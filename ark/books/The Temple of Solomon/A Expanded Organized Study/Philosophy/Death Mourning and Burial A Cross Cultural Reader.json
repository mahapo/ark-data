G. M. RobbenAnthropologists, and in particular those from West-ern societies, stand in a peculiar relation to death.They have often had a brief personal brush withdeath at home – an aunt, a grandparent or a favoritecousin – but only become engrossed in the culturalcomplexities of death, mourning, and burial once inthe field. This situation contains several dangers. Theethnographic experience overshadows their generalunderstanding of death, misleads them into believingthat their own culture has a much poorer deathculture than that of their hosts, and may result in adistortive opposition between the ordinary, shallow,secular death culture of Western society and theintricate, profound, sacred death rituals elsewhere.My understanding of death has been colored bythe study of violent death and impaired mourning inArgentina during the 1970s and 1980s. Thousands ofpeople were killed in those times of political tur-moil,revolutionaryfervorandauthoritarianrule. Some died in armed combat or were executedby hit squads, but most were assassinated while heldcaptive by the Argentine armed forces. The militarydid not give away death carelessly. Some interro-gators offered their captives the choice between aquick death with a bullet if they cooperated and aslow death under torture if they refused to talk.Captives regarded death therefore as a liberationfrom suffering instead of an end to life. Some per-ceived death even as a victory wrested from theabsolute control of their captors. An unintentionaldeath during excessive torture undermined theomnipotence of the interrogators and a suicide wasseen as an act of empowerment. Under such extremecircumstances, it was not the mode of death (violentvs. natural, good vs. bad, planned vs. accidental) andthe treatment of the body (clandestine cremation,secret burial, dumping at sea) but the mode of dying(shooting, strangling, drowning, electrocuting,poisoning) and the absence of a ceremonial treat-ment of the body that were of foremost concern torelatives, comrades, and friends.My ethnographic experience may seem unusualwithin the anthropology of death, were it not thatthere was a strong interest in uncommon forms ofdeath during the early days of anthropology. Afterall, James Frazer (1976) opened his monumentalTheGolden Boughwith the ritual murder of the priestlyking who resided at the sanctuary of the goddessDiana in Italy. This foundational interest in the an-thropological study of death was matched by a simi-lar interest in sociology by Emile Durkheim, andcarried forward by the next generation of anthro-Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:22ampage 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"pologists, in particular Mauss, Hertz, Van Gennep,and Malinowski.The anthropology of death led a ratherdormant existence after this promising start, andhas only revived since the 1970s with the publicationof sophisticated ethnographies rather than the ambi-tious comparative efforts that characterized earlieranthropological scholarship. The result has been thatthere is only a small number of cross-cultural ap-proaches but many excellent ethnographies, articles,and collections of essays.1The most prominent com-parative efforts are Rosenblatt, Walsh, and Jackson(1976) on grief and mourning, Huntington andMetcalf (1979) on mortuary rituals, Bloch andParry (1982a) on regeneration, Palgi and Abramo-vitch (1984) on theoretical approaches and thematicissues, Counts and Counts (1991a) on grief, Hallamand Hockey (2001) on material culture and remem-brance, and Barley (1997) with a sweeping popular-izing study about death culture.2This volume aims to provide the readership with agood sense of the foundational texts in the anthro-pology of death, to delineate enduring researchinterests, and demonstrate the intellectual depthand breadth of the field in recent decades. Theorganizing principle is the trajectory from dying toafterlife, while paying close attention to the socialand cultural consequences of death. The trajectory isorganized into six parts which each comprise onemain subfield of the anthropology of death: (I)Con-ceptualizations of Death; (II)Death and Dying; (III)Uncommon Death; (IV)Grief and Mourning; (V)Mortu-ary Rituals; and (VI)Remembrance and Regeneration.Conceptualizations of DeathThe inevitability of biological death challenged earlygenerations of anthropologists to look for universalfeatures in the diverse cultural responses to death,whereas later generations became absorbed in thepractices themselves through meticulous ethnog-raphies and sophisticated interpretations. The com-parative dimension of recent anthropological studiesis therefore implicit but seldom spelled out. Con-ceptualizing death is so daunting in the face of thetremendous variation of mortuary practices that an-thropology has tended to generalize about deathmore in interdisciplinary dialogues than in internaldebates. A central theme of interdisciplinary inquiryhas been the tension between the inevitability ofdeath and the belief in spiritual immortality. Theselection of texts in part I demonstrate how variousdisciplines, but especially psychology and psycho-analysis, have inspired anthropological thinkingabout death and immortality.In the excerpt from his 1925 essayMagic, Science,and Religion, Bronislaw Malinowski challenges theidea by the psychologist Wilhelm Wundt that peopleare dominated by a fear of death. Malinowski indi-cates that this universal fear is complemented by anequally universal denial of death through a belief inimmortality. These two attitudes translate into anambivalent attachment of the living and the dead.Surviving relatives want to break and at the sametime prolong their association with the deceased.Close relatives accompany the loved one during thedying process, care for the corpse, assume the socialstatus of mourners, and display their grief in public.Mortuary rituals separate the living from the dead.The corpse is removed from the place of death, andundergoes some sort of transformation throughburial, mummification, cremation or consumption,thus betraying the ambivalent relation between theliving and the dead. The mourners are concernedabout the dangers of the corpse and the contamin-ation by death, but there reigns also a sublime senseof spirituality, hope, the sacred, and the other-worldly. Malinowski considers such religious imagin-ation as a functional response to death becausepeople loathe the idea of a final ending. They clingto a belief in a spiritual life after death by imaginingthe salvation of an eternal spirit from the visiblydecaying corpse. Thus, religion gives people a com-forting sense of immortality, while the mortuarypractices restore the group that has been disturbedtemporarily by the death of one of its members.Half a century after Malinowski, the psychologicalanthropologist Ernest Becker continues to grapplewith people’s universal fear of death in the chapterThe Terror of Deathtaken from his bookThe Denial ofDeath(1973). Inspired by psychoanalysis, Beckertries to show that the fear of death is one of themost important inner drives of human beings. Hedelineates two principal scientific viewpoints aboutRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:22ampage 2Death and Anthropology: An Introduction2"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"the fear of death. Thehealthy-minded argumentstatesthat this fear is a social construction. Children raisedin a sheltered environment by loving mothers willdevelop basic notions of trust and security. Theycannot imagine separation or loss during infancy,and when older will accept death as a fact of life.Instead, themorbidly minded argumentstates that thefear of death is natural and universal. It is driven bypeople’s instinct of self-preservation and their at-tempt to control life-threatening situations. Thisfear would be paralyzing if permanently consciousand is therefore repressed during early childhoodthrough a complex internalization of contradictoryfeelings of love and rage towards their caretakers.Still, repression does not dissipate the fear of deathbut lodges it firmly in the unconscious. Becker con-cludes therefore that both arguments hold part of thetruth. The first proves the strength of repressing auniversal fear of death that is explained by thesecond.Very much like Becker, the psychiatrist Robert JayLifton and Eric Olson postulate the universal fear ofdeath in the chapterSymbolic Immortalityfrom theirbookLiving and Dying(1974), and like Malinowski,they consider the belief in immortality as its univer-sal response. Lifton and Olson reconcile Freud’semphasis on the finality of biological death and thehuman need to believe otherwise with Jung’s atten-tion to people’s search for meaning and immortalitythrough religious symbolization. They find this sym-bolic immortality in five modes of expression.Bio-logical immortalityconsists of extending life throughone’s offspring, family name, tribe or nation. Art,literature, and knowledge lead tocreative immortality.Theological immortalityrefers to beliefs in resurrec-tion, reincarnation, rebirth and a spiritual life afterdeath.Natural immortalitymakes people part of aneternal universe and the interminable cycles ofnature. Finally,experiential immortalityconcernsaltered states of consciousness such as ecstasy, en-lightenment, drug-induced highs, and collective ef-fervescence. The fear of death impels people toprocure these five modes of symbolic immortalityto overcome their innate death anxiety, and livemeaningful lives in the promise of a continuity withothers.Societyreapsthegoodworksofthese personal quests but may also suffer its conse-quences when leaders pursue self-aggrandizing andmegalomaniac projects through war, political repres-sion, and economic exploitation. In the vein ofBecker, Lifton and Olson, the sociologist ZygmuntBauman has argued that people try to transcend thefear of death through culture and social organization.Culture is a defiant denial of death in the desire formeaning and immortality: ‘‘Without mortality, nohistory, no culture – no humanity’’ (Bauman 1992:7).Unlike the previous authors, the historian Phil-ippe Arie`s does not attempt to isolate any universalsabout death but focuses on the transitions in WesternEuropean death models. Arie`s approaches this pro-cessual study of death in the excerpt from his bookThe Hour of Our Death(1987) through four psycho-logical themes: (1) people’s sense of the individual;(2) the defense of society against the unpredictableforces of nature; (3) the belief in life after death; and(4) the belief in the existence of evil. The particularmanifestations and historical combinations of thesefour themes have led to five death models during thelast millennium of European history.Thetame death modelwas dominant in the eleventhcentury and disappeared by the seventeenth century.Death was not a personal but a social affair in whichfamily and community were present at the deathbed,wake, and funeral. Catholic mortuary rituals servedto harness this unpredictable natural phenomenonthrough highly ordered procedures and provide thedeceased with a peaceful repose till Judgment Day. Inaddition, these rituals repaired broken ties, andreaffirmed the continuity and solidarity of the com-munity. Thus, death was ritualized and tamed. Thedeath of the self modelarose in the eleventh centuryamong the elite and had replaced the tame deathmodel entirely by the seventeenth century. This shiftwas due to changes in the first and third psycho-logical themes, while the second and fourthremained the same. People began to regard them-selves as individuals rather than members of a col-lectivity, developed notions about the separation ofbody and soul, emphasized the active role played bythe immortal soul in the afterlife, and became in-creasingly afraid of the decaying corpse. By the latesixteenth century, people’s notion about society’sdefense against nature began to change, and by theRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:22ampage 3Antonius C. G. M. Robben3"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"eighteenth century, nature was widely regarded aspartaking both in life and death. This belief mani-fested itself in people’s fear of being buried alive.Death was neither tame nor hidden, but savage andmysterious. This is the period during which the fearof death – regarded by Malinowski, Becker, Liftonand Olson as universal – arose according to Arie`s.Arie`s calls this theremote and imminent death modelbecause death was distant yet could strike at any time.All four psychological themes, and in particularpeople’s awareness of themselves in relation toothers, became affected between the eighteenthand twentieth century and gave rise to thedeath ofthe other model. People did not so much fear their owndeath but that of their relatives and the suffering of afinal separation from loved ones. Death becamesublime and even beautiful because it was no longerassociated with guilt, hell, and evil but people couldlook forward to a reunion with family membersalready in heaven. Theinvisible death modelbecamedominant in the twentieth century, however, withoutcausing any substantial changes in the four themes.Death’s medicalization distanced the communityfrom the dying and the deceased. Individualismruled, nature was conquered, social solidaritywaned, and not the afterworld but family tiesmattered. Western society surrounded death withso much shame, discomfort, and repulsion thatGorer (1965) even spoke of a pornography ofdeath. Death became concealed in hospitals, nursinghomes, and trailer parks. Yet, the fear of deathremained, a fear corresponding more to people’ssocial than biological death, as can be sensed eachtime the newspapers report about some lonely soullying dead for months in a squalid rundown apart-ment.In the early 1970s, Johannes Fabian (1973) took areflexive look at the anthropological study of deathin his essay ‘‘How Others Die: Reflections on theAnthropology of Death.’’ He argued that the discip-line contributed little to general debates about deathbecause of a tendency towards parochialization, folk-lorization and exoticization. An obsessive concernfor cultural variation, the folkloric isolation of deathas a self-contained experience, and a fascination withexotic mortuary practices inhibited the formulationof statements that transcended local peculiarities.Thus, anthropologists placed themselves outsidemajor theoretical debates and maneuvered their dis-cipline into a subsidiary role to other social scien-cees, providing them with raw data about the alien‘‘other’’ for the development of their theoretical andanalytical models. Fabian wanted anthropology tofocus on the social construction of death, and sug-gested three possible directions: (1) a processual,constitutive, practice-oriented view of cultural con-ceptions of death; (2) a dialectical model of thesociocultural reality of death paying attention to theconstruction of individual and social realities of deathas intertwined yet separate processes; and (3) acommunicative, intersubjective, language-centeredapproach to death and dying. These three approachescan be identified in the ethnographies and articlesproduced since the 1970s but the comparativeagenda has remained largely empty. Be that as itmay, the ethnographic harvest and interpretivefinesse of the anthropology of death has been sorich that the field is thriving and is in a position toparticipate fully in interdisciplinary discussions anddebates.Death and DyingThere exists a great variation in cultural beliefs aboutdeath and dying. The idea of death as an irreversibleevent is strong in Western culture but many cultureshave processual, cyclical or stage-like notions ofdeath. Furthermore, cultures differ in the substan-tive ways to give meaning to such notions. Theselections in part II focus on death as a predestinedevent, a developmental process, a natural cycle, anda clinical condition, but anthropologists have alsowritten about death as a process of suffering (Mimica1996) and as a cycle of reincarnation (Desjarlais2000, 2003; Parry, chapter 21).The people of Brittany, France, have a fatalisticworldview. Ellen Badone reveals in her article‘‘Death Omens in a Breton Memorate’’ (1987) howthe Bretons believe that death is foretold by omens(intersignes) such as bird calls, neighing horses,howling dogs, dreams, and visions.3Badone analyzesthe omens of the fatal cycling accident of a youngman hit by a drunken driver, interpreted four yearsafter his death by his mother. The mother weaves aRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:22ampage 4Death and Anthropology: An Introduction4"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"narrative of portents to the tragic death that helpsher cope with her grief, attests to the existence ofomens, and confirms the belief in a supernaturalforce which predestines people’s lives. Omens canseldom be observed when old people are dying, but,so argues Badone, occur generally with unexpecteddeaths that require a framework of meaning andemotional comfort.The Cheyenne consider death as a long processduring which a person’s development is reversed,according to Anne Straus in her article ‘‘The Meaningof Death in Northern Cheyenne Culture’’ (1978).The body disintegrates but the spirit-self and tribalidentity survive and participate in Cheyenne society.The Creator (Ma?heo?o) provides animals and humanbeings alike with a life force, but endows people withthe gifts of spirit (mahta?sooma) and breath/power(omotone). A child develops into a human being asthe spirit achieves a balance between two ‘‘good’’human parts and two ‘‘crazy’’ animal parts. Death isa process that begins when the spirit and later thebreath/power leave the body. The body ceases tofunction, and spirit and breath/power unite intoone spirit-self. Sometimes, a spirit returns to theinert body after having visited the land of thedeparted, and the Northern Cheyenne will thereforeonly bury their dead after four days. The life forceremains in the corpse and will slowly sediment in thebones as the flesh disintegrates. The mourners weepfor four days and come to accept the inevitable pro-cesses of life and death. The spirit-self will then re-unite with the spirit-selves of all deceased Cheyennes,however, without taking leave from the community ofthe living because spirit-selves are animate, self-con-scious entities with identities, names and kinshipterms. These spirit-selves continue to partake in theCheyenne community by giving advice to the livingthrough their dreams.Whereas the Cheyenne differentiate betweenanimal and human death, the cattle-herders fromAsturias in northern Spain interpret death as partof a natural lifecycle, as becomes clear from theexcerpts of Marı ́aCa ́tedra’s ethnographyThis World,Other Worlds: Sickness, Suicide, Death, and the Afterlifeamong the Vaqueiros de Alzada of Spain(1992). Just ascattle can die prematurely through sickness or acci-dent, so too can people. The natural cycle of life anddeath unfolds most clearly within the social cycle ofthe house. The ageing head of the household (amo)must decide on the most suitable heir to preserve thehouse and ensure his own immortality as one in anunbroken chain of keepers. The house bears heavilyon the lives of the villagers, andamoshave evencommitted suicide over its loss. One concrete prob-lem is that the most industrious son and daughter-in-law may not be the best persons to nurse theamoashis health deteriorates. Generally, the balance weighsdown on the side of the house. Theamoretreats frompublic life into the house, and dies socially. Lifebegins to lose itsgracia, itsjoie de vivre, its charmand pleasure, a condition bound to end in sicknessand death.Although an inevitable fact of nature, the Asturiancattle-herders are apprehensive about their mortalityand try to master it through a taxonomy of modes ofdeath. They differentiate among a good death, a baddeath, and a tragic death in terms of the precedingcircumstances and the emotional and social conse-quences for the relatives. Thegood deathis fast,without suffering, and is accepted most readily bythe relatives. Thebad deathinvolves a long, painfuldying process exacting a heavy toll on both thesufferer and the family members. Finally, thetragicdeathtakes place suddenly and strikes healthy humanbeings, often in the midst of their lives. These deathsare hard on the surviving relatives. Suicide is a tragicdeath that stands at the extreme opposite of naturaldeath because it involves a violation of culturalnorms and the agency of the deceased in his owndemise.The advance of Western technology in the area oforgan transplants has placed a tremendous moralpressure on people to accept the idea that death isan event whose occurrence can be established withprecision. Margaret Lock compares in her essay‘‘Displacing Suffering: The Reconstruction ofDeath in North America and Japan’’ (1997) Ameri-can and Japanese definitions of death, and revealshow distinct notions of personhood, the place of themedical profession in society, and cultural beliefsabout identity can account for their differences.4North American physicians and the general publicalike have always considered people to be dead whenthe heart stopped beating. The first successful heartRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:22ampage 5Antonius C. G. M. Robben5"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"transplant in 1967 required a medical definition ofdeath to protect the legal rights of donors and phys-icians. The US 1981 Uniform Determination ofDeath Act established that someone was considereddead when an irreversible coma had set in and theperson was effectively brain dead. Death as thefinal stage in a process of dying with elaborate socialand cultural significance had become medicalizedand turned into a biological event objectively mea-surable in terms of time and neurological activity.Culture retreated from the brain-dead organismand became confined to mortuary rituals and griefwork.The almost uniform acceptance by North Ameri-can society of the brain death definition contrastssharply with the situation in Japan. Brain deathbecame first defined in 1974 but received nation-wide criticism. The Japanese government institutedin 1989 a special committee to present an authorita-tive opinion. Even though a committee majorityacceded that brain death was a human death andthat the taking of organs was acceptable, a minoritycalled for a national debate on the social and culturaldimensions of death. Many Japanese regarded braindeath as unnatural. Margaret Lock argues that thispublic criticism should be understood within a muchlarger context of Japanese concerns about modern-ization, industrialization, and Westernization at thecost of Japanese values, traditions, and notions ofdeath and self. Death is not seen as an event but as aprocess in which the soul must be ritually separatedfrom the body. Furthermore, the body’s integrity isimportant to prevent the spirit from suffering andallow the surviving relatives to show proper respectto the deceased (see also Suzuki, chapter 19). Thus,popular Japanese notions about processual deathresisted clinical notions, and opened a public debateabout the cultural construction of life and death nottaking place in the USA.Uncommon DeathMost anthropological studies on death are concernedwith natural death, but a growing number of studieshave retaken Durkheim’s (1966) interest in suicideand Frazer’s (1976) fascination with murder, sacri-fice, and sorcery.5Marcel Mauss (1979:37–56)expanded Durkheim’s sociological explanation ofsuicide by adding that not only suicide but alsodeath by suggestion was the result of collectivebeliefs.6Uncommon deaths must be studied to-gether with natural deaths, as Marı ́aCa ́tedra (chapter8) has pointed out, because they are all influenced bythe social context. Part III presents three selectionsabout such forms of uncommon death, namelythrough witchcraft, live burial, and disappearance.Evans-Pritchard’s studyWitchcraft, Oracles andMagic among the Azande(1968) provides a classicanalysis of the cultural scenarios set in motion todeal with the disruptive consequences of witchcraft.He notices that the Azande of southern Sudan distin-guished between natural and magical causes of death.Snake bites, a collapsing granary or the wound of aspear were recognized as natural causes of death.However, these natural causes did not stand on theirown but were related to secondary causes, usuallywitchcraft. Witchcraft made the victim cross thesnake’s path, so both the witch and the snake killedthe person. What happened when a person’s deathwas attributed to witchcraft? First, the bereavedrelatives consulted a poison oracle (benge) to establishthe cause of death. A nobleman administered poisonto a chicken, asked the oracle whether a particularperson was a witch, and waited for the poison to takeeffect. If the chicken died, then poison was given to asecond chicken to validate the first outcome. If thesecond chicken was spared, then the oracle hadconfirmed the suspicion of witchcraft and the surviv-ing family would take revenge by magically killingthe guilty witch or by demanding material compen-sation.Ever since James Frazer wrote about the murderof the priestly king on the shores of lake Nemi,anthropologists have been fascinated by such uncom-mon deaths. Evans-Pritchard has reinterpreted Fra-zer’s analysis of regicide among the Shilluk ofsouthern Sudan (Evans-Pritchard 1969:66–86). Hedoubts whether Shilluk kings had ever been strangledto death when sick or senile, and rejects the view thatenfeebled kings were murdered to avert a majordisaster and prevent the suffering of the Shillukpeople. Instead, he interprets the alleged regicideas a political legitimization of rebellion. Such rebel-lions were always made by a prince and thus helpedRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:22ampage 6Death and Anthropology: An Introduction6"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"to reunite the divided nation and strengthen thekingship. Whatever the truth about Shilluk regicide,Evans-Pritchard’s student, Godfrey Lienhardt, pur-sued the study of similar uncommon deaths in thesouthern Sudan. The chapter from his ethnographyDivinity and Experience: The Religion of the Dinka(1961) reads almost like a trial record in whichincredulity rules. Lienhardt confesses that he didnot witness any live burials, and feels thereforeobliged to add account upon account to prove hisargument.Lienhardt describes the burial alive of fishing-spear masters among the Dinka, neighbors of theShilluk. The burial (dhor) took place on the ageingmaster’s request who asked his clansmen to dig alarge grave near his home. Next, a bull was sacri-ficed. A platform of branches was raised in the pit onwhich the master would be lifted and to which a liveram was tied. The master began singing, and theclansmen joined in his joyful mood. Another plat-form was raised above the master’s head, and thegrave was closed with cattle dung. Finally, a bull anda calf were sacrificed on top of the heap, and theritual ended with a feast in honor of the fishing-spearmaster. The crux of the burial was that the masterdid not die an involuntary but a deliberate deathstaged by the people to increase the clan’s vitality,regeneration, and good fortune. The master wasbelieved to carry the life of his people and thereforeneeded to be buried alive, because a natural deathwould expire the life force with him and would thusthreaten the survival of his people. Lienhardt con-cludes that not the Western notion of personal im-mortality but the Dinka notion of collectiveimmortality was at stake in these uncommon burials.Whereas the Dinka celebrated the voluntaryburial alive of the fishing-spear masters, the Argen-tine people have agonized over the involuntary burialalive of thousands of disappeared citizens during thelast military dictatorship. My contribution (Robben2000) to this reader, ‘‘State Terror in the Nether-world: Disappearance and Reburial in Argentina,’’describes how the Argentine military regime usedthe disappearance of political opponents as a terrortactics to intimidate their comrades-in-arms, para-lyze family protest, and exploit the cultural belief inthe relation of body and spirit. The Argentine mili-tary abducted tens of thousands of civilians, keptthem in captivity for months on end, and finallyassassinated most of them. Their remains were cre-mated or buried in mass graves. One of the mostgruesome assassinations was carried out by the Navywhich sedated its captives and dropped them fromairplanes flying across the south Atlantic ocean. Aftermisleading the Argentine people for several yearsabout the real fate of the disappeared, the Argentinemilitary discovered to their dismay the political andespecially emotional force of people’s need to buryand mourn their dead. Incessant human rights pro-tests helped to topple the regime, and allowed forthe exhumation, identification, and reburial of hun-dreds of disappeared Argentines. The reburialsmanifested the Argentine belief in a political lifeafter death, a life which the military wanted toextinguish and the relatives were determined toresurrect. The uncommon and violent death of thedisappeared contributed, therefore, directly to thesurvival of their spirit and their continuing influenceon Argentine politics.Grief and MourningGrief may be a universal emotion of bereavement, aspsychologists such as Bowlby (1981) have noted, butits social expression in mourning is culturally spe-cific. Loss is therefore the central concept in theselections gathered in part IV, and grief andmourning should be understood in relation toother losses that provoke personal and collectivecrises, as has been argued by Freud (1968).Mourning becomes then a social and cultural wayto cope with any significant loss for which death isthe ultimate metaphor.Emile Durkheim has had a lasting influence on theanthropology of death by emphasizing that the indi-vidual grief experienced at the death of anotherhuman being is expressed collectively in culturallyprescribed ways of mourning. Crying relates in thesame way to grief as weeping and wailing relate tomourning. Mourning is not a spontaneous emotionbut a collective obligation manifested in appease-ment rites. In his classic workThe Elementary Formsof Religious Life, Emile Durkheim (1995) draws uponethnographic accounts of Australian aborigines toRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:22ampage 7Antonius C. G. M. Robben7"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"argue that the spontaneity of their wailing is decep-tive, because all these expressions are clearly pre-scribed,controlled,andmonitoredbythecommunity. Durkheim’s explanation of such rites isthat the death of an individual diminishes the groupnumerically and socially. Durkheim was fascinatedby questions of social order and disintegration. ThisHobbesian puzzle becomes particularly pressing inthe case of death. Indifference to a death expresses alack of moral and cultural unity, and an absence ofsocial cohesion and solidarity. Instead, collectivemourning helps to draw people closer together andinvigorate the weakened social group. This socialfunction of mourning rites is not limited to thedeath of individuals. Mourning is a general expres-sion of loss for a social collectivity under threat, as isdemonstrated by aboriginal rites for illness, famine,drought, and the desecration of religious symbols.Radcliffe-Brown (1964) demonstrates in the ex-cerpt from his ethnographyThe Andaman Islandershow weeping and embracing are collective perform-ances rather than spontaneous personal expressionsof sorrow or happiness. The Andamanese can cry ondemand when required by society. Radcliffe-Browneven suggests that these cultural practices producethe emotions which they are obliged to express, andaffirm the social attachments that hold society to-gether. He delineates seven occasions of ceremonialweeping related to initiations, marriages, deaths,friendships, and peace-making. These rites are sub-divided into two varieties: reciprocal or symmetricalrites (meeting of friends or relatives, peace-makingceremonies, communal mourning) and one-sided orasymmetrical rites (wailing over a corpse, weepingover initiated novices and newly-weds). The practiceof embracing at reciprocal rites expresses the emo-tional attachment of two persons, while weepingprovides relief from built-up tensions. This dualfunction becomes clear at the end of a mourningperiod when secluded mourners renew their socialties with the community. Weeping is a general re-sponse to loss, as shown not only in mortuary ritualsbut also in weddings and initiation ceremonies.Asymmetrical rites signify affective and collectiveattachments, and are expressed by embracing andweeping over the inert body, the novice or thenewly-wed. In the case of death, weeping and em-bracing manifest the social attachment of the livingand the dead, enhance the social solidarity of thesurvivors, and mend the weakened social collectiv-ity.The separation of parents and children upon mar-riage is experienced as such a great loss in severalcultures that an analogy is drawn with death. Thesadness of a mother bidding farewell to her departingdaughter turns the wedding metaphorically into afuneral. In the excerpts from his bookThe DeathRituals of Rural Greece(1982), Loring Danforth inter-prets this metaphoric relation through an analysis ofGreek wedding songs and funeral laments.7There isstrong social pressure on the bereaved to channelsorrow into culturally meaningful laments. Danforthdemonstrates that there are remarkable similaritiesin content, structure, melody, and lyrics betweenwedding songs and death songs. The variation existsin the context, style, and tempo in which the songsare sung. The metaphoric relation between death andmarriage appears also in similar symbolic relationsbetween death and labor migration, the lifecycle ofplants, the migration of birds, the flowing of water,and the shedding of tears. These connections amongdeath, marriage and all other metaphors deny thefinality of death, relativize separation, and mediatethe too stark and too painful opposition of life anddeath. Grief is channeled into culturally significantlaments led by distant relatives or talented outsiders.The exhumation of the dead, several years after thefuneral, symbolizes the negation of death by a returnof the ossified remains to their homes and families.Once again, the laments sung at the exhumationclosely resemble wedding songs, and the dry bonesare greeted, kissed, and honored as if they werenewly-weds.Renato Rosaldo reveals in the essay ‘‘Grief and aHeadhunter’s Rage’’ (1993) how the accidental deathof his wife Michelle deepened his understanding ofbereavement among the Ilongot of the Philippines.Bereaved Ilongot men used to engage in headhuntingto dispel the rage embedded in their grief by severingand casting away the head of an unsuspecting victim.For the Ilongot, ‘‘grief, rage, and headhunting gotogether in a self-evident manner’’ (1984:178).8Hiswife’s unfortunate fall to death while conductingfieldwork, provoked an unsuspected anger and rageRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:22ampage 8Death and Anthropology: An Introduction8"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"in Rosaldo resembling that of bereaved Ilongot men.This personal reaction made him eventually shift hisanalysis from headhunting as a ritual manifestation ofbereavement to headhunting as an expression ofgrief, rage, and emotional loss. A reinterpretationof the ethnographic record showed that headhuntingwas a common Ilongot response to a severe loss. Notonly the death of a close relative, but also dramaticlife transitions made young Ilongot men boil overwith anger and eager to take a head.Nancy Scheper-Hughes has taken the culturalconstruction of bereavement one step further byarguing that not only mourning but grief itself is aproduct of culture.9In the excerpts from her eth-nographyDeath Without Weeping: The Violence of Every-day Life in Brazil(1992), she points out that mothersin a northeast Brazilian shanty town are aware of thestructural causes of high infant mortality (poverty,malnutrition, poor health care) as well as the imme-diate causes (diarrhea, communicable diseases). Still,they endow babies with a life force, a will to live,whose strength will ultimately determine whether ornot an infant survives. This belief makes motherswithhold food from weak, passive babies and givemore food to strong, active babies. These Brazilianmothers accept the death of their weak infants stoic-ally. Crying is even considered detrimental to thebabies because the heavy tears on the thin angelwings burden their flight to heaven. Scheper-Hughesemphasizes that the maternal aloofness does notcover a deep sorrow, and the absence of a display ofgrief is not the repression of an inconsolable loss.The mother feels pity rather than grief for thebaby.10Mortuary RitualsMortuary rituals are a true cultural universal thatshow people’s resistance to accepting biologicaldeath as a self-contained event, and their desire toprolong the departure from the dead through aprocess of phased transitions. The largest numberof studies in the anthropology of death is on mortu-ary rituals, and many anthropologists still follow thestructuralist paths cleared by Hertz and Van Gennep.Part V contains excerpts from their two most influ-ential texts, an application of their approach toJapanese funerals, and an article about Amazonianendocannibalism demonstrating the intertwinementof mortuary ritual and grief.A Contribution to the Study of the Collective Represen-tation of Deathby Robert Hertz (1960) endures as thesingle most influential text in the anthropology ofdeath.11Hertz argues forcefully that the death of ahuman being is not exclusively a biological reality orconfined to the individual sorrow of the bereavedrelatives, but that death evokes moral and socialobligations expressed in culturally determined fu-neral practices. Although Hertz restricts his analysislargely to the mortuary practices of South Asiantribal societies, he reveals a structure of greatcross-cultural significance. In the excerpts includedin this reader, Hertz isolates the key elements in thesecondary burials among the Dayak of Kalimantan,Indonesia. He points out that the inert body, thedeceased’s soul, and the surviving relatives playchanging roles during the time between death andsecondary burial, a time which he subdivides intotwo periods. First, there is the intermediary periodduring which (1) the inert body is temporarily storedor buried, (2) the spirit or soul of the deceasedremains near the corpse, and (3) the bereaved rela-tives are separated from society and enter intomourning. Clearly, death does not occur at onemoment in time but is a drawn-out process. Thedead person is still considered part of society, and hisor her continued residence among the living obligesthem to provide food, engage in conversation, andshow respect as if he or she were still alive. In acomparable way, the deceased’s spirit or soul doesnot depart for the land of the dead but wanders inthe vicinity of the corpse and frequents the placeswhere the deceased used to dwell. The bereavedrelatives fear the soul’s wrath for past wrongdoing,and are prone to appease the soul through sacrifices,taboos, and mourning. These circumstances makethe mourners stand apart from society. They cannotparticipate in its daily routines, and wear distinctiveclothing and ornaments.The second and final period begins when the bodyhas disintegrated sufficiently, the soul has detachedfrom the deceased, and the mourners have properlyexpressed their grief and carried out their socialobligations. Hertz (1960:54) sums up this secondRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:22ampage 9Antonius C. G. M. Robben9"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"period as follows: ‘‘The final ceremony has threeobjects: to give burial to the remains of the deceased,to ensure the soul peace and access to the land ofthe dead, and finally to free the living from theobligations of mourning.’’ In contrast to the tempor-ary burial of the first period, the final burial is acollective affair through which the deceased joins theancestors and the community bids him or her fare-well. The surviving relatives can now end theirmourning. They cleanse themselves ritually fromthe impurities of their extended proximity todeath, change into new clothing, and reunite withthe community.Arnold van Gennep made an extremely importantcontribution to the anthropology of death by inter-preting mortuary rituals as one among similar ritesof passage: ‘‘The life of an individual in any society isa series of passages from one age to another and fromone occupation to another’’ (1960:2–3). These tran-sitions, such as birth, puberty, marriage, and death,are life crises and become therefore the subject ofelaborate elevation rituals as a person rises from onestatus to the next. These rituals take place in whatDurkheim (1995) has called sacred time, and Turner(1967) liminal time. The chapter from Van Gennep’sbookthe Rites of Passage(1960) included here dis-cusses funerals.Mortuary transition or elevation rituals have threedistinct phases. First, there is a relatively short pre-liminary phase characterized by a rite of separationthat isolates the corpse and the mourners fromsociety, and makes them wear special clothing andobserve certain taboos. The rite of transition takesplace during the second or liminal phase marking thepassage from the land of the living to the afterworld.This phase has the most elaborate rituals because thejourney is considered long and the deceased has to beequipped with food, clothing, weapons, protectiveamulets, means of transportation, and a guide to leadthe way. Finally, there is the postliminal rite ofincorporation to mark both the passage of the soulto the world of the dead and the return of themourners to the bosom of society. The remains areburied in a cemetery, placed in a tree, cremated, orseparated in any other way from their temporarystay. The bereaved relatives join for a meal, singsongs and celebrate the final passage of the deceased.The mourning has come to an end, the social order isrestored, and the flow of everyday life is picked upagain.Hikaru Suzuki refines the ideas of Hertz and VanGennep by demonstrating that the form and contentof modern Japanese mortuary rituals are the out-come of considerable negotiation between funeralprofessionals and bereaved relatives. In the excerptfrom her ethnographyThe Price of Death: The FuneralIndustry in Contemporary Japan(2000), she analyzes thepreparations for the rite of separation, and demon-strates how professionals are in charge of the corpse,and direct the mourners towards certain ceremoniesand expenses to conform with their social status. Therite of separation begins when bereaved relatives calla funeral company to take care of the deceased in theceremonial trajectory from the place of death, byway of the home and the funeral auditorium, to thecemetery. A person is not considered dead in Japan-ese culture until the remains are cremated, so thedeceased is welcomed home by the relatives beforeproceeding to the funeral auditorium. In the past,the closest family members would bathe the corpseto protect the deceased and the relatives from deathpollution. This bathing ceremony fell into disuse butwas reintroduced during the 1990s by a professionalbathing service. The bathing ceremony ends with theclosing of the coffin. After a wake by relatives andguests, a nightly vigil by a few close relatives, and afuneral ceremony the following morning, the rite ofseparation has concluded and the rite of transitioncan begin around the cremation of the deceased.The structural approaches developed by Hertzand Van Gennep continue to be important for theanthropology of death because they offer analyticalframeworks that can be applied to every mortuaryritual. Hikaru Suzuki has given this approach a newimpulse by demonstrating that rites of passage arenot static scripts but dynamic practices. Beth Con-klin (1995) provides yet another way of looking atmortuary practices in her article ‘‘‘Thus are ourbodies, thus was our custom’: Mortuary Cannibal-ism in an Amazonian Society.’’ Although she does notanalyze mortuary cannibalism as a rite of passage butfocuses on grief, mourning, and attachment, I have,nevertheless, placed her contribution in this partbecause her approach gives new meaning to theRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:22ampage 10Death and Anthropology: An Introduction10"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"work of Hertz and Van Gennep. She shows thecomplex entwinement and difficult separation ofcorpse, spirit, and the bereaved, and demonstratesthat mortuary practices do not stand by themselvesbut encompass emotions, subjectivities, and lifeprocesses.12The Brazilian public was shocked to learn in theearly 1960s that the Wari’ indians of western Ama-zonia ate their dead. The integrity of the body, thesacredness of the corpse, and the burial of theremains are so deep-seated in Western culture thatsuch endocannibalism could only provoke horror.However, from the perspective of the Wari’, notthe eating of the dead but the Western custom ofabandoning them to rot away in cold, uncaring soilwas callous and heartless. Two notions of Wari’cosmology are fundamental to understand their mor-tuary cannibalism: (1) the body’s blood and flesh arethe seat of subjectivity, social identity and socialrelationships; and (2) there is a reciprocal relationbetween humans and animals. Social ties continue toembody the corpse upon biological death, while thedeceased’s spirit materializes into a white-lippedpeccary. Rather than merciless, mortuary cannibal-ism was an expression of compassion for the be-reaved relatives, helped severing the ties of livingand dead, and contributed to the community’s sub-sistence by effectuating the transformation of humaninto animal.The death of a person resulted in the division ofthe bereaved relatives into two groups of mourners:close blood relatives and the spouse on the one hand,and in-laws on the other. The blood relativesgathered closely around the dead body, while callingout the deceased’s kinship terms. The affines occu-pied themselves with organizing the funeral by pre-paring food and drinks, and eventually by consumingthe corpse. The physical separation of the bloodrelatives from the corpse and its subsequent dismem-berment were the most emotional moments of thefuneral because the cutting implied the severing ofthe embodied social ties, resembled the butcheringof game, and marked the spirit’s departure. Not theblood relatives, but the affines consumed the roastedflesh and organs. This rite of transition dissipatedgrief by the consumption of the sociophysical bodyand its embodied identity and social ties, helped themourning process, resuscitated the Wari’ spiritunder water, and foreshadowed its incarnation intoa peccary. This transformation from human intoanimal showed that the deceased cared for the sur-viving relatives by providing them with gamefor their subsistence. Ritual and loss ended asshamans talked to the spirits embodied in peccarieskilled in the hunt, and thus gave comfort to thegrieving relatives by communicating the deceased’swell-being.Remembrance and RegenerationIn many cultures, life does not end with biologicaldeath because of a belief in an eternal spirit, asurviving soul, a cycle of life and death, or notionsof reincarnation and regeneration. Jonathan Parry(1982) analyzes in his essay ‘‘Sacrificial Death andthe Necrophagous Ascetic’’ two opposite yet com-plementary approaches to life and death in Hinduismthrough a study of heads of household and Aghoriascetics in the holy city of Benares, India. Life anddeath constitute a zero-sum game in Hinduism be-cause life can only be created by causing death, whiledeath regenerates life. This interminable cycle iscomplemented by a fundamental homology betweenthe human body and the cosmos, meaning that bothare composed of the same five elements and ruled bythe same laws. Sacrifice and rebirth of body, time,and cosmos are thus inextricably linked. Just as thecosmos will be devoured by fire and flood to enableits rebirth, so the deceased are cremated on thefuneral pyre and their ashes scattered in the Gangesriver to allow their rebirth. A ‘‘good’’ death is there-fore a sacrificial act through cremation which regen-erates the deceased, time, and the cosmos as if in anembodied big bang.Unlike ordinary Hindus, Aghori ascetics try toescape death by skirting the cycle of reincarnationsand by returning to the origins of the Hindu cosmoswhen there was only a void. The Aghori asceticssuspend time and become endowed with life-givingpowers through ways that would be considered pol-luting to others, such as mortuary cannibalism, andliving on cremation grounds. This intimate associ-ation with death frees them from life, and makesthem deny a social order organized along the rigidRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:22ampage 11Antonius C.

Thus, ascetics return to theprimordial cosmic unity beyond time and place.People believe that ascetics do not die but enterinto a deep meditation. They achieve a state ofnon-duality and therefore escape the death–rebirthcycle. Their physiological functions may cease oneday but their vital breath remains in the animatebody. In sum, ordinary Hindus embrace death inorder to regenerate life, while Aghori ascetics em-brace death to defy life.The northwest coast of North America has been aregion of continuing anthropological interest sinceFranz Boas conducted fieldwork there. The potlatch– the competitive reciprocation of property amongranked position holders from different villages – hasintrigued generations of scholars. Potlatches havebeen interpreted as rituals reaffirming group mem-bership and its ranking of social statuses, as a socialleveling mechanism redistributing property amongneighboring tribes, as a ritual exchange system regu-lating intermarriages, and as a religious culturalcomplex (Kan 1986:192–193). Sergei Kan adds anew explanation by focusing on the potlatch as amemorial for the deceased and their ancestors.13A death among the nineteenth-century matrilinealTlingit was followed by a funeral, a reburial, and amemorial potlatch. Sergei Kan (1986) describes inthe excerpt from his article ‘‘The 19th-Century Tlin-git Potlatch: A New Perspective’’ how the memorialpotlatch was an occasion to rebury the remains in anew grave house, allow the deceased’s ghost todepart for the afterworld, and mark the end ofmourning. The memorial potlatch also served tocompensate the paternal/affinal kin for their ser-vices, and especially to evoke the memory of theancestors. The four-day potlatch was preceded by amonth of preliminary rites in which guests werefeasted with dances, songs and masked perform-ances. Before presenting the gifts to the guests,orations and songs were delivered by each individualhost to express his or her relation to the deceased.What began as the remembrance of the deceased,soon evolved into a memorial ritual for all matrilin-eal ancestors. All deceased relatives were named inpublic, and offerings were made to commemoratethe matriclan’s dead members. The potlatch empha-sized the corporate identity of the dead, united thedeceased with his or her forebears, and allowed eachliving clan member to remourn, remember, honor,and bestow his or her relatives with food, gifts andlove, thus guaranteeing their immortality and thewell-being of the living.Katherine Verdery (1999) demonstrates in theexcerpt from her bookThe Political Lives of DeadBodies: Reburial and Postsocialist Changehow long-buried corpses can acquire new public meaningsunder changing political circumstances.14Post-so-cialist Eastern Europe witnessed a political regener-ation of the biographies of deceased public figures,whether these be kings, politicians, bishops orartists. The repatriation and reburial of such publicfigures appealed to many different audiences andpolitical groups which each sensed a deep affinitywith the deceased. The importance of the manypolitical, religious, ideological, generational or his-torical meanings of the public figure became en-hanced by the aura surrounding the dead body, andthe affect and emotion it evoked. Death inspires anawe among the living which is materialized by thecorpse. An anthropological analysis of the treatmentand reburial of the dead becomes therefore a cause-way into the politics of action, meaning, and emo-tion.Future of the Anthropology of DeathWhat is the state of the anthropology of death today?In 1973, Johannes Fabian criticized anthropology forits parochialization, folklorization, and exoticizationof death, and called upon the discipline to participatemore centrally in leading contemporary debates andexploit anthropology’s significant comparative andtheoreticalpotential.PalgiandAbramovitchrepeated this plea for cross-cultural analysis andtheoretical engagement in their major 1984 reviewessay. Two decades later, this summons still awaits asustained answer. Somehow, anthropologists recoilfrom making the sweeping generalizations commonin sociology and psychology which, it must be said,operate only within the limited cultural universe ofWestern society. Anthropology’s attention to cul-tural variation seems difficult to reconcile with thebuilding of grand theories and the singling out ofRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:22ampage 12Death and Anthropology: An Introduction12"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"universal principles about death because there isalways the unexpected cultural twist underminingsuch theoretical endeavors. Still, the broader theor-etical and empirical relevance of the anthropology ofdeath is shown overwhelmingly in the rich contribu-tions collected in this reader, and I believe that thefield can develop further into at least six directions,namely critique, comparison, self-reflexivity, object-ification, death-centeredness, and dialogue.The ethnographic critique of grand social theoriesand conceptual reductionism has been an enduringvalue but also a continuing liability of anthropology.The emphasis on the cultural aspects of social life hasgiven short shrift to a search for more universalcharacteristics. The anthropology of death shouldengage more directly with disciplines such as soci-ology, psychology, and medicine which claim to haveuncovered general principles of death, dying, grief,and mourning. Becker (chapter 2) and Scheper-Hughes (chapter 16) provide two examples of howto enrich other disciplines with the anthropologicalsensitivity to cultural variation in human conduct andcognition. The human conception of death consistsof many cultural edifices with numerous nooks andcrannies yet with a limited number of foundations,some of which have been delineated outside anthro-pology.Comparison, either between or within culturesand societies, is one of the core missions of anthro-pology, but it remains still underdeveloped in thestudy of death. The comparative approaches of Hertz(chapter 17) and van Gennep (chapter 18) may counton wide acceptance in anthropology but hardly any-thing as daring has been attempted since then. Fur-thermore, the present inattention to comparison alsoexists within ethnographic work. There is a tendencyto either focus on normal death or on uncommondeath, but there is seldom an integrated approachstudying the entire variation of modes of deathwithin a larger cultural scheme. Ca ́tedra (chapter8) and Parry (chapter 21) show how fruitful andrewarding this approach can be.Self-reflexivity has been a narrative style and epi-stemological approach in anthropology since the1970s. How often do deaths in the personal sphereor in the field remain unreported? We can onlywonder how Malinowski’s understanding of Tro-briand mourning and mortuary practices wasaffected by the death of his mother. The entriesduring the last month of his rather abruptly endingdiary are suffused with profound sorrow and greatmood swings: ‘‘Overcome with grief, I sobbed. Thendeep sadness, and fatigue. I feel so strong and healthynow – and all this is so pointless. I know that if I lostmy eyesight or my health now, I could easily commitsuicide’’ (Malinowski 1967:292). Rosaldo’s (chapter15) reinterpretation of Ilongot grief in the light of hispersonal sorrow is pointing the way to more self-reflexive ethnographies in the anthropology of death.The objectification of death in material culturewas a major concern of anthropologists at the turnof the nineteenth century, but following generationslost interest. Kan (chapter 22) draws attention tothe importance of material culture in his ethnographyof memorial potlatches, and so do Hallam andHockey (2001) for Western culture. Western soci-eties may have rather poor mortuary rituals, but theyhave a rich but understudied death culture rangingfrom art, cinema and literature to commemorations,cemeteries, memorials and oral culture.Paradoxically, much work in the anthropology ofdeath is life centered instead of death centered.Death is regarded as a disturbance of the socialorder, a laceration of the social body, and a gap insocial and family networks. Nadia Seremetakis hascalled for more attention to the content of deathitself, and praises the work of Arie`s (chapter 4) whodemonstrated the relative autonomy of death ritualsin a changing historical context. Seremetakis encour-ages anthropologists ‘‘to treat death rites as an arenaof social contestation, a space where heterogeneousand antagonistic cultural codes and social interestsmeet and tangle . . . [and to] analyze death rituals asintegrities with their own temporal rhythms, trans-formations, and levels of engagement with and dis-engagement from the social order’’ (1991:15). Lock(chapter 9) provides another example of a death-centered approach. Studies about euthanasia, thehospice movement (Hockey 1990), genocide(Hinton 2002a), AIDS (Farmer 2003), speciesdeath through nuclear, chemical or biologicalweapons (Lifton 1967), and the search for immor-tality through cloning and cryonics are promisingareas for further research.Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:22ampage 13Antonius C.

Verdery (chapter 23) and myown essay (chapter 12) are examples of such dialoguewith political and psychological anthropology.NOTES1The most important anthropological collections areBloch and Parry (1982b); Bohannan (1967); Ceder-roth, Corlin, and Lindstro ̈m (1988); Counts andCounts (1991b); Hinton (2002a, 2002b); Hum-phreys and King (1981); Platt and Persico (1992);Reynolds and Waugh (1977).2Without in any way trying to be exhaustive, there arealso a number of publications in other disciplines ofparticular interest to anthropologists, such as insociology (Bauman 1992; Elias 1985; Kamerman1988; Riley 1983; Seale 1998; Walter 1999), psych-ology (Archer 1999; Cook and Oltjenbruns 1989;Kastenbaum and Costa 1977; Nadeau 1998; Parkes1996; Stroebe, Hansson, Stroebe, and Schut 2001),history (Arie`s 1974, 1987; Guthke 1999; Kselman1993; Merridale 2000; Mosse 1990), religious stud-ies (Bowker 1991), thanatology (Aiken 1994; Core,Nabe and Core 2000), and comparative literature(Holst-Warhaft 2000).3See also Badone (1989).4See also Lock (2001).5The rapidly growing field of the anthropology ofviolence (see e.g. Scheper-Hughes and Bourgois2003) is providing a unique confluency of researchopportunities with the anthropology of death.6Eastwell (1982) has confirmed the existence of deathby suggestion.7See also Alexiou (1974) and Seremetakis (1991).8Renato Rosaldo had tried to understand Ilongotheadhunting from a historical perspective (Rosaldo1980), while Michelle Rosaldo took resort to sym-bolic and psychological anthropology (Rosaldo, M.1980).9The sociologist Walter (1999) makes a similarargument.10The interpretation of Scheper-Hughes is highly con-troversial because it goes against the grain of well-established psychological theory about bereavement.Psychologists would diagnose the maternal responseto infant death as denial or impaired mourning.11Huntington and Metcalf (1979) regard their book asan elaboration of the seminal work by Hertz.12See also Conklin (2001:157–177).13See also Kan (1989) and Simeone (1991).14See also Gal (1991).BIBLIOGRAPHYAiken, Lewis R., 1994Dying, Death, and Bereavement. 3rdedn.

Deathis the gateway to the other world in more thanthe literal sense. According to most theories ofearly religion, a great deal, if not all, of religiousinspiration has been derived from it – and inthis orthodox views are on the whole correct.Man has to live his life in the shadow of death, andhe who clings to life and enjoys its fullness mustdread the menace of its end. And he who is facedby death turns to the promise of life. Death and itsdenial – Immortality – have always formed, as theyform today, the most poignant theme of man’s fore-bodings. The extreme complexity of man’s emo-tional reactions to life finds necessarily itscounterpart in his attitude to death. Only what inlife has been spread over a long space and manifestedin a succession of experiences and events is here atits end condensed into one crisis which provokesa violent and complex outburst of religiousmanifestations.Even among the most primitive peoples, the atti-tude towards death is infinitely more complex and, Imay add, more akin to our own, than is usuallyassumed. It is often stated by anthropologists thatthe dominant feeling of the survivors is that of horrorat the corpse and of fear of the ghost. This twinattitude is even made by no less an authority thanWilhelm Wundt the very nucleus of all religiousbelief and practice. Yet this assertion is only a half-truth, which means no truth at all. The emotions areextremely complex and even contradictory; thedominant elements, love of the dead and loathing ofthe corpse, passionate attachment to the personalitystill lingering about the body and a shattering fear ofthe gruesome thing that has been left over, these twoelements seem to mingle and play into each other.This is reflected in the spontaneous behavior and inthe ritual proceedings at death. In the tending of thecorpse, in the modes of its disposal, in the post-funerary and commemorative ceremonies, thenearest relatives, the mother mourning for her son,the widow for her husband, the child for the parent,always show some horror and fear mingled withFrom Bronislaw Malinowski, ‘‘Magic, Science and Religion,’’ inMagic, Science and Religion, ed.

As death approaches,the nearest relatives in any case, sometimes thewhole community, forgather by the dying man, anddying, the most private act which a man can per-form, is transformed into a public, tribal event.As a rule, a certain differentiation takes place atonce, some of the relatives watching near thecorpse, others making preparations for the pendingend and its consequences, others again performingperhaps some religious acts at a sacred spot. Thusin certain parts of Melanesia the real kinsmenmust keep at a distance and only relatives bymarriage perform the mortuary services, while insome tribes of Australia the reverse order is ob-served.As soon as death has occurred, the body iswashed, anointed and adorned, sometimes thebodily apertures are filled, the arms and legs tiedtogether. Then it is exposed to the view of all, andthe most important phase, the immediate mourningbegins. Those who have witnessed death and itssequel among savages and who can compare theseevents with their counterpart among other uncivil-ized peoples must be struck by the fundamentalsimilarity of the proceedings. There is always amore or less conventionalized and dramatized out-burst of grief and wailing in sorrow, which oftenpasses among savages into bodily lacerations and thetearing of hair. This is always done in a public displayand is associated with visible signs of mourning, suchas black or white daubs on the body, shaven ordisheveled hair, strange or torn garments.The immediate mourning goes on round thecorpse. This, far from being shunned or dreaded, isusually the center of pious attention. Often there areritual forms of fondling or attestations of reverence.The body is sometimes kept on the knees of seatedpersons, stroked and embraced. At the same timethese acts are usually considered both dangerous andrepugnant, duties to be fulfilled at some cost to theperformer. After a time the corpse has to be disposedof. Inhumation with an open or closed grave; expos-ure in caves or on platforms, in hollow trees or onthe ground in some wild desert place; burning orsetting adrift in canoes – these are the usual forms ofdisposal.This brings us to perhaps the most importantpoint, the two-fold contradictory tendency, on theone hand to preserve the body, to keep its formintact, or to retain parts of it; on the other handthe desire to be done with it, to put it out of the way,to annihilate it completely. Mummification andburning are the two extreme expressions of thistwo-fold tendency. It is impossible to regard mum-mification or burning or any intermediate form asdetermined by mere accident of belief, as a historicalfeature of some culture or other which has gained itsuniversality by the mechanism of spread and contactonly. For in these customs is clearly expressed thefundamental attitude of mind of the surviving rela-tive, friend or lover, the longing for all that remainsof the dead person and the disgust and fear of thedreadful transformation wrought by death.One extreme and interesting variety in which thisdouble-edged attitude is expressed in a gruesomemanner is sarco-cannibalism, a custom of partakingin piety of the flesh of the dead person. It is done withextreme repugnance and dread and usually followedbyaviolentvomitingfit.Atthesametimeitisfelttobea supreme act of reverence,love, and devotion. In factit is considered such a sacred duty that among theMelanesians of New Guinea, where I have studied andwitnessed it, it is still performed in secret, althoughseverely penalized by the white Government. Thesmearing of the body with the fat of the dead, preva-lent in Australia and Papuasia is, perhaps, but avarietyof this custom.In all such rites, there is a desire to maintain thetie and the parallel tendency to break the bond. Thusthe funerary rites are considered as unclean andsoiling, the contact with the corpse as defiling anddangerous, and the performers have to wash, cleansetheir body, remove all traces of contact, and performritual lustrations. Yet the mortuary ritual compelsman to overcome the repugnance, to conquer hisfears, to make piety and attachment triumphant, andwith it the belief in a future life, in the survival of thespirit.And here we touch on one of the most importantfunctions of religious cult. In the foregoing analysis Ihave laid stress on the direct emotional forcesRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 3:58am page 20Magic, Science and Religion20"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"created by contact with death and with the corpse,for they primarily and most powerfully determinethe behavior of the survivors. But connected withthese emotions and born out of them, there is theidea of the spirit, the belief in the new life into whichthe departed has entered. And here we return to theproblem of animism with which we began our surveyof primitive religious facts. What is the substance of aspirit, and what is the psychological origin of thisbelief?The savage is intensely afraid of death, probably asthe result of some deep-seated instincts common toman and animals. He does not want to realize it as anend, he cannot face the idea of complete cessation, ofannihilation. The idea of spirit and of spiritual exist-ence is near at hand, furnished by such experiences asare discovered and described by Tylor. Grasping at it,man reaches the comforting belief in spiritual con-tinuity and in the life after death. Yet this belief doesnot remain unchallenged in the complex, double-edged play of hope and fear which sets in always inthe face of death. To the comforting voice of hope, tothe intense desire of immortality, to the difficulty, inone’s own case, almost the impossibility, of facingannihilation there are opposed powerful and terribleforebodings. The testimony of the senses, the grue-some decomposition of the corpse, the visible disap-pearance of the personality – certain apparentlyinstinctive suggestions of fear and horror seem tothreaten man at all stages of culture with some idea ofannihilation, with some hidden fears and forebod-ings. And here into this play of emotional forces, intothis supreme dilemma of life and final death, religionsteps in, selecting the positive creed, the comfortingview, the culturally valuable belief in immortality, inthe spirit independent of the body, and in the con-tinuance of life after death. In the various ceremoniesat death, in commemoration and communion withthe departed, and worship of ancestral ghosts, reli-gion gives body and form to the saving beliefs.Thus the belief in immortality is the result of adeep emotional revelation, standardized by religion,rather than a primitive philosophic doctrine. Man’sconviction of continued life is one of the supremegifts of religion, which judges and selects the betterof the two alternatives suggested by self-preservation– the hope of continued life and the fear of annihila-tion. The belief in spirits is the result of the belief inimmortality. The substance of which the spirits aremade is the full-blooded passion and desire for life,rather than the shadowy stuff which haunts hisdreams and illusions. Religion saves man from asurrender to death and destruction, and in doingthis it merely makes use of the observations ofdreams, shadows, and visions. The real nucleus ofanimism lies in the deepest emotional fact of humannature, the desire for life.Thus the rites of mourning, the ritual behaviorimmediately after death, can be taken as pattern ofthe religious act, while the belief in immortality, inthe continuity of life and in the nether world, can betaken as the prototype of an act of faith. Here, as inthe religious ceremonies previously described, wefind self-contained acts, the aim of which is achievedin their very performance. The ritual despair, theobsequies, the acts of mourning, express the emo-tion of the bereaved and the loss of the whole group.They endorse and they duplicate the natural feelingsof the survivors; they create a social event out of anatural fact. Yet, though in the acts of mourning, inthe mimic despair of wailing, in the treatment of thecorpse and in its disposal, nothing ulterior isachieved, these acts fulfill an important functionand possess a considerable value for primitive cul-ture.What is this function? The initiation ceremonieswe have found fulfill theirs in sacralizing tradition;the food cults, sacrament and sacrifice bring maninto communion with providence, with the benefi-cent forces of plenty; totemism standardizes man’spractical, useful attitude of selective interest towardshis surroundings. If the view here taken of the bio-logical function of religion is true, some such similarrole must also be played by the whole mortuaryritual.The death of a man or woman in a primitivegroup, consisting of a limited number of individuals,is an event of no mean importance. The nearestrelatives and friends are disturbed to the depth oftheir emotional life. A small community bereft of amember, especially if he be important, is severelymutilated. The whole event breaks the normalcourse of life and shakes the moral foundations ofsociety. The strong tendency on which we haveRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 3:58am page 21Bronislaw Malinowski21"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"insisted in the above description: to give way to fearand horror, to abandon the corpse, to run away fromthe village, to destroy all the belongings of the deadone – all these impulses exist, and if given way towould be extremely dangerous, disintegrating thegroup, destroying the material foundations of primi-tive culture. Death in a primitive society is, there-fore, much more than the removal of a member. Bysetting in motion one part of the deep forces of theinstinct of self-preservation, it threatens the verycohesion and solidarity of the group, and upon thisdepends the organization of that society, its tradition,and finally the whole culture. For if primitive manyielded always to the disintegrating impulses of hisreaction to death, the continuity of tradition and theexistence of material civilization would be madeimpossible.We have seen already how religion, by sacralizingand thus standardizing the other set of impulses,bestows on man the gift of mental integrity. Exactlythe same function it fulfills also with regard to thewhole group. The ceremonial of death which ties thesurvivors to the body and rivets them to the place ofdeath, the beliefs in the existence of the spirit, in itsbeneficent influences or malevolent intentions, inthe duties of a series of commemorative or sacrificialceremonies – in all this religion counteracts thecentrifugal forces of fear, dismay, demoralization,and provides the most powerful means of reintegra-tion of the group’s shaken solidarity and of the re-establishment of its morale.In short, religion here assures the victory of trad-ition and culture over the mere negative response ofthwarted instinct.Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 3:58am page 22Magic, Science and Religion22"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"2The Terror of DeathErnest BeckerIs it not for us to confess that in our civilized attitude towards death we are once more livingpsychologically beyond our means, and must reform and give truth its due? Would it not be betterto give death the place in actuality and in our thoughts which properly belongs to it, and to yielda little more prominence to that unconscious attitude towards death which we have hitherto socarefully suppressed?

Here we introduce dir-ectly one of the great rediscoveries of modernthought: that of all things that move man, one of theprincipal ones is his terror of death. After Darwin theproblem of death as an evolutionary one came to thefore, and many thinkers immediately saw that it was amajorpsychologicalproblemfor man.2Theyalsoveryquickly saw what real heroism was about, as Shalerwrote just at the turn of the century:3heroism is firstand foremost a reflex of the terror of death.

The divine hero of each ofthese cults was one who had come back from thedead. And as we know today from the research intoancient myths and rituals, Christianity itself was acompetitor with the mystery cults and won out –among other reasons – because it, too, featured ahealer with supernatural powers who had risen fromthe dead. The great triumph of Easter is the joyfulshout ‘‘Christ has risen!’’, an echo of the same joythat the devotees of the mystery cults enacted at theirceremonies of the victory over death. These cults, asG. Stanley Hall so aptly put it, were an attempt toattain ‘‘an immunity bath’’ from the greatest evil:death and the dread of it.4All historical religionsaddressed themselves to this same problem of how tobear the end of life. Religions like Hinduism andBuddhism performed the ingenious trick of pretend-ing not to want to be reborn, which is a sort ofnegative magic: claiming not to want what you reallywant most.5When philosophy took over from reli-gion it also took over religion’s central problem, anddeath became the real ‘‘muse of philosophy’’ from itsbeginnings in Greece right through Heidegger andmodern existentialism.6We already have volumes of work and thought onthe subject, from religion and philosophy and – sinceDarwin – from science itself. The problem is how tomake sense out of it; the accumulation of researchand opinion on the fear of death is already too largeto be dealt with and summarized in any simple way.The revival of interest in death, in the last fewdecades, has alone already piled up a formidableliterature, and this literature does not point in anysingle direction.The ‘‘Healthy-Minded’’ ArgumentThere are ‘‘healthy-minded’’ persons who maintainthat fear of death is not a natural thing for man, thatwe are not born with it. An increasing number ofcareful studies on how the actual fear of death de-velops in the child7agree fairly well that the child hasno knowledge of death until about the age of three tofive. How could he? It is too abstract an idea, tooremoved from his experience. He lives in a worldthat is full of living, acting things, responding to him,amusing him, feeding him. He doesn’t know what itmeans for life to disappear forever, nor theorizewhere it would go. Only gradually does he recognizethat there is a thing called death that takes somepeople away forever; very reluctantly he comes toadmit that it sooner or later takes everyone away, butthis gradual realization of the inevitability of deathcan take up until the ninth or tenth year.If the child has no knowledge of an abstract idealike absolute negation, he does have his own anx-ieties. He is absolutely dependent on the mother,experiences loneliness when she is absent, frustrationwhen he is deprived of gratification, irritation athunger and discomfort, and so on. If he were aban-doned to himself his world would drop away, and hisorganism must sense this at some level; we call thisthe anxiety of object-loss. Isn’t this anxiety, then, anatural, organismic fear of annihilation? Again, thereare many who look at this as a very relative matter.They believe that if the mother has done her job in awarm and dependable way, the child’s natural anx-ieties and guilts will develop in a moderate way, andhe will be able to place them firmly under the controlof his developing personality.8The child who hasgood maternal experiences will develop a sense ofbasic security and will not be subject to morbid fearsof losing support, of being annihilated, or the like.9As he grows up to understand death rationally by theage of nine or ten, he will accept it as part of his worldview, but the idea will not poison his self-confidentattitude toward life. The psychiatrist Rheingold sayscategorically that annihilation anxiety is not part ofthe child’s natural experience but is engendered inhim by bad experiences with a depriving mother.10This theory puts the whole burden of anxiety ontothe child’s nurture and not his nature. Anotherpsychiatrist, in a less extreme vein, sees the fearof death as greatly heightened by the child’s experi-ences with his parents, by their hostile denial ofhis life impulses, and, more generally, by the antag-onism of society to human freedom and self-expan-siveness.11As we will see later on, this view is very populartoday in the widespread movement toward unre-pressed living, the urge to a new freedom for naturalbiological urges, a new attitude of pride and joy inthe body, the abandonment of shame, guilt, and self-Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 3:58am page 24The Terror of Death24"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"hatred. From this point of view, fear of death issomething that society creates and at the same timeuses against the person to keep him in submission;the psychiatrist Moloney talked about it as a ‘‘culturemechanism,’’ and Marcuse as an ‘‘ideology.’’12Norman O. Brown, in a vastly influential book thatwe shall discuss at some length, went so far as to saythat there could be a birth and development of thechild in a ‘‘second innocence’’ that would be free ofthe fear of death because it would not deny naturalvitality and would leave the child fully open tophysical living.13It is easy to see that, from this point of view, thosewho have bad early experiences will be most mor-bidly fixated on the anxiety of death; and if by chancethey grow up to be philosophers they will probablymake the idea a central dictum of their thought – asdid Schopenhauer, who both hated his mother andwent on to pronounce death the ‘‘muse of philoso-phy.’’ If you have a ‘‘sour’’ character structure orespecially tragic experiences, then you are boundto be pessimistic. One psychologist remarked tome that the whole idea of the fear of death was animport by existentialists and Protestant theologianswho had been scarred by their European experiencesor who carried around the extra weight of a Calvinistand Lutheran heritage of life-denial. Even the distin-guished psychologist Gardner Murphy seems to leanto this school and urges us to studythe personwhoexhibits the fear of death, who places anxiety in thecenter of his thought; and Murphy asks why theliving of life in love and joy cannot also be regardedas real and basic.14The ‘‘Morbidly-Minded’’ ArgumentThe ‘‘healthy-minded’’ argument just discussed is oneside of the picture of the accumulated research andopinion on the problem of the fear of death, but thereis another side. A large body of people would agreewith these observations on early experience andwould admit that experiences may heighten naturalanxieties and later fears, but these people would alsoclaim very strongly that nevertheless the fear of deathis natural and is present in everyone, that it is the basicfear that influences all others, a fear from which noone is immune, no matter how disguised it may be.William James spoke very early for this school, andwith his usual colorful realism he called death ‘‘theworm at the core’’ of man’s pretensions to happi-ness.15No less a student of human nature than MaxScheler thought that all men must have some kind ofcertain intuition of this ‘‘worm at the core,’’ whetherthey admitted it or not.16Countless other authorities– some of whom we shall parade in the followingpages – belong to this school: students of the statureof Freud, many of his close circle, and serious re-searchers who are not psychoanalysts. What are we tomake of a dispute in which there are two distinctcamps, both studded with distinguished authorities?Jacques Choron goes so far as to say that it is ques-tionable whether it will ever be possible to decidewhether the fear of death is or is not the basic anx-iety.17In matters like this, then, the most that one cando is to take sides, to give an opinion based on theauthorities that seem to him most compelling, and topresent some of the compelling arguments.I frankly side with this second school – in fact, thiswhole book is a network of arguments based on theuniversality of the fear of death, or ‘‘terror’’ as Iprefer to call it, in order to convey how all-consum-ing it is when we look it full in the face. The firstdocument that I want to present and linger on is apaper written by the noted psychoanalyst GregoryZilboorg; it is an especially penetrating essay that –for succinctness and scope – has not been muchimproved upon, even though it appeared severaldecades ago.18Zilboorg says that most people thinkdeath fear is absent because it rarely shows its trueface; but he argues that underneath all appearancesfear of death is universally present:For behind the sense of insecurity in the face of danger,behind the sense of discouragement and depression,there always lurks the basic fear of death, a fear whichundergoes most complex elaborations and manifestsitself in many indirect ways. . . . No one is free of thefear of death . . . The anxiety neuroses, the variousphobic states, even a considerable number of depres-sive suicidal states and many schizophrenias amplydemonstrate the ever-present fear of death which be-comes woven into the major conflicts of the givenpsychopathological conditions. . . . We may take forgranted that the fear of death is always present in ourmental functioning.19Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 3:58am page 25Ernest Becker25"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Hadn’t James said the same thing earlier, in hisown way?Let sanguine healthy-mindedness do its best with itsstrange power of living in the moment and ignoringand forgetting, still the evil background is really thereto be thought of, and the skull will grin in at thebanquet.20The difference in these two statements is not so muchin the imagery and style as in the fact that Zilboorg’scomes almost a half-century later and is based on thatmuch more real clinical work, not only on philosoph-ical speculation or personal intuition. But it also con-tinuesthestraightlineofdevelopmentfromJamesandthe post-Darwinians who saw the fear of death as abiological and evolutionary problem. Here I think heis on very sound ground, and I especially like the wayhe puts the case. Zilboorg points out that this fear isactually an expression of the instinct of self-preserva-tion, which functions as a constant drive to maintainlife and to master the dangers that threaten life:Such constant expenditure of psychological energy onthe business of preserving life would be impossible ifthe fear of death were not as constant. The very term‘‘self-preservation’’ implies an effort against someforce of disintegration; the affective aspect of this isfear, fear of death.21In other words, the fear of death must be presentbehind all our normal functioning, in order for theorganism to be armed toward self-preservation. Butthe fear of death cannot be present constantly inone’s mental functioning, else the organism couldnot function. Zilboorg continues:If this fear were as constantly conscious, we should beunable to function normally. It must be properly re-pressed to keep us living with any modicum of com-fort. We know very well that to repress means morethan to put away and to forget that which was put awayand the place where we put it. It means also tomaintain a constant psychological effort to keep thelid on and inwardly never relax our watchfulness.22And so we can understand what seems like an im-possible paradox: the ever-present fear of death inthe normal biological functioning of our instinct ofself-preservation, as well as our utter obliviousnessto this fear in our conscious life:Therefore in normal times we move about actuallywithout ever believing in our own death, as if wefully believed in our own corporeal immortality. Weare intent on mastering death. . . . A man will say, ofcourse, that he knows he will die some day, but he doesnot really care. He is having a good time with living,and he does not think about death and does not care tobother about it – but this is a purely intellectual, verbaladmission. The affect of fear is repressed.23The argument from biology and evolution is basicand has to be taken seriously; I don’t see how it canbe left out of any discussion. Animals in order tosurvive have had to be protected by fear-responses,in relation not only to other animals but to natureitself. They had to see the real relationship of theirlimited powers to the dangerous world in which theywere immersed. Reality and fear go together natur-ally. As the human infant is in an even more exposedand helpless situation, it is foolish to assume that thefear response of animals would have disappeared insuch a weak and highly sensitive species. It is morereasonable to think that it was instead heightened, assome of the early Darwinians thought: early menwho were most afraid were those who were mostrealistic about their situation in nature, and theypassed on to their offspring a realism that had ahigh survival value.24The result was the emergenceof man as we know him: a hyperanxious animal whoconstantly invents reasons for anxiety even wherethere are none.The argument from psychoanalysis is less specula-tive and has to be taken even more seriously. Itshowed us something about the child’s inner worldthat we had never realized: namely, that it was morefilled with terror, the more the child was differentfrom other animals. We could say that fear is pro-grammed into the lower animals by ready-madeinstincts; but an animal who has no instincts has noprogrammed fears. Man’s fears are fashioned out ofthe ways in which he perceives the world. Now, whatis unique about the child’s perception of the world?For one thing, the extreme confusion of cause-and-Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 3:58am page 26The Terror of Death26"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"effect relationships; for another, extreme unrealityabout the limits of his own powers. The child lives ina situation of utter dependence; and when his needsare met it must seem to him that he has magicalpowers, real omnipotence. If he experiences pain,hunger, or discomfort, all he has to do is to screamand he is relieved and lulled by gentle, loving sounds.He is a magician and a telepath who has only tomumble and to imagine and the world turns to hisdesires.But now the penalty for such perceptions. In amagical world where things cause other things tohappen just by a mere thought or a look of displeas-ure, anything can happen to anyone. When the childexperiences inevitable and real frustrations from hisparents, he directs hate and destructive feelingstoward them; and he has no way of knowing thatmalevolent feelings cannot be fulfilled by the samemagic as were his other wishes. Psychoanalysts be-lieve that this confusion is a main cause of guilt andhelplessness in the child. In his very fine essay Wahlsummed up this paradox:the socialization processes for all children are painfuland frustrating, and hence no child escapes forminghostile death wishes toward his socializers. Therefore,none escape the fear of personal death in either director symbolic form. Repression is usually. . . immediateand effective.25The child is too weak to take responsibility for allthis destructive feeling, and he can’t control themagical execution of his desires. This is what wemean by an immature ego: the child doesn’t havethe sure ability to organize his perceptions and hisrelationship to the world; he can’t control his ownactivity; and he doesn’t have sure command over theacts of others. He thus has no real control over themagical cause-and-effect that he senses, either insidehimself or outside in nature and in others: his de-structive wishes could explode, his parents’ wisheslikewise. The forces of nature are confused, exter-nally and internally; and for a weak ego this factmakes for quantities of exaggerated potential powerand added terror. The result is that the child – at leastsome of the time – lives with an inner sense of chaosthat other animals are immune to.26Ironically, even when the child makes out realcause-and-effect relationships they become a burdento him because he overgeneralizes them. One suchgeneralization is what the psychoanalysts call the‘‘talion principle.’’ The child crushes insects, seesthe cat eat a mouse and make it vanish, joins withthe family to make a pet rabbit disappear into theirinteriors, and so on. He comes to know somethingabout the power relations of the world but can’t givethem relative value: the parents could eat him andmake him vanish, and he could likewise eat them;when the father gets a fierce glow in his eyes as heclubs a rat, the watching child might also expect tobe clubbed – especially if he has been thinking badmagical thoughts.I don’t want to seem to make an exact picture ofprocesses that are still unclear to us or to make outthat all children live in the same world and have thesame problems; also, I wouldn’t want to make thechild’s world seem more lurid than it really is most ofthe time; but I think it is important to show thepainful contradictions that must be present in it atleast some of the time and to show how fantastic aworld it surely is for the first few years of the child’slife. Perhaps then we could understand better whyZilboorg said that the fear of death ‘‘undergoes mostcomplex elaborations and manifests itself in manyindirect ways.’’ Or, as Wahl so perfectly put it, deathis acomplex symboland not any particular, sharplydefined thing to the child:the child’s concept of death is not a single thing, but itis rather a composite of mutually contradictory para-doxes . . . death itself is not only a state, but a complexsymbol, the significance of which will vary from oneperson to another and from one culture to another.27We could understand, too, why children have theirrecurrent nightmares, their universal phobias ofinsects and mean dogs. In their tortured interiorsradiate complex symbols of many inadmissible real-ities – terror of the world, the horror of one’s ownwishes, the fear of vengeance by the parents, thedisappearance of things, one’s lack of control overanything, really. It is too much for any animal to take,but the child has to take it, and so he wakes upscreaming with almost punctual regularity duringRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 3:58am page 27Ernest Becker27"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"the period when his weak ego is in the process ofconsolidating things.The ‘‘Disappearance’’ of the Fear of DeathYet, the nightmares become more and more widelyspaced, and some children have more than others: weare back again to the beginning of our discussion, tothose who do not believe that the fear of death isnormal, who think that it is a neurotic exaggerationthat draws on bad early experiences. Otherwise, theysay, how do you explain that so many people – thevast majority – seem to survive the flurry of child-hood nightmares and go on to live a healthy, more-or-less optimistic life, untroubled by death? As Mon-taigne said, the peasant has a profound indifferenceand a patience toward death and the sinister side oflife; and if we say that this is because of his stupidity,then ‘‘let’s all learn from stupidity.’’28Today, whenwe know more than Montaigne, we would say ‘‘let’sall learn from repression’’ – but the moral wouldhave just as much weight: repression takes care of thecomplex symbol of death for most people.But its disappearance doesn’t mean that the fearwas never there. The argument of those who believein the universality of the innate terror of death restsits case mostly on what we know about how effectiverepression is. The argument can probably never becleanly decided: if you claim that a concept is notpresent because it is repressed, you can’t lose; it isnot a fair game, intellectually, because you alwayshold the trump card. This type of argument makespsychoanalysis seem unscientific to many people, thefact is that its proponents can claim that someonedenies one of their concepts because he represses hisconsciousness of its truth.But repression is not a magical word for winningarguments; it is a real phenomenon, and we have beenable to study many of its workings. This study gives itlegitimacy as a scientific concept and makes it a more-or-less dependable ally in our argument. For onething, there is a growing body of research trying toget at the consciousness of death denied by repressionthat uses psychological tests such as measuring gal-vanic skin responses; it strongly suggests that under-neath the most bland exterior lurks the universalanxiety, the ‘‘worm at the core.’’29For another thing, there is nothing like shocks inthe real world to jar loose repressions. Recentlypsychiatrists reported an increase in anxiety neur-oses in children as a result of the earth tremors inSouthern California. For these children the discoverythat life really includes cataclysmic danger was toomuch for their still-imperfect denial systems – henceopen outbursts of anxiety. With adults we see thismanifestation of anxiety in the face of impendingcatastrophe where it takes the form of panic. Re-cently several people suffered broken limbs andother injuries after forcing open their airplane’ssafety door during take-off and jumping from thewing to the ground; the incident was triggered bythe backfire of an engine. Obviously underneaththese harmless noises other things are rumbling inthe creature.But even more important is how repressionworks: it is not simply a negative force opposinglife energies; it lives on life energies and uses themcreatively. I mean that fears are naturally absorbed byexpansive organismic striving. Nature seems to havebuilt into organisms an innate healthy-mindedness; itexpresses itself in self-delight, in the pleasure ofunfolding one’s capacities into the world, in theincorporation of things in that world, and in feedingon its limitless experiences. This is a lot of verypositive experience, and when a powerful organismmoves with it, it gives contentment. As Santayanaonce put it: a lion must feel more secure that God ison his side than a gazelle. On the most elementallevel the organism works actively against its ownfragility by seeking to expand and perpetuate itselfin living experience; instead of shrinking, it movestoward more life. Also, it does one thing at a time,avoiding needless distractions from all-absorbing ac-tivity; in this way, it would seem, fear of death can becarefully ignored or actually absorbed in the life-expanding processes. Occasionally we seem to seesuch a vital organism on the human level: I amthinking of the portrait ofZorba the Greekdrawn byNikos Kazantzakis. Zorba was an ideal of the non-chalant victory of all-absorbing daily passion overtimidity and death, and he purged others in his life-affirming flame. But Kazantzakis himself was noZorba – which is partly why the character of Zorbarang a bit false – nor are most other men. Still,Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 3:58am page 28The Terror of Death28"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"everyone enjoys a working amount of basic narcis-sism, even though it is not a lion’s. The child who iswell nourished and loved develops, as we said, asense of magical omnipotence, a sense of his ownindestructibility, a feeling of proven power andsecure support. He can imagine himself, deepdown, to be eternal. We might say that his repressionof the idea of his own death is made easy for himbecause he is fortified against it in his very narcissisticvitality. This type of character probably helped Freudto say that the unconscious does not know death.Anyway, we know that basic narcissism is increasedwhen one’s childhood experiences have been se-curely life-supporting and warmly enhancing to thesense of self, to the feeling of being really special,truly Number One in creation. The result is thatsome people have more of what the psychoanalystLeon J. Saul has aptly called ‘‘Inner Sustainment.’’30It is a sense of bodily confidence in the face ofexperience that sees the person more easily throughsevere life crises and even sharp personality changes;it almost seems to take the place of the directiveinstincts of lower animals. One can’t help thinking ofFreud again, who had more inner sustainment thanmost men, thanks to his mother and favorable earlyenvironment; he knew the confidence and couragethat it gave to a man, and he himself faced up to lifeand to a fatal cancer with a Stoic heroism. Again wehave evidence that the complex symbol of fear ofdeath would be very variable in its intensity; it wouldbe, as Wahl concluded, ‘‘profoundly dependent uponthe nature and the vicissitudes of the developmentalprocess.’’31But I want to be careful not to make too much ofnatural vitality and inner sustainment. As we will seein Chapter Six, even the unusually favored Freudsuffered his whole life from phobias and fromdeath-anxiety; and he came to fully perceive theworld under the aspect of natural terror. I don’tbelieve that the complex symbol of death is everabsent, no matter how much vitality and inner sus-tainment a person has. Even more, if we say that thesepowers make repression easy and natural, we are onlysaying the half of it. Actually, they get their verypower from repression. Psychiatrists argue that thefear of death varies in intensity depending on thedevelopmental process, and I think that one import-ant reason for this variability is that the fear is trans-muted in that process. If the child has had a veryfavorable upbringing, it only serves all the better tohide the fear of death. After all, repression is madepossible by the natural identification of the child withthe powers of his parents. If he has been well caredfor, identification comes easily and solidly, and hisparents’ powerful triumph over death automaticallybecomes his. What is more natural to banish one’sfears than to live on delegated powers? And whatdoes the whole growing-up period signify, if not thegiving over of one’s life-project? I am going to betalking about these things all the way through thisbook and do not want to develop them in this intro-ductory discussion. What we will see is that man cutsout for himself a manageable world: he throws him-self into action uncritically, unthinkingly. He acceptsthe cultural programming that turns his nose wherehe is supposed to look; he doesn’t bite the world offin one piece as a giant would, but in small manageablepieces, as a beaver does. He uses all kinds of tech-niques, which we call the ‘‘character defenses’’: helearns not to expose himself, not to stand out; helearns to embed himself in other-power, both ofconcrete persons and of things and cultural com-mands; the result is that he comes to exist in theimagined infallibility of the world around him. Hedoesn’t have to have fears when his feet are solidlymired and his life mapped out in a ready-made maze.All he has to do is to plunge ahead in a compulsivestyle of drivenness in the ‘‘ways of the world’’that thechild learns and in which he lives later as a kind ofgrim equanimity – the ‘‘strange power of living in themoment and ignoring and forgetting’’ – as James putit. This is the deeper reason that Montaigne’s peasantisn’t troubled until the very end, when the Angel ofDeath, who has always been sitting on his shoulder,extends his wing. Or at least until he is prematurelystartled into dumb awareness, like the ‘‘Husbands’’ inJohn Cassavetes’ fine film. At times like this, whenthe awareness dawns that has always been blotted outby frenetic, ready-made activity, we see the transmu-tation of repression redistilled, so to speak, and thefear of death emerges in pure essence. This is whypeople have psychotic breaks when repression nolonger works, when the forward momentum of ac-tivity is no longer possible. Besides, the peasantRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 3:58am page 29Ernest Becker29"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"mentality is far less romantic than Montaigne wouldhave us believe. The peasant’s equanimity is usuallyimmersed in a style of life that has elements of realmadness, and so it protects him: an undercurrent ofconstant hate and bitterness expressed in feuding,bullying, bickering and family quarrels, the pettymentality, the self-deprecation, the superstition, theobsessive control of daily life by a strict authoritarian-ism, and so on. As the title of a recent essay by JosephLopreato has it: ‘‘How would you like to be a peas-ant?’’We will also touch upon another large dimensionin which the complex symbol of death is transmutedand transcended by man – belief in immortality, theextension of one’s being into eternity. Right now wecan conclude that there are many ways that repres-sion works to calm the anxious human animal, so thathe need not be anxious at all.I think we have reconciled our two divergentpositions on the fear of death. The ‘‘environmental’’and the ‘‘innate’’ positions are both part of the samepicture; they merge naturally into one another; it alldepends from which angle you approach the picture:from the side of the disguises and transmutations ofthe fear of death or from the side of its apparentabsence. I admit with a sense of scientific uneasinessthat whatever angle you use, you don’t get at theactual fear of death; and so I reluctantly agree withChoron that the argument can probably never becleanly ‘‘won.’’ Nevertheless something very import-ant emerges: there are different images of man thathe can draw and choose from.On the one hand, we see a human animal whois partly dead to the world, who is most ‘‘dignified’’when he shows a certain obliviousness to his fate,when he allows himself to be driven through life;who is most ‘‘free’’ when he lives in secure depend-ency on powers around him, when he is least inpossession of himself. On the other hand, we getan image of a human animal who is overly sensitive tothe world, who cannot shut it out, who is thrownback on his own meagre powers, and who seemsleast free to move and act, least in possession ofhimself, and most undignified. Whichever imagewe choose to identify with depends in large partupon ourselves. Let us then explore and developthese images further to see what they reveal to us.NOTES1 S.

The first question is, What happens to aperson after death? The second is, How can a personlive without overwhelming anxiety in the face of thecertainty of death? Behind both questions lies thehuman aspiration to live forever.It is possible to look at all of human history as arecord of man’s diverse answers to these questions ofimmortality. Religions and empires have beenfounded, wars fought, and untold millions of peoplekilled on behalf of conflicting notions of the path toimmortal life. And the concern about immortality, aswell as the debate about what it means, continues inour own time.Freud said that the aim of life is death. By this hemeant to convey at least two distinct ideas. The firstimplication of this concept is the idea of the deathinstinct as an innate tendency toward return to aninanimate state.Instincts are modes of energy that lead to certainforms of life-preserving behavior. Therefore,the con-cept of an instinct that leads to death is something of acontradiction in terms. As we have suggested previ-ously, however, Freud’s idea of a death instinct didcontain an important element of truth that should bepreserved: that death is psychically present from thebeginning of life. We wish to preserve this Freudianinsight about the psychological significance of death.But we believe that this influence of death on psycho-logicallifeisduetotheimportanceofsymbolizationinmental activity rather than to what Freud called adeath instinct.What we call experience can occur only insofar asour minds are able to give form to our perceptions.This form structures and orders sensory data.‘‘Seeing’’ and ‘‘recognizing’’ are thus very closelyrelated, because inner psychic structures createmeaning and the possibility for recognition. Theinner forms in our minds are images and symbolswhich can be either very clear and distinct or rathervague and cloudy. The most general psychic organ-ization of these inner images and symbols takes placearound the polarities of connection-separation,movement-stasis, and integrity-disintegration. Theextreme form of separation, stasis, and disintegra-From Robert Jay Lifton and Eric Olson, ‘‘Symbolic Immortality,’’ inLiving and Dying(London: Wildwood House, 1974).Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 3:59am page 3232"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"tion is death, and imagery that relates to these ispsychologically extremely powerful.The second implication of Freud’s concept of thedeath instinct is that ‘‘every organism wants to die inits own fashion.’’ In that spirit, recent psychiatricinvestigators speak of the ‘‘appropriate’’ death, bywhich they mean a readiness to die because a full lifehas reached completion. But this sense is often in-separable from despair – the feeling that one nolonger has sufficient purpose to go on living.These problems have been dealt with chiefly inliterature, philosophy, and theology – disciplinesoutside the realm of science. Only recently havepsychologists become concerned with them. Thescientific world view has generally been limited toquestions of the ‘‘means’’ of life, rather than con-fronting problems of ultimate value. The purposes ofhuman life and the question of what lies beyond it –these are precisely the issues that science has con-sidered inappropriate to its proper concerns. Be-cause science has great prestige in our society,scientists’ avoidance of issues of value has a profoundinfluence on our culture and our lives.Psychology has been partly within the scientifictradition in this sense and partly outside it. Mostacademic psychologists have been more interested inpsychologicalmechanisms(such as how people learn)than in questions of ethicalgoals(such as what it ispeople should learn). On this point Freud was a greatrebel, because he was concerned with alleviatingpsychological misery. To achieve that end, he believedpeople should be educated to accept reality, and hewas convinced that the scientific truths discovered bypsychology would lead to the abolition of man’s spir-itual illusions.Chief among humanity’s illusions, in Freud’s view,was religion. He saw the spiritual comfort given byreligion as a false support used by people who hadnot outgrown childish dependence on parents. Ma-turity, according to Freud, would consist in facingsquarely the hard realities of life, and death, and notsearching after false hopes.Freud saw the idea of immortality as supremeamong civilization’s false hopes. He said that thisillusion derives from clinging to the pretense thatone will not die, and that it serves to compensate forthe reality of death which is too hard to accept. Freudbelieved that by pinning its hopes on an illusion – theillusion that death is not total and final – civilizationundermines its only real hope: the rational pursuit ofthe truth.When,inhislaterwritings,Freudattackedreligionas an illusion, he aroused almost as much controversyand contempt as he had in his earlier emphasis on theimportance of sexuality. Freud insisted that death isfinaland means the total annihilation of the organism.He believed that doctrines of the immortality of thesoul derive from a childlike refusal to accept thefinality of death.In the early 1900s, Carl Jung, initially one ofFreud’s followers, began to take psychology in avery different direction. Jung had done extensivestudy of world religions and mythology and wasimpressed by the discovery that myths from allparts of the world and in every age have containedbeliefs about life after death. Jung felt that the longhistory of mythology must reveal deep truths aboutthe nature of the human mind that psychology wasignoring. These truths Jung called ‘‘archetypes’’ –universal psychic images which he believed arosefrom the deepest level of the unconscious. Jungargued that humankind’s relatively recent stressupon narrow materialistic science could bring aboutthe loss of the vital truths displayed in dreams andmyths. To ignore these universal archetypal truthswould result in the impoverishment of psychic life.Jung described the psychic vitality of ‘‘primitive’’peoples who live in tune with archetypal truth. Andhe observed the positive effects of belief in myths forpersons nearing death. He said that when man’sconscious thinking is in harmony with the deeptruths of the unconscious revealed in mythology,then fear of death is no longer overwhelming. Lifecan then be lived to the fullest until the end. There-fore, Jung, in contrast to Freud, encouraged belief inreligious teachings because he thought such beliefwas, in his words, ‘‘hygienic’’ – necessary for healthyliving. He wrote:When I live in a house that I know will fall about myhead within the next two weeks, all my vital functionswill be impaired by this thought, but if, on the con-trary, I feel myself to be safe, I can dwell there in anormal comfortable way.Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 3:59am page 33Robert Jay Lifton and Eric Olson33"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Jung was convinced that the unconscious partof the mind has a timeless quality and that belief ineternal life is consistent with the timelessness ofthe unconscious. To achieve psychological whole-ness, in his view, requires that one become more intouch with this part of the unconscious in daily living.In his autobiography, published posthumously, Jungwrote:If we understand and feel that here in this life wealready have a link with the infinite, desires and atti-tudes change.We can learn something important from bothFreud and Jung. But neither, in our opinion, had atotally satisfactory view.Freud stressed what is biologically true aboutdeath: its absolute destruction of the organism. Hewas also aware of man’s great capacity for self-delu-sion. Though he knew that confronting death couldheighten the vitality of living, he did not grasp thesymbolic significance of images of immortality. Inthis he under-estimated the human need for imagesof connection beyond the life span of each individual.This need is not itself delusional, nor need it neces-sarily result in delusions. Freud was bound to aconception of psychic activity that we think fails todo justice to the characteristically human tendencycontinually to create and re-create images and innerforms. We speak here of symbolization as a processrather than the creation of specific symbols. Whatwe have referred to as the psychoformative processencompasses this overall tendency, and its complex-ity is such that it cannot be reduced to the idea of thesexual or death instinct. The important question,then, is how and when symbolization can becomerich enough to sustain full vital life.Here, Jung made a real contribution. He tookreligious imagery very seriously and appreciated itssignificance in man’s search for meaning and theeffort to express it. The problem with Jung’s pos-ition is that he did not always distinguish betweenman’s need for symbolization around immortalityand the literal existence of an afterlife. We agreewith Jung that the scientific tradition as reflected inFreud’s insistence on seeing religious symbols asmere delusion misses the point of such symbols.But Jung’s refusal to distinguish between symbolicmeaning and literal reference undermines and dis-torts both religion and science.In the seventeenth century, a French philosophernamed Blaise Pascal proposed what he called a‘‘wager.’’ If there is no afterlife, and one doesn’tbelieve, then one has lost nothing, Pascal argued.But if there really is such a thing, and one fails to gainadmission through lack of belief, then all is lost.Therefore, Pascal argued, since there is everythingto be gained by believing, and nothing to lose, oneshould make the wager and decide to believe in theafterlife. Jung’s position is a bit like Pascal’s wager.Moreover, Jungian symbols tend to have a fixedquality, so that there is little connection betweenwhat Jung calls archetypal symbols and ongoinghistory.Our own view of symbolic immortality draws fromboth Freud and Jung. We would stress not only thefinality of death, but also the human need for a senseof historical connection beyond individual life. We[ . . . ] need to develop concepts, imagery, and sym-bols adequate to give a sense of significance toexperience. This psychological process of creatingmeaningful images is at the heart of what we willnow callsymbolic immortality.We can see the sense of symbolic immortality asreflecting man’s relatedness to all that comes beforehim and all that follows him. This relatedness isexpressed in the many kinds of symbolization thatenable one to participate in ongoing life withoutdenying the reality of death. Without this unendingsense of attachment to aims and principles beyondthe self, the everyday formative process we havebeen discussing – as well as the capacity to feel athome in the world – cannot be sustained. Whenpeople believe in such cultural projects and expres-sions, they feel a sense of attachment to human flow,to both their biology and their history. They feel asense of immortalitywhich enables active, vital life togo on.This sense of immortality is expressed in fivemodes or categories: biological, creative, theo-logical, natural, and experiential.Biologicalimmortality is perhaps the most obviousmode. It means simply that a person lives on throughRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 3:59am page 34Symbolic Immortality34"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"(and in) his sons and daughters and their sons anddaughters in an endless chain. In addition to gener-ational continuity, this mode also symbolizes the re-productive cells as they are passed along from parentto child.The biological mode of immortality has beengreatly emphasized in East Asia, especially in Chinaand Japan, where the failure to have offspring implieslack of respect for ancestors. But the idea of acontinuing family and a ‘‘family name’’ protectedfrom blemish is important in all cultures. The actof writing a will to insure the transmission of in-herited wealth to one’s descendants reflects thisconcern for the preservation of one’s posterity.This mode is never purely biological. It is experi-enced emotionally and symbolically and transcendsone’s own biological family to include one’s tribe,organization, people, nation, or even species. Simi-larly, the sense of biological continuity becomesintermingled with cultural continuity as each gener-ation passes along its traditions to the next.We can speak of a kind of ‘‘biosocial immortality’’that occurs through the continuity of one’s familyand other important social groupings. Historicallythis mode has been a mixed blessing. It has encour-aged cooperation with those beyond one’s immediatefamily (one’s people), but has also led through chau-vinism to the killing of those whom one views as‘‘different.’’ Nevertheless, there has been a signifi-cant trend among large numbers of people through-out the world to view all of humanity as a singlespecies sharing a common destiny. Unfortunately,that beginning recognition has hardly touched ideo-logical and nationalistic antagonisms.A second mode is that of human ‘‘works,’’ or thecreativemode. One may feel a sense of immortality inthis mode through teaching, art-making, repairing,construction, writing, healing, inventing, or throughlasting influences of any kind on other human beings– influences that one feels can enter into a generalhuman flow beyond the self. In professions likescience or art that have a long heritage, one isfrequently aware of the historical sources of one’sown work and the tradition that one’s own contribu-tion is maintaining.In such service professions as medicine or educa-tion, one has a sense that one’s direct influence onpatients or students is transmitted to more distantpersons not seen or known. When efforts at healingor teaching seem unsuccessful, one may feel a pro-found despair originating in the perception that one’sefforts are not making any lasting difference. Thisdespair itself reveals a deep human need to have anenduring effect – to leave a trace.Ordinarily, when one’s work is progressing well,there is little conscious concern with its immortaliz-ing effect. But when the products of creative effortdo not seem sufficient to embody one’s sense of self,then the question (previously unconscious) of thevalue and meaning of one’s life and work begins tobecome a conscious concern.The Christian tradition has distinguished between‘‘work’’ and ‘‘works.’’ ‘‘Work’’ in this sense hasreferred to mundane, often unsatisfying toil whichregenerates neither the worker nor his community.‘‘Works’’ imply contributions of lasting value to thelarger community; these contributions are made inpart through one’s ‘‘vocation.’’Entering a vocation was originally dependentupon feeling oneself ‘‘called’’ to do some particularkind of work, and the word vocation still suggestssomething beyond just a job. It implies that one feelsin one’s work connections and commitments beyondthe self. At some level of consciousness, such actionsare perceived to involve the lasting extension of thevalued elements of one’s own life into the lives ofothers. Through such doctrines as karma, service,and duty, other religions have expressed similarideas.Thetheologicalmode of immortality is the onemost readily suggested by the word immortality.For, historically, it has been through religion andreligious institutions that people have most self-con-sciously expressed the aspiration of conquering deathand living forever. Different religions give the assur-ance of immortality in different ways, but concernwith the problem of the meaning of life in the face ofdeath is common to all religious traditions. No reli-gion is based on the premise that human life iseternallyinsignificant. Thus, Buddha, Moses, Christ,and Muhammad, through various combinations ofmoral attainment and revelation, transcended indi-vidual death and left behind teachings through whichtheir followers could do the same.Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 3:59am page 35Robert Jay Lifton and Eric Olson35"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The danger with religious images of immortality isthat they can quickly lose their symbolic quality andresult in the assertion that people don’t really die. Forcenturies, great religious teachers have attacked insti-tutionalized ‘‘religion’’ as the real stumbling block toauthentic spiritual attainment. Such images as heaven,hell, reincarnation, and the resurrection of the bodyare often understood in the same sense as scientificobservations of nature. Thus, the concept of the‘‘immortal soul’’ – a part of man that escapes death– was seen by Freud as a characteristic example of thehuman capacity for self-delusion through religion.We believe Freud was justified in his attack uponliteralized doctrines that deny death. But Freud didnot appreciate that religious symbols of life afterdeath or life beyond death can mean somethingother than literal images of angels living serenely ina blissful heaven or, negatively, damned souls con-demned to eternal suffering in the fires of hell. Theimage of immortality can connect with the experi-ence of spiritual death and rebirth which may occurmany times during one’s earthly existence. Spiritualrebirth in this sense may be interpreted as a dying toprofane or vulgar existence and a regenerated life ona more intense and meaningful plane, an experiencethat gives rise to profound and revitalizing hope. TheJewish religion has emphasized rebirth as somethingthat happens to the whole people or nation. Chris-tianity has focused more on individual spiritual at-tainment and salvation.Imagery of rebirth is found in the Hindu andBuddhist as well as the Jewish and Christian reli-gions. And whenever such imagery is present, thedanger of its being literalized is always present, too.But central to all these traditions, and more compat-ible with our own psychoformative position, is theconception of transcending death through spiritualattainment that connects one with eternal principles.Thus the idea of being ‘‘chosen by God,’’ experi-encing the grace of God, or, in Eastern religions,removing the veil of ordinary existence – all theseimages speak symbolically of a changed experience oftime and of death somehow losing its sting. Whetherthrough prayer, worship, contemplation, or medita-tion, all religions have taught methods of reorientingoneself in relation to time and death. This reorien-tation is often spoken of as a spiritual rebirth thatmust be preceded by a death of the old self. This isexpressed in the Christian tradition in the words ‘‘Hewho finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his lifefor my sake will find it,’’ a paradoxical image sug-gesting both death and rebirth.A fourth mode is the sense of immortalityachieved through continuity withnature. ‘‘Fromdust you come and to dust you shall return’’ is anOld Testament injunction against pride, as well as anexpression of confidence that the earth itself doesnot die. Whatever happens to man, the trees, moun-tains, seas, and rivers endure. Partly for this reason,we constantly go back to nature, however briefly, forspiritual refreshment and revitalization.In traditional Japanese culture, nature has beenseen as a divine embodiment of the gods of moun-tain, valley, rain, wind, field, and stream. The deli-cate beauty of Japanese gardens is an expression ofthis cultural legacy. In India, the gods are alwayspictured as residing amidst lush mountains andvalleys – nature being the ideal spiritual home.Americans, too, have had an intense concern withthe ‘‘great outdoors,’’ a concern originally demon-strated by the importance of the great frontier – thatever expanding horizon of the earthly realm of man.The image of nature as the great frontier stillexists in our journeys to the moon and aspirationsbeyond. (These journeys and aspirations, beinghuman, become corrupted by the competitive insist-ence of a single nation upon being the first there – ineffect, upon claiming an immortalizing advantage forthis priority.) An avid interest in outdoor sports of allkinds and a growing preoccupation with ecologywitness the continuing importance of being intouch with a surviving natural habitat. The concernwith ecology has arisen from the very real possibilityof the destruction of the environment, and also fromthe continuing importance of nature for our imagin-ations. In this sense, the enduring rhythms of naturehave a significance that is undiminished, and perhapsintensified, for those city-dwellers to whom they areno longer visible.A fifth mode of immortality, which we callexperi-ential transcendence, is a bit different from the othersin that it depends solely on a psychological state. Thisstate is the experience of illumination or raptureattained as time seems to disappear. The termRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 3:59am page 36Symbolic Immortality36"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"transcendence – meaning ‘‘going beyond’’ – refers tothe feeling of being beyond the limits and confines ofordinary daily life. Moments of transcendence havean ecstatic quality, and the word ‘‘ecstasy’’ means ‘‘tostand outside of’’ – to be outside of oneself. In thissense, moments of experiential transcendence aremoments of being beyond prosaic life, and beyonddeath.Experiential transcendence is similar to the spir-itual reorientation which we spoke of as religiousrebirth. But such psychological experience may alsobe found in music, dance, battle, athletics, mechan-ical flight, contemplation of the past, artistic orintellectual creation, sexual love, childbirth, com-radeship, and the feeling of working together withothers in common cause. This experience can occurin relation to any of the other four modes (biological,creative, theological, natural) and, in fact, may beessential in order to integrate any of them into one’slife. However it occurs, experiential transcendenceinvolves a sense of timelessness, of which Jungspoke. There does seem to be a universal psychicpotential and even need for occasional suspension ofordinary awareness of time.The state of experiential transcendence may bebrought on with the aid of drugs, starvation, physicalexhaustion, or lack of sleep. However induced, thisstate is felt as involving extraordinary psychologicalunity, intensity of sensual awareness, and unexpres-sible illumination and insight. After such an experi-ence, life is not quite the same. In fact, it is the resultof such experiences – the sense of ‘‘new life’’ – that isoften valued more than the experiences themselves.Transcendent experiences result in a reorderingof the dominant symbols and images by which onelives. The result can be a new tone of vitality inliving, a new sense of commitment to one’s projects,or the abandoning of one’s old projects and commit-ments in favor of a totally new style of life. Thereordering can also lead to greater ethical integrityand more courageous moral actions. Experiences ofthis kind can be of greater or lesser intensity. Buteven such relatively less intense and more commonoccurrences as exertion on a tennis court or in asprint, a moment of insight or quietude, or gentlesensual touching can involve an altered sense of timeand a feeling of expanded life space.Over the centuries, men have frequently useddrugs in pursuit of these experiences. In recentyears drugs have been increasingly used, often incombination with music, to achieve various kindsof ‘‘highs.’’ Many people in describing such ‘‘trips’’have emphasized the importance of the setting inwhich the drug is taken, the person with whomone shares the experience (the ‘‘guide’’), and theexpectations that one brings to the experience. Allthese refer to the symbolic context or set of imagespresent in the mind prior to and during the use of thedrug. This, in turn, suggests that drugsby themselvesdo not bring about spiritual reorientation. Largenumbers of people are finding forms of spiritualdiscipline, such as meditation, which can offer simi-lar experiences without recourse to drugs.The ‘‘highs’’ which some people experience withdrugs (or alcohol) are obtained by other people indifferent ways. William James long ago remarkedthat getting drunk was the poor man’s substitute forwhat the rich get from going to the symphony.Whether that is precisely true or no, we mightwonder what he would say now about the moremodern combination of listening stoned to theStones. In any case it is interesting that the use ofmarijuana has come to be termed getting ‘‘stoned’’ –almost in the way getting drunk is sometimes re-ferred to as being ‘‘plastered.’’ In each case the imageis of becoming desensitized, even inanimate – but ina very special way that is thought of as highly pleas-urable and beyond pain. Although alcohol is primar-ily a depressant and marijuana characteristicallyintensifies perception, both can result in eitherheightened sensitivity or the reverse, dependingupon the setting and the expectations that one bringsto their use.Those who would connect the use of drugs withthe experience of transcendence (as we are doinghere) are nevertheless compelled to recognize theaddiction and deterioration which can also result.The deaths of Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, forexample, suggest the way in which drug use mayinvolve the user in destructive experiences, evendeath trips.When reordering and renewal give way to exclu-sive reliance upon the chemical influence of thedrug, habituation and addiction can be said toRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 3:59am page 37Robert Jay Lifton and Eric Olson37"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"occur. No longer having access to liberating images,the ‘‘old self’’ remains in a state of symbolic death.Use of the drug then becomes more desperate, andthe breakdown of inner integrity becomes increas-ingly associated with the death imagery of separ-ation, disintegration, and stasis. The anxietyassociated with these impels the user to returneven more desperately to the drug in a patheticdownward spiral. There are many people whoserelationship to drugs is a mixture of these extremes,containing elements of symbolic reordering and re-birth as well as habituation and anxiety.The quest for experiential transcendence is usuallyrelated not only to the search for the new, but also tothe unfolding of that which is oldest and deepest inthe self. Rebirth and new life are recurrent images inall religious traditions; the Christian spiritual mes-sage is, in fact, referred to as ‘‘goodnews.’’ Theexperience of addiction, not only to drugs but toanything else as well, is a desperate search for novelty(always a new high) with continually less experiencethat is actually new. Thus, addiction comes to be theexperience that nothing is new – a nullification of thelife imagery of movement. It becomes instead adeathlike numbness from which recovery is difficult.The process of therapy in psychiatry involves asymbolic reordering analogous to that which occursin experiential transcendence. When therapy is suc-cessful, a patient feels a widening of the space inwhich he lives. It is as if the narrow images throughwhich he has seen reality have been reorganized sothat the past appears more coherent and the futuremore inviting. Death imagery is reconceived, and lifeimagery of connection, integrity, and movementbecomes dominant.In many societies experiential transcendence isencouraged through fiestas, festivals, holidays, andcelebrations which help people to break free of therestraints of routine and to sing, dance, drink, laugh,and love in a spirit of excess. Such celebrationsradically interrupt ordinary daily life and allow par-ticipants to forget time and responsibility. The occa-sions for these celebrations are often religious holydays which derive from society’s myth of its ownbeginnings. The celebration is a kind of birthday inwhich the society’s birth is commemorated and itspeople’s lives renewed.Experiential transcendence is thus a key to thesense of immortality in any mode. For what lies atthe heart of experiential transcendence – reorienta-tion of time – is necessary to the other modes aswell ifthey are in fact to connect with a sense of the eternal.Experiential transcendence involves entry into whathas been called ‘‘mythic time,’’ in which the percep-tion of death is minimized and the threat of extinctionis no longer foreboding. One feels oneself alive in a‘‘continuous present’’ in which ancient past and dis-tant future are contained.We spoke earlier of the innate death imagery ofseparation, disintegration, and stasis. The fivemodes of symbolic immortality provide avenuesthrough which the death anxiety associated withthese images can be mastered. By achieving signifi-cant relation to these modes, one’s life assumesqualities of continuity and the life imagery of con-nection, movement, and integrity is affirmed. Wecan speak of the need to master death anxiety as basicto the human condition, and we can see the modes ofsymbolic immortality as providing paths for thismastery.It is possible to think of human life at everymoment as moving between two poles: imagery oftotal severance (death imagery) and imagery of con-tinuity (symbolic immortality). Both are present in akind of balance; neither is able totally to abolish theother. Death imagery makes the quest for symbolicimmortality more urgent and provides a stimulus forcreative effort of all kinds. Images of continuity andimmortality make the certainty of death lessthreatening. Feeling moments of experiential tran-scendence or a strong sense of relation to one of theother modes of symbolic immortality enables one toaffirm the continuity of life without denying death.Much of the time these matters are not part ofconscious awareness, although they underlie andsupport the tone and quality of one’s awareness. Atcrisis points and times of transition, however, theybecome very conscious issues.Periods of historical dislocation are characterizedby lack of confidence in a society’s institutions. Butinstitutions – family, church, government, work,schools – are themselves structures through whichto facilitate the sharing of images of immortalizingRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 3:59am page 38Symbolic Immortality38"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"connectedness. In times like our own when theseinstitutions are in flux, the task for each individual ofmaintaining a sense of immortality becomes vastlymore difficult.Death anxiety becomes overwhelming when onehas to confront it in isolation. Societies and socialinstitutions – when people believe in them – are ableto aid in mastering death anxiety by generatingshared images of continuity beyond the life of eachsingle person. The capacity to live with death isgenerated by available social forms as well as byforms made available by one’s own life.Suicide is therefore never a purely private matter.When a person takes his own life, not only does hedemonstrate his own failure to master death anxiety;he reveals a social failure as well. The society has notmanaged to share with him its symbols of continuity.In committing suicide a person makes a once-and-for-all total effort to master death anxiety.Paradoxically, suicide can be an attempt to assertsymbolic integrity: It is a way of holding to certainprinciples, of actively defining one’s life boundaries,and of affirming value. This is not to say that suicidedoes not result from despair. But to live with despairis one thing; to perform the final act of ending one’slife is another. Suicide can be seen as a kind of falsemastery: One commits suicide when one is unable tolive with the knowledge of death or envision a viableconnection beyond it.That suicide cannot be understood solely as an actof valueless despair is shown by the traditional Jap-anese practice of hara-kiri. In this act of ritual sui-cide, dying with dignity overcomes the humiliationof defeat. In accordance with the samurai code,suicide is an honorable act through which one canmaintain the purity and immortality of one’s nameand country and, in the act of dying, reassert immor-talizing principles. Yukio Mishima, the great Japan-ese novelist, attempted to revive that tradition and toconvey in his recent suicide the message that con-temporary Japan is losing its national essence.Though many found his act of ritual suicide absurd,it had a profound impact on Japanese society.What about other kinds of suicide? Certainly noteveryone who commits suicide lives by so demandinga code as that of the samurai. Nevertheless, a personwho voluntarily ends his life is asserting in a positiveway – although through a negative act – that undercertain conditions life is not endurable. The act ofsuicide thus presumes the presence of some stand-ards as to what a livable life would be. Under ex-treme conditions, such as Nazi extermination camps,suicide could become an assertion of freedom (totake one’s own life rather than to wait to be killed)and even an inspiration for rebellion. For this tohappen, suicide must be associated with a vision oflife renewal beyond the death-dominated moment.Suicide can rarely be the source of such renewal.More characteristically, it is the ultimate failureto master that which can never be completelymastered: death itself. But destructive and self-destructive acts are less likely to be resorted towhen one feels oneself to be animated by a sense ofimmortality.Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 3:59am page 39Robert Jay Lifton and Eric Olson39"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"4The Hour of Our DeathPhilippe Arie`sIn the preface, I explained how I was gradually led toselect certain kinds of documentation: literary, litur-gical, testamentary, epigraphic, and iconographic. Idid not study these documents separately or in anyparticular order. I studied them simultaneously, inthe light of a question that arose in the course of myfirst explorations. My hypothesis, which had alreadybeen proposed by Edgar Morin, was that there was arelationship between man’s attitude toward deathand his awareness of self, of his degree of existence,or simply of his individuality. This is the thread thathas guided me through a dense and confusing mass ofdocuments; this is the idea that has determined theitinerary that I have followed to the end. It is in termsof these questions that the information contained inthe documents has taken on a form and a meaning, acontinuity and a logic. This has been the key that hashelped me to decipher facts otherwise unintelligibleor unrelated.InEssais sur l’historie de la mort, I held to this systemof analysis and interpretation. I have also used it inthe general organization of the present work. It hasinspired the titles of three of the five parts: ‘‘TheTame Death,’’ ‘‘The Death of the Self,’’ and ‘‘TheDeath of the Other.’’ These titles were also suggestedby Vladimir Janke ́le ́vitch in his book on death.But my research for that gave me a greater famil-iarity with the facts, which slightly altered my ori-ginal hypothesis, raised other questions, and openedup other perspectives.

The first is the one thatguided my investigation,awareness of the individual.The others are: thedefense of society against untamednature,belief in an afterlife, andbelief in the existence ofevil.By way of conclusion I shall try to show how thevarious models defined in the course of this book(the tame death, the death of the self, remote andimminent death, the death of the other, and theinvisible death) can be explained in terms of vari-ations on these four themes.The Tame DeathAll four themes appear in the first model of the tamedeath, and all are of equal importance in defining it.Death is not a purely individual act, any more thanlife is. Like every great milestone in life, death iscelebrated by a ceremony that is always more or lesssolemn and whose purpose is to express the individ-ual’s solidarity with his family and community.The three most important moments of this cere-mony are the dying man’s acceptance of his activerole, the scene of the farewells, and the scene ofmourning. The rites in the bedroom or those of theoldest liturgy express the conviction that the life of aman is not an individual destiny but a link in anunbroken chain, the biological continuation of afamily or a line that begins with Adam and includesthe whole human race.One kind of solidarity subordinated the individualto the past and future of the species. Another kindmade him an integral part of his community. Thiscommunity was gathered around the bed where helay; later, in its rites of mourning, it expressed theanxiety caused by the passage of death. The commu-nity was weakened by the loss of one of its members.It expressed the danger it felt; it had to recover itsstrength and unity by means of ceremonies the last ofwhich always had the quality of a holiday, even ajoyous one. Thus, death was not a personal dramabut an ordeal for the community, which was respon-sible for maintaining the continuity of the race.If the community feared the passage of death andfelt the need to recover itself, this was not onlybecause it was weakened by the loss of one of itsmembers. It was also because death – the death of anindividual or the repeated deaths caused by an epi-demic – opened a breach in the defense systemerected against the savagery of nature.From the earliest times man has refused to accepteither sex or death as crude facts of nature. Thenecessity of organizing work and maintaining orderand morality in order to have a peaceful life incommon led society to protect itself from the violentand unpredictable forces of nature. These includedboth external nature, with its intemperate seasonsand sudden accidents, and the internal world of thehuman psyche, which resembles nature in its sud-denness and irregularity; the world of the ecstasy oflove and the agony of death. A state of equilibriumwas achieved and maintained by means of a consciousstrategy to contain and channel the unknown andformidable forces of nature. Death and sex were theweak points in the defense system, because herethere was no clear break in continuity betweenculture and nature. So these activities had to becarefully controlled. The ritualization of death is aspecial aspect of the total strategy of man againstnature, a strategy of prohibitions and concessions.This is why death has not been permitted its naturalextravagance but has been imprisoned in ceremony,transformed into spectacle. This is also why it couldnot be a solitary adventure but had to be a publicphenomenon involving the whole community.The fact that life has an end is not overlooked, butthis end never coincides with physical death. Itdepends on the unknown state of the beyond, thesolidity or ephemerality of survival, the persistenceof memory, the erosion of fame, and the interventionof supernatural beings. Between the moment ofdeath and the end of survival there is an intervalthat Christianity, like the other religions of salvation,has extended to eternity. But in the popular mind theidea of infinite immortality is less important than theidea of an extension. In our first model, the afterlifeis essentially a period of waiting characterized bypeace and repose. In this state the dead wait,according to the promise of the Church, for whatwill be the true end of life, the glorious resurrectionand the life of the world to come.The dead live a diminished life in which the mostdesirable state is sleep, the sleep of the future blessedRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:00am page 41Philippe Arie`s41"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"who have taken the precaution of being buried nearthe saints. Their sleep may be troubled owing totheir own past impiety, the stupidity or treacheryof survivors, or the mysterious laws of nature. In thiscase they cannot rest; they wander and return. Theliving do not mind being close to the dead inchurches, parks, and markets, provided they remainasleep. But it is impossible to forbid these returns; sothey must be regulated, channeled. Society permitsthe dead to return only on certain days set aside bycustom, such as carnivals; then it can control theirpresence and ward off its effects. The Latin Chris-tianity of the early Middle Ages reduced the ancientrisk of their return by installing them among theliving, at the center of public life. The gray ghostsof paganism became the peaceful recumbent figures,whose sleep was likely to remain untroubled thanksto the protection of the Church and the saints;later, thanks to the Masses and prayers said in theirbehalf.This conception of life after death as a state ofrepose or peaceful sleep lasted much longer than onemight believe. It is surely one of the most tenaciousforms of the old attitude toward death.Death may be tamed, divested of the blind vio-lence of natural forces, and ritualized, but it is neverexperienced as a neutral phenomenon. It alwaysremains a misfortune, amal-heur. It is remarkablethat in the old Romance languages physical pain,psychological suffering, grief, crime, punishment,and the reverses of fortune were all expressed bythe same word, derived frommalum, either alone orin combination with other words: in French,malheur,maladie, malchance, le malin(misfortune, illness,mishap, the devil). It was not until later that anattempt was made to distinguish the various mean-ings. In the beginning there was only one evil thathad various aspects: suffering, sin, and death. Chris-tianity explained all of these aspects at once by thedoctrine of original sin. There is probably no othermyth that has such profound roots in the collectiveunconscious. It expressed a universal sense of theconstant presence of evil. Resignation was not,therefore, submission to a benevolent nature, or abiological necessity, as it is today, as it was no doubtamong the Epicureans or Stoics; rather it is therecognition of an evil inseparable from man.The Death of the SelfSuch is the original situation, as defined by therelationship of our four themes. Later, as one ormore of these fundamental elements varied, thesituation changed.The second model, the death of the self, isobtained quite simply by a shift of the sense ofdestiny toward the individual.We recall that the model was originally limited toan elite of rich, educated, and powerful persons inthe eleventh century, and still earlier to the isolated,organized, and exemplary world of monks andcanons. It was in this milieu that the traditionalrelationship between self and other was first over-thrown, and the sense of one’s own identity pre-vailed over submission to the collective destiny.Everyone became separated from the communityand the species by his growing awareness of himself.The individual insisted on assembling the moleculesof his own biography, but only the spark of deathenabled him to fuse them into a whole. A life thusunified acquired an autonomy that placed it apart; itsrelations with others and with society were trans-formed. Friends came to be possessed like objects,while inanimate objects were desired like livingbeings. No doubt the balance sheet of the biographyshould have been closed at the formidable hour ofdeath, but soon it was carried beyond, under thepressure of a desire to be more – something deathcould not touch. These determined men colonizedthe beyond like some new continent, by means ofMasses and pious endowments. The chief instrumentof their enterprise, their guarantee of continuitybetween this world and the next, was the will. Thewill served both to justify the love of earth and tomake an investment in heaven, thanks to the transi-tion of a good death.Individualism triumphed in an age of conversions,spectacular penitences, and prodigious patronage,but also of profitable businesses; an age of unpreced-ented and immediate pleasures and of immoderatelove of life.So much for awareness of the individual. It wasinevitable that such an exaltation of the individual,even if it was more empirical than doctrinal, wouldcause some changes in the third theme, the nature ofRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:00am page 42The Hour of Our Death42"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"the afterlife. The passion for being oneself and forbeing more than was manifested during a singlelifetime spread by contagion to the afterlife. Thestrong individual of the later Middle Ages couldnot be satisfied with the peaceful but passive concep-tion ofrequies. He ceased to be the surviving butsubduedhomo totus. He split into two parts: a bodythat experienced pleasure or pain and an immortalsoul that was released by death. The body disap-peared, pending a resurrection that was accepted asa dogma but never really assimilated at the popularlevel. However, the idea of an immortal soul, theseat of individuality, which had long been cultivatedin the world of clergymen, gradually spread, fromthe eleventh to the seventeenth century, until even-tually it gained almost universal acceptance. Thisnew eschatology caused the worddeathto be re-placed by trite circumlocutions such as ‘‘he gave upthe ghost’’ or ‘‘God has his soul.’’This fully conscious soul was no longer content tosleep the sleep of expectation like thehomo totusofold – or like the poor. Its immortal existence, orrather its immortal activity, expressed the individ-ual’s desire to assert his creative identity in this worldand the next, his refusal to let it dissolve into somebiological or social anonymity. It was a transform-ation of the nature of human existence that may wellexplain the cultural advance of the Latin West at thistime.So the model of the death of the self differs fromthe older model of the tame death with respect totwo of our themes, that of the individual and that ofthe afterlife. The second and fourth parameters, onthe other hand, have hardly moved. Their relativeimmobility protected the model from too sudden achange. It gave it a centuries-old stability that can bedeceptive and that can give the impression that thingshad not changed at all.Our fourth theme, belief in evil, remained virtu-ally unchanged. It was necessary to the economy ofthe will and to the maintenance of a love of life thatwas based partly on an awareness of its fragility. It isobviously an essential element of permanence.The second, defense against nature, might havebeen affected by the changes in the sense of theindividual and of the afterlife. It was certainlythreatened, but its equilibrium was restored.The desire to assert one’s identity and to come toterms with the pleasures of life gave a new andformidable importance to the hour of death men-tioned in theAve Maria, a prayer for a good death thatdates from the end of this period. This could verywell have upset the relationship of the dying man tohis survivors or to society, making death pathetic, asin the romantic era, or solitary, like the death of thehermit, and abolishing the calming ritual that menhad created as a defense against natural death. Deathmight then have become wild and terrifying, becauseof the force of emotion and the fear of hell. But thisdid not happen, because a new and totally oppositeceremony took the place of what had beenthreatened by individualism and its agonies.The deathbed scene, which had once been themost important part of the ceremony, persisted,sometimes with just a touch more pathos, until theseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when thepathetic element declined under the influence of anattitude of mingled acceptance and indifference. Aseries of ceremonies was inserted between death andburial: the funeral procession, which became ecclesi-astical in character, and the service at the church inthe presence of the body, which was the work of theurban reform movement of the late Middle Ages andthe mendicant orders. Death was not abandoned tonature, from which the ancients had claimed it inorder to tame it. On the contrary, death was moreconcealed than ever, for the new rites also included afact that may seem negligible but that is highlysignificant. The face of the cadaver, which had beenexposed to the eyes of the community and whichcontinued to be for a long time in Mediterraneancountries and still is today in Byzantine cultures, wascovered by the successive masks of the sewn shroud,the coffin, and the catafalque or representation.After the fourteenth century, the material coveringof the deceased became a theatrical monument suchas was erected for the decor of mystery plays or forgrand entrances.The phenomenon of the concealment of the bodyand face of the deceased is contemporaneous withthe attempts we find in the macabre arts to representthe underground decay of bodies, the underside oflife, which was all the more bitter because this lifewas so well loved. This interest was transitory, butRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:00am page 43Philippe Arie`s43"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"the concealment of the body was permanent. Thefeatures of the deceased, once calmly accepted, werehenceforth covered because they might be upsetting,that is, frightening. The defense against untamednature was invaded by a new fear, but this fear wasimmediately overcome by the taboo to which it gaverise. Once the body was conjured away by thecatafalque or representation, the old familiaritywith death was restored and everything returned tonormal.The definitive concealment of the body and theprolonged use of the will are the two most significantelements of the model of the death of the self. Thefirst balances the second, maintaining the traditionalorder of death against the pathos and nostalgia of theindividualism illustrated by the will.Remote and Imminent DeathThis model of the death of the self, with all that itpreserved in the way of traditional defenses and asense of evil, influenced customs until the eighteenthcentury. However, profound changes were beginningto take place by the end of the sixteenth century, tosome extent in actual customs and conscious ideas,but more especially in the secret world of the im-agination. These changes, although barely percep-tible, are very important. A vast transformation ofsensibility was under way. The beginning of a rever-sal – a remote and imperfect adumbration of thegreat reversal of today – was starting to appear inrepresentations of death.Where death had once been immediate, familiar,and tame, it gradually began to be surreptitious,violent, and savage. Already, as we have seen, theold familiarity had been maintained only by means ofthe artifices of the later Middle Ages: more solemnrites and the camouflage of the body under therepresentation.In the modern era, death, by its very remoteness,has become fascinating; has aroused the same strangecuriosity, the same fantasies, the same perverse de-viations and eroticism, which is why this model ofdeath is called ‘‘remote and imminent death.’’What was stirring in the depths of the collectiveunconscious is something that had hardly moved atall for thousands of years, our second theme, thedefense against nature. Death, once tame, was nowpreparing its return to the savage state. It was adiscontinuous movement, made up of violent jolts,long imperceptible advances, and real or apparentretreats.At first sight it may seem surprising that thisperiod of returning savagery was also characterizedby the rise of rationalism, the rise of science andtechnology, and by faith in progress and its triumphover nature.But it was at this time that the barriers patientlymaintained for thousands of years in order to containnature gave way at two points that are similar andoften confused: love and death. Beyond a certainthreshold, pain and pleasure, agony and orgasm areone, as illustrated by the myth of the erection of thehanged man. These emotions associated with theedge of the abyss inspire desire and fear. An earlymanifestation of the great modern fear of death nowappears for the first time: the fear of being buriedalive, which implies the conviction that there is animpure and reversible state that partakes of both lifeand death.This fear might have developed and spread and,combined with other effects of the civilization of theEnlightenment, given birth (over a century ahead oftime) to our culture. This is not the first time that thelate eighteenth century seems to lead directly intothe twentieth. But instead, something happened thatcould not have been foreseen and that restored theactual chronology.The Death of the OtherIf the momentum really did carry from the eight-eenth to the twentieth century, it hardly seemsthat way to the unsophisticated observer. The con-tinuity exists on deeper levels, but only rarely does itshow above the surface. This is because in the nine-teenth century, which saw the triumph of the indus-trial and agricultural techniques born of the scientificthought of the previous period, romanticism (theword is convenient) gave birth to a sensibility char-acterized by passions without limit or reason. Arevolution in feeling seized the West and shookit to its foundation. All four of our themes weretransformed.Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:00am page 44The Hour of Our Death44"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The determining factor was the change in thefirst theme, the sense of the individual. Up to nowthis theme had alternated between two extremes:the sense of a universal and common destiny and thesense of a personal and specific biography. In thenineteenth century both of these declined in favor ofa third sense, formerly confused with the first two:the sense of the other. But this was not just any other.Affectivity, formerly diffuse, was henceforth concen-trated on a few rare beings whose disappearancecould no longer be tolerated and caused a dramaticcrisis: the death of the other. It was a revolution infeeling that was just as important to history as therelated revolutions in ideas, politics, industry, socio-economic conditions, or demography.An original type of sensibility now came to dom-inate all others, a type that is well expressed by theEnglish wordprivacy. It found its place in the nuclearfamily, remodeled by its new function of absoluteaffectivity. The family replaced both the traditionalcommunity and the individual of the late MiddleAges and early modern times. Privacy is distin-guished both from individualism and from the senseof community, and expresses a mode of relating toothers that is quite specific and original.Under these conditions, the death of the self hadlost its meaning. The fear of death, born of thefantasies of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,was transferred from the self to the other, the lovedone.The death of the other aroused a pathos that hadonce been repressed. The ceremonies of the bed-room or of mourning, which had once been used as abarrier to counteract excess emotion – or indiffer-ence – were deritualized and presented as the spon-taneous expression of the grief of the survivors. Butwhat the survivors mourned was no longer the factof dying but the physical separation from the de-ceased. On the contrary, death now ceased to be sad.It was exalted as a moment to be desired. Untamednature invaded the stronghold of culture, where itencountered humanized nature and merged with it inthe compromise of ‘‘beauty.’’ Death was no longerfamiliar and tame, as in traditional societies, butneither was it absolutely wild. It had become movingand beautiful like nature, like the immensity ofnature, the sea or the moors. The compromise ofbeauty was the last obstacle invented to channel animmoderate emotion that had swept away the oldbarriers. It was an obstacle that was also a conces-sion, for it restored to this phenomenon that peoplehad tried to diminish an extraordinary glamour.But death could not have appeared in the guise ofthe highest beauty if it had not ceased to be associatedwith evil. The ancient and intimate relationship be-tween death and physical illness, psychic pain, andsin was beginning to break down. Our fourth theme,the belief in evil, which had long been stationary, waspreparing to withdraw, and the first stronghold itdeserted was the heart and the mind of man, whichwas believed to be its original and impregnable seat.What a revolution in thought! It is a phenomenon asimportant as the return of untamed nature within thehuman psyche, and indeed, the two are related; it isas if evil and nature had changed places.The first barrier that fell in the eighteenth century– perhaps as early as the seventeenth in England –was belief in hell and in the connection betweendeath and sin or spiritual punishment. (The necessityof physical illness was not yet questioned.) Scholarlythought and theology raised the problem as early asthe eighteenth century. By the beginning of thenineteenth century, the debate in Catholic and Pur-itan cultures was over; belief in hell had disappeared.It was no longer conceivable that the dear departedcould run such a risk. At most, among Catholics,there still existed a method of purification: time inpurgatory, shortened by the pious solicitude of sur-vivors. No sense of guilt, no fear of the beyondremained to counteract the fascination of death,transformed into the highest beauty.If hell is gone, heaven has changed too; this is ourthird theme, the afterlife. We have followed the slowtransition from the sleep of thehomo totusto the gloryof the immortal soul. The nineteenth century sawthe triumph of another image of the beyond. Thenext world becomes the scene of the reunion ofthose whom death has separated but who havenever accepted this separation: a re-creation of theaffections of earth, purged of their dross, assured ofeternity. It is the paradise of Christians or the astralworld of spiritualists and psychics. But it is also theworld of the memories of nonbelievers and free-thinkers who deny the reality of a life after death.Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:00am page 45Philippe Arie`s45"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"In the piety of their love, they preserve the memoriesof their departed with an intensity equal to therealistic afterlife of Christians or psychics. The dif-ference in doctrine between these two groups maybe great, but it becomes negligible in the practice ofwhat may be called the cult of the dead. They have allbuilt the same castle, in the image of earthly homes,where they will be reunited – in dream or in reality,who knows? – with those whom they have neverceased to love.The Invisible DeathIn the nineteenth century the psychological land-scape was completely transformed. Neither thenature of the four themes nor the relationshipsamong them were the same. The situation thatresulted did not last more than a century and ahalf. But the model of death that came next, ourmodel, which I have called the invisible death, doesnot challenge the underlying tendency or the struc-tural character of the changes of the nineteenthcentury. It continues them, even if it seems to con-tradict them in its most spectacular effects. It is as ifbeyond a certain threshold, these tendencies pro-duced the opposite effects.Our contemporary model of death is still deter-mined by the sense of privacy, but it has becomemore rigorous, more demanding. It is often said thatthe sense of privacy is declining. This is because todaywe demand the perfection of the absolute; we toler-ate none of the compromises that romantic societystill accepted beneath its rhetoric – or beneath itshypocrisy, as we would say. Intimacy must be eithertotal or nonexistent. There is no middle groundbetween success and failure. It is possible that ourattitude toward life is dominated by the certainty offailure. On the other hand, our attitude toward deathis defined by the impossible hypothesis of success.That is why it makes no sense.The modern attitude toward death is an extensionof the affectivity of the nineteenth century. The lastinspiration of this inventive affectivity was to protectthe dying or the invalid from his own emotions byconcealing the seriousness of his condition until theend. When the dying man discovered the piousgame, he lent himself to it so as not to disappointthe other’s solicitude. The dying man’s relations withthose around him were now determined by a respectfor this loving lie.In order for the dying man, his entourage, and thesociety that observed them to consent to this situ-ation, the protection of the patient had to outweighthe joys of a last communion with him. Let us notforget that in the nineteenth century, death, byvirtue of its beauty, had become an occasion for themost perfect union between the one leaving andthose remaining behind. The last communion withGod and/or with others was the great privilege ofthe dying. For centuries there was no question ofdepriving them of this privilege. But when the liewas maintained to the end, it eliminated this com-munion and its joys. Even when it was reciprocal andconspiratorial, the lie destroyed the spontaneity andpathos of the last moments.Actually, the intimacy of these final exchanges hadalready been poisoned, first by the ugliness of dis-ease, and later by the transfer to the hospital. Deathbecame dirty, and then it became medicalized. Thehorror and fascination of death had fixed themselvesfor a moment on the apparent death and had thenbeen sublimated by the beauty of the Last Commu-nion. But the horror returned, without the fascin-ation, in the repellent form of the serious illness andthe care it required.When the last of the traditional defenses againstdeath and sex gave way, the medical profession couldhave taken over the role of the community. It did soin the case of sex, as is attested by the medicalliterature on masturbation. It tried to do so in thecase of death by isolating it in the scientific labora-tory and the hospital, from which the emotionswould be banished. Under these conditions it wasbetter to communicate silently in the complicity of amutual lie.It is obvious that the sense of the individual and hisidentity, what we mean when we speak of ‘‘possess-ing one’s own death,’’ has been overcome by thesolicitude of the family.But how are we to explain the abdication of thecommunity? How has the community come to re-verse its role and to forbid the mourning which itwas responsible for imposing until the twentiethcentury? The answer is that the community feelsRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:00am page 46The Hour of Our Death46"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"less and less involved in the death of one of itsmembers. First, because it no longer thinks it neces-sary to defend itself against a nature which has beendomesticated once and for all by the advance oftechnology, especially medical technology. Next,because it no longer has a sufficient sense of solidar-ity; it has actually abandoned responsibility for theorganization of collective life. The community in thetraditional sense of the word no longer exists. It hasbeen replaced by an enormous mass of atomizedindividuals.But if this disappearance explains one abdication,it does not explain the powerful resurgence of otherprohibitions. This vast and formless mass that we callsociety is, as we know, maintained and motivated bya new system of constraints and controls. It is alsosubject to irresistible movements that put it in a stateof crisis and impose a transitory unity of aggressionor denial. One of these movements has unified masssociety against death. More precisely, it has ledsociety to be ashamed of death, more ashamed thanafraid, to behave as if death did not exist. If the senseof the other, which is a form of the sense of the selftaken to its logical conclusion, is the first cause of thepresent state of death, then shame – and the resultingtaboo – is the second.But this shame is a direct consequence of thedefinitive retreat of evil. As early as the eighteenthcentury, man had begun to reduce the power ofthe devil, to question his reality. Hell was aban-doned, at least in the case of relatives and dearfriends, the only people who counted. Along withhell went sin and all the varieties of spiritual andmoral evil. They were no longer regarded as partof human nature but as social problems that couldbe eliminated by a good system of supervisionand punishment. The general advance of science,morality, and organization would lead quite easilyto happiness. But in the middle of the nineteenthcentury, there was still the obstacle of physical illnessand death. There was no question of eliminatingthat. The romantics circumvented or assimilated it.They beautified death, the gateway to an anthropo-morphic beyond. They preserved its immemorialassociation with illness, pain, and agony; these thingsaroused pity rather than distaste. The trouble beganwith distaste: Before people thought of abolishingphysical illness, they ceased to tolerate its sight,sounds, and smells.Medicine reduced pain; it even succeeded in elim-inating it altogether. The goal glimpsed in the eight-eenth century had almost been reached. Evil was nolonger part of human nature, as the religions, espe-cially Christianity, believed. It still existed, ofcourse, but outside of man, in certain marginalspaces that morality and politics had not yet colon-ized, in certain deviant behaviors such as war, crime,and nonconformity, which had not yet been cor-rected but which would one day be eliminated bysociety just as illness and pain had been eliminatedby medicine.But if there is no more evil, what do we do aboutdeath? To this question modern society offers twoanswers.The first is a massive admission of defeat. Weignore the existence of a scandal that we have beenunable to prevent; we act as if it did not exist, andthus mercilessly force the bereaved to say nothing. Aheavy silence has fallen over the subject of death.When this silence is broken, as it sometimes is inAmerica today, it is to reduce death to the insignifi-cance of an ordinary event that is mentioned withfeigned indifference. Either way, the result is thesame: Neither the individual nor the community isstrong enough to recognize the existence of death.And yet this attitude has not annihilated death orthe fear of death. On the contrary, it has allowed theold savagery to creep back under the mask of medicaltechnology. The death of the patient in the hospital,covered with tubes, is becoming a popular image,more terrifying than thetransior skeleton of macabrerhetoric. There seems to be a correlation betweenthe ‘‘evacuation’’ of death, the last refuge of evil, andthe return of this same death, no longer tame. Thisshould not surprise us. The belief in evil was neces-sary to the taming of death; the disappearance of thebelief has restored death to its savage state.A small elite of anthropologists, psychologists,and sociologists has been struck by this contradic-tion. They propose not so much to ‘‘evacuate’’deathas to humanize it. They acknowledge the necessity ofdeath, but they want it to be accepted and no longershameful.

Imaginationsimply offers too many reasons when one tries toaccount for the absence of things. But the questionmay set an historical trap which might be even moredangerous. Students of death in contemporary societyappear to agree on the fact that modern man ‘‘sup-presses’’ thinking about death.2It is tempting to see inanthropology an accomplice of presumed societalinterests in suppressing death. The possibility cannotbe ruled out since it has been demonstrated for otherissues and areas such as colonialism, racial discrimin-ation and the control of the poor (although thereremain founded claims to the contrary). But to trans-pose attempts at understanding to the level of ethical-moral accusations (and confessions) is the worst kindof obfuscation that can be perpetrated on any intellec-tual enterprise, since it can only create self-righteous-ness, not self-understanding.Hope for clarification and critical examinationwould seem to lie in our ability to relate our negativerhetorical question to positive barriers to communi-cation, to practical impediments and normative pro-hibitions. It will be the contention of this paper that,while some of these may be understood as directreflexes of a present social context, others – andmore important ones – will have to be sought in theintellectual history of the discipline and in the historyof the use to which anthropological findings havebeen put in other contexts, notably in philosophical,psychological and sociological approaches to death inmodern society.IIOur attempt to understand that development will beguided by the following thesis: Much like the con-cept of culture, approaches to death in anthropologyhave undergone a process of parochialization. Par-ochialization has had the effect of eliminating a tran-scendental and universal conception of the problem.‘‘Death’’ (in the singular) has ceased to be a problemof anthropological inquiry; there are only deaths andforms of death-related behavior.In his essay on ‘‘Matthew Arnold, E. B. Tylor, andthe Uses of Invention,’’ George W. Stocking revealed– and debunked – one of anthropology’s favoritemyths: that Tylor with his definition of culture (in1871) became the father of modern anthropology inthe sense that he provided the discipline with itsrelativist and strictly scientific foundations. He issupposed to have brought the study of culture outof a haze of humanist appreciation of human achieve-ments into the light of non-evaluative, systematicinvestigations of man’s cultural products. ButStocking maintains:Far from defining its modern anthropological meaning,he simply took the contemporary humanist idea ofculture and fitted it into the framework of progressivesocial evolutionism.3The humanist idea of culture and the notion of socialevolutionism are the reference points between whichwe have to place the origins of a transformation ofanthropological inquiry into death. J. G. Frazerclearly combined them when he wrote in one ofthe introductory chapters to hisThe Belief in Immor-tality:4The problem of death has very naturally exercised theminds of men in all ages. Unlike so many problemswhich interest only a few solitary thinkers, this concernsus all alike.But from a humanist ‘‘us’’ he imperceptibly switchesto an evolutionist ‘‘they’’:Some of their solutions of the problem, though dressedout in all the beauty of exquisite language andpoetic imagery, singularly resemble the rude guessesof savages.For Tylor and Frazer alike, evolutionism remained aframe of self-identification, a means of locating one’sown society at the peak of human intellectual devel-opment. In a seemingly paradoxical way this resultedin steering anthropological inquiry away from uni-versal problems of human existence to concern withparticular products of evolution. For Frazer theRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:00ampage 50How Others Die: Reflections on the Anthropology of Death50"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"‘‘problem of death’’ became a matter of studyingparticular savage customs, leading him to embarkon one of histours de forcearound the ethnographicglobe.5A further step in the parochialization of anthropo-logical inquiry can be recognized in the positionFranz Boas developed in violent opposition to evolu-tionism (and therefore inevitably accepting many ofits tenets). Boas shared with Tylor and Frazer a viewof the importance of ‘‘customs’’ in the study ofculture and human thought, but he was concernedwith their ‘‘tyranny’’ rather than their curiosity value.As Stocking notes, this in fact led to an identificationof culture with folklore, a profound change in con-cept.6Once the anthropological concept of culturehad lost its universal (albeit elitist) character, it wasclear that the discipline simply no longer had atheoretical plane on which to face challenges suchas the problem of death. Anthropologists had ceasedto answer for humanity; their investigations had leftthe field of tension which is created when particularphenomena are related to universal concepts or pro-cesses (be it the 18th century’s Natural Law, theGeistof the romantics, the natural laws of evolution, oreven the Universal History of the diffusionists).Having lost a universal frame of inquiry, questionshaving to do with the nature and meaning of deathhad to be implanted (if not buried, if the pun bepermitted) in various parochial ‘‘units’’ of researchwhich came to replace that frame. In fact, Hertz’sclassical study, ‘‘Contribution a`une e ́tude sur larepre ́sentation collective de la mort’’ (see note 21),conceived in the line of Durkheim’s powerful attemptto base a universal theory of knowledge on a paro-chial conception of the social nature of man, hasremained the last generally significant contributionto guide social anthropological research (and eventhat one has been largely outside the horizon ofAnglo-American anthropology until its recent recep-tion in a translation).To be sure, classical authors of modern anthropol-ogy continued to assert convictions of their prede-cessors. Echoing Tylor and Frazer, B. Malinowskiadmits that these ‘‘orthodox views’’ of the experi-ence of death as the core of primitive religiosity ‘‘areon the whole correct.’’ There is at least a core of anearlier universalism preserved when he states:Even among the most primitive peoples, the attitudetowards death is infinitely more complex and, I mayadd, more akin to our own, than is usually assumed.But all this must be seen in the perspective of his owntheoretical progress beyond ‘‘orthodox views.’’ Mal-inowski was among those who advanced a parochia-lization of anthropological inquiry by first isolatingreligion from intellectual life in general:Thus the belief in immortality is the result of a deepemotional revelation, standardized by religion, ratherthan a primitive philosophic doctrine.That was a radical departure from Tylor’s views.Secondly, there is Malinowski’s idea of religiousceremonies addressed to the experience of death as‘‘self-contained acts, the aim of which is achieved intheir very performance,’’ which, lastly, led him todefine the scope of anthropological inquiry in a waythat has remained exemplary:The ceremonial of death which ties the survivors to thebody and rivets them to the place of death, the beliefsin the existence of the spirit, in its beneficent influ-ences or malevolent intention, in the duties of a seriesof commemorative or sacrificial ceremonies – in allthis religion counteracts the centrifugal forces of fear,dismay, demoralization, and provides the most power-ful means of reintegration of the group’s shaken soli-darity and of the re-establishment of its morale.7Later criticism and quite important modifications8notwithstanding, this encapsulation of the experi-ence of death in self-contained acts, performed forthe sake of a self-containing social unit, had theintellectually disastrous effect of opening to anthro-pology an easy escape from the ‘‘supreme dilemma oflife and final death’’ (Malinowski). The argument isthis: Beyond all differences in theoretical and meth-odological inclination, social-cultural anthropolo-gists may be presumed to be students of humanbehavior inasmuch as it is determined by culturalorientations (among other things). Death as an eventis the termination of individual behavior. Thereforethere cannot be an anthropological study of death,but only of behavior toward death as it affects thosewho survive. It must be a study of ‘‘how others die’’Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:00ampage 51Johannes Fabian51"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"in more than one sense: examining the reactions ofsurvivors and interpreting these reactions throughceremonies, ritual practices, ideological rationaliza-tions – in short, as ‘‘folklore.’’ Whether this isintended or not, death-related behavior will thenbe placed at a safe distance from the core of one’sown society.9I hasten to emphasize that this is not the wholestory, although it describes the most influentialorientations10in the discipline. We should give rec-ognition to dissenting views11and examine the pos-sibilities of an anthropology of death which faces,rather than escapes from, the ‘‘supreme dilemma.’’But first we must consider yet another context inwhich anthropological inquiry into death appears tohave been forced into the position of a spectator of,rather than participant in, social reality. We should atleast note that in this context we are unable to dojustice to a more profound theoretical issue concern-ing an epistemological conception of ‘‘the other.’’ Itis raised by Donald T. Campbell in his discussion ofthe foundations of behaviorist versus introspectivepsychology. Similarly, our cursory sketch of theparochialization and folklorization of anthropologicalinquiry should not give the impression that thenotion of ‘‘primitive’’ otherness has always and ne-cessarily had a stultifying effect. On the contrary, inthe tradition of the Enlightenmentphilosophes, an-thropologists such as Le ́vi-Strauss (see section V ofthis paper) and Diamond have employed it in acritical fashion. As Diamond argued, ‘‘the authentichistorian [which is what he thinks an anthropologistmust be]. . . . approaches other societies in othertimes with the confidence that his humanity is equalto the task of registeringdifferences. And that, thoughnot the only element, is thecriticalone in all humancommunication.’’12IIIIn one form of the Roman games (themunera), alienand exotic people were put to death by other exoticpeople or animals. Similarly, fascination with thecurious, the violent, and the exotic seems to be thearena assigned to the use of anthropological studiesof death by analysts of contemporary personality andsociety. Among the many examples that could beadduced to support that observation. I should like topoint to Talcott Parsons. In his essay, ‘‘TheoreticalDevelopment of the Sociology of Religion’’ (firstpublished in 1944), as well as inThe Social System,itis the problem of death which causes him to turn toMalinowski’s ‘‘classic analysis’’ of Trobriand funeralrites, and to W. L. Warner, E. E. Evans-Pritchardand C. Kluckhohn and their studies of death inrelation to witchcraft. The point is that here theissue of death is not one among many occasions toturn to anthropology but, with few exceptions, theonly one.13While our metaphorical allusion to the Romangames14captures much of the rationale for appealingto anthropological studies of death-folklore, weshould not overlook a number of theoretical reasonswhich led investigators of death in modern society toassume the role of spectators of the ‘‘primitive.’’Most importantly, the turn from the ‘‘us’’ to the‘‘they’’ was taken by anthropologists themselves, aswe tried to show in the preceding section. In part itwas dictated by their basic evolutionary perspective,by that imperceptible transformation of culture intofolklore, and by all sorts of murky mixtures of racismand colonialism which, often unconsciously, imposedthemselves on seemingly objective analyses. Butthese tendencies appear to have been reinforcedand codified when philosophers, psychologists andsociologists put ethnographic reports to use in theirown approaches to death. ‘‘Primitive’’ reactions todeath may then be consulted for the purpose ofilluminating ontogenetic development with parallelsfrom man’s early history.15Or, more frequently, wewill find attempts to identify contemporary reactionsto death, especially those that appear irrational,overly ritual and picturesque, as survivals of ‘‘ar-chaic’’ forms. However, essentially the same connec-tion may be made for an inverse argument: that whatis wrong with modern man’s relation to death is theabsence or suppression of these ancient ways ofcoping with its threat. Usually without critical exam-ination, these ‘‘primitive’’ reactions to death areplaced in the domain of religion (which in turn istaken to constitute a self-contained aspect of humanactivity) and this makes it possible to replace thegeneral evolutionist perspective with a view of‘‘secularization,’’ religious devolution, as an intrinsicRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:00ampage 52How Others Die: Reflections on the Anthropology of Death52"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"component of modernity. Primitive and folkloricdeath-customs may then be located in a nostalgicpast – which is yet another way of relegating reac-tions to death to ‘‘the others,’’ or at least the otherthat has survived in us . . .Werner Fuchs published a study entitledImages ofDeath in Modern Society16in which he offers a tantal-izing combination of astute criticism and simpleacceptance of the very syndrome we are trying todescribe. His point of departure is an observationwhich, I am sure, must be rather disconcerting tomodern social-scientific students of death. Uponcloser examination, it turns out that sociologistsand psychologists who make ‘‘suppression’’ of deaththe cardinal topic of their analyses (here he refers toFulton and Gorer) are in fact arguing very much likeChristian theologians who lament modern man’sapparent indifference to death. The suppression hy-pothesis, Fuchs argues, is an interpretation sup-ported more by interests in preserving thevanishing influence of religious institutions than byempirical facts (pp. 7–14). In his own approach hedissociates himself from such conservative culture-criticism for which death has become the ‘‘lasttrump’’ (p. 8) against secular, industrial society. Onthe one hand he rejects the idea of death as a con-stant; on biological as well as social grounds it can beshown that man’s increasing power over nature hasmade such a notion obsolete. On the other hand hetakes it upon himself to demonstrate that modernman does not simply suppress his reactions to death.He may submit to death as a fact, but he has pre-served many of the ancient ways, symbolic andritual, of coping with that experience. This is thepoint where he is compelled to turn to anthropo-logical studies of primitive death-lore in order tocreate a background and contrast for his views of thegenesis of modern images (pp. 26–50). There is noneed for us to criticize extensively his use of anthro-pological concepts and findings, for he himself an-ticipates objections when he admits to the analogousand abstract nature of his arguments (e.g., pp. 26 f.,50 f.). It suffices to point out some of those asser-tions which we take to confirm our thesis that an-thropological studies of death have been, by andlarge, assigned the role of providing the exotic‘‘other’’ to the sociologist’s ‘‘we.’’First we find, as expected, the ‘‘folklorization’’ ofprimitive culture in a formulation worth quoting atlength:It stands to reason that in primitive societies such ideas[of death] will not be found as opinions and attitudesbut always closely linked to the institutional field inwhich death is symbolized. Images of death in primi-tive societies can hardly be identified as relativelyindependent intellectualizations [als Geistiges] but onlyin and with social institutions in which the groupattempts to socialize death. (p. 38)Secondly, Fuchs is compelled – by his assumptionthat emerging modern images are determined bynotions of a ‘‘natural’’ and ‘‘peaceful’’ death – toproject into primitive reactions the violence wewould expect to be associated with the exotic spec-tacle of dying: primitive man related to nature not bymastering it, but through ‘‘magical’’ interpretation(pp. 46 ff.); the helplessness and oppressive nature ofprimitive socialization in turn resulted in violence(p. 47). The mere frequency of violent death musthave led to a kind of confusion between dying andkilling (pp. 48 ff.). Death is experienced as interactionand hence can be induced by social agents (e.g., in theforms of Voodoo death and similar phenomena,p. 49). It would be easy to show that speculations ofthat kind are not at all borne out by what presentanthropology and prehistoric archeology tell us aboutthe ecological adaptations of ‘‘primitive’’ man or therole of violence and the history of warfare. In any case,Fuchs’ argument must be read backwards. Primitivereactions to death are bound to be seen as magic-exotic and violent because they serve as points ofdeparture in a series of developments toward ‘‘ra-tional’’ (natural and peaceful) images of death.Appeals to anthropological findings in this studyand in many comparable ones have little more thanprojective value. They express more about the spec-tators than about those who are being watched.IVIt appears that progress in understanding will dependon our ability to free the notion of death from itsencapsulation in behavior, custom and folklore andto restore the experience of the termination ofRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:00ampage 53Johannes Fabian53"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"individual life to its full problematic status. Thiswould call for an anthropology for which socialreality and subjective participation in that realityare irreducible conceptual poles of inquiry. Onewould have to reject the use of anthropologicalresearch for the sole purpose of illustrating ‘‘sociali-zations’’ of death, especially all those utilizations ofethnography in which theanalyticalnotion of social-ization is transformed intoprogrammaticsocialization,i.e., into support for contemporary recipes forcoping with death.17To pose social and individualreality as irreducible conceptual poles implies thatthe thrust of anthropological inquiry must bedirected toward ‘‘mediations’’ between them.Above all, it entails an epistemological orientationwhich approaches conceptualizations and institutio-nalizations of death experience asprocesses, as pro-ductive ‘‘constructions of reality’’ rather thandisembodied schemes of logic or social control.Without trying to suggest systematic connectionswhere there are none, we shall explore a number ofintellectual contexts in which we see the potentialfor such processual approaches. First, however, weshall take up the case of modern prehistoric arche-ology since it may help us to determine more exactlywhat we are looking for.More than twenty years ago, Edgar Morin beganhisanthropologie de la mortby observing that researchin the process of hominization has been guided bytwo important kinds of evidence: the use of tools,and the burial of the dead (Morin,op. cit., pp. 19 ff.).In the decades that followed, our image of early manhas undergone considerable change. The timespanallotted to the process of hominization has beenenormously expanded and at the same time formergeneric distinctions, often based on the scantiestevidence, have become blurred. Today, ‘‘Neander-thal’’ man, at first codified as theUrmenschin evolu-tionaryscientificclassificationandpopulariconography, turns out to be a much closer relativeof modern man than we ever expected. Neverthe-less, evidence for burials has lost little of its theoret-ical importance. It may no longer be invoked as‘‘proof’’ for achieved hominization since such anotion has become meaningless, but it has retainedits crucial role as a phenomenon involved in homi-nization as a process. Thus in a recent analysis ofMousterian and Upper Paleolithic materials, Sally R.Binford sees in burials evidence for ‘‘new forms ofsocial organization,’’ ‘‘leading to the appearance offully modern man.’’18Of course, prehistoric archeology has been andwill be under severe limitations due to the precar-ious nature of preserved evidence, no matter howmuch progress is made in the quantitative analysis ofeven the tiniest bits of data. Edgar Morin rightlycautioned against the ‘‘platitudes’’ which might bederived from a suggestive association of tool use andburial rites, i.e., of technology and symbolic activity.There is little use, he argues, in declaring that thetool humanizes nature and that notions of an afterlifehumanize death, as long as the ‘‘human’’ remains aconcept suspended in thin air. Rather, one shouldstart with the assumption that ‘‘death, as does thetool, affirms the individual; it prolongs it in time asthe tool extends it in space; (and the assumption)that it, too, strains to adapt man to the world and, byvirtue of that, expresses the same lack of adaptationof man to the world, and the same conqueringpotential of man in relationship to the world’’ (op.cit., p. 20). It is easy to see that modern prehistoricresearch with its fixation on linear ‘‘adaptation’’would react uneasily to so paradoxical a proposition.Yet it is because Morin accepts the epistemologicalframe we sketched earlier that his evaluation ofprehistoric evidence does not take the folkloricturn. Notions of death and afterlife are not merelyseen as customary expressions of man’s functionalconquest of death. Death, he maintains, ‘‘is assimi-lated to life’’ and filled with ‘‘metaphors of life’’ andritual action based on and elaborating these meta-phors, is action which ‘‘modifies the normal order oflife’’ and reveals in the prehistoric and ethnologicalmaterial a ‘‘realistic consciousness of death’’ (op. cit.,p. 22).There is no sign that these propositions weretaken up in the theoretical development of prehis-toric research on burial customs. On the contrary,one can observe an increasing functionalization ofburial evidence, making it more and more derivativeof socio-economic relationships (while preserving itsmethodological importance).19All this amounts to atheoretical ‘‘socialization’’ of death in man’s earlyhistory. The theoretical counter-part of such func-Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:00ampage 54How Others Die: Reflections on the Anthropology of Death54"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"tionalization, by the way, seems to be an almostphobic avoidance of ‘‘catastrophism,’’ i.e., of theviolent, sudden termination of certain societies orcultural traditions as an explanation for discontinu-ities in the archeological record. While contempor-ary society seriously contemplates (and inflicts)societal death in war, in the nuclear threat andin the doom of ecological catastrophe, the NewArcheologists appear to picture man’s early historyas continuous adaptation and growth within whichindividual as well as societal death is entirely subor-dinate to processes of social differentiation andultimately to the law of selection. ‘‘Death asthe servant of life’’ is a notion which places neoe-volutionary theory in a curious vicinity to evolution-ary theology, old (as in Smyth’sDeath and Evolution)and new (as in Teilhard de Chardin’s all-embracingvisions). If these observations are correct, thenthey suggest an interesting counterpoint to a ten-dency noted earlier. Whereas analysts of con-temporary man and society project exotic, andoften violent images of death into the humanpast, students of that human past offer naturalistic,adaptive and systematic explanations which are incontrast to the erratic and violent preoccupationsof contemporary society. With this, the generalcontention of this paper – that the historical devel-opment of anthropological inquiry into death hashad a self-cancelling effect – acquires yet anotherdimension.Our interpretation would of course be unfair andoutright wrong if we should leave the impressionthat nothing was gained in the course of that history.‘‘Folklorization’’ and functionalization of primitiveculture have produced an impressive number ofdetailed reports on human reactions to death. Evi-dence for variation as well as for the persistence ofcertain general themes should make it once andforever impossible to revert to anemic, abstractnotions of a gradual evolution ‘‘away from death.’’Nevertheless there remains the task of placing theproblem of death back into the context of a ‘‘we,’’ ofits universal significance as well as its particularexpressions, of its unmitigated threat as well asits achieved domestications. To achieve that trans-position it will not suffice to revive theTotentanzmotif of death as the great equalizer. Rather, weshall have to explore and develop the avenueswhich the discipline provides for breaching the gapscreated by self-inflicted parochialization and im-posed exoticism.VFrom the vantage point from which this essay is beingwritten – contemporary anthropology in its more‘‘humanist’’ and historical-critical orientations –there appear several theoretical confluents with apotential for leading an anthropology of deathbeyond its present confines. None of them iswithout predecessors in the history of the socialsciences; their innovative power at the presenttime rests with the challenge they can bring againstthose entrenched tendencies we have tried to char-acterize.The first example I find is Le ́vi-Strauss’ radicalstructuralism. He, more than anyone else among theleading figures in current anthropology, has preparedthe way back from a folklorized ethnography of deathinto investigations of its universal significance. Tocite but one statement of his:When an exotic custom fascinates us in spite of (or onaccount of ) its apparent singularity, it is generallybecause it presents us with a distorted reflection of afamiliar image, which we confusedly recognize as suchwithout yet managing to identify it.20Written in a tradition which had produced one of theclassical studies of the problem,21Le ́vi-Strauss’TheSavage Mindaddresses itself to the issue of death inthree contexts: the elementary contrast of life anddeath as expressed in the symbolic use of color-contrasts (pp. 64 f.), the role of names in markingan individual’s position in a community consisting oflivinganddead (pp. 191 ff.), and the significanceof material reminders of the dead in providing ‘‘con-tact with pure historicity’’ (p. 242; see alsopp. 236 ff.). Far from being relegated to the functionof opening comforting, self-contained ritual escapes,death-related customs are in this system analyzed ascrucial evidence for the constitution of the ‘‘savagemind’’ (which, it will be remembered, is studied notas a defective but as a pure form of the human mind).Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:00ampage 55Johannes Fabian55"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"In each case death is seen as themediatorbetween theliving and the dead and is given a seminal role inthe construction of those systems of classificationwhich govern man’s natural, social and historicaluniverses. The existentialist critic may resent theintellectualist and seemingly abstract character ofthat notion of death. But it is one which restoresthe universal significance of primitive conceptionsof death (many of which Le ́vi-Strauss sees realized inhis own society, cf. pp. 200 f., 238 f.). His investi-gations are addressed to all of humanity, and espe-cially the chapter on names, bearing the intriguingtitle ‘‘The individual as a species’’ (Ch. 7, pp. 191–216) could be read as a commentary to Marx’senigmatic statement with which we prefaced thispaper.Objections have been raised against Le ́vi-Straus-sian structuralism in general and, implicitly orexplicitly, against the analyses we alluded to.Some concern his empirical basis, others the epi-stemological foundations of his thought and yetothers his ways with ‘‘structuralism.’’ We sharemany of them and we are inclined to express themwith more conviction the closer they relate toour own areas of competence. Yet it takes a tasklike the present one to recognize the powerand potential which the structuralist trend in anthro-pology (at least in its original intentions) mighthave for undoing the parochialization of inquiryand the folklorization of culture we perceived asmajor obstacles to a non-trivial anthropology ofdeath. For what it is worth, we may add a quotationfrom Le ́vi-Strauss which contains the startling prop-osition that anthropology isnothing butthe study ofdeath:The world began without the human race and it willend without it . . . Man has never – save only when hereproduces himself – done other than cheerfully dis-mantle million upon million of structures and reducetheir elements to a state in which they can no longer bereintegrated . . . ‘‘Entropology,’’ not anthropology,should be the word for the discipline that devotes itselfto the study of this process of disintegration in its mosthighly evolved forms.22We can credit Le ́vi-Strauss with vindicating thelogical nature of human reactions to death or, con-versely, with vindicating death as the supreme medi-ator of those oppositions and contradictions bymeans of which the human mind constructs its uni-verses.23Put in slightly different terms, we may say thatstructuralism provides for a possibility of viewinghuman experience of death as the core of a language,of a universal code. This is a far cry from previousfixations on exotic customs. Yet there remains alegitimate and fruitful concern in the anthropo-logical tradition – the search for thespecificmessage,the ‘‘what’’ that may be expressed in the language ofdeath.This brings us to the question of the ‘‘meaning’’ ofculturally defined reactions to death. We shouldnote at once that this problem, too, is by no meansa new one and that consequently one would haveto work through much accumulated rubble in orderto get at its more productive and promising formu-lations. For one thing, search for meaning has attimes been inseparable from a search for ‘‘functions’’seen either as directed action or as measurable effectsof action. Culturally specific forms of reacting to-wards death were then interpreted as implementa-tions of beliefs in souls, in immortality, or insupernatural powers. Or they were perceived asritual redress of crises inflicted on the group, as anoblique way of exercising control over the living (inthe complex of ‘‘ancestor worship’’), or simplyas means of providing mental hygiene, individualand social, in the face of events which cannot becoped with through direct rational and instrumentalaction.This is perhaps the best place to point to theimportant work of an anthropologist continuing atradition to which we paid little attention in thispaper: the conceptualization of death as a rite ofpassage. Victor W. Turner, in his study of Ndemburitual,24shares our contention that a gap between a‘‘we’’ and an exotic ‘‘they’’ is a prime obstacle tounderstanding (pp. 3, 6), and that rituals ought to beapproached as language, or as a ‘‘semantic,’’ as heputs it (p. 10). The wider conclusions he draws fromhis analysis should be sufficient to dispel an impres-sion which our admittedly somewhat anti-ritualistcritique of the anthropology of death may have leftwith the non-initiated reader.Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:00ampage 56How Others Die: Reflections on the Anthropology of Death56"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Paraphrasing a statement which Geertz makesabout religion, we may stipulate that a cultural reac-tion to deathis sociologically interesting not because, as vulgarpositivism would have it . . . , it describes the socialorder (which, insofar as it does, it does not only veryobliquely but very incompletely), but because . . . itshapes it.25The essay from which this quotation is takenremained in many respects in the frame it attemptedto break (and probably had to in order to have thiseffect), but it has been crucial in preparing thediscipline for a formidable task: to discern in theexotic and the folkloric that which reveals, in Mor-in’s formulation, a ‘‘realistic consciousness of death.’’There are various directions in which furtherinquiry may proceed. Common to all of them arethe following basic orientations:(a) A processual, constitutive view of culture and, conse-quently, of cultural conceptions of, and reactions to, death.‘‘Primitive,’’ no less but also no more than modernways of coping with death can be realistic only to theextent that they can be shown to constitutepraxis,active transformation and elaborations of conceptswhich are open, so to speak, at both ends: toward thecrude experience of the termination of life andtoward the impact of those sublime formulationswhich give meaning to that event. Recently RoyWagner proposed a view of processual, innovativemetaphorization as an approach to culture and foundthe following formulation immediately relevant toour problem:The ultimate dogma, known to all cultures, is that ofmortality, the inevitability of personal death, and itfollows that the most powerful innovative constructswill be those which achieve their force against this kindof human limitation. Hence it is that ghosts, gods, andother religious creations are so often represented asbeing omnipotent, omniscient, and immortal. Insofaras these beings are constituted as innovations upon auniversal state of man, they are of necessity repre-sented anthropomorphically, as metaphorical peoplewho share man’s active, causational capacity but nothis mortality or his other limitations. Most effectivelythey take the form of innovations upon living humanbeings, and achieve their metaphoric status throughacts of impersonation, the metaphorization of socialrole, whereby a person is ‘‘extended’’ into the role of aghost or deity. Man’s life-course can be seen as theultimate social role, which subsumes all others, and itis at this level of generality, that of man as a wholebeing, that religious impersonation as a form of innov-ation takes place.26(b) A dialectical model of socio-cultural reality. This isimplied in the criterion of ‘‘openness.’’ Realisticconceptions of death could not be formed if thesocial world were seen as a self-contained domain.For a social conception of death to emerge, the eventof individual death must be recognized as an inalien-able mediator, not only in the Le ́vi-Straussian logicalsense, but also in the phenomenological senseaccording to which subjectivity remains an irredu-cible pole in the construction of a social world. Wemay illustrate this position with a quote from AlfredSchu ̈tz in which he statesthat the whole system of relevances which governs uswithin the natural attitude is founded upon the basicexperience of each of us: I know that I shall die and Ifear to die . . . It is the primordial anticipation fromwhich all the others originate. From the fundamentalanxiety spring the many interrelated systems of hopesand fears, of wants and satisfactions, of chances andrisks which incite man within the natural attitude toattempt the mastery of the world, to overcome obs-tacles, to draft projects, and to realize them.27Schu ̈tz’ phenomenology of the social world has beenapplied by Ilona H. Fabian to an analysis entitledTheConcept of Time in Zulu Myth and Ritual(unpublishedM.A. thesis, University of Chicago, 1969). There itis argued that conceptualizations of, and relation-ships with, the dead are crucial in the formation ofa person’s as well as a society’s historical conscious-ness. The ‘‘I,’’ the ‘‘we’’ and the ancestors are allseen to be involved in a constant process of mythicalformulation and ritual action, resulting in aninterpretation of ‘‘ancestor worship’’ bearing littleresemblance to entrenched magico-religious orsociologistic explanations.(c) A communicative approach to ethnographic reality.This, again, should be understood both in the struc-Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:00ampage 57Johannes Fabian57"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"turalist sense which holds that all of culture is a systemof communication (and that death, being a seminal‘‘distinctive contrast,’’ is a prime datum of communi-cation), and in the sense that any study of ‘‘others’’ ispossible only on the basis of an inter-subjective con-text. As far as anthropological research is concerned,that context can usually not be presumed to exist butmust be constituted in the process of producingethnographic knowledge. As I have argued else-where,28this leads methodologically to a preoccupa-tion with ‘‘language-centered’’ approaches. But moreimportantly, by including the ethnographic ‘‘other’’ ina communicative ‘‘we,’’ it makes possible and neces-sary a critical, self-reflective anthropology. After all,attempts to breach the gap between the ‘‘we’’ and the‘‘they’’ would probably end in egocentric delusions ifthey could be achieved by a simple act of good will, ora theoretical dictate. Redirecting the program for ananthropology of death from the stance we found to bedominant in its tradition to the problem of ‘‘how wedie’’ does not rid us of the labors of careful ethno-graphic observation, comparison and analysis. How-ever, it burdens these labors with the knowledge that,in working out an anthropology of death, we strivetoward a realistic consciousness of death – ours.VIIf our assessment of past and present developments isat least moderately accurate, we should be able toderive some rules for the interpretation of anthro-pological literature on death.1. Ethnographic data cannot simply be adduced forthe purpose of ‘‘explaining’’ antecedent forms of pre-sent attitudes, or to account for exotic survivals inpresent attitudes, or generally to support an evolution-ary view of the history of death-related behavior. Thereason is that a great deal of that ethnography has beenselected, shaped, and interpreted precisely in terms ofthese research interests. There is at least the dangerthat one explanation (that of contemporary attitudestoward death) may be supported by something thatposes as evidence (ethnography of ‘‘primitive’’ atti-tudes) but is in fact another explanation.Mutatis mutan-dis, the same rule applies when ethnographic support issought for explanations of ontogenetic developments,such as the role of ideas of death in the process ofindividuation, especially when this is done to retrans-late ontogenetic notions into schemes of history. Crit-ical anthropology can offer nothing to support thethesis that the history of attitudes toward death hasbeen one of increasing individualization and personal-ization. All this does not mean that ethnographic datacannot ever be subject to historical interpretations (bethey historical in the traditional sense or be they pro-cessual-systematic in terms of a theory of evolution),but to determine their applicability calls for a degree ofcompetence the average user of anthropological loredoes not have. For any serious analyst of modernsociety, anthropology should be anything but a sourceof facile illustrations.2. To touch on a more specific point, it cannota prioribe assumed that the ‘‘primitive’s’’ reaction todeath, because of his deep roots in a relatively smalland well defined society, are any more specific and‘‘meaningful’’ than those of modern man. Sensitive,critical ethnography may come to the surprising con-clusion that ‘‘everything that touches upon death isequivocal, ambiguous’’29– as we should expect itwould be if there is some validity to the conception ofdeath as a mediator of knowledge and meaning. Howelse could anticipations of death in thought and experi-ence become the sources of innovative thought?3. Furthermore, one should not turn to anthropol-ogy if he is looking for proof that primitive man’s lifewas much more under the influence of his beliefs in anafterlife and in the dead. To assess that influence onewould have to specify its nature. Anthropologist-cum-psychologist Roger Bastide, for instance, points outthat African traditional religionexternalizesits deadand therefore can live with them, whereas Westernsocietyinternalizesthe dead in the form of obsessionsand compulsive behavior. He comes to the surprisingconclusion thatIf the structure of African cultures is that of a dialog[between the living and the dead] – then the structureof Western society is that of a monolog, but themonolog of the dead.304.

Again,notions of primitive ritualism and of the all-pervasivesacredness of primitive man’s world must at least besuspected of having been codified in reaction to the sameeconomic and religious changes to which analysts of con-temporary society link modern images of death (afterall modern anthropology originated in that society).5. Generally, one may predict that the ‘‘use’’ ofethnography to support schemes of evolution or devo-lution should become more and more difficult thecloser the outside analyst gets to contemporary anthro-pology (hence the heavy reliance on early ethnographyexemplified in the study by Fuchs quoted above).This brings us to one last observation. As we see it,there simply is no way of getting directly at ‘‘theothers.’’ Anthropologists and other analysts ofmodern reactions to death must find or construct ameta-level of interpretation if they are to share theirfindings. In the late nineteenth century, this may havebeen the idea of a natural science of man in search ofuniversal laws of progress to be verified by ethno-graphic ‘‘data’’ whose ‘‘objective’’ otherness was notseriously doubted. Today we seem to be left with thetask of constructing a social hermeneutic, an inter-pretation of social reality (no matter whether it is‘‘primitive’’ or ‘‘modern’’) which conceives of itselfas part of the processes it attempts to understand.Le ́vi-Strauss was right: the anthropology of death is aform of dying, or of conquering death – which, inthe end, may be the same.NOTES1A cursory check of four major professional journalsrevealed that between 1960 and 1970 only nine ‘‘death-related’’ papers were published, and the majority ofthese dealt only with the purely ceremonial aspects ofdeath. Concerning major monographs, the situation isnot much better. The few that appeared within the lastdecade or so (Warner, Goody, Gorer, Douglass) havebeen widely recognized but cannot claim a trend-set-ting influence. Let me note, however, that Goody’sstudy contains a wealth of information and suggestionswhich make it valuable beyond its declared limits.2To point to but one prominent example, see R. L.Fulton and Gilbert Geis, ‘‘Death and Social Values,’’ inDeath and Identity, edited by R. L. Fulton (New York,1965), pp. 67–75.3George W. Stocking,Race, Culture and Evolution(New York, 1968), p. 87.4James George Frazer,The Belief in Immortality and theWorship of the Dead, Vol. I (London, 1913), pp. 3,31 ff.5It is interesting to note that 19th century evolutionismcould become a conceptual vehicle for a theologian in hissearch for a ‘‘positive’’ meaning of death. In the light ofthe theories of Darwin and Weismann, death is dis-covered as the ‘‘servant of life’’ (Newman Smyth,ThePlace of Death in Evolution, New York, 1897, p. 14),a ‘‘secondary event’’ in the course of life whose necessityis nothing but a form of adaptation following the law ofnatural selection (ibid., p. 27). Echoing our epigramfrom Marx, Smyth states ‘‘that the duration of life for theindividual members of different species seems to havebeen determined upon the principle of utility, for thepreservation of the species’’ (ibid., p. 33).6‘‘Boas’ equation of folklore and culture had implica-tions for the idea of the ‘culture’ of civilized men.Just as folklore at the primitive level tended to beseen as encompassing culture, so also the culture ofmore advanced peoples was now largely seen asfolklore’’ (Stocking,op. cit., pp. 225 ff.).7Bronislaw Malinowski,Magic, Science and Religion(Garden City, NY 1954), pp. 47, 51, 52. In supportof my contention that this view became paradig-matic, see David G. Mandelbaum, ‘‘Social Uses ofFuneral Rites,’’ inThe Meaning of Death, H. Feifel, ed.(New York, 1959), pp. 189–217.8Notably by Meyer Fortes,Oedipus and Job in WestAfrican Religion(Cambridge, 1959).9A classical and extreme formulation of that positionmay be found in A. L. Kroeber, ‘‘Disposal of theDead,’’American Anthropologist, 29 (1927), pp. 308–15, in which he classes mortuary practices with suchperipheral phenomena as ‘‘fashion.’’10Attesting to that power is, for instance, Clyde Kluc-khohn’s essay ‘‘Conceptions of Death among theSouthwestern Indians,’’ inCulture and Behavior,R.Kluckhohn, ed. (New York, 1962), pp. 134 – 49,which begins with a sensitive formulation of theproblem, looks to Boas for guidance, and ends witha Malinowskian statement.

Kroeber on culturegrowth (pp. 336, 488) appear to be recognized onpredominantly theoretical grounds.14A recent interpretation of the Romanmunerasug-gests, however, that the link may be more than just ametaphorical one. With the connivance of Romanintellectuals these games were presented to a people‘‘who had lost the habit of forging its own history andwas now content to participate, in their Sunday’sbest, in a parody. . . . the weapons of the gladiatorsand the techniques of combat borrowed successivelyfrom defeated peoples served as the fossilized imageof the Roman conquest.’’ (Roland Auguet,Cruaute ́et Civilisation:Les Jeux Romains(Paris, 1970),pp. 238 ff.)15To name a few examples from otherwise highlyperceptive philosophical treatments, Plessner writes:‘‘The empty forms of time, space, self, and deathhave in common the fact that they presuppose adetaching act of objectivization; they can be attainedonly by the type of human being who has becomeconscious of his individuation. By contrast, childrenand primitive peoples meet death, and indeed thephenomenon of disappearance as such, unselfcon-sciously and without wonder.’’ (Helmuth Plessner,‘‘On the Relation of Time to Death,’’ inMan and Time(Papers from the Eranos Yearbooks, Bollingen Seriesxxx-3), edited by Joseph Campbell (New York,1957), pp. 233–63). The idea is implicit in the wayMorin juxtaposes Piaget’s work on children andLeenhardt’s findings in Melanesia (Edgar Morin,L’homme et la Mort, rev. edn. (Paris, 1970), p. 31),or when Choron puts ‘‘primitives’’ into the companyof animals (Jacques Choron,Death and Modern Man(New York, 1972), Appendix 2).16Werner Fuchs,Todesbilder in der modernen Gesellschaft(Frankfurt, 1969).17This transformation was observed and made a point ofcritique in a comment of Alvin Gouldner’s: ‘‘Over andagainst man’s animal mortality, Parsons designs a‘social system’ that, with its battery of defenses andequilibrating devices, need never run down. WhatParsons has done is to assign to the self-maintainingsocial system an immortality transcending and com-pensatory for man’s perishability. It is thus thatParsons’ social system extrudes all embodied mortalbeings and, indeed almost any kind of perishable‘matter,’ and the system is instead constructed of‘role players’ or roles and statuses that transcend andoutlive men. Much of Parsons’ theoretical effort,then, is, I suspect, an effort to combat death. But itdoes entail a denial not only of the death of individuals,but also of the death of society and, particularly,American society.’’ Alvin W. Gouldner,The ComingCrisisofWesternSociology(New York, 1970), pp. 433 ff.One does not have to share Gouldner’s position (espe-cially not his contention that Parsons is the chief villainin the story) to see some of the deeper practicalreasons for assigning to anthropological findings ondeath the theoretical value we found to be exemplifiedin Parsons’The Social System.18Sally R.

This paper should be consultedfor a review of earlier, mostly French, literature onthe importance of burial evidence in prehistoricresearch.19This trend, as well as the theoretical and methodo-logical sophistication which can be brought to it, isexemplified in a recent collection of papers edited byJames A.

This essay, then, is criticalwithinone traditionof thought but perhaps not sufficiently criticalofit.Given the magnitude of even the limited task of animmanent criticism, I can only hope for indulgence.Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:00ampage 61Johannes Fabian61"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:00ampage 62"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Part IIDeath and DyingRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:01am page 63"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:01am page 64"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"6Death Omens in a Breton MemorateEllen BadoneSince the publication of Anatole Le Braz’sLa Le ́gendede la Mort chez les Bretons Armoricainsin 1893, Brittanyhas been renowned as a region rich in folklorerelated to death. The present discussion, based onfieldwork recently conducted in Brittany, will beconcerned with only one aspect of the Bretondeath-related discourse. This is the category of pre-cursors of death orintersignes.Narratives concerningintersignesmay be classifiedetically as memorates. They are unstructured per-sonal narratives dealing with supernatural eventsinterpreted as portents of death. Often related inthe first person, they are considered to be true anddeal with experiences lived through by the speakeror some close associate. As memorates,intersignenarratives provide particularly useful material forthe study of folk belief.1As van Gennep points out,2intersigneis alocal Breton term for omen which first appears inthe publications of folklorists working in Brittanyduring the late nineteenth century. The wordinter-signeliterally means ‘sign between.’ These are signswhich bridge two time dimensions, the present andthe future, and two levels of reality, the natural andthe supernatural.Intersignesare associated with aworldview in which there are no rigidly definedboundaries between these domains. Inintersignenar-ratives, the supernatural expresses itself through themedium of natural phenomena: the actions of birds,dogs and horses, or noises heard in the night. Manypeople in rural Brittany are predisposed to recognize‘natural’ signs in the surrounding environment, suchas weather prognosticators. The observation thatgulls are flying towards the coast, for example, isinterpreted as a sign of good weather. Thus, it is notsurprising that supernatural signs are also noted: adog howling is a supernatural indicator of a forth-coming death.Intersignesdiffer from weather signs,however, in that they relate to more profound issues:death, grief and loss.A number of different types of event are emicallyrecognized asintersignes.The most common of theseisthe call of the ‘death bird’ in the neighbourhood of apersonwhoisabouttodie.Thisbird,knowninBretonasLabous an Ankou, is sometimes, but not exclusively,identified as the owl. Other birds whose continuedappearance around a house is considered an omen ofdeath include crows and magpies. Additional types ofFrom Ellen Badone, ‘‘Death Omens in a Breton Memorate,’’Folklore, 98 (1987), pp. 99–104.Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:01am page 6565"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"intersigneinclude premonitory dreams and wakingvisions of funeral processions, seen well in advanceof an actual death and funeral in the community. Theclassicintersigne, collected byLe Braz at the turn of thecentury and still observed today, is the sound ofsqueaking wheels along the roadway outside one’shome. This is theKarrigell an Ankouor the wheelbar-row of theAnkou– death personified in Breton trad-ition – coming to carry away the soul of the dying.3Itshould be noted that many of the phenomena recog-nized asintersignesare not restricted to Breton folk-lore. The howling dog and the call of the owl, forexample, are standard omens in many folk traditions,as even a cursory glance of theMotif-Index of FolkLiteraturedemonstrates.In the analysis ofintersignenarratives the questionarises of whether the signs observed are interpretedasintersignesbefore or after the fact of a death. Incertain narratives, theintersigneappears as the cuewhich changes the status of the dying person. Bythose who have observed theintersigne,heisnolonger viewed as a sick person who may recover.Rather, he is considered to belong in the liminal stateof those for whom there will be no return, ‘betwixtand between’ the social categories of the living andthe dead. In other cases, however, it is afterwards,and especially in the context of the narration of theexperience, that the signs achieve their full signifi-cance, as Honko’s 1964 study would suggest. Thenarrator, recounting what he or she observed beforea death, traces a pattern which lends meaning andcoherence to an otherwise inexplicable and tragicevent.In describing experiences withintersignes, the nar-rator both reconstructs and interprets his or herpersonal history. This process will become evidentin the analysis of the following text, recorded duringfieldwork. The speaker, Marie, is a middle-agedwoman who lives with her alcoholic husband andher sister who runs a small rural cafe ́in interiorBrittany. As Marie relates, she had two sons, onenormal and one who developed psychiatric problemsafter his period of obligatory military service. In hernarrative, Marie describes theintersignesexperiencedby each member of her immediate family, prior tothe cycling accident in which her healthy son waskilled, four years earlier.Marie’s narrative has two significant features. Thedeath in question is an accidental death, and inaddition, it is the death of a young person. Thus itis doubly shocking and tragic. Whereas the elderlyare expected to die and are therefore not mournedto excess, the death of a young person falls into thecategory of deaths locally considered to be ‘triste’. Asan accidental death, Marie’s son’s death is a source ofspecial anxiety. It appears senseless, unnecessary,revolting. As his mother explains, he was knockedoff his bicycle by a drunken driver. Through hernarrative, Marie engages in a process akin to Le ́vi-Strauss’ mythical thought, seeking to overcome con-tradictions by generating connections among seem-ingly unrelated events.4This process enables Marieto reconcile the apparent meaninglessness of herson’s death with her desire for an ordered, meaning-ful vision of reality. She achieves this reconciliationby framing her son’s death in the context of a pre-destined pattern beyond human control.The narrative which follows has been translatedfrom the French. My own comments and those of anacquaintance of the narrator, present during theinterview, are interspersed with Marie’s account.Marie:Oui, bon. My son was working at Carhaix, he, heis the one who died there. He was killed by a car. Hewas riding along the side of the road, like that, andthen a driver who was drunk drove right into him.Right into him, like that. He was lifted up on thehood of the car, and then he fell back on the road. Itwas his skull that was . . . the bone was fractured.Yes, he died immediately.My comment: Because of a drunk driver!Marie: Yes, one who was going to see his wife in thehospital, because she had just given birth. So, yousee, he had celebrated the event after work with hisfriends, he’d bought them all drinks.Parenthetically, although these details were notincluded deliberately as a dramatic device, onemight note the poetic irony in this linkage betweenbirth and death. The narrative continues:Marie: So, my son was working at Carhaix, and one dayhe was home here. He was about to leave, he wasstanding on the doorstep. There, where I live, onthe doorstep. And when he was going to put hisRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:01am page 66Death Omens in a Breton Memorate66"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"suitcase in the car, we heard a bird, who cried,twice, in the night, like that. Over there, by thepoplars. We heard it twice, like that, twice.Acquaintance: And you don’t know what sort of a cry itwas?Marie: Oh, dismal cries. Twice it cried.Acquaintance: And you don’t know if it was a whitebird? Was it an owl?Marie: Oh, I don’t know, since it was night-time. It wasnight-time, and me, I had always heard the oldpeople say, before, that that was the death bird.Labous an Ankou, that’s what we used to call it,Labousan Ankou. I mentioned that to my son: ‘Do you thinkthat’s what it is?’ I asked him. ‘I don’t know. The oldpeople used to say so,’ he replied, like that. But Ididn’t want to make him afraid, so I just left it at that,because, just at that moment, he was going to leave.Because, if I had told him too many things about it,he would have been afraid.So, I just said one or two words, and then Istopped talking about it.Bon, that was that. Myson went and worked, and after work he used totrain to take part in cycling races. And, I don’t knowhow many months later, three or four months later,perhaps, he was killed. But, my sister now, she wasin Alsace. She was working in a hotel there at thatmoment, you see. And she had dreamed that she hadseen my son in an ambulance, here. In her dream,she saw the courtyard here and my son in theambulance. She wasn’t even here at home. She wasworking in a hotel in Alsace and she dreamt that. Shewoke up with a start, like that, and she said toherself, ‘Oh, perhaps he’s going to have an accident,’because he was a cyclist. But the time passed, and itdidn’t come about right away.Afterwards, we foundout that she had had that dream.Here it is evident that the dream’s premonitoryquality was recognized after the death occurred.Marie: And my mother, too. My mother had a dreamtoo. That he had been killed.My comment: That her grandson had been killed?Marie: Yes, she told me so. I was in the chicken coop.This inclusion of ‘unnecessary’ details is a charac-teristic feature ofintersignenarratives, and of memo-rates in general.5Marie not only considers itimportant to relate the fact that her mother hadtold her about the dream, but also to describe thecircumstances surrounding its narration. Such detailssituate the incident in her mind and reinforce hermemory of having discussed the premonitory dreamwell in advance of her son’s accident. However,again, it is after the fact, in Marie’s personal recon-struction of the events leading up to her son’s death,that her mother’s dream assumes its full significanceas a precusor. The narrative continues:Marie: She told me: ‘I dreamt that Re ́my had beenkilled.’ She told me that. So, we had all heardsomething, or dreamed. And my husband heardthe sound of hammering.My comment:What was that?Marie:Yes, before the death, too. And he told me.Hewas made to feel it, you see. It’s bizarre, isn’t it?He wasmade to feel it.Marie’s repeated comment, ‘He was made to feelit,’ is extremely significant. Her exact words were:‘On lui avait fait sentir.’ The impersonal subject andthe passive voice implicitly raise the question: whoor what made her husband sense their son’s death inadvance? I would suggest that theintersigneis anintegral part of a worldview based on the conceptof fate orla destine ́e. When discussing death or thechoice of a marriage partner, many informants ex-pressed the view that there is nothing one can do toexert control over these areas of life. Each person hashis or her own destiny and, try as one might, it isimpossible to deviate from this predetermined path.It isec ́rit d’avance– written in advance – that one willmarry a certain person or die at a particular placeand time. This idea of destiny is not conceived of somuch in terms of the Christian concept of God’s willas in terms of an ordering force in the universe, aforce which bears no direct connection to RomanCatholic dogma. As another, strongly anticlericalinformant explained, after describing a number ofintersignesshe had experienced:It’s because of that that I believe that there must be aMaster. I don’t know if it’sLe Bon Dieuor another, but Ithink there must be a Master who forewarns us.Thus,intersignesare interpreted as proof that there isa larger force which predetermines and controls theevents in human lives. According to this fatalisticworldview, the future constitutes an objective real-Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:01am page 67Ellen Badone67"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"ity, elements of which can be known in the presentthrough the medium of theintersigne. Logically, if allthe major crises in life are ‘written in advance,’ it isnot surprising that some people are forewarned. It is‘given to them’ – by the ‘Master’ – to know before-hand. As Marie says of her husband: ‘On lui avait faitsentir– He was made to feel it.’Marie continues to relate the circumstances asso-ciated with the hammering noise heard by her hus-band in the night:Marie:‘I heard something,’ he told me. ‘I heard some-thing, and I don’t know what it is. I’m worried. Ithink I heard something.’ He thought it must havebeen the neighbour behind, hammering in the elec-tric fence pickets for his cows, since it was duringthe night. He thought it was that. But no-one knewwhat it was, the sound of hammering, no-one knew.When my son was dead, afterwards, then we foundout. Because we couldn’t get the coffin out of theroom. No-one could have known. We had to knockdown a bit of the wall at the door to get the coffinout of the room. And, you see, no-one knew thatthe wall would have to be knocked down. And itwas that, the sign, it was that.My comment: He heard the same noise?Marie: Yes, the sound of hammering, yes. We knockedit down with the hammer too. And that, that’s true!Marie’s insistence on the truth of this event istypical. Whereas certain categories of death-lore,including most legends dealing with ghosts, are con-sidered improbable – ‘the things ignorant peopletalked about in the old days’ –intersignesare believed.Marie continues:Marie: And then, before, a long time before, there wasa man who was sick, there in the village. I don’tknow how long before – one year, or two. Therewas a dog who came and howled at my door. Andme, I believe in that sort of thing, eh? Crying andhowling at my door. And I hadn’t forgotten [at thetime of her son’s death]. I hadn’t forgotten. I said tomyself [when the dog came]: ‘Oh, he’s come to thewrong door, ha!’ Because it was the other man whowas ill. Yes, he was sick, and he died almost imme-diately after that. ‘He was howling at the wrongdoor, ha!’ I said to myself then. Because I believe inthose things.Non, non, non!He wasn’t mistaken.And another day, there was a magpie that came andtapped on my windowpane, too. And me, I believein those things. And all that, I believe had a rela-tionship with the death of my son.Here Marie explicitly sets her son’s death in thecontext of the predetermined pattern provided bythe repeated occurrences ofintersignes. Beginning atleast one and possibly two years before the death ofher son, with the dog howling at her door, thispattern ofintersignesreaches a peak of intensitythree or four months prior to the accident.In the case of her son, as Marie observes:Marie: We heard all that, all that was heard beforehand.And for the death of my mother two years ago, wedidn’t hear a thing. Because she was an elderlyperson, you see, and everyone has to die, as youwell know. She was an elderly person.My comment: That was more normal?Marie: Yes, and my son, you see, because of the factthat it was a young person, we were made to feel it.On nous a fait sentir.This statement and other materials collectedduring fieldwork suggest thatintersignenarrativesare more often associated with accidental deaths,unexpected deaths or‘triste’deaths of the kind de-scribed in this text than with ‘normal,’ peacefuldeaths resulting from old age. This is because thecontradictions inherent in‘triste’deaths are moreacute than in other types of death: youth and deathare concepts which it is not easy to reconcile. There-fore there is a greater need to situatetristedeaths inthe type of explanatory framework provided by theintersignenarrative.Marie continues:Marie:Ma, those things are true, those things that I’vejust told you. Yes, they’re true. So, therefore, thereis something supernatural, above us, don’t youbelieve? Because, all that, it’s bizarre, all the same!And yet, it’s true. And me, I had heard theold people recount all that sort of thing beforetoo. But now I believe, because we all heardsomething.Here again the idea is expressed thatintersignesprovide evidence for the existence of some vaguelyRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:01am page 68Death Omens in a Breton Memorate68"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"defined supernatural force ‘above us’ which directsour lives. In addition, Marie reaffirms the veracity ofher experience, explicitly contrasting her presentattitude of belief with her own former scepticism.Her comment, ‘But now I believe, because we allheard something,’ corrorborates Honko’s observa-tion that ‘In general, informants react critically tosupernatural experiences. They want to considertrue only that which they themselves saw or whichsome acquaintance experienced.’6Marie’s narrative is a particularly complete andcoherent example of its type. It is unusual to betold anintersignenarrative involving so many differ-ent signs appearing to so many individuals in con-nection with the same death. It seems likely thatthe need to reconstitute a meaningful representationof reality was expecially great in this case, notonly because of the young man’s age and the acci-dental nature of his death, but also because Marieharbours a deeply felt sense of injustice that it washer healthy, ‘good’ son who was taken, while hermentally handicapped, ‘bad’ son had been leftalive. As she states in connection with her mother’sdream before the accident which killed Re ́my, thehealthy son:Marie: Me, I thought, because my mother had defin-itely dreamt about Re ́my. Because my son, the otherson, was sick in hospital with a nervous breakdown.The son you just met here. I believed that maybe hewould die. And I had got that idea in my head, likethis, ‘maybe something will happen to him.’ But Inever imagined that anything would happen to thehealthy one.This last quotation illustrates another characteris-tic feature ofintersignenarratives. Often when thesign is first observed it is incorrectly interpreted asanintersignefor someone considered likely to die. Asthe narrative progresses, it is discovered that, by anironic twist of fate, another totally unexpected andmore tragic death occurs, while the ‘likely candi-date’ either does not die, or the relative importanceof his death is minimized. The inclusion of detailsconcerning the mistaken interpretation of aninter-signelends a shock value to such narratives which isaesthetically satisfying for Breton listerners on twolevels. First, it evokes a thrill of surprise and fearwhich is, in moderation, pleasurable. On a deeperlevel, however, the mistaken identification of theperson about to die dramatically demonstrates thereality of fate as an uncontrollable and ultimatelyunknowable force.Intersignenarratives are ‘good stories’ becausethey validate the fatalistic worldview shared by nar-rator and listeners. These narratives concretize thefolk belief that the future exists as an objective realityand that one cannot, therefore, alter the pattern ofone’s life. Just at the moment when one seems tohave glimpsed a fragment of this pattern, one findsthat, ironically, the supernatural has reserved theright to its secrets. Although certain clues may beprovided about how the future will unfold, merehuman minds cannot always penetrate destiny’sdeeper logic.Theintersignenarrative discussed in this paperrepresents a reconstruction or ordering of pastevents which generates meaning and pattern wherethey are not otherwise apparent. It does so byappealing to specific natural phenomena and todreams, through which the supernatural speaks.The howling dog, the hammering noise in thenight and the premonitory dreams – observedprior to the tragedy – are as Le ́vi-Strauss wouldsay, the ‘remains of events’ which are fitted togetherafter the fact, to build up structures of significance.7It is in the telling and re-telling of events that thenarrator attempts to bridge the gap between herdesire to find a reason and the inherent unreason ofher loss.NOTES1 Lauri Honko, ‘Memorates and the Study of FolkBelief,’Journal of the Folklore Institute1 (1964), 5–19;C.

StrausHuman death is distinguished from other death inNorthern Cheyenne culture, human life from otherlife; and the meaning of human death must be con-sidered in its relationship to the meaning of humanlife. Human-ness is tied to physical life, but selfhoodand tribal identity are not: human death terminatesphysical life while self and Cheyenne-ness persist.Human life is understood here as a ‘‘journey onthe surface of the earth’’ (as represented in figure 7.1below). The developing fetus has not yet begun thejourney and is described as ‘‘someone coming to joinus’’. Intercourse is understood as necessary but notsufficient for conception: conception is tripartite,male and female contributions of blood and sub-stance are required, but the animating life principlecomes from the Creator,Ma?heo?o. Ma?heo?’sblessingis tenuous and especially insecure during fetal life.Spontaneous abortions are believed to be caused byamoral or un-Cheyenne-like behavior of eitherparent which leadsMa?heo?oto ‘‘call the childback’’, withdrawing the blessing of life. A child isconsidered to be ‘‘close to the spirit’’, likely to be‘‘called back’’ for the first twelve years of his life, butespecially during this very early period. The death ofa newborn infant or a fetus is the source of greatfamily strife, the relatives of each parent blaming theother parent for the death.In the first months of life, the fetus is not con-sidered to be fully living: the creation of life is aprocess, not an event. Traditionally, a fetus abortedin this early time would be treated like the placentaof a newborn, potentially lifeful, potentially human,but not yet realized, and it is hung on a branch of atree beside a river to dry and ultimately to be eatenby carnivorous birds (and perhaps also to call forthits twin; the original ‘second twin’ developing in ariver from the thrown-away placenta of the first).The older fetus, in particular the fetus which hasmanifest its life principle by beginning to movewithin the womb, is buried as if it were a newborninfant. At the moment of birth, the infant has life,but is not yet human: it hasMa?heo?o’sfirst blessingonly.Ma?heo?oblesses all living things in this way. Hisspecial blessing to human beings is the gift of breath/power (omotome) and the associated spiritual poten-tial (mahta?sooma).Omotome, meaning breath/air andalso word, is inspired in the child when the ‘‘plug hasFrom Anne S. Straus, ‘‘The Meaning of Death in Northern Cheyenne Culture,’’Plains Anthropologist, 23, 79 (1978): 1–6.Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:01am page 7171"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"been removed’’, the mucus loosened in the infant’sthroat, and the child inhales his first breath of air.With his first breath he draws in his consciousnessand his ability to communicate verbally, and thus hisonly access to power in a world where he is other-wise weak and ignorant (cf. Straus 1978: ChapterVI). In the exercise of hisomotomeand under thedirection of his parents, especially during the firsttwelve years of his life, the human being develops hismahta?soomaor spiritual balance. When themahta?-soomais differentiated into its four parts, two of them‘‘good’’ (representing the ordered cultural existenceof man), two of them ‘‘crazy’’ (representing hisunordered, animal heritage), the individual willdemonstrate in his behavior that he ‘‘knows thedifference’’, that is, comprehends the moral orderwithin which he must live. Only at this point is theindividual considered to be responsible for his ownbehavior as a functioning self, a full participant in thetribal community, a person. It is at this point as wellthat the individual’s behavior may be classified byother adults, a fundamental classification being thatbased on the ‘‘good’’ and ‘‘crazy’’ potential present ineveryone, and the extent to which each directs thebehavior of the person in question. Personhood, fullparticipation in the tribal society, then, is not en-sured by birth: it is possible for a child never tobecome a person. Personhood is the result of a longprocess of development.The origin of death like the origin of life is ex-plained in sacred traditions.

Birth and deathare closely associated here, as are the beginning andthe end of the ‘‘journey of life’’: the very old like thevery young are described as ‘‘close to the spirit’’.Reincarnation is a common though vague notionamong contemporary Northern Cheyenne: SweetMedicine himself was said to have lived four life-times; infants born with scars or with teeth, andthose who cry until they are given a particularname are thought to be reincarnations of tribalancestors; and all twins are considered to be reincar-nations of the original twin spirits.The demise, like the creation, of the humanperson is a process. Themahta?-sooma, last to developis the first to leave the body, its loss resulting inbehavioral and cognitive changes. Theomotomedeparts next, bringing loss of senses, consciousnessand ultimately, breathing. As the individual literallyex-spires, theomotomejoins themahta?soomaas thespirit self of the Above World. An individual who isstrangled (traditionally a woman’s way of suicide)traps hisomotomeinside his body and thus nevermakes the transition from living to spirit self.The life principle, first gift ofMa?heo?o, once dif-fused throughout the body, becomes localized in theskeleton as the flesh rots away or is eaten, and remainsthere dormant until the bones begin to crumble intodust/earth. (In the old days, reburial of the disarticu-lated bones might occur at this time.) The skeletons ofdeceased human beings (se?ote) are known to moveabout on their own, playing handgame, which theytaught to the Cheyennes, or frightening the living:theyareanimate(andanimateingender[cf.StrausandBrightman, 1977]) but unable to communicate ver-bally with the living. It was possible for such skeletonstobecomerevivifiedthrougha sweatlodgeceremony,and there are many popular stories about dissemblinghuman beings who are really skeletons, encounteredby Cheyennes alone at night. One informant com-pared the revivification of such skeletons to the lifecycle of the snake which he said sheds its flesh in thewinter,becoming a mere skeleton, butreturns to newbody and full life each spring.The process of death may be reversed. Occasion-ally a spirit which has travelled toseana, land of thedeparted, has returned to the body (often with thehelp of a powerful medicine person) which then‘‘comes back’’ to full life. Individuals who have‘‘come back’’ can recall visiting with those longdead and being in a beautiful place. Such experiencesoccur within the first four days after apparent death,so burial does not take place earlier than four daysafter apparent death. The spiritself may leave thehuman body temporarily without death, as in sleepand unconsciousness (both of which are named inCheyenne by words related to that for ‘‘die’’:na?eotse(¼becoming or almost unconscious/dead) sleep;andna?a, unconscious or dead. This equation causesan interesting confusion in Cheyenne-English be-tween ‘‘passed out’’ and ‘‘passed away’’, which areused as identical phrases).The moment of death, then, is difficult to discern:death is a long process. Clues to the immanence ofdeath include the wandering about of the externalmahta?soomaor shadow-image of the individual. Oneinformant reported a typical experience of seeing theshadow-image of a particular woman walking alongthe Tongue River road one night when she wasknown to be in the Buffet Bar in Ashland. Thatsame woman died later in the evening in a carwreck on Highway 212. Such a separation of imagefrom body is taken as evidence of personal disinte-gration. The individual who sees his own shadow-image should also expect his own death: hence thespecial power of the mirror as an offensive weapon inoldtime warfare and the present-day anxiety con-cerning photographic images. Radical behaviorchange is also taken as evidence of illness, as is lossof hearing, which presumably indicates the failingphysical powers of theomotome.Continuity of the non-physical or spirit self afterdeath is clear: ‘‘You die, but your spirit takes over’’,explained one young informant. The spirit-self isanimate, even when separate from the body: it hasself-awareness, it perceives its own death, separatesfrom the body, and moves on to another place. Itcontinues in its awareness of and participation in theCheyenne community, both as a dream visitor and asa memory carried in a name. Young people especiallyencounter grandparents in dreams, and these de-ceased elders advise them about the direction oftheir lives.

They have identities and names,and must grant permission for their names to begiven to a new person, just as is the case amongthe living. They are conscious of the moral orderwithin which they continue to function: they knowhow to behave in the Cheyenne Way. They are nolonger alive and they are no longer human; but theyare indeed persons, full participants in the tribalsociety.Seana, at the end of the long fork of the Milky Way,is by far the most common destiny of Cheyennes afterdeath; but it is not the only one. Medicine people,specially powerful on earth, may travel a special pathafter death. They are properly buried with their headsfacing Bear Butte, (noaha-vose) and are said to go thereafter death. Within the sacred mountain, these medi-cine people may becomenesemoono, personal spirits,who continue to guide and instruct their people,assuming a variety of incarnations on the surface ofthe earth.

They are differentiated fromotherheama-vo?estaneo?oprimarilyon the basis of theirgreater power, just as in life medicine people aredistinguished from others. The interaction ofnese-moonowith living human Cheyennes is patternedaccording to the norms for conduct betweenthose of greater and lesser power (cf. Straus 1976:Chapter 5).Some Cheyennes in death as in life are exiled fromthe tribal community, isolated from all that is mean-ingful to them. Those whose behavior in life wasirredeemably evil, who sinned and had not beenredeemed by ceremonial pledge of their relatives,travel the short fork of the Milky Way or ‘‘suicideroad’’ and are lost. Some may fall back to earth andbecome reincarnated as were-animals befitting theanimal-like, a-moral manner in which they con-ducted their lives on the surface of the earth. Thereare stories, for example, about does which enchantand entice solitary hunters in the hills at night,causing them to become hopelessly lost and con-fused. Their mode of seduction is to appear asbeautiful women, irresistable to the hunter whopursues them relentlessly. Perhaps such deer arethe incarnations of women who had been sinfully‘‘loose’’ during their life on the surface of the earth.Male ‘‘devils’’ as they are called, are reported fre-quently at night on the ‘‘divide’’ between Lame Deerand Ashland: a person driving a car may be hailed bya man asking for a ride only to find when he stopsthat the ‘man’ has green eyes and cloven hoofs. Such‘‘devils’’ invariably incite their victims to unruly andunCheyenne-like behavior. Then there are the owls.Owls are widely recognized as heralds of death, andowls will haunt and bother people walking alone onthe reservation at night (particularly terrifying is thenoise of the flapping wings as the owl pursues youclosely). Owls are in some sense seen as inherentlyevil: there may well be some connection betweenowls and the spirits of those who behaved in evil waysbut are now deceased, perhaps even with murderers,the arch-sinners among traditional Cheyennes. Thebest way to cope with the curse of the owl is to kill it.Eventually all such were-animals die or are killed,thus ultimately purging bothseanaand the livingCheyenne community of evil beings.Those who die a ‘‘bad death’’ may also becomeisolated from the tribal community. The mostcommon ‘‘bad death’’ is death by violent accident.Accidents, particularly violent accidents, disturb thespiritual balance of the individual and may result inthe loss of good spirits. With its two ‘‘crazy spirits’’then dominant at the moment of death, the self maynever regain sufficient integration to make it ‘‘overthere’’ and may be condemned to earthbound wan-derings and non-participant(!) observation of triballife. Spirits of those who have been obsessed, un-modulated in life, perhaps as the result of a maliciouscurse, are likewise off-center and may fail to find theway. Moreover, it is important for the departingspirit to ‘‘rest upon its journey’’, its resting placebeing its own body: if that body is mutilated orotherwise unrecognizable, it may not be able to‘‘find its home’’ and may exhaust itself to nothingnessin its search. Hence, personal belongings and identi-fying paints are part of the traditional burial practiceto mark and distinguish a particular body, and sol-Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:01am page 74The Meaning of Death in Northern Cheyenne Culture74"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"diers will risk their lives to recover the corpses oftheir fellows.A ‘‘good death’’ is a tribal death, onewhich serves atribal purpose and exemplifies tribal values; a ‘‘gooddeath’’contributestothetribalsolidarityandprovidesfor the security of the self within the tribal commu-nity. From conception, a Cheyenne is a tribal being.His substance is Cheyenne substance, and his heart,the center of his physical being and locus of his personmotivation, is a Cheyenne heart (the Cheyenne namefor themselves,tsetsehestahase, means those who arehearted alike). Each individual is defined as special,unique: each has his own powers and his own prob-lems. Individuals are encouraged freely to developtheir own talents and interests and are taught not tointerferewith the free development and expression ofothers. Yet this encouragement of individualityobtains only within the context of tribal membershipwhich ensures, ultimately, that individualism serves atribal purpose and supports a tribal identity. Withouttribal membership, there is no freedom, there is only‘‘being lost’’. The community is defined as prerequis-ite to, not limiting of, individual direction within it.One’s death should be as valuable a contributionto the tribe as one’s life. In the days of warfare andstill today in times of war, the best death was to die inbattle, in defense of your community and your placewithin it. ‘‘If you died a natural death, your namewas forgotten: if you died fighting, it was remem-bered’’ (Stands-in-Timber, 1969: 69). The oldpeople are respected for their wisdom and theirspiritual powers, for their special place in the life-system of creation. It is understood as ‘‘natural’’ thatthey should depend upon those younger than themfor food and physical strength, as it is that othersshould depend upon them for advice and instruction.But physical debilitation is not good: it helps no one.‘‘When a man gets old, he teeth are gone. I am afraid(of that time), I wish to die (before it comes)’’ (songof the Kit Fox Society). The suicide warrior wascommon in pre-reservation days, choosing to die avaluable, positive death instead of withering mean-inglessly into nothing. The reservation period has hadits suicide warriors as well, most famous amongwhom are Head Swift and Crazy Mule, whosenames exemplify the importance of a death whichis a meaningful, tribal death.Loneliness is considered to be the universal condi-tion of mankind, the inescapable consequences ofMa?heo?o’sgift of human consciousness. ‘‘No twopeople on the face of this earth are alike in any onething except for their loneliness’’ observes the con-troversial Northern Cheyenne author, HyemeyohstsStorm (1972: 7). Isolation and loneliness are centralthemes in the major tribal rituals as well as in day today interaction among contemporary NorthernCheyennes. This becomes particularly evidentamong those who are drinking, and whose expressionis thus somewhat less guarded: the fears confided inthese situations invariably include fear of lonelinessand isolation from those important to him. Exile isconsidered to be the ultimate punishment for devi-ance: it is the worst possible condition for human orother persons; it imposes constant loneliness. Thedeepest and most acute loneliness is occasioned bythe death of a relative or close friend. The anguish issometimes so great, according to one informant, thatthe bereaved may expire of his loneliness, literallydrowning his heart in the build up of fluid/tearsaround it. For those who remain, open contact withthe departed is irrevocably lost: subsequent contact isdependent upon the will of theheama-vo?estaneo?o.The departing spirit, caught up in human lonelinessduring his four days’search for the Milky Way is saidoften to visit those closest to him and to beg them toaccompany him. One informant spoke of her cousin’sefforts to entice her to join him on his journey toseana, for example. Once ‘‘over there’’, however, thespirit is free of that loneliness and is no more a threatto the living. Many of the prayers for the recentlydeceased are focussed on helping him make it ‘‘overthere’’.The exquisite pain of loss through death is said tobe the hardest thing a human being must face in thearduous journey on the surface of the earth: grief andthe expression of grief are to be expected at suchtimes. But the weeping must end in four days. If itcontinues longer, the mourners ‘‘may be given some-thing else to cry about’’. They must realize that life ishard and that the departed has been liberated from astruggle. Death is a release, and reunion with thosealready departed is the great reward at the end of thejourney.

In facing one’s own death, thepossibility of dying in a bad way, of not finding theway, and thus of isolation and loneliness is thedeepest concern. What Cheyennes fear most aboutdeath – their own as well as others’ – is the lonelinessassociated with it. They do not fear the loss of‘productive self’ (cf. Schulz, 1976) presumably pri-mary for Americans in general, for normally it is notlost. They fear what they already know to be inevit-able, – the loneliness which is at once their uniquepower and their universal problem as human beings.Death is defined as transformation, not termin-ation, of selfhood for those who have lived in theCheyenne Way: deceased Cheyennes continue toparticipate in the tribal society asheama-vo?estaneo?oandnesemoono. Death is understood as a process, notan event; and the process of death may be reversed.Death should be expected, even courted: it shouldnot be accidental. Isolation, not anihilation, is thegreatest fear associated with death in the NorthernCheyenne community.REFERENCESSchulz, Carol, 1976Death anxiety and the Structuring of adeath concerns cognitive domain.

These distinctions, naturally, involveconcepts and values specific to the culture of thebran ̃as.The positive and negative aspects of ‘‘good’’ and‘‘bad’’ deaths do not refer only to the moment ofdeath itself but also to the circumstances that pre-cede it. A ‘‘good death,’’ among other things, is rapidwhile a ‘‘bad death’’ may mean weeks, months, oreven years of slow agony. For that reason, a gooddeath is also known as a ‘‘sudden death’’ [repentina]while a bad death might be classed as a ‘‘death ofchronic illness’’ or a ‘‘slow death’’ [accidentada]. In allthe definitions of good death, there are two add-itional constants: the absence of pain and the absenceof an awareness of dying. A good death that fulfillsthese three conditions is known as a ‘‘happy death’’[muerte feliz], or even a ‘‘nice death’’ or ‘‘prettydeath’’ [muerte bonita, muerte guapa]. This is the wayall Vaqueiros, irrespective of age, want to die. Thehappy death comes peacefully during sleep when thedying person is not aware of it.A happy death is what would happen if I went to bednow and was stiff the next morning. It’s not beingaware . . . and not knowing about anything. It’s notthinking about anything, just going to bed and notwaking up, without suffering at all. It’s what I wouldwant. (Man, age 38)In contrast, a bad death involves sickness with painand an awareness of the imminence of a death with-out cure. A long, drawn-out agony precedes thiskind of death.Bad death is that of some people who suffer, God saveus, a lot of pain. Some more and some less, everybodydislikes pain and suffering. The more you have to be inbed, the more you suffer and dwell on death and thinkabout those who remain. (Woman, age 62)A bad death, then, comes from any long illness,especially cancer.

This kind of deathallows one to work and lead a normal life until thelast moment – another aspect of a good death. A baddeath is not only painful for the person who is dyingbut also for the household, those who must care forthe sick person and see the suffering. The foreknow-ledge of one’s own death, or the observation of apainful death in others, produces ‘‘apprehension’’:If the Divine Lord prohibited dying when you knowyou’re dying, I think it would be better, eh? When yourealize it you get an apprehension, you see that you’redying and you die. You’re dying with a disease for yearsand years, suffering there, seeing that you don’t get anybetter and that you have to die. You are a burden forthe family and those who are around you, and you liethere thinking, ‘‘Well, now I have to die.’’ A bad deathwas that of X from F, who would spend all day going‘‘Ay, ay, ay!’’ She must have had cancer, and shecouldn’t stand it; it was painful to hear her. (Man,age 65)A good death ideally takes place when a person hascompleted the life cycle, in old age. It should occurin a ‘‘natural’’ way, without illness or violence, sothat a person is unaware of it and feels no pain. Deathof old age, also called ‘‘natural death,’’ is a subcat-egory of the good death. It differs from the happydeath in that the latter may occur at any age while theformer takes place at around eighty years. Thosewho die ‘‘old’’ do not have a specific illness; theysimply ‘‘terminate,’’ which means they eat less andless and their blood ends or runs out [se agota].People who die that way have a tranquil and softconclusion; it is said that they ‘‘died like birds.’’Sometimes they lead normal lives, even doing workappropriate to their age up to the last moment. It isthought that this ending closes the cycle of a full life.The man from C house died completely healthy, but heran out of blood. And the grandmother here was thesame; all she had was rheumatism, and she began todecline, eating little and kind of faded away, until shedidn’t have any strength left. She was eating less, andgetting thinner, and declining with less strength, be-cause the blood comes to an end, until they end up likea bird. (Woman, age 66)This kind of death represents for humans the con-tinuation of the general cycle of nature. Plants andanimals share with humans some elements of this finalprocess. Compare, for example, the following obser-vations on the cycle of plant and animal life with thepreceding statements about the natural death ofhumans:December is known as the dead month because it’s thelast one of the year; it’s the month that the blooddeclines. The grasses decline and the sap goes all theway down. It’s something, I think, that’s the same inhumans; humans grow until they are thirty years old,and then they slowly get smaller. The grasses and plantsgrow in the spring until the end of autumn, then theyare flattened by the wind or bad weather; they dry out.It’s like dying; they lose their sap, their blood, and theyhave less strength. (Man, age 79)A good cow gets sold when it is fifteen, sixteen, orseventeen years old. It may last until it’s twenty-two ortwenty-three, depending on its mouth – if its teetharen’t so worn down that it can’t graze and eat. That’sthe main reason cows give out. Their teeth wear downand fall out; they waste away, getting thinner; theycan’t ruminate and they die. But no one waits untilthey die. When the cow gets old you to dispose of it,because the same happens to them as with people –rheumatism, etc., until they pass away. Me, they won’tthrow me out until God or the devil calls, but the cow,since it’s useful you sell it, but not for much, since bythen it’s hard to fatten. (Man, age 65)The death that forms the sharpest contrast withnatural death is known as the ‘‘tragic death’’ [muertedesgraciada]. In natural death, one dies from intrinsicand entirely predictable causes; the tragic death iscaused by external agents or accidents. First andforemost, tragic deaths occur in mortal accidents inthe course of the traditional activities of thebran ̃a,but they also include more modern deaths in auto-mobile accidents. Those who die in these ways aresaid to die tragically [de/por desgracia] or by accident.Another kind of death is known as ‘‘violent death,’’ aform of tragic death that includes all deaths caused byhumans, both murder and suicide.Someone dies tragically who goes to hitch up the cartto the cows and gets caught and trampled.

Tragic death is when you fall from a roof,or a stone falls on you, or you fall off a cliff, or you’rerun over by a cart, or a car hits you and flattens you,since you end up pretty tragic. There are a lot ofaccidents. . . . No, hanging yourself is not an accident.That’s more like a crime; that’s violent death.Tragic death shares some of the features both ofthe good death and of the bad death. It is usuallyquick like the happy death and consequently it isoften without pain or an awareness of dying. But itis not always instantaneous; the moribund may havethe long agony of the bad death. Although manyVaqueiros prefer a tragic death to a painful illness,they do not prefer it for those around them, for atragic death is always a disagreeable surprise forthose who remain. It can happen to persons of anyage; in fact, the active population is especially sus-ceptible to it. Furthermore, this kind of death in-volves the courts or a police investigation, anautopsy, and other legal problems. So Vaqueiros areambivalent about this kind of death.An accident is not a good death, woman. Well, it’s arapid death – but what if you barely stay alive? Youcould smash your hands or a leg, and God knows howlong you’d be dragging around.Hombre, if you don’tfeel anything, then there’s nothing quicker than anaccident, because you die instantly. Nobody wants it,because it’s a surprise for those who remain. Becauseit’s a rapid death, but not for the family. (Woman, age19)The contrast between death of old age and tragicdeath is made clear in the following quotation. Deathof old age is expected and inevitable, the conclusionof a natural process. Tragic death interrupts thisprocess unexpectedly and prematurely. The subjectcame up when a cow was injured and had to beslaughtered.The animal is destined to die. But this animal, like aperson, shouldn’t have died yet. It should have lasted afew years more, or however many it would have lasted;it’s a pity. The cow, like a person, dies one way oranother; you have to take it to the fair to be sold. But itmakes you sadder when it’s lost tragically, like that day.And with people it’s the same. You have an apprehen-sion when you lose a family member tragically. But it’svery different when they’ve fallen ill or come to anadvanced age and then die, because that way you knewthey had to die. But when you lose a person byaccident, tragically, who was young, or middle-aged,Ay Dios!It’s a different pain, a different feeling, adifferent sadness than when you get to the right age,you’re old, and you die. (Man, age 67)This same ‘‘apprehension’’ is felt when one merelytalks about death. Any middle-aged Vaqueiro reactsto the subject with worry, distress,aburrimiento,orbitterness, when noting the inevitability of death. Italso leads them to think about the futility of life, theselfishness of everyday life, the contrast betweenpleasure and entertainment, and the obligatoryending that must occur sooner or later. OftenVaqueiros prefer not to think or talk about thismatter.Death worries everybody. Just thinking about it. Be-cause one never dies without having thought about it.But just to think that no matter how long a life is, it won’tbe more than a hundred years. So that all that work, allthat slaving and all that loving . . . and then to think ‘‘Ihave to die.’’ You almost get depressed [te aburre] think-ing about it, eh? You almost get demoralized, and it’s likeyou don’t feel like working anymore. But we shouldn’tbe so bad or so selfish for the little time we have to live.Of course, sometimes it’s not fun, but there are alwaysmoments of pleasure, good times at fiestas and fairs, ofgoing from one thing to another . . . and then, nothing!Everybody dies. (Man, age 40)If they told me I was going to die tomorrow, I wouldn’tbe afraid; I’d be sad. The sadness of going away foreverand not coming back. Death. Here we are four days onloan. That’s what the whole world is if you stop tothink about it. But one can’t talk about this, eh? I don’twant to talk about it. (Woman, age 47)When people get old, they often lose their fear ofdeath. Thus certain elderly persons lose all aware-ness of their coming death; they are said ‘‘not to feelit.’’ Others resign themselves to it or even accept theidea. And finally there are those in severe pain who‘‘ask for death.’’ The quotes that follow provideexamples of these three ways of facing one’s death.There is a saying that when we get to be old we are likechildren, and it’s true.

Someone who isvery bad off asks for death, of course. A lot of them do!And they say, ‘‘Suffocate me, finish me off, I’ll forgiveyou if you stop my suffering.’’In the worst cases of bad death, both the personwho is dying and those who are witnessing thesuffering desire a quick ending. Life ceases to havemeaning in some circumstances. Here one of thesecases is compared with a case of tragic death.When somebody old dies, you feel confused. On theone hand it makes you sad, but on the other you arewanting death [for an older person]. Because when oneis that way, nothing helps, and one can’t enjoy theworld at all. If you’re going to be in bed all day and inpain, then what are you doing in the world? But a youngperson is different. Poor E [who died after an accident],what he went through! So young and healthy. Look, hewas the same age as I am now. Think about if I died now.And he just went into a coma, and there was nothingthat could be done. (Woman, age 18)It should be clear by now that death is not only auniversal biological fact but also a complex culturalevent. The Vaqueiros use language to express theirperception of similarities and differences among thedifferent ways of dying. By giving these differentways names, they give a certain order to an inher-ently chaotic human phenomenon. They are able toclassify death, even if in arbitrary and subjectiveways. The local taxonomy of death could be repre-sented as shown in table 8.1.Following the local procedure of expressing gen-eral distinctions by citing specific cases, I will con-clude this introduction with three descriptions. Eachshows the ethnographic context for the differentways of dying. I hope they bring color and spontan-eity to the more formal exposition above.A.Good Death (Happy)Three years ago on Maundy Thursday, over in N [aldea]a woman died suddenly. She was from X house in M[bran ̃a], and she had gone down with her grandchildrento mass, by burro. That was something! If she hadfallen off the burro on the way they would have saidthat the burro killed her. Anyway, down in N we wereall in X’s place [a bar/store]. I was standing up, gettingthings from the counter, and the woman was sitting ona bench. And she began to get purple, and stick out herarms and lean against a chair, and go over backwards,and the people went to grab her. Andala!She up anddied in J’s arms, just like that, without saying a word,she died. They called the priest, who must have been inhis house, and she was still breathing and moving.And the priest said, ‘‘We have to get a mattress.’’ Jwent upstairs and got a foam mattress, and theylaid her down on it. By then she wasn’t moving at all.And he said. ‘‘This woman’s not right here amongallthesepeople.Whydon’twetakeherupstairs?’’ And everyone carried her upstairs, andthey sent word to her house that she had died. Shewasn’t aware of anything. And that day they took herup to the house. Yes, dear, she didn’t suffer at all. Thatis a happy death.Table 8.1DeathGood DeathBad DeathTragic DeathHappy or suddenOf old age or naturalSlow or chronic illnessAccidental or by misfortuneViolentRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:02ampage 80Kinds of Death and the House80"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"B.Bad Death‘‘Bring me my clothes to lay me out in them, now!

I don’t know if itwas that night or the next day that she died. It smelledof blood and pus. What she suffered! She had a verybad death.C.Tragic Death (by Misfortune)With my father it was by misfortune. We were to-gether cutting a tree down by the river. And as I toldyou, for the felling of a tree, we had attached a ropehigh up, to pull for the direction of the fall. And when Isaw the tree was falling I called to him, and he ran fullspeed in the direction of the fall. A branch caught himon the head and felled him on the spot. He died there.All you could see was that he gritted his teeth, hismouth and nothing else! It slayed him instantly. He wasdead, but he could not be brought home because of thelaw. Some neighbors counseled me to take him home,others not, because someone could report it, de-nounce it, and they would take everything we had.The judge from T came here and men from B [a nearbybran ̃a] volunteered as guards as well, two of them, dayand night, almost twenty-four hours until the judgecame. It was winter, but they made a fire, since therewas wood. He wasn’t even sixty years old; fifty-six, Ithink. The doctors of N, when they performed theautopsy, said, ‘‘What a shame! What a chest this manhas!’’ I saw him die right in front of me. Thankgoodness there was a man from B nearby. I calledhim, and I cut the branch and he lifted him up. Welooked to see if there was any hope, but no. I waspretty afraid when he died. When the tree fell that gothim, he must have suffered a lot, but if you think aboutit, it was something sudden, maybe a second. Becausethose who die with a lot of pain, maybe over a numberof days, they suffer a lot.In the following chapters I will discuss at greaterlength natural death and violent death, the two polesof the categories the Vaqueiros have established.[...]The different values accorded to death apply both tothe Vaqueiros who die and to their survivors. A gooddeath is one that is hardly felt at all, rapid andwithout pain; a bad death supposes a long illness ora slow and painful agony together with a conscious-ness of the approaching end. For those who attendthe dying person, the good death is discreet; they say‘‘it’s almost not death,’’ and it happens while theVaqueiro is still participating in the collective workof the house. A bad death becomes a heavy burdenfor those who remain, adding to their other workand forcing them to share in the suffering andimpotence.While it might seem at first that the Vaqueirosrefuse to accept death, these descriptive categories infact involve a rejection of sickness and pain, and raisethe problem of the selectivity of death. Vaqueirosconsider the age of the person who dies very signifi-cant. They complain of the injustice involved whenpersons die who have not yet completed their lifecycle, who have not worked and taken pleasure asthey should have, those who still enjoy thegraciaofliving. When such persons die, even in the mostbenign cases of happy death or mortal accident,members of the group experience ‘‘surprise,’’‘‘worry,’’ anddescobertura– a sense of loss and ab-sence, which is not only affective but also economicRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:02ampage 81Marı ́aCa ́tedra81"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"for the people of the house of the deceased. By thesame token, one hears muted criticism of those who,when they are very old and have amply fulfilled theirlife’s cycle, ‘‘do not feel death’’ or ‘‘do not know thatthey have to die.’’ When these persons die, survivorsfeel serenity and also a certain relief. Vaqueiro atti-tudes toward death thus depend on the context inwhich the death occurs.My analysis of natural death and violent deathbrings out the contrast between these two differentways of dying. Death of old age means the continu-ation of the cycle of nature on a human level. OldVaqueiros ‘‘dry up’’ like the grass of the meadows inwinter, ‘‘finish up’’ like the animals of the Vaqueirostable, ‘‘die like birds.’’ Birds exemplify a sweet andquiet end, one that is barely noticeable and in accordwith in the laws of the universe. Some Vaqueirosachieve this ideal: death finds them gathering wood,on a quiet walk, or shopping in thealdea. Without aperiod of sickness and suffering (these people aresaid to die ‘‘healthy’’), death results from a physicalexhaustion or emptying in which the dying personnever loses his or her social personality. Those whoare with them accept the fact of death with tranquil-lity.The house is the context for death in thebran ̃a.This family enterprise provides the frame for death asit does for life, the last recourse even of those whohad to abandon it so that it might survive. With eachchange of generation, the house, along with its oldamo, suffers a crisis that the various legal dispositionsgoverning the transmission of the property attemptto overcome.The transmission of the house presents a dilemmafor the Vaqueiro who is going to die. On the onehand, the house, through its continuity, offers theonly possibility for immortality. The oldamowho inhis day received the house from ‘‘those who wentbefore’’ and ‘‘who sweated’’ there, who raised afamily there, wants the house ‘‘to go on’’ with‘‘those who come afterwards.’’ The duty to increasethe house, or at least transmit it without loss to thenext generation in an orderly succession, involves alesson of humility – the recognition of one’s owntransience in relation to the permanence of the insti-tution. Human beings die but the house survives.The oldamosthus are linked in the collective butanonymous chain that built the house. The fact thatthe house survives even when there are no bonds ofkinship, when transmission from father to son is notpossible, demonstrates the importance of the house.Perhaps even more significant, when the oldamomust choose one of his children as the heir, hethereby virtually disinherits the others, doing akind of violence to his own blood, especially whenhe must take into account, among other things, theaptitude of the preferred child to continue the housein spite of his own personal preferences. When thetwo roles of the elderly Vaqueiro,amoand parent,come into conflict, the dilemma is usually resolved infavor of theamo. Being a ‘‘good parent,’’ that is,favoring all of one’s children equally, is inconsistentwith being a ‘‘goodamo’’ and choosing the child bestsuited for the house. If anamovacillates in makingthis choice or he refuses to make it altogether, he willbe criticized severely by the Vaqueiro community.The house holds other more practical and subject-ive interests for the elderly Vaqueiro. Traditionallythe system of inheritance provided a way for theamoto ensure himself a peaceful old age, providing forcare in sickness and company in death. From thispoint of view, the house is a property that one offersto those who might be interested, children orhere-deiros. At times, when relations are strained andespecially when the property is small, the oldamoshave to offer the heirs something more than thetenuous promise of preferring them in a will. Thesolution in such cases may be the deeding of theproperty or, more recently, the ceding of control,now made possible by the old-age subsidy. Thissubsidy demonstrates the endemic insecurity, botheconomic and affective, of the elderly, together withthe efforts and legal ingenuity of the culture inprotecting them. Until the old-age subsidy was insti-tuted, the legal title to the house was the principalweapon of the elderly, together with control over theprofits the house produced, in order to ensure dig-nity in old age.The dying Vaqueiro must negotiate between twocontradictory desires: the perpetuation of the houseand personal care. The various cultural solutions aimat maintaining a difficult equilibrium between themoral obligation to continue a house and the per-emptory necessity for personal security. But all solu-Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:02ampage 82Kinds of Death and the House82"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"tions are inevitably partial: by placing the emphasison one aspect or another, certain conflicts are re-solved but others are created. One of the mostfrequent conflicts of this sort is the deterioration ofrelations between the older and younger couplewithin the house. The latter often resent their lackof independence and participation in family deci-sions, because they are doing most of the work ofthe house.Today ceding control of themandois perhaps themost viable attempt at solving the dilemma. In thisrespect the old-age subsidy also helps the young.Ceding control allows for an effective and gradualsuccession of one generation by another, comparedwith the definitive and drastic changeover of death orthe deeding of the title. In such a situation, there is apossibility of combining the experience of years withthe strength and vitality of the young. This methoddoes not always work. At times there are clashes andconflicts between the two generations because oftheir differing ways of administering the house, andespecially because of their differing ways of thinkingabout it. The oldamohas a ‘‘faith’’ and an ‘‘affection’’for his home that the youngamodoes not alwaysshare. The greater possibilities of emigration andwork available outside thebran ̃anow make the trad-itional hope of becoming anamoless attractive. Inlocal terminology, becoming anamois now some-times seen as becoming the ‘‘slave’’ of one’s house.Ceding control is also the first stage in the transi-tion to death. The diminishing of responsibility andwork coincide with a change in diet and the gradualloss ofgracia. Learning to die is a process like learn-ing to live. The child who is born in thebran ̃astays inthe house at least until he goes to school, a time thatmarks his formal entry in the outside world. Hegradually begins to become interested in extrafami-lial relations and creates his own kind of bonds toothers. In old age a reverse process occurs in whichthere is an increasing disinterest in social life, eatingand working, fiestas and entertainment, relationswith neighbors, and interchanges with friends. At acertain point, children and the elderly coincide intheir reclusion in the house. As Vaqueiros say, ‘‘Youare a child twice.’’ The elderly and children performsimilar services in the house and develop a bond offriendship and solidarity.Graciasignifies a pleasure in living, both everydayand social: traveling, seeing friends, going to themarket, and playing cards. This social expansivenessis represented by metaphors of body expansion andlightness. Conversely, the loss ofgraciameans shrink-age and heaviness. Losinggraciais not just a matter ofage, since there are some old people who have quitea lot ofgracia. The main cause of the diminution ofgraciais the increasing heaviness of blood. Blood is ametonymic sign for life; the absence of movement inblood or human beings is the characteristic trait ofdeath.Vaqueiros are able to maintain theirgraciaas longas they ‘‘defend themselves,’’ that is, as long as theycan can contribute is some way to the work of thehouse, maintain an appetite, get around thebran ̃a,orcare for children. The old-age subsidy today helpsthe elderly to maintaingraciabecause it allows themto be economically independent, preventing themfrom becoming a burden on the house. OtherVaqueiros hold in high esteem the elderly who, inspite of their age, ‘‘defend’’ themselves with dignity;they praise those willing to do the small tasks theyare able to perform. The loss ofgraciasignifies theentry into a phase of defenselessness that culminatesin death.Once the old Vaqueiro has taken to bed, he or shehas reached the maximum separation in the processof reclusion. Nevertheless, it is at this point that afinal and intense sociability forms around the sickperson. Members of the household provide the threebasic aspects of care: food, hygiene, and company.The rest of the community also participates in theprocess of sickness, helping in the work of the housein various ways, watching over the sleep of the sickperson, and especially visiting. The same thingoccurs when a Vaqueiro mother gives birth; thepresents that she receives from relatives, friends,and neighbors are virtually the same. Like themother who has just given birth, the sick personhas urges for certain foods, which are generouslysupplied by the members of the house and by visit-ors. Like the young mother’s, the sick person’s diet iscomposed of unusual foods, fiesta fare rather thanthe everyday food of thebran ̃a. The similarity ofritual in both transitions suggests that death andbirth have many points in common.

At the same time, thebran ̃aneighborsmonitor the condition of the sick person, makingsure that the family fulfills its obligations.Representatives of the outside world – the doctor,the priest, and the notary public also appear at thehouse at the time of death. The visits of these special-ists tend to occur when the house is full of people.This is particularly true of the priest, whose arrivalbrings out thebran ̃aresidents to participate in thereligious ritual. Grave illness or death is the onlyformal occasion on which the intimacy of Vaqueirohome is opened to the outside. Normally theVaqueiros go to the doctor and the notary in town,and see the priest at mass in thealdea. The respectivejurisdictions of these professionals – over the body,legal status, and the soul – define the Vaqueiros andprovide official recognition of their deaths.If death from old age may be seen as the culmin-ation of a natural process, suicide involves a sharp anddrastic interruption of this process. Suicide is in somesense the most ‘‘cultural’’ way of death because itoccurs according to the will of the Vaqueiro. Culturenot only provides a set of norms for dying but also thepossibility of violating these norms in certain circum-stances. The examination of the motives that lead tosuicide shows the existence of conflict in theVaqueiro society as well as a system of values aboutlife and death – when and why it is worth living, andwhen and why it is worth ending one’s life. I willsummarize these circumstances below.Many suicides are considered ‘‘normal’’ by thegroup, and many persons who commit suicide arenot considered sick in any way. What is more,suicide, although it may be considered a mistake, isnot regarded as a sin or a crime. In the propercircumstances, anyone may do it.Suicide is something that gets into the head fromthinking wrong. I’m not sure, dearie, what I woulddo, I’m not sure. It is a mistake, of course, it has to be amistake.It seems to me to be something done backwards.That you should die when God wants it, and notbefore. Of course, when they’re in pain, I don’tknow, since it never happened to me.Among the circumstances leading to suicide maybe a desire to avoid the punishment of the law.Vaqueiros generally agree that death in thebran ̃aispreferable to life in jail. They consider suicide areasonable expiation or corrective for a crime orwrong decision. In the case of the attempted homi-cide, additional factors included an implicit fear of aserious economic loss for the house, the advancedage of the man, and the probability of his receiving alife sentence. In the face of the law and the courts,the Vaqueiro, as we have seen, feels impotent anddefenseless.A similar feeling of defenselessness results fromprolonged sickness. When there is no hope that theperson will get better and a bad death is expected,suicide is considered a ‘‘logical’’ solution. TheVaqueiros regard suicide as humanly reasonable incases of chronic or painful illness because they live ina society where the use of painkillers traditionally hasnot been an option. Those around the suicide mayeven look on this act as ethical and moral, becausethe illness of a member of the house, especially whenthe treatment is long and costly, can lead to the lossof the household savings and the amassing of substan-tial debts. The possibility of suffering, combinedwith the possibility of making others suffer, thuscan be more unbearable than the idea of death.Suicide usually has its meaning or its motivesin the house. Those suicides that result from familyor marital disputes show up the conflicts and in-equalities in the system of inheritance and its cor-responding distribution of roles in the house. Insuch cases, much of the responsibility for thesuicide is attributed to the surviving members ofthe household, but in a way so subtle and diffusethat, while it serves as a warning to the guilty, it doesnot threaten their daily relations with the commu-nity. Given that all of the houses are organized in thesame way, these diffuse accusations serve as negativemodels, behavior to avoid, and allow for a collectiverecognition of guilt in which all Vaqueiros partici-pate.Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:02ampage 84Kinds of Death and the House84"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Within the house, certain persons appear moresusceptible to suicide. The transmission of the prop-erty brings theamosecurity in old age and guaranteesthat he will be treated acceptably, for he can choosethe child he prefers as heir and, by threatening tochange the will, blackmail him or her into behavingwell. But the other inhabitants of the house are‘‘defenseless’’ when involved in the household ten-sions. Among the ‘‘disinherited’’ persons are thewomen, who very rarely areamas. Those womenmost likely to commit suicide are twenty-one tothirty years old, the age at which the ‘‘newcomer’’women are adjusting to their new houses and to thedifficult roles of daughter-in-law, wife, and mother.The young woman faces a sharp change from thepreceding period,la mocedad(approximately agesfourteen to twenty), which most women rememberas one of the happiest times of their lives.La mocedadis a time of courtship, characterized by frequentattendance at dances, fairs, and diversions. It is acritical period in that the choice a woman makeswill determine her entire future. It is necessary toweigh the candidates carefully. A good match wouldbe amayorazowith a good house that is easy to work inand has few relatives, but if the girl waits too long tofind her mate, she runs the risk of remaining single orwasting her time. Hence in her late twenties, whenshe is in danger of becoming an old maid [moza vieja],a Vaqueiro woman will become less choosy. Marriagemeans the end of diversions and the beginning of aperiod of hard work, many obligations, and fewrights. Many mature women lamented to me theirchoice of mates; they vividly remember their sorrowat leaving their own home and their conflicts withtheir mothers-in-law and sisters-in-law in the newhouse. Even after many years of residence in the newhouse, when they speak of ‘‘my’’ house, they refer tothe house in which they were born, in contrast to‘‘this’’ house, the one in which they now live.The high suicide rate for women in their twentiesmust be understood in this context. But it is signifi-cant that few people spontaneously mentioned localcases of suicide of this sort, although they oftenadmitted that this age is full of unpleasantness and‘‘life problems.’’ I think this avoidance of the subjecthas two sides. The first is that these are the suicidesthe people find most intolerable: they involve thedisappearance of young persons ‘‘in their prime oflife,’’ for reasons for which all Vaqueiro feel a littleguilty. By the same token, the suicides of olderpersons – mothers-in-law rather than daughters-in-law, for example – which are viewed as less morallyunjust, are spoken of more frequently. In severalcases, the suicides of young women were ascribedto ‘‘nerves,’’ even though it was recognized thatthere were conflicts in the house. It seems thatmany women of this age have ‘‘the nerves,’’ some-thing I noticed myself. Once this condition is diag-nosed, the behavior of the other members of thehouse toward the ‘‘newcomer’’ tends to improve.A second reason why people were reluctant tomention female suicides is the lack of salience ofwomen in the culture. According to Soto Va ́zquez,female Vaqueiros commit suicide almost as fre-quently as males (49 cases compared to 62). But inthe cases of suicides mentioned to me, only ninewomen were mentioned compared with thirtymen. It seems that the suicides of women are lessfrequently noticed and remembered than the suicidesofamosbecause of the woman’s weak juridical statusin the house. As regards status, women, especiallythose who have not had children, resemble the bach-elor uncle or any of the other ‘‘old people of thehouse.’’ The distinction between women andamosbecomes clear as well in the amount of publicityand number of attendees at their respective funeralsand postmortem rituals. Note that in case 14 citedabove, which involved anama, the man of the housecomplained before committing suicide that ‘‘nobodypaid him any attention,’’ and that ‘‘he was nobody inthe house.’’ In the legal sense, all women who are notamasare ‘‘nobody’’ in the house, at least until theyhave children; even then, their rights depend on theirsons.Although conflicts in the houses principally affectwomen, some men find the role ofamounbearable.Because they are responsible for the prosperity andperpetuation of the house, a serious economic blun-der that ‘‘does the house in [acaba con la casa],’’ or anerror in foresight that leaves the house without asuccessor, can lead to much remorse and personalanguish. Both situations imply that theamohas madea mistake: either he does not know how to run thehouse or he has not exercised enough authorityRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:02ampage 85Marı ́aCa ́tedra85"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"within the household. Being anamodemands anassertive personality. Given the difficulties of theVaqueiro environment and the conflictive social or-ganization of the household and thebran ̃a, theamomust sometimes be tough and aggressive. He mustknow how to defend himself in the family and in thebran ̃a, where some houses take advantage of theweakness of others in order to expand (at times inthe crudest ways – by moving boundary markers orappropriating disputed fields). The role of theamo,with its implicit responsibility for the direction anddecisions that affect the house, is the opposite of thatof the bachelor uncle, who must work and obey.Some people are not at ease in their respectivepositions; for them, suicide is one way out.Attributing a suicide to mental illness allowspeople to avoid the issue of responsibility. Mentallyretarded persons who commit suicide are alsothought not to have any responsibility for theiractions. It is thought that because both the mentallyill and the mentally retarded do not follow thenormal rules of reasoning, any incident may leadthem to kill themselves. The Vaqueiros do distin-guish a less serious and more transitory kind ofmental problem: ‘‘suffering from nerves.’’ As I haveindicated, this may be an expression of conflictbetween the individual and the household. It istaken as a warning of the need for a change inbehavior by the rest of the household lest the sickperson have a ‘‘spell of craziness,’’ an ‘‘attack,’’ or a‘‘bad hour.’’ In these cases it is thought that certainphysiological causes – violent blood and the burstingof the nerves in the head – can initiate the process ofself-destruction if others do not avoid flare-ups andarguments as much as possible.These spells or strains [ramos] that lead to suicideare believed to be ‘‘inherited,’’ since they are trans-mitted in the house like other qualities or defects –the art of cooking, devoutness, studiousness, orthievery – although they affect some individualsmore than others. The factor of ‘‘inheritance’’ im-plies a shift from the scrutiny of individual motivesand social situations to that of the history of the houseand its members. Vaqueiros intuitively relate per-sonal disorders to the diachronic process of thefamily system as it unfolds within the confines ofthe house. Family precedents, repeated suicides inthe same house or even in the samebran ̃a, pose with acertain starkness the eternal truth that we are allproducts of the past and models for the future, or, inlocal terms, that ‘‘there are things that go beyondpersons.’’Indeed, ‘‘inheritance’’ seems to have certain de-terministic aspects that turns it into ‘‘destiny,’’ whichin thebran ̃ais thought to be directed by God. Suicideis thus a moral expiation, a settling of accounts withthe heavenly court, either for one’s own debts or forthose of prior members of the house. Possession ofthe house thereby supposes not only certain materialobjects but also these old faults, which can beredeemed only by obeying the Ten Commandments.I will treat religion at length in a later chapter, but Inote here that the loss of life in itself is consideredsufficient punishment for the person who commitssuicide and further expiation in the ‘‘other world’’ isnot expected. After death, suicides are distinguishedfrom those who have died naturally only by certainacts carried out by the civil and religious authorities;the Vaqueiros consider these acts efforts to discour-age others from doing the same thing. Here is howthe Vaqueiros describe these differences:And you know that they can’t put those who commitsuicide in the church either. That’s right; the personswho commit suicide, hang themselves, or shoot them-selves or things like that, they aren’t put in the church.You know that they take dead bodies to thechurch. Well, I went to X to the burial, and theydidn’t put it in the church. He hanged himself in acherry tree there by the house. They say that suchpersons find themselvesarrepentidos.With them it’s different. Sometimes they have to goto the cemetery and so autopsy, and open their heads.I’ve never seen that and I hope to God I never do,because it’s bad to see it, but they have to lift up the lidon the brains.In addition to the specific motives given as causesfor suicide, local explanations often point to a pro-cess calledaburrimiento, a concept I generally haveleft untranslated. The situations that this term refersto include all of those that may lead Vaqueiros to endtheir lives: the people of thebran ̃a se aburrenbecauseof sickness, because they cannot defend themselves,when they see ‘‘the bad things in the houses,’’ or seeRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:02ampage 86Kinds of Death and the House86"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"‘‘everything going wrong’’; because there are people‘‘who pick on them’’ in the house when they are old,because of the ‘‘problems of life’’ when they areyoung, and because of loneliness, lack of money,debts, and even ‘‘the nerves.’’ All of these negativeaspects of Vaqueiro life produce, individually or incombination, a state of mind that begins with the lossofgracia, disinterest in life, and culminates with anabhorrence of life.That’s it – they see that they areaburrı ́osof life. No,they’re not wrong in the head, no, I think they see thatthey areaburrı ́os, aburrı ́os.They see that they areaburrı ́osof life. They see theyareaburridosand so they say, ‘‘So, I’ll do this to end it.’’Ay Dios!They have to be in a bad way, a bad way inorder to do it.Life isgracia– interest in things, activity, andstruggle;aburrimientomeans being tired, irked, andloathing life. It is associated with the state ofarrepen-timiento, an express renunciation of living. TheVaqueiroarrepentidofinds death is the only solution.No, the one who does it is considerablyarrepentı ́o.Arrepentı ́ois when one is worn out,aburrı ́o, when oneis not able to go out to another town, or do anythingelse, when one thinks about it, when one is oppressedby the idea of it, when it seems that it is the bestsolution, when one finds oneself forced to do it.When that happens, it’ll be because they arearre-pentı ́os; they don’t have another solution, and they findthemselves alone, and theyse aburrenand they come tothat.Hombre, I feel they don’t have any other choicebecause in order for them to hang themselves they haveto be reallyarrepentı ́os.Aburrimientois evidence of the stress, conflicts,and inequalities of the inheritance system. But insome way the violence is inevitable. The familysystem here and everywhere is always arbitrary; itsolves some problems and it creates others. If the lossofgraciafollows a gradual and natural process ofdisinterest and disillusion with life,aburrimientoim-plies that this process is hastened. Although physic-ally alive, thearrepentidos, once they have lostgracia,can be considered as socially and cognitively dead. Sosuicides properly hurry on their own death. Living,in certain circumstances, makes no sense. Death is aflight from pain and human suffering.Well, they are people who are cowards, whose arre-pienten, who give up. Seeing myself in this situation.. . . Because you have to havevalorfor that . . . youhave to bearrepentı ́o.I don’t know what they think. They think, ‘‘Perhapsif I end my life, I’ll end my suffering, I won’t sufferanymore.’’ Leaving is a way of getting out of the way.In the next chapters I will examine where theVaqueiros go when they ‘‘leave.’’[...]Perhaps the reader will agree by now that theprocess of death is broader than has been tradition-ally conceived. The relation of death with pain, age,and suffering seems to be critical for understandingthe death process coherently. Where the boundariesof this process lie must be determined for a givenculture. Death is no simple and obvious fact; it is acomplex mass of beliefs, emotions, and activities thatdiffer from one society to another are added to theorganic event. Sickness and suicide are as integral tothe process of death as mortuary ritual and theconditions of afterlife.Death cannot be separated from its social context.It primarily affects the house in which it occurs, butcertain deaths have more important social meaningthan others, especially those of the oldamos. Theirdeaths signify a relay of generations, the transmissionof property, the periodic crisis critical for the sur-vival of the institution and the human beings thatpeople it. The permanence of the house requires thatthe oldamobe considered a usufructuary, one link inan immortal chain. The ideology of the house affectsthe different personalities of those who live there,whether that of the father who should be in charge orthose of other members who must be silent andobey. The natural death of the oldamo, attended bya well-chosen heir with a family, is evidence ofsuccess in worldly terms, a guarantee of continuity.Conversely, violent death, particularly suicide dueto domestic problems, points up the negative aspectsof the Vaqueiro way of passing houses. The housesolves some problems but creates others that, inextreme cases and with certain kinds of people, areRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:02ampage 87Marı ́aCa ́tedra87"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"resolved in suicide. It is impossible, of course, topredict which individuals will commit suicide, but itis not at all difficult to figure out what kinds ofpeople are most likely to do it. Most vulnerable tosuicide, aside from theamoswho find it impossible tofulfill their roles adequately, are the women andthose who do not inherit. They are locally character-ized as ‘‘defenseless’’ within the system of houses.Studying natural death without considering vio-lent death, or vice versa, would be partial and insuf-ficient. The former shows how the house isorganized, the relation of the individual to the col-lectivity, the structural norms, the ordinary proced-ures, and the ordered relations; the latter identifiesproblems in human relations, structural tensions,flaws in communication, and endemic family con-flicts. The two kinds of death provide differentperspectives on the institution of the house. Yetone frequently finds these ways of dying examinedin isolation, providing an excessively dark andnegative or unnaturally idylic and happy viewof the community studied, the one permeated byviolence and aggressivity, the other by solidarity andmutual aid. One wants to ask, ‘‘Does everybody diethis way?’’The house is not isolated in its sorrow but issupported by the wider Vaqueiro community. At acertain point, death becomes a collective affair, bothin requiring a house to live up to its responsibilitiesand in supplying it with its due. First the sick person,then the dead person, becomes the center of thecommunity. Significantly, the attentions are similar(a visit and presents) for those who are born andthose who are dying. Elaborate interchanges areorganized between those of the house, those fromthebran ̃a, and those from the outside. The doors ofthe house are open (and so is its pantry) more or lessaccording to the different degrees of social inter-action and geographical proximity. In the funeralprocess all levels of social relation are present andexplicitly distinguished.This collective organization can be seen in thegroup of specialists who appear to make the arrange-ments after death (those who shroud, pray, cook, cutthe bread, make the coffin). Their help is evidencenot only of solidarity but also of necessity, for thereare no commercial alternatives in thebran ̃as.Inaddition to these specialists, there are other, lessvisible helpers – those who cut the dead person’shay or carry the body down the mountainside. Inaddition to the specialists who appear at death, thereare those who came before (nurse-practitioners andmidwives, healers and bonesetters, prayer personsand diviners) and those who come after (spirits anda ́nimas, and again prayer persons and diviners). Allcomprise a generous response to precise ecologicalconditions, but they are much more: links betweennature and the Vaqueiros, the sick and the healthy,the living and the dead, and the saints and humans.The house continues to have fundamental valueafter death. The dead belong to the house as do theemigrants. When a house is inherited, all of its deadcome along with it. Eternal rest, the payment ofpending debts, and the immobility of the dead aretransacted by means of the house. The continuity ofthe relation between the living and the dead is aresult of their mutual dependence as well as theirmutual identity: what remains of the dead in us andwhat the dead have taken away that is ours.The social context is just one aspect of the processof death. The ideological aspect – how it is defined,evaluated, and predicted – helps us to understand it indifferent ways. A natural death is considered to be thehuman equivalent of death in nature, hence the fre-quent comparisons of this kind of death with the stateof meadows in winter, with old cows, and especiallywith birds, metaphors for the environment that pointto the lack of violence or rupture in this kind of dying.The old Vaqueiros who die naturally do so withoutillness. They die from old age, when their blood, thesap of their life, wears out. They disappear withoutcausing trouble for the survivors, even helping outwith small tasks, ‘‘defending themselves until the veryend.’’An unfortunate death is one in which the naturalprocess is interrupted by external causes or humanagents. Death by suicide is perhaps the least ‘‘nat-ural’’ and most ‘‘cultural’’ way of death: it impliesa social cause in the majority of the cases, such aslegal or familial problems, or a physical cause, suchas disease, which has grave social consequences –pain and suffering for the severely ill and forthose who care for them. Suicide shows up theVaqueiros’ lack of defenses, which, for whateverRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:02ampage 88Kinds of Death and the House88"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"reason, have led them to interrupt the normal pro-cess of life.For me the most interesting aspect of death lies inits cultural definition: the Vaqueiros do not automat-ically disappear at physical death but continue on along passage that began in life with the physical,social, legal, and intellectual decline of the Vaqueiro,or, in local terms, with the loss ofgracia. Differentpersons losegraciain different ways: some lose itgently and slowly (those who die natural deaths),others lose it swiftly and sharply (those who dieviolent deaths). Loss ofgraciahas physical causes(the change of speed of the blood) and social con-comitants (changes of diet and a reduction in activity,work, and responsibility). A consequence of thisprocess is the handing over of control in the house.This transfer of legal responsibility is repeated in thesocial sphere by a reduction of social activity and thegradual restriction of the radius of interaction fromthe region of thebran ̃ato the house. Finally, as theintellectual faculties decline, people can lose theirawareness of life and death.The factors that contribute to the maintenance ofgraciaare good health, (‘‘a good stomach’’), interestin work and activity, economic independence, theintensity of family and friendship relations, accept-able mental health, and so on. Obversely, a painfuland chronic illness, personal insecurity, becoming aburden on others, and not being able to take care ofoneself all lead toaburrimientolack of interest inliving, or toarrepentimiento, the express renunciationof life. Life isgracia, a pleasure in things, activity, anda struggle;aburrimientomeans tiredness, impotence,and passivity. Withaburrimiento, death is preferableto life.One learns how to die just as one learns how tolive. The child born in thebran ̃astays in the house atfirst, only gradually venturing out to get involved insocial relations beyond the family and outside thebran ̃a. In death this process is reversed; there is agradual disengagement from social life, from fiestasand entertainment, from relations with friends andneighbors, and from work and eating.Gracia, as Pitt-Rivers (1989) suggests, is a gift from the gods, butso, too, isdesgracia, misfortune. From this point ofview, suicide is not the strange, aberrant, unnaturalact it is usually considered to be, but rather a decisionthat any Vaqueiro might come to in certain circum-stances, the end result of a coherent process.Indeed, it might be said that some Vaqueiros,although physically alive, are socially and cognitivelydead when they have lost theirgracia. The loss ofgraciais not just a psychological state but also acultural category imposed on the individual withgiven symptoms. This is precisely what the belief inthe spirits of the living implies. A spirit is evidence ofthe existence of death in life or the continuance oflife after death. The spirit of the living is the culturalself that has died, divorced from the physical self thatis still alive. In other words, people can begin tobelong to the world of the dead before clinical death.It is possible that many of the suicides, those who are‘‘accelerating’’ their deaths, belong to this class of theliving dead when they lose their grace.There is plenty of behavioral evidence for theduality of spirits. Spirits do not, as is frequentlysupposed, come in one uniform model; rather, theycome in many types, and these types change, rangingfrom animals to divine beings. Anthropological lit-erature may portray spirits as aggressive (one wantsto ask, are all of them so?) or may emphasize theirnature as judges and benefactors. These oversimpli-fications may be due to a synchronic approach thatleaves out the different kinds of spirits (both livingand dead), the different ‘‘ages’’ of the spirits (therecent, the longer gone) that change over time, andtheir various situations (they may be in good or badplaces).After a process of domestication, thanks to thelight of the candles that family members provide toilluminate its trip, the spirit metamorphoses from anight bird into a day bird, a symbol of the divine. Atthe end of this long journal, the spirits becomeA ́nimas; they become immobile and command a cultfrom the living like that of the saints. We find thesame fluctuation in the continuum of specialists whotalk with the dead and the saints – from spiritists tothe shamanlikea ́nimasto the prayer persons. Theseintermediaries try to maintain a difficult equilibriumbetween thebran ̃aand the outside, and between thisworld and other worlds.As I have shown, the Vaqueiros express theirperceptions of the different categories of existenceby means of metaphorical associations with theRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:02ampage 89Marı ́aCa ́tedra89"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"animals around them. From the living person tosaint, from theamoof the house to theamoof thesky or heaven, there is a series of transitions, anelaborate gradient of the different possibilities ofbeing. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of thisvision of the cosmos is that there is no quantumleap, no sharp division between the living and thedead, between human beings and divine beings.Ethnographic descriptions of other peoples remarkon similarities between the humans and God, howwe resemble those we venerate. The Vaqueiros, withtheir belief in spirits andA ́nimas, extend this similar-ity farther. For them, divine beings are humanbeings, too. I wonder whether we have a generaltendency to reify unnecessarily the boundaries ofpopular categories, perhaps overconditioned by thetraditional subdivisions of the discipline and ourpenchant for closed mental compartments. Wheredoes religion begin and social structure end? Are theA ́nimassupernatural beings or the distant kin of theVaqueiros? What are the similarities and differencesbetween apparitions of saints and apparitions ofneighbors? This last question itself merits anotherstudy. Such a study might well be informed by theVaqueiro notion that holiness is not an absolute butrather a relative state, a state that presupposes anapprenticeship, a period of domestication like theapprenticeship necessary in the life of society for theliving and in the afterlife for the dead.REFERENCEPitt-Rivers, J., 1989.

The human-ities and social sciences have also sounded regularwarnings: Jacques Ellul claimed, for example, that‘‘Technique has becomeautonomous; it has fashionedan omnivorous world which obeys its own laws andwhich has renounced all tradition,’’1a sentimentechoed by John Kenneth Galbraith, Rene DuBos,and Martin Heidegger, each from their very differentvantage points. Autonomy in the Kantian tradition is,of course, associated with the notion of free will, ofan individual no longer subject to externally createdlaws. As Langdon Winner has pointed out, the veryidea of an autonomous technology raises an ‘‘unset-tling irony, for the expected relationship of subjectand object is exactly reversed.’’2We humans haveapparently lost out to the monster, but neverthelessrush eagerly ahead creating new devices. Like Shivain Hindu iconography, Bryan Pfaffenberger suggests,technology, as seen through a modernist lens at least,is both creator and destroyer, an agent of futurepromise and of culture’s destruction.3It has generally been assumed that the majordriving force behind the creation of technologiesis to meet universal human needs. Herbert Marcusewas one who accepted this position, and, althoughhe was concerned about the way in which theproducts of technological progress could be sub-verted under the name of rationality for ideologicalpurposes, he nevertheless emphasized that masteryof nature could, if properly applied, be associatedwith freedom and autonomy.4Ju ̈rgen Habermas,building in part on Marcuse, insisted that an appar-ent consensus created around the supposed ration-ality of technological progress veils the interests ofpowerful elites and removes debate from the publicsphere.5Activities associated with technology arefar from autonomous; on the contrary, they areintimately associated with the social and politicalorder. Nevertheless, for both Marcuse and Haber-mas, since the creation of technology is a rationalendeavor designed to meet universal human needs,there is nothing inherently questionable about theendeavor, provided that one goes about it in theright way.G. Basalla and M. Sahlins take more radical pos-itions, ones with which most anthropologists wouldagree; they stress that, aside from the fundamentalrequisites for sustaining life, it is culture and notnature that defines necessity. Necessity is not, afterall, the mother of invention in any predeterminedway; rather, human technology is a ‘‘material mani-festation of the various ways men and womenthroughout time have chosen to define and pursueexistence.’’6Technology is thus an integral part of thehistory of human aspirations and ‘‘the plethora ofmade things are a product of human minds repletewith fantasies, longings, wants, and desires.’’7Tosimply link technology with power is to leave tacitthe dominant modernist ideology of progress as aninherently rational pursuit to which culture makes nocontribution.It is easy to assume that among the many forms oftechnology those related to medicine exist, by defin-ition, to meet basic human needs, in particular toreduce suffering and avert premature death. It is notsurprising, perhaps, that aside from a concern aboutrunaway expenditure and unwanted side effects onthe body, there has been, until recently, relativelylittle resistance, in principle, to the development andapplication of medical technology. Despite the factthat the interests of powerful elites are often directlyinvolved with the creation, manufacture, distribu-tion, and application of medical technology,8theassumption that techniques that allow us to penetratewith increasing facility into the recesses of the body,together with those that supposedly relieve pain andprolong life, are inevitably for the good usually holdssway.Over the past two decades it has become in-creasingly clear that biomedical technologies areby no means autonomous and, moreover, that thecharacterization of suffering, being culturally con-structed, has a profound influence on their devel-opment, associated discourse, and application. It isin connection with the application of reproductivetechnologies, neonatal intensive care, genetic en-gineering, organ transplantation, and dying thatcontested domains have become most evident.That dispute has emerged around these dramaticmanipulations should come as no surprise, fortheir application necessarily involves debate abouttacit knowledge of what constitutes life anddeath.Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:02am page 92Displacing Suffering: The Reconstruction of Death in North America and Japan92"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"In North America particularly, efforts to reducesuffering have habitually focused on control andrepair of individual bodies. The social origins ofsuffering and distress, including poverty and dis-crimination, even if fleetingly recognized, are setaside, while effort is expanded in controlling diseaseand averting death through biomedical manipula-tions.9Disputes with respect to biomedical technol-ogy usually revolve around the question of individualrights, autonomy, and justice. Activists have focusedon abuse of individual patients by powerful elites,but very few commentators have stepped back andasked why, for example, infertility, menopause, andaging should be conceptualized as diseases, or whywe struggle to save extremely premature infants butshow little concern about the reasons for their pre-mature birth or the social consequences of theircontinued existence.This essay will focus on disputes in North Americaand Japan that are associated with the transplantationof major organs, together with the required redefin-ition of death necessary to implement this technol-ogy. Were it not for the development of the ironlung, an ostensibly autonomous, supremely utilitar-ian piece of technology, and its successor, the artifi-cial respirator or ventilator, by means of which manypeople who can no longer breathe independently arekept alive, there would be no debate today about thereduction of suffering and the ‘‘saving’’ of livesthrough transplant technology. The artificial respir-ator clearly meets a basic need, but the uses to whichit is put today have implications that reach far beyondthe simple function of sustaining breathing on atemporary basis. Transplant technology, involvingthe removal of body fluids or parts from one person,and their insertion into a second person designated asneedy, could never be mistaken for a value freeendeavor – from its inception, at the very minimum,altruism was inevitably implicated.10Once certainpatients on the artificial ventilator were harnessed tothe heroic and showy technology of organ trans-plants, it became apparent, particularly to thoseinvolved in medical practice, that there was someurgency to clarify exactly what is meant by biologicaldeath.It would seem that there can be very little roomfor ideological posturing in connection with definingdeath – most of us raised in the contemporary Westbelieve, I suspect, that death is a rather easily defin-able point of no return about which there can belittle argument. Japan, like North America, is intheory a predominantly secular society, and is simi-larly driven by principles of rational order and scien-tific progress, principles that are evident in manyaspects of the health-care systems on both sides ofthe Pacific. However, in Japan the possibility oftinkering with death has opened up the floodgatesof a concern that reaches far beyond the demise ofindividuals, whereas in North America, by contrast,death was quietly redefined in 1968 by an elite groupof Harvard physicians, and further modified in 1981so that the concept of ‘‘whole-brain death’’ is nowrecognized in the Uniform Determination of DeathAct as equivalent to the end of life. There was a briefperiod in the late 1960s when public concern aboutthese changes was evident, but today, in the greatmajority of North American hospitals, brain deathis accepted as the end of life, and the ‘‘harvesting’’of organs from brain dead bodies has becomeroutinized.This contrast between North America and Japaninvites comparison of the different forms the searchtakes in late modernity for the relief of suffering andthe creation of a just and moral order, together withan examination of the relationship this search has tothe production and application of scientific and tech-nological knowledge. It is now apparent in mostcorners of the world, except perhaps in the heartof Leviathan, that science, in particular biomedicine,has come to be thought of by many as one form ofneo-imperialism. In an era of struggles to create andrecreate cultural identities and establish the groundsof cultural difference, the self-conscious possessionof scientific knowledge, or, alternatively, its repudi-ation as inauthentic or culturally inappropriate, isexplicitly made use of as an ideological tool toestablish local power bases and authority. The pro-duction and circulation of technologies are, there-fore, not only far from autonomous but, on thecontrary, incite and foster culturally infused politicalactivity. Suffering becomes grist for the mill of ideo-logical dispute, and individual misery either disap-pears from sight or else is appropriated in theinterests of dominant others.Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:02am page 93Margaret Lock93"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Remaking DeathAfter the development of artificial respirators,attempts were made to clarify precisely what consti-tutes death in several international forums. In both a1966 CIBA symposium held in London and a 1968World Medical Association conference held inSydney, delegates worked under the assumptionthat what they were participating in was an unpre-cedented response to new medical technologies thatmade it necessary for the first time to ‘‘define’’death.11However, in an article entitled ‘‘Back fromthe Grave,’’ Martin Pernick has shown that concernabout establishing the time of death is not new butrather is the latest round in an ongoing historicaldebate, repeatedly revitalized in the wake of newmedical discoveries.12Pernick cited a 1940 article inScientific Americanas a relatively recent example ofthis concern, in which it was stated that ‘‘frequent’’errors in diagnosing death remained the cause ofcases of premature burial,13and concluded that itis not simply responses to specific medical discover-ies that have shaped the content of debates aboutdeath, but that professional interests and culturalvalues are inevitably implicated, precluding the pos-sibility of arriving at a rational, universally acceptabledefinition.Phillipe Arie`s, writing about the history of death inthelongue dure ́e, claims that for at least a millenniumthere existed in Europe, until the thirteenth century,what he terms ‘‘tamed death.’’ A familiarity withdeath associated with neither fear nor despair, ‘‘half-way between passive resignation and mystical trust,’’was, Arie`s claims, characteristic of the time.14Des-tiny was revealed through death, and the dyingperson participated in a public ceremony in which‘‘his own personality was not annihilated but put tosleep.’’15Arie`s suggests that from medieval times on,death gradually became more individualized; anawareness of personal mortality and of failure associ-ated with death was apparent in medieval Europeaniconography. After the Enlightenment, Arie`s detectsanother shift inmentalite ́in which death ‘‘becamechallenged and furtively pushed out of the world offamiliar things.’’ Interest shifted to the death of theother – to the ‘‘loved one’’ – and our own deathsbecame asocial and unnameable.Arie`s has been criticized, quite rightly I believe,for downplaying the individual ‘‘torment and pain’’that must always have accompanied many deaths, andfor giving undue emphasis to its social significance.16Arie`s was, after all, primarily interested in the cul-tural representation of death, rather than in everydayexperiences, individual or collective. Zygmunt Bau-man has commented that, in principle at least, deathwas ‘‘tame’’ prior to the Age of Reason because itposed no challenge to the social order. Being preor-dained, the end of the life cycle and also eminentlysocial, there was no need to fight death. For Bauman,shared knowledge about death, which he believes isincited by a universal awareness of mortality, pro-vides the driving force for cultural creativity, a pushfor transcendence – ‘‘culture is about expandingtemporal and spatial boundaries of being, with aview to dismantling them altogether . . . the firstactivity of culture relates tosurvival– pushing backthe moment of death, extending the life-span.’’17Bauman suggests that the knowledge and fact ofmortality drives the cultural construction of theidea of immortality – ‘‘mortality is ours withoutasking – but immortality is something we mustbuild ourselves. Immortality is not a mere absenceof death; it isdefianceand denial of death.’’18Thus,the construction of immortality is, in Bauman’s esti-mation, the major source of life’s meaning in allsocieties, resulting in the transformation of bio-logical death, ‘‘a fact of nature,’’ into a culturalartifact, which in turn ‘‘offers the primary buildingmaterial for social institutions and behavioral pat-terns crucial to the reproduction of societies in theirdistinctive forms.’’19A contemporary scientific approach to death has,in theory, by painting itself into the cold cornerwhere culture is no longer deemed relevant, doneaway with all meaning, save that a corpse indicatesbiological failure. Moreover, as is well known, fromat least the time of Descartes, the living body grad-ually came to be understood in medicine as a kind of‘‘animated corpse,’’ since dissection was the primarymeans of aggregating facts about human biology.20Thus, mortality was medicalized in order to combatdeath and disease. Today death is ‘‘measurable’’ andlegally recognizable as an absence of neuronal func-tioning or, alternatively, of respiration and a heart-Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:02am page 94Displacing Suffering: The Reconstruction of Death in North America and Japan94"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"beat. Having apparently been stripped of culture,death can no longer transcend biology to act as atouchstone for coming to terms with mortality. In-stead, it is simply understood, in medicine at least, asbiological failure, a waste:Death is primarily regarded as an illness or an aberra-tion rather than something that is natural [and] thephysician is supposed both to certify death and state itscause. . . . These certificates also illustrate the beliefthat although human beings die from many causes atonce, it is always possible to isolate a single andprecipitate cause of death. . . . Death is conceptualizedas an ailment that is amenable to intervention.21Narratives such as that of Arie`s about a progres-sion from a socially meaningful, preordained deathto one where individual dying became the focus, andthen to a vision of death as something to be con-quered, are told from the vantage point of thegrandrec ̧it– as though cultures are monolithic, seamlesswholes, and as though a neat cleavage exists betweenculture, a human creation, and nature, subject totimeless biological law. Ruth Richardson, inDeath,Dissection and the Destitute, shows how in nineteenth-century England the ‘‘life strategies’’ of the commonfolk by no means coincided with the aspirations ofthose scientists who employed professional bodysnatchers to obtain corpses for dissection and aut-opsy. People went to great lengths to try to preventthe robbing of graves, anatomical dissection, and thecommodification of corpses. For most citizens dis-section was considered not only demeaning but lit-erally cruel, and even in the medical literature therewas much debate as to whether or not clinical de-tachment should be equated with inhumanity, al-though perhaps a ‘‘necessary inhumanity.’’22InMiddlemarch, George Eliot has the townsfolk talkdisparagingly and fearfully about Lydgate the‘‘modern’’doctor and his fascination with dissection.The body in deathmayhave been stripped of socialand individual significance in the minds of patho-logically oriented medical professionals but, for themajority of ordinary people living in nineteenth-century Europe, at least, death retained a meaningthat transcended the physical demise of an individual.In theory, in the late twentieth century, by partici-pating in the medicalization and sanitization of death– by virtually confining it to hospitals – we havecapitulated to the view that death is essentially abiological event. This very capitulation is, of course,contingent upon a culturally created dominant ideol-ogy that understands the physical body as precul-tural, an aggregation of natural facts amenable torational experiment and manipulation. Culture isleft to deal, often rather peremptorily, with onlythe final disposal of the body, and the work ofgrief. Moreover, many writers confirm that we nolonger know how to behave around those who aredying – the very process smells of failure and inducespanic. Of course, a major paradox is evident becausecontemporary mass media is laden with images ofviolent deaths that leave nothing hidden or sanitized,but such garish endings belong to the other, not toourselves, and perhaps actually facilitate the anesthe-tization of our own mortality. Nevertheless, thereare now many signs of increasing public disputeabout the confinement of death, and about the all-out battle to defeat it. As Martin Pernick points out,‘‘Today, perhaps for the first time, public criticisminvolves both a fear of being wrongly declared dead,and a fear of being wrongly declared alive.’’23Making Death UsefulIn America the first major step in the most recentremaking of death was taken by an ad hoc committeeof the Harvard Medical School in 1968. It is signifi-cant that this was accomplished shortly after theworld’s first heart transplant took place in SouthAfrica in 1967. The group of physicians who com-prised the committee declared unilaterally that indi-viduals in a state of ‘‘irreversible coma,’’ anddiagnosed as having ‘‘brain death syndrome,’’ couldbe declared dead.24Prior to this time, it wasaccepted simply by convention that death couldonly be medically established once the heart hadstopped beating, but confusion arose when artificialrespirators were brought into routine use, becausethey allow the heart to remain beating after inte-grated brain function has ceased. The committeegave two reasons for establishing a clear definitionof death:1)that ‘‘increased burdens’’ on patients,families, and hospital resources were caused byRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:02am page 95Margaret Lock95"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"‘‘improvements in resuscitative and support meas-ures,’’ and2)that ‘‘obsolete criteria for the definitionof death can lead to controversy in obtaining organsfor transplantation.’’25Thus, reaching a medical con-sensus about a definition of brain death as the end oflife was clearly linked from the outset to a demandfor human organs. These debates captured somepassing media and public attention.26During the early 1970s, the concept of ‘‘braindeath syndrome’’ was challenged in the courts. Inone landmark case in Virginia in 1972 the jury ruledagainst the donor’s family, who claimed that thetransplant surgeons had been responsible for thedeath of their relative. Other court cases followedincluding several involving homicide victims, butnone resulted in the prosecution of a doctor.27Atthe same time, a debate about medical practice wasunder way in the medical world itself as to whichtests, if any, could be relied upon to confirm anindividual doctor’s opinion about brain death, andsecondly as to who would act as ‘‘gatekeepers’’ toprotect physicians from malpractice suits.28A Uni-form Determination of Death Act was eventuallydeclared in 1981, after extensive debate among themembers of a President’s Commission especially setup for that purpose. This Act was immediately sup-ported by the American Medical Association and theAmerican Bar Association, and was subsequentlyadopted over a number of years by the majority ofstate legislatures.The President’s Commission, in opposition to theposition taken by a number of individual physicians,philosophers, and theologians (who were writingmostly in professional journals, rather than for themedia), opted to further rationalize and update whatthey characterized as ‘‘obsolete’’ diagnostic criteriaand to enshrine a definition of death in law, some-thing that thus far had not been the situation.29TheCommission recommended that a concept of‘‘whole-brain death,’’ equated with an ‘‘irreversibleloss of all brain function,’’ be adopted. This conditionwas carefully distinguished in the report from a‘‘persistent vegetative state,’’ as exemplified by pa-tients such as Karen Ann Quinlan and Nancy BethCruzan, whose brain stems continued to functiondespite an irreversible loss of higher brain function.The earlier definition of ‘‘irreversible coma’’ leftroom for doubt as to whether patients such as thesecould be taken for dead, and the concept of whole-brain death sought specifically to clarify this point.Thus, physicians, in constructing a ‘‘uniform’’death,deliberately set out to protect themselves againstmalpractice, while at the same time ensuring asource of organs for transplants from legally defineddead bodies.Despite this effort, a number of publicationsappeared shortly after the Act was passed in whichmedical professionals, philosophers, and social scien-tists pointed out the numerous ways in which thewording of the Act is ambiguous. In particular, twocriteria remain acceptable for the determination ofdeath: irreversible cessation of circulatory and re-spiratory functionsorirreversible cessation of allfunctions of the entire brain, including the brainstem. The philosopher David Lamb, in summarizingthis controversy, suggests that ambiguity is presentbecause the Commission wished to avoid a radicaldeparture, a ‘‘paradigm shift,’’ from what had beenconventionally recognized as death prior to the in-vention of the artificial ventilator, while at the sametime meeting the pragmatics demanded by the neces-sity of a legal definition.30One of the problems theCommission faced was to transform theprocessofdying into a clearly definableevent– to establishdeath as a point in time. Pressure to remove organsas expediently as possible made the transformation ofdeath into a recognizable, scientifically determinableevent absolutely essential. As Roy Selby and MarilynSelby had noted just prior to the Commission, ‘‘dyingmust never be confused with death.’’31Despite theapparent routinization of brain death as a diagnosis,and efforts to create uniformity in the determinationof death, considerable doubt and debate continues tothis day as to whether we are on an ethical slipperyslope, and as to what actually constitutes death.32Thus, we remain, in Kuhn’s terms, in a paradigmcrisis, striving for commensurability but unable toachieve it.This relatively quiet remaking of death has beenmasked throughout by a focus on the heroics ofmedicine and the prolongation of life. Twoimpending deaths are, of course, involved – that ofthe donor and that of the recipient – but the publicimagination has been fired in North America by theRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:02am page 96Displacing Suffering: The Reconstruction of Death in North America and Japan96"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"idea of the ‘‘gift’’ of life. The life and death of thepatient from whom organs will be ‘‘harvested’’ is leftunmarked except as ‘‘donor’’ (although the use ofanencephalic babies temporarily swayed this prior-ity).33The media usually focuses our attention onthe life that will be ‘‘saved,’’ and particularly on themoments during and immediately after surgerywhen the proclamation of success is made; survivalrates beyond the first few weeks fail to make morethan serendipitous news coverage, and very fewpeople indeed know about the prognosis for trans-plant patients, long-term outcomes, or about their‘‘quality of life’’ after surgery.Between 1982 and 1992, the number of trans-plants performed in the United States tripled, and itis estimated that over thirty-five thousand Americansare currently living with a donated organ in theirbody.34Transplants of all kinds, many of them repeatattempts after rejection, are routinized procedures;the ‘‘cutting edge’’ of transplant technology is con-cerned with ‘‘cluster’’ transplants, brain tissue im-plants, and the paring down of large organs for use ininfants and children. The current drive to ‘‘maxi-mize’’ the availability of organs is grounded in theutilitarian assumption that organs must be madeavailable for the greatest good of all and includes amajor debate about whether the buying and selling oforgans should be established. Discussion is focusedon organ procurement, including what type of con-tract with potential donors and their families is mostappropriate for making them more readily avail-able;35whether adoption of a market modelfor obtaining organs is appropriate;36and whetherthe body should be understood as a form ofproperty.37It is evident, therefore, that whatever discussiontakes place about the remaking of death in NorthAmerica is being carried out after the fact of theroutinization of organ transplants from brain deaddonors, and is colored by the pressures that aperceived escalating ‘‘shortage’’ of organs adds tothe debate. Moreover, public consciousness,molded by the media, is focused almost withoutexception on the heroics of transplants and the‘‘saving’’ of life, a situation that Ivan Illich hascharacterized as a fetishization of life.38The health‘‘fad,’’ particularly evident in the United States,requiring constant personal vigilance and body con-trol, together with the imbibing of medications(such as hormone replacement therapy) purported,among other claims, to extend life, are other facetsof this fetishization.39In contrast to debates about death prior to theintroduction of the artificial respirator, the issuetoday is infinitely more complex, because there arenowtwodeaths inextricably linked through the coin-cidental failure of their body parts. It is not unrea-sonable to assume that public concern about thedeath of the donor should have been powerfulenough to limit the rather rapid routinization ofmajor organ transplants; current biomedical ethicsin North America, and to a lesser extent in Europe,are, after all, grounded in respect for autonomousindividuals and their welfare. These values inevitablybecome somewhat unraveled at the seams with twopatients and their competing rights to consider, andone might expect to see some evidence in the mediaof this conflict of interest, perhaps even a nationaldebate similar to the one about abortion. Clearly thishas not happened. Organ donors, as a class of people,are praised for their generosity and altruism – for the‘‘gift of life’’ – but as individuals their deaths remainessentially unnoticed.Apparentlywe equate lack ofbrain function with the end of life, and we trust themedical profession in their judgment as to whenexactly this takes place. Perhaps this situation shouldcome as no surprise in a rational, secular societywhere it makes little sense to dwell on the misfor-tune of ‘‘neomorts,’’ to use Willard Gaylin’s graphicneologism;40perhaps it is simply more ‘‘healthy’’ tothink of individuals ‘‘living’’ on in others, and torecognize transplants as a life saving technology – adevice that not only sidesteps the failure of death, butseemingly vanquishes it.In 1991, more than two thousand people were onthe waiting list for heart transplants in the UnitedStates, and the number of donors has decreased inrecent years. One transplant surgeon has talked ofthe ‘‘alarming number of patients who diewaiting,’’41a situation described as a ‘‘public healthcrisis.’’42But by no means does everyone understandthis crisis in the same way. Leon Kass, for example,characterized the problem very differently in arecent article on the selling of organs:Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:02am page 97Margaret Lock97"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Now, embarked on the journey, we cannot go back.Yet we are increasingly troubled by the growing aware-ness that there is neither a natural nor a rationalplace to stop. Precedent justifies extension, so doesrational calculation: we are in a warm bath that warmsup so imperceptibly that we don’t know when toscream.43Few cultural commentators are as explicit as Kass,but doubts, although rarely publicly discussed, ap-parently extend well beyond critics situated withinthe medical world, as was clearly also the case in thenineteenth century. Rene ́e Fox’s assessment of aGallup Poll taken in 1985, for example, is that‘‘many respondents . . . expressed anxiety aboutthe possibility that if they signed a donor card phys-icians might prematurely take steps to pronouncethem dead, to surgically excise their organs, or evento hasten their death.’’44Another smaller surveyrevealed that the willingness of people who perceivethemselves to be on the margins of society (in par-ticular blacks) to become donors is lower thanamong the middle classes.45This finding has a ma-cabre irony to it, since, from the point of view ofsurgeons, the ‘‘best’’ organs come from those whodie in traffic accidents, gunshot wounds, knifings,and so on, among whom the numbers of youngblacks and Hispanics are very high.A recent study from Scandinavia shows thatamong an age-stratified, random sample of 1950Swedish individuals, nearly 70 percent showedsome discomfort about autopsy and organ donation.People reported, for example, that they were ill atease at the thought of cutting up a dead body, andmany were concerned that the patient might not bedead at the time of organ removal.46Not only is thepublic cautious, but several studies have shown that,in North America at least, many nurses and othermedical staff are conflicted when it comes to identi-fying donors and approaching their families to obtainconsent.47The fact that we cannot bring ourselves tosimply talk of ‘‘death’’ but refer consistently to‘‘brain death’’ clearly suggests that life is still presentin the minds of most people;48continued usage ofthe term brain death is in itself an example of theambiguity and uncertainty involved. These research-ers have also pointed out that newspaper and televi-sion accounts regularly report that patients who havebeen declared brain dead later ‘‘die’’ when ‘‘life-support’’ measures are removed, and health profes-sionals, they claim, regularly use terminology ‘‘thatimplies such patients die twice.’’49The Slippery Slope of PersonhoodThe President’s Commission that culminated in theDeath Act stated clearly that for death to be diag-nosed all brain function must have ceased, includingthe reflexes controlled by the brain stem. At thispoint there is a lack of ‘‘neurological integration,’’and what is left is ‘‘no longer a functional ororganicunity, but merely amechanicalcomplex.50RichardZaner has pointed out that, for whole-brain advo-cates, ‘‘it is the biological organism (or, more specif-ically, the physiological/anatomical nervous system)which is definitive for life and death, not thepersonwhose organism (or nervous system) it is.’’51Zanerand the majority of the contributors to the bookDeath: Beyond Whole Brain Criteriabelieve that theCommission put the cart before the horse by tryingto develop a concept of death out of a set of stand-ardized medical tests while evading the central issueofwhohad died. In order for there to be a uniformstatutory definition of human death there must firstbe, according to Zaner, a general consensus overwhat constitutes ‘‘personhood’’ or ‘‘personal iden-tity.’’52The Commission, recognizing that no suchconsensus exists, pointed out that the issue has beendebated for centuries, and explicitly sought to cir-cumvent the problem by making a biological argu-ment in which rationally conceived operationalcriteria and medical tests provide the answer. Theresponse of Edward Bartlett and Stuart Youngnerwas that neither operational criteria nor valid testscan be decided upon unless a working definition isfirst established – namely a concept of what itmeansto die.53Such a definition has to be ‘‘societal,’’ notbiological they argued, since a permanent loss of‘‘personhood’’ should be of central concern, ratherthan the demise of the body physical. With this inmind, Zaner concluded that ‘‘at the very least . . .the central issues inherent to any definition of deathmust be kept rigorously open.’’54Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:02am page 98Displacing Suffering: The Reconstruction of Death in North America and Japan98"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Definitions grounded in the idea of a loss ofpersonhood have been characterized as ‘‘onto-logical’’ and contrasted with what are taken to benarrowly defined scientific definitions based on thestate of brain function.55Lamb, a philosopher, isconcerned that those who argue for a redefinitionbased on ontological criteria are in actualityappealing to the idea that a loss of higher brainfunction is equivalent to death. He points out thatsuch arguments are concerned only with criteria thatdescribe ‘‘the minimum necessary qualities for per-sonhood, defined in terms of psychological abilities,’’and he asserts that a Cartesian dualism is present insuch arguments, which assume the ethical cutoffpoint to be the moment when the ‘‘ghost’’ leavesthe machine.56Karen Gervais criticized Lamb in turn for placingtoo much reliance on a biological definition; Lamb,she states, understands death as ‘‘a fact awaitingdiscovery,’’ and she characterizes the ontological ap-proach, in contrast, as based in ethical reflection.57Lamb has countered this rebuttal by claiming thatwhole-brain death is an ‘‘ethically superior formula-tion’’ because ‘‘in matters of life and death, objectivetestable criteria concerning presence or absence ofvital functions are more reliable than indeterminateassessments concerning the quality of residual life, orspeculations regarding personhood, or utilitarianrequirements for transplant organs.’’58Lamb isclearly concerned that overriding interests aboutthe supposed crisis precipitated by an ‘‘organ short-age’’ will seize the day and send us on our way downthe slippery slope to redefining death in response toperceived needs. He adds that a whole-brain deathformulation does not dispute the loss of all capacityfor integrated mental activity, but because the ‘‘es-sence’’ of personal identity is an elusive concept,which in any case resides in a different logical spacethan the cessation of vital functions, it is certainly notone on which doctors should rely in making deci-sions about death. Personal identity, after all, doesnot have any specific anatomical location, insistsLamb, but is a quality akin to ‘‘spirit,’’ ‘‘will,’’ or‘‘soul,’’ with religious, legal, and political associ-ations. Loss of personhood or moral integrity arecultural conceptions and are, therefore, subject to awide range of interpretation and open to easy ma-nipulation and abuse where pragmatism and utilitar-ianism hold sway. Norman Fost, arguing alongsimilar lines, has asserted that the problem withutilitarian justifications for redefining death, exem-plified by the recently enacted Uniform Determin-ation of Death, is that constant redefinition is invitedwhenever utility requires it, creating ‘‘not only in-stability, but the perception and possibility that un-wanted persons can be defined out of existence[whenever] it serves the greater good.’’59Given this climate, Lamb and other supporters ofwhole-brain death believe it is imperative to searchout ‘‘precise’’ measurement of neurological func-tioning because they are suspicious of a culturallyproduced, psychologically driven interpretation oflife, and see less of an opening for abuse when using atightly defined, biologically based definition (pro-vided in practice there is an under diagnosis ofdeath whenever there is doubt). This argument as-sumes, of course, not only that death is measurable,but also that such measurements are accurate andunfailingly replicable. A recent survey conductedamong 195 physicians and nurses produced somedisquieting results. Youngner and colleagues remindus that the concept of whole-brain death was initiallyaccepted because it was assumed that ‘‘in the hands ofcompetent physicians’’ a diagnosis of irreversible lossof all brain function is clinically practical and com-pletely reliable. However, they found that only 35percent of survey respondents both knew the wholebrain criteria for death and were able to apply itcorrectly.60One fifth of these respondents weredirectly involved in making diagnoses about deathat that time. Moreover, when asked to give theirpersonal opinions about concepts of death and thenapply them to hypothetical cases, 58 percent of therespondents did not use a concept of death consist-ently, and furthermore personal concepts variedwidely among health-care professionals.61Because of possible conflict of interest, neurosur-geons and neurologists are today expected to donothing more than suggest to the families of theirpatients, once brain death has been declared, thatthey might think about donation of organs. Trans-plant surgeons and physicians, for their part, may notenter the scene until after brain death has beendeclared on two separate occasions.

Of more importance, perhaps, it ensuresthat the failure of death is rapidly transformed,the bereaved family willing, into a celebration ofimmortality.Striving for Consensus: The Japanese DebateThere are some remarkable differences at the pre-sent time between Japan and North America withrespect to organ transplants: whereas, for example,in America nearly two thousand heart transplantstook place in 1990, in Japan there were none. It isobvious that this difference cannot be explained by alack of technology or skills, or by a shortage ofeconomic resources on the part of the Japanese.So, cultural differencesmustbe at work. Initially,my inclination was to ask what it is about JapaneseandnotNorth American culture, experience, andsocial organization that could account for this dis-crepancy. What widely shared knowledge do theJapanese possess that makes them resistant to thetechnologically aided extension of human life? Thisapproach seemed particularly pertinent becauseJapan utilizes and exports more complex medicaltechnology than any other nation in the world.62Isthis cultural difference to be found at the level ofattitudes towards the mastery of nature or, morespecifically, to a concern about tinkering with thebodies of the dying and the dead? Is Japan perhaps notas secular and rational, not as ‘‘modern’’ as its out-ward appearance leads us to believe? Alternatively, isit perhaps due to cultural influences on the actualproduction of scientific discourse about death anddying in Japan? Or is the difference due largely to theway in which the power and interests of doctors areplayed out, and the form of institutionalization thatmedicine takes in Japan? Or is it some combinationof the above?It is relatively easy to take off from this point,embracing an implicit assumption that there is some-thing inherently odd about not striving to ‘‘save’’lives in a secular society with neither economic nortechnological constraints; to set out, therefore, toscrutinize the relics of tradition, survivals from anarchaic past lurking in Japanese late modernity thataccount for this anomaly. But such an approachviolates the majority of interpretations given byJapanese on this subject, many of whom flatly denythat culture, that is, the ‘‘culture of tradition’’ isinvolved and argue instead for a more pragmaticexplanation in which politics and power relationsamong the professions, and between the medicalworld and the public, are implicated.63Equally im-portant, by focusing on Japan as the anomaly, NorthAmerican assumptions about the good and just soci-ety remain unproblematized and thus, implicitly, thenorm for the contemporary world, something thatalso concerns many Japanese participants as theyargue their version of the brain death debate.Shortly after the world’s first heart transplant wasconducted in South Africa, several attempts weremade in other locations to carry out the same pro-cedure, including Sapporo, Hokkaido in 1968. As inother parts of the world, the Sapporo procedureinitially produced an accolade from the media, andwas heralded as a dramatic medical triumph. How-ever, several months later, the physician in charge,Dr. Wada, was arraigned on a murder charge andonly acquitted after six years of wrangling. Themajority of Japanese believe in retrospect that thepatient whose heart was removed was not braindead, and that the recipient, who died two and ahalf months after the operation, was not sufficientlyin need of a new heart to have undergone the pro-cedure in the first place.64As part of the ongoingnational debate about brain death, discussion of thecase was formally reopened in 1991, and the chair-man of the Japanese Medical Association, testifyingbefore a government committee, reported thattwenty-three years ago, right after the removal ofthe supposedly ineffective heart from the recipientpatient, it had been tampered with, indicating thatthe involved doctors may have tried to exaggeratethe degree of its deterioration.65The case is nowconsidered in retrospect as a barbarous piece ofmedical experimentation carried out by a doctorwho received a good portion of his training in Amer-ica and is, moreover, described as self-aggrandizing.There have been a good number of other cases inconnection with organ transplants where the Japan-Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:02am page 100Displacing Suffering: The Reconstruction of Death in North America and Japan100"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"ese medical profession has not shown up in a goodlight. One, for example, involved a highly contro-versial kidney/pancreas transplant at Tsukuba Uni-versity in which organs were removed from a youngmentally retarded woman diagnosed as brain dead,but neither she nor her parents had given permissionfor her to be a donor.66Contested Definitions of DeathThe first definition of brain death in Japan wasformulated by the Japan Electroencephaly Associ-ation in 1974. Probably in response to the muchpublicized case of the mentally retarded patient,the Life Ethics Problem Study ParliamentariansLeague, composed of twenty-eight Diet membersand forty-five other professionals, was establishedin 1985, and after one year endorsed the need forlegislation about brain death.67In the same year, theMinistry of Health and Welfare set up a Brain DeathAdvisory Council, the final report of which con-tained the definition of brain death made use of inJapan today.68This report is explicit, however, that‘‘death cannot be judged by brain death.’’ Neverthe-less, the diagnosis is frequently applied, not as asignal to turn off the respirator, but to preparerelatives for an impending death.69The report spurred other involved groups tomake pronouncements about their positions. InJanuary 1988, after two years of meetings by aworking group, the directors of the Japanese Med-ical Association voted unanimously to accept braindeath as the termination of human life. Despite thisdecision, there remains a lack of agreement amongthe representatives of medical specialties and alsoamong individual physicians who are deeply dividedon the issue. The politically outspoken Japan Asso-ciation of Psychiatrists and Neurologists (some ofthe sixty-nine hundred members of whom are re-sponsible for making brain death diagnoses) fearthat if brain death is equated with death, the handi-capped, mentally impaired, and disadvantaged willbe at risk of being diagnosed prematurely in agreedy desire to get at their organs. In their 1988report they state that a major problem is with thedifficulty in deciding when brain function isirreversibly lost.70Some physicians havejoined members of the publictoformthehighlyvisiblePatients’RightsCommittee,whose interests range well beyond the question ofbrain death. Under the leadership of the flamboyantDr. Honda from the prestigious department of in-ternal medicine at Tokyo University, they have re-cently filed several lawsuits charging murder whenorgans have been removed from brain dead patients,one of which was in connection with the TsukubaUniversity case described above. The Public Prosecu-tor’s Office has not thus far reached a decision inconnection with any of these cases, but has throwntwoofthemoutofcourt,statingthatthereisnopublicconsensus in Japan as to how to define death.71EricFeldman believes that because, after almost sevenyears, complaints made by the Patients’ Rights Com-mittee remain unresolved, hesitation on the partof doctors to forge ahead with transplanation isreinforced.72As a result of the unresolved debate, copiouslydocumented by the media, the government feltcompelled in late 1989 to set up a Special CabinetCommittee on Brain Death and Organ Transplantsin order to bring about closure. This committee,composed of fifteen members from various walks oflife, was charged to make a report to the PrimeMinister by 1991, and its very formation signaled tothe public that the government was ready to supporta move to legalize brain death as the termination oflife. The group was so deeply divided that for awhile it appeared that it would never produceanything more than an interim report, but in Janu-ary 1992 a final report was forthcoming. Inprinciple the members should have reached consen-sus, but this they could not achieve. The majorityposition is that brain death is equivalent to humandeath, that organ transplants from brain deaddonors are acceptable, and that the current defin-ition of brain death as formulated by the Ministry ofHealth is appropriate. The minority position madeit clear that they wished to have the social andcultural aspects of the problem fully debated; intheir opinion the discussion thus far had been largelyconfined to ‘‘scientific’’ information, which theybelieved to be inadequate.73The public was keptfully apprised of just who appeared before thecommittee. It was evident that many of those whoRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:02am page 101Margaret Lock101"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"testified, including certain scientists and doctors,argued against the acceptance of brain death, butnevertheless the majority of the committee eventu-ally moved to support its approval.74Throughout, the Japan Federation of Bar Associ-ations (Nichibenren)has maintained its positionagainst the acceptance of brain death as the termin-ation of life. It has expressed concern for the‘‘sanctity of life,’’ and about possible medical ‘‘ex-perimentation.’’ The Federation has also pointed outthat there may be unforeseen consequences in con-nection with inheritance claims, and a lack of publicconsensus on the issue was noted by them.75The dayfollowing the announcement of the Cabinet Com-mittee report, the Ministry of Justice, the NationalPolice Agency, and the Public Prosecutor’s Office allreiterated their continued resistance to braindeath.76The Patients’ Rights Committee, lawyers, thepolice, several television producers, and manyauthors of newspaper articles and books on thesubject of brain death, and even a number of medicalprofessionals appear to be publicly contesting theauthority of transplant surgeons. What they usuallycite as their principal cause for concern is a lack oftrust in the medical teams who will make decisionsabout cases of brain death; they believe that in therush to retrieve organs the process of dying will becurtailed or even misdiagnosed. The opposition isexplicitly opposed to the secrecy and arrogance ofsome members of the medical profession, and pointsout that patients and their families are vulnerable toexploitation.Certain of these same opponents of brain death arepushing for informed consent, together with a frankdisclosure and discussion of diagnoses with patients,neither of which activities are by any means routinelyestablished in Japan. This contest, therefore, al-though at one level a debate about the accuracy andreplicability of scientific decision-making, is also achallenge to the hegemony of invested authority,exerted in what is characterized by several of thechallengers as a traditionally Japanese way, wherebysubjects are rendered passive and expected to complywith medical regimen without question.One of the national newspapers,Asahi Shinbun,recently described the medical world as ‘‘irritated’’with government dithering, and doctors sense thattheir international reputations as outstanding sur-geons are fading. At the annual meeting of the Jap-anese Medical Association held in Kyoto in 1990,which I attended, two plenary sessions and severalsmaller panels were given over to brain death andorgan transplants. The principal paper givers werephysicians who had lived and worked for some timein the United States and who had practiced transplantsurgery while there. Aside from the scientific part oftheir presentations, every one of them stronglyasserted that Japanese medicine is suffering becauseof the national uproar over brain death. They allshowed slides of themselves standing, usually insurgical garb, side by side with American transplantsurgeons together with happy, lively patients whohad recently received organ transplants. These pre-sentations were one of the few occasions, until veryrecently, when attention was focused on the situationof patients whose lives might be prolonged, howevertemporarily, by transplant procedures.77Reaching Public ConsensusTaking place in concert with government, profes-sional, and media discussion is the most persistentsearch for a national consensus (kokuminteki goˆi)among the Japanese public that has taken place todate on any subject. There were at least ten nationalsurveys about brain death and organ transplantsbetween 1983 and 1992. Over the years the numberof people who recognize brain death has increasedfrom 29 percent to nearly 50 percent. In all of thesurveys, a paradox is evident, however: many peopleapprove of organ transplants from brain dead pa-tients although they themselves do not accept braindeath as the end of life. It seems that the Japanesepublic is willing to allow transplants to take place,even though they personally would not be comfort-able with participating in such a procedure.The results of opinion polls are usually used bythose who are against brain death to support theirarguments, since it has been frequently reiteratedthat public consensus must be reached before braindeath can be nationally recognized. Nevertheless,one is left with the feeling, voiced by many membersof the Japanese public, that the whole exercise ofRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:02am page 102Displacing Suffering: The Reconstruction of Death in North America and Japan102"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"repeatedly surveying the nation is essentially a farce,and that the idea of trying to achieve a simpleconsensus on such an inflammatory subject is essen-tially without meaning.Cultivating the NaturalClearly, the Japanese public’s mistrust of physicianscontributes to the brain death ‘‘problem,’’ but whyhasthisissue more than any of the other pressingproblems in connection with biomedical technologycaptured the attention of the nation for nearly thirtyyears? Discussions about informed consent, eutha-nasia, and the new reproductive technologies appearin the media with increasing frequency today, but notnearly to the same extent as the topic of brain deathand organ transplants, debate about which canbecome exceedingly vituperative.78A perusal of the over five hundred articles, books,and newspaper editorials published on brain deathand organ transplants since 1986 reveals that braindeath is reported to be too ‘‘unnatural’’ (fushizen)tobe called ‘‘death,’’ for example,79or that it is ‘‘con-trary to basic human feelings.’’ The idea of ‘‘control-ling’’death is also described as going against nature.80Organ transplants are characterized in one book asegetsu nai(a powerful vernacular expression indicat-ing that something is foul, ugly, or revolting) andchima mire(bloody).81Arguments against the institu-tionalization of organ transplants requiring a braindead donor appear, therefore, to raise major con-cerns about interfering with the natural order. How-ever, for the most part these concerns remainarticulated only as emotion-laden adjectives or elseby indirect allusions to the ‘‘cold,’’ over-rational‘‘West.’’Contemporary Japanese attitudes towards scien-tific knowledge and its associated technology aredifficult to pin down because of their intimateconnection to a widespread ambivalence aboutthe process of Japanese modernization. Moreover,Japanese attitudes towards modernization cannot beunderstood in isolation from ever changing interpre-tations, producedboth inside and outside the country,about the relationship of Japan to the West. The formthat current debate takes about body technologiesin Japan, therefore – the feasibility of tinkering withthe margins between culture and nature, and the verydefinition of those margins – reflect more generalconcerns about modernization, postmodernization,and ‘‘Westernization.’’In Japan throughout the late nineteenth century,the eager quest for Western science and technology‘‘was grounded in [a] sense of cultural certitude’’;82an awareness that the ‘‘core’’ or the bass note (koso)of Japanese culture would remain unaffected. Tech-nology, self-consciously aligned with the other, wasplaced in opposition to culture in this discourse, andepitomized by the platitudeswakon yo ̄sai(Japanesespirit and Western technology) andto ̄yo ̄do ̄toku, seiyo ̄gijutsu(Eastern morality, Western technology). Tet-suo Najita and others have shown how this confi-dence in the endurance of ‘‘traditional’’ culture wasgradually eroded. Early this century and again afterWorld War II internal tension erupted over Japan’sincreasing technological sophistication and inter-nationalization.83Fears about an imminent collapseof the nation’s cultural heritage became common-place, and one reaction was a reassertion of culturalessentialism.84For many Japanese, the specter of Westernizedindividualism, utilitarianism, and super-rationalismtriggers emotional responses that push them towardsa rhetoric of difference, even as they buck at itsinherently nationalistic underpinnings. This is thediscursive background against which the brain deathdebate is taking place. Appellations such as ‘‘trad-ition’’ and ‘‘religion’’ smack of superstition and pre-modern sentimentality to a large number of people,but Japan is repeatedly described by internal com-mentators and outside observers alike as havingundergone a unique form of modernization andhence of being quintessentially different.Those who have doubts about the introduction ofnew technologies have to struggle very hard, there-fore, to find a suitable language with which to articu-late their discomfort. Criticizing a ‘‘Western,’’‘‘scientific,’’ interventionist approach to naturemakes one vulnerable to accusations of Japaneseessentialism and antirationalism. Equally difficult tovoice is criticism of the epistemological grounds onwhich a scientific determination of death is con-structed, for this smacks of antirationalism.

However, one or two attempts have beenmade to create a more nuanced argument based onthe structure of Japanese social relationships. Masa-hiro Morioka suggests, for example, that rather thanfocusing on the standardization of brain death, asdoes so much of the literature, attention should beshifted to the brain dead person at the center of anexus of characteristically Japanese human relationsboth familial and medical. He deliberately seeks toredefine the problem as social rather than clinical.86The anthropologist E. Namihira analyzes Japaneseattitudes towards the dead body to account for resist-ance to brain death and organ transplants – an argu-ment that highlights the cultural construction ofnature, but one to which the majority of Japaneseintellectuals with whom I have talked have reactedwith a good deal of resistance.87The entire commentary about tampering withdefinitions of death is, therefore, complex, emo-tional, and fraught with ideological pitfalls becausedebate cannot be divorced from other pressing issuesof national import. A tension between technology asboth creator and destroyer of culture is evident. Notsurprisingly, negotiating a moral high ground hasthus far proved impossible, not least when peopletry to shelter behind scientific justifications for theirarguments.Discourse on Social DeathIn Japan biological death is usually understood as aprocess, not as a point in time.88Moreover, a dis-tinction is made by many commentators betweenbiological and social death, believed to take placesome time after the demise of the physical body.Although few commentators talk explicitly about aConfucian-derived belief in the ancestors, its influ-ence on the brain death debate is apparent. Prelimin-ary interviews I conducted with fifty Japaneseinformants, men and women, made it clear that thefate of the body after biological death, together witha concern about the recently dead, may contribute toa reluctance both to donate and to receive organs.Everyone interviewed stated that they no longerbelieve in the elaborate prewar ancestor system,integral to the extended family. Nevertheless, overhalf of the respondents indicated that they carry outregular, often daily rituals in their homes and at thegraves of their deceased parents and grandparents.Most pointed out that family and social obligationsrequire that the bodies and memories of deceasedfamily members be treated with respect.A 1981 survey showed that the majority of Japan-ese (between 60 and 70 percent) believe that whenand where one is born and dies is determined bydestiny, and that this should not be changed byhuman intervention.89Appropriate separation ofthe soul from the body at the moment of death iscentral to the Japanese belief about dying;90in arecent survey, 40 percent responded that they be-lieve in the continued existence after death ofreikon(soul/spirit).91This same survey showed thatamong young people between the ages of sixteenand twenty-nine, belief in the survival of the soulis particularly prevalent.92From an analysis of the very moving narrativesprovided by relatives of victims of the Japan Air Linescrash in the mountains of Gunma prefecture in 1985,Namihira concluded that the spirit of the deceased isoften anthropomorphized and is believed to experi-ence the same feelings as the living. Hence, relativeshave an obligation to make the spirit ‘‘happy’’ and‘‘comfortable.’’ People were in agreement that it isimportant for a dead body to be brought home, andthat a corpse should be complete (gotai manzoku),otherwise the spirit will suffer and may cause harmto the living. Namihira cites the results of a 1983questionnaire by a committee set up to encouragethe donation of bodies for medical research: Of 690respondents, 66 percent stated that cutting into deadbodies is repulsive and/or cruel, and also shows alack of respect for the dead. Against these figures,the numbers of people agreeing to autopsies hasRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:02am page 104Displacing Suffering: The Reconstruction of Death in North America and Japan104"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"steadily increased in recent years,93as has thenumber of people willing to go abroad to obtainorgan transplants94as well as those willing to recog-nize brain death as the end of life. Clearly, thepopulation is deeply divided about attitudes towardsthe dying and the recently dead, and many would, inany case, probably state one thing in response to asurvey and actually do another when confrontedwith personal suffering.In Japan the boundary between the social and thenatural was never very rigidly defined – the ances-tors were immortalized as entities who continue toact in the everyday world, but eventually becomepart of an animized natural order, forming a vitalbridge between the spiritual, social, and naturaldomains. Despite the Confucian origins of the ances-tors, the philosopher Akira Omine links the type ofanimism with which the ancestors are associated toShinto, the indigenous religion of Japan, which rep-resents, he believes, ‘‘quirky local beliefs cherishedin our peculiarly unspiritual island country and in-comprehensible to most of the world.’’95Shinto,associated with the Emperor and with nationalism,has an exceedingly delicate status among largenumbers of liberal minded Japanese today. Ominegoes on to claim that although animism affects atti-tudes about the dead, it ‘‘simply lacks the depth ofvision to address a challenge like that of redefiningthe boundary between life and death.’’96It seems thatOmine, in common with many of his intellectualcolleagues, would like to keep formalized religiousbelief (but not necessarily spirituality) out of thebrain death discussion.Comments such as those of Omine make it evi-dent that everyday discourse and practices aboutsocial death produce considerable anxiety amongcertain Japanese who wish their nation to be under-stood as eminently rational, in particular becausesuch discourse is grist for the mill of commentators(both inside and outside Japan) who hope to signalthat ‘‘tradition’’ and the ‘‘old moral order,’’ includingthe ancestors who signify continuity above allelse, is intact and functioning in the Japan of latemodernity.When it comes to discussing organ transplant-ation, many people point out that formalized giftgiving remains central to ongoing relationships ofreciprocity in Japan, and continues to contribute tothe moral order. The idea of receiving an organ thathad been anonymously donated would be very diffi-cult for many to accept without incurring an enor-mous sense of guilt and without violating a sense ofwhat is correct behavior.97In addition, a few peoplewith whom I have talked have clearly been physicallyrepulsed by the very idea of organ transplantation.For them, transfer of body parts among unrelatedpeople extends beyond the bounds of what is ‘‘nat-ural’’ and entails a completely unacceptable mixingof self and other. Certain scientists also see things thisway, for transplant technology has explicitly beendescribed by an eminent Japanese immunologist asthe conjoining of the ‘‘self’’ and ‘‘nonself.’’98A simi-lar, rather special, manifestation of this concern wasdemonstrated around the dying Emperor Shoˆwa,who received many blood transfusions duringthe last year of his life, all of which had to besupplied by family members. It should be notedthat there is little or no opposition to organ trans-plants from living, related donors, suggesting that itis an inappropriate mixing of self and other beyondthe ‘‘natural’’ bounds of the family that causesdiscomfort.Although abortion is acceptable to most Japanesecitizens, and is usually characterized as an unfortu-nate but necessary intervention at times, use of fetaltissue for research and transplants is not permitted.Fetuses are thought of by most people as living andconceptually inseparable from the body of the preg-nant woman. However, since a fetus has no inde-pendent social or moral standing it is not fullyhuman. Many Japanese are nevertheless concernedabout mistreatment of fetal tissue, although its statusis less problematic than that of a brain dead individ-ual. Concern is evident about the traumatic death ofa fetus, especially on the part of Japanese women,and lucrative Buddhist-based rituals are enacted allover Japan to appease the souls of aborted fetuses.99Thus, traumatic and sudden death, together with themixing of self and other, both before birth and laterin the life cycle, are culturally sensitive and contestedevents in Japan. However, the politics of solid organtransplants, coupled with a pervasive concern aboutrespect for the deceased, means that the brain deathdebate takes center stage, whereas abortion con-Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:02am page 105Margaret Lock105"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"tinues to be accepted quite simply as an unfortunatebut unavoidable part of human life.Late Modernity, Cultural Identity, and the OtherIt is striking that the culture and values of the ‘‘West’’are scrutinized in the brain death debate in Japan. Wehear and read much about Christianity (but nothingof Judaism), about rationality and the brain as thecenter of the body, about altruism, individualism,and even selfishness – all values associated with the‘‘West.’’ But, despite a call to move beyond a discus-sion of scientific decision-making, as noted above,Japanese values are not often examined explicitly. Ithas been suggested by some that if the original hearttransplant, the Wada case, had not flared up into alegal battle, the entire brain death debate may neverhave surfaced, and the medical world would simplyhave gone ahead unilaterally as they did in NorthAmerica. Others strongly disagree with this pos-ition, although many believe that brain death willbe made legally acceptable in Japan fairly soon andthat the search for a national consensus is simply aplacatory exercise before those in power go ahead toinstitutionalize organ transplants; indeed, a privatemembers bill has recently been submitted for con-sideration to the Diet.Thoughtful people recognize that while braindeath is obviously a sensitive topic, the definition ofdeath, although clearly the nub of the debate, has ametaphorical significance that triggers a cascade ofideological repercussions reaching far beyond themedical world. The present dilemma for progressivethinkers in Japan is how to dispose of the remnants ofpatriarchal and patronage thinking – the reactionarypart of the Confucian heritage – without drawing on alanguage that single-mindedly pursues the entrench-ment of the ‘‘Western’’values of individual autonomyand rights. It is in this context that the argumentabout brain death is taking place, and, as in theWest, it is an overwhelmingly secular argument inwhich representatives of religious organizations are,for the most part, remarkably absent.100At its mostabstract level, the current angst is a manifestation ofthe ceaseless, restless, contradictory debate aboutJapan and the West, a debate that has proceededunabated for something approaching two hundredyears, in which the ‘‘West’’ has come to be associatedwith ideas having universal application, whereas Jap-anese ideas are linked to uniqueness. As one pediatri-cian has recently put it, ‘‘Why should we mindlesslyimitate Westerners? We would only be turning our-selves into white Westerners with Asian faces.’’101Although a certain amount of genuine passion isaroused over the fate of those individuals whose livesare directly involved, little is heard from patients andtheir families, whether they be potential donors orreceivers. Recently, however, awoman whose daugh-ter will soon require a liver transplant, when inter-viewed byNewsweekfor its Japanese edition,complained, ‘‘Why do we have to suffer just becausewe have the misfortune to be Japanese?’’102Since thebeginning of 1994, the year in which an internationalconference on organ transplantation was deliberatelystaged in Japan by surgeons keen to break through thecurrent impasse, the fate of those patients not able toreceive transplants, together with those who havegone abroad to obtain organs, has started to capturethe imaginations of the media and the Japanese public.An extraordinarily moving art exhibition, at whichpictures created by Japanese children who had re-ceived organs were exhibited beside accounts oftheir medical histories, was held in Kyoto in conjunc-tion with the transplant conference.Thus far, the debate has not been about individualhuman suffering, but rather a manifestation of thestruggle by citizens and activists from a whole rangeof political persuasions about moral order in con-temporary Japan. Those who recognize brain deathas the end of life usually accept a modernist ideologyof technologically driven progress in the relief ofhuman suffering, while many (but not all) of thoseagainst embrace an argument about the essentialistdifference of Japan and exhibit concerns about aperceived loss of moral order. Very slowly and pain-fully forced, it seems to me as I interview andobserve Japanese who are dealing directly with thisproblem in ethics committees, citizens groups, andso on, by a genuine concern about the suffering ofindividuals, a middle ground is emerging. Neverthe-less, extremists on both sides remain highly vocal andinfluential. Those arguing for a modulated positionusually start with case studies rather than fromabstract propositions, or from the simple assumptionRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:02am page 106Displacing Suffering: The Reconstruction of Death in North America and Japan106"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"that biomedical technology is intrinsically good.Some people arguing for a middle ground activelyseek to avoid the silencing of individual suffering inthe name of nationalism, or professional or govern-mental interest, but these voices are only just be-coming audible, and are not great in number as yet.It is notable, however, that even in modulated dis-cussion grounded in everyday experience, the splitbetween those for and against the acceptance of braindeath remains strikingly evident. Even when thesuffering of potential recipients is clearly recognizedthis does not mean that involved Japanese will neces-sarily agree that transplants are an unequivocal good.When I asked one pediatrician, often visible in themedia, who deals with dying children every day, whyshe remains adamantly opposed to the introductionof organ transplants from brain dead donors, sheacknowledged that Buddhism, although of no appar-ent consequence in her daily life, is probably aninfluence since she believes deeply that death is insome way preordained and that we humans shouldnot play God. Although Buddhist related, the senti-ments of this pediatrician may not be very far re-moved from those of people living in other parts ofthe world today, but when contextualized in thecurrent debate about death in Japan they reveal theextent to which ‘‘needs’’ and ‘‘suffering’’ and ourresponses to those marked as ‘‘suffering’’ and‘‘needy’’ remain shaped by culturally derived values.The talk today in the United States is of‘‘rewarded gifting’’ and ‘‘organ wastage,’’ signs ofthe urgent need to procure more and more organsin a steady move towards the large-scale commodifi-cation of human parts. In our haste in North Americawe talk little about the flow of organs from the poorto the rich, from the Third World to the First World,and even less of possible atrocities, despite documen-tation of such by Amnesty International. Leon Kasshas described this process as a ‘‘coarsening of sens-ibilities and attitudes’’ and adds that ‘‘ . . . there is asad irony in our biomedical project, accurately an-ticipated in Aldous Huxley’sBrave New World:Weexpend enormous energy and vast sums of money topreserve and prolong bodily life, but in the processour embodied life is stripped of its gravity and muchof its dignity. This is, in a word, progress as tra-gedy.’’103We also keep death firmly under wrapsand, despite evidence of societal disagreement andmisunderstanding about the new death we havecreated, refuse to debate this issue in public. Perhapswe can learn directly from the Japanese case on thispoint, if nothing else, and begin to recognize onceagain that mortality is not merely biological demise.In striving to make the brain dead immortal bystating that they live on in others as donated organs,we in fact collapse the very culture/nature distinc-tion that made the yardstick for justifying brain deathin the first place. Surely such a contradiction de-serves debate.The monster is amongst us, and we need morecourage than Frankenstein exhibited if we are to usetechnology to relieve suffering in an equitablemanner; a first step is to recognize how easilysuffering can be used in the service of ideologicaland political ends. On both sides of the Pacific, ifdebate about technology and the body is reduced to aconfirmation or otherwise of scientific accuracy,or to a discussion of political interest, or even, forthat matter, to one of ethical correctness, we willconsistently lose sight of the necessity to step furtherback so that more difficult questions can be posed.Prominent among them is a consideration of therelationship of tacit, culturally shaped knowledgeto the production of scientific knowledge and itspractices, together with the associated contests,within and among societies, about legitimizationof such knowledge as truth. Most important, ofcourse, is the effect of such discussion on the recog-nition of suffering and what, if any, conditionshould be assigned as beyond the realm of culturalintervention.NOTES1 Jacques Ellul,The Technological Society, trans.

E. Evans-Pritchard[...]Death is due to witchcraft and must be avenged. Allother practices connected with witchcraft are epit-omized in the action of vengeance. In our presentcontext it will be sufficient to point out that in pre-European days vengeance was either executed dir-ectly, sometimes by the slaughter of a witch, andsometimes by acceptance of compensation, or bymeans of lethal magic. Witches were very seldomslain, for it was only when a man committed a secondor third murder, or murdered an important person,that a prince permitted his execution. Under Britishrule the magical method alone is employed.Vengeance seems to have been less a result of angerand hatred than the fulfilment of a pious duty and asource of profit. I have never heard that to-day the kinof a dead man, once they have exacted vengeance,show any rancour towards the family of the manwhom their magic has struck down, nor that in thepasttherewas anyprolonged hostility betweenthe kinof the dead and the kin of the witch who had paidcompensation for his murder. To-day if a man kills aperson by witchcraft the crime is his sole responsi-bilityandhiskinarenotassociatedwithhisguilt.Inthepast they assisted him to pay compensation, not invirtue of collective responsibility, but in virtue ofsocial obligations to a kinsman. His relatives-in-lawand his blood-brothers also contributed towards thepayment.Assoonasawitchisto-dayslainbymagic,orin the past had been speared to death or had paidcompensation, the affair is closed. Moreover, it is anissue between the kin of the dead and the kin of thewitch and other people are not concerned with it.They have the same social links with both parties.It is extremely difficult to-day to obtain infor-mation about victims of vengeance-magic. Azandethemselves do not know about them unless they aremembers of a murdered man’s closest kin. Onenotices that his kinsmen are no longer observingtaboos of mourning and one knows by this thattheir magic has performed its task, but it is uselessto inquire from them who was its victim becausethey will not tell you. It is their private affair and is asecret between them and their prince who must beinformed of the action of their magic since it isnecessary for his poison oracle to confirm theirpoison oracle before they are permitted to endtheir mourning. Besides, it is a verdict of the poisonFrom E. E. Evans–Pritchard,Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande(Oxford: Clarendon, 1968 [1937]).Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:03am page 115115"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"oracle and one must not disclose its revelations aboutsuch matters.If other people were acquainted with the names ofthose who have fallen victims to avenging magic thewhole procedure of vengeance would be exposed asfutile. For it may be observed here, though the pointwill more readily be understood later, that if it wereknown that the death of a man X had been avengedupon a witch Y then the whole procedure would bereduced to an absurdity because the death of Y is alsoavenged by his kinsmen upon awitch Z. Some Azandehave indeed explained to me their doubts about thehonesty of the princes who control the oracles, and afewhaveseenthatthepresent-daysystemisfallacious.At any rate, its fallaciousness is veiled so long aseverybody concerned keeps silence about the victimsof their vengeance-magic. In the past things weredifferent, for then a person accused by the prince’soracles of having killed another by witchcraft eitherpaid immediate compensation or was killed. In eithercase the matter was closed because the man who hadpaid compensation had no means of proving that hewas not a witch, and if he were killed at the prince’sorders his death could not be avenged. Nor was anautopsypermittedonhiscorpsetodiscoverwhetheritcontained witchcraft-substance.When I have challenged Azande to defend theirsystem of vengeance they have generally said that aprince whose oracles declare that Y has died from themagic of X’s kinsmen will not place the name of Zbefore his oracles to discover whether he died fromthe magic of Y’s kinsmen. When Y’s kinsmen asktheir prince to place Z’s name before his poisonoracle he will decline to do so and will tell themthat he knows Y to have died in expiation of a crimeand that his death cannot therefore be avenged. Afew Azande explained the present system by sayingthat perhaps vengeance-magic and witchcraft partici-pate in causing death. The part of the vengeance-magic explains the termination of mourning of onefamily and the part of witchcraft explains the initi-ation of vengeance by another family, i.e. they seekto explain a contradiction in their beliefs in themystical idiom of the beliefs themselves. But I haveonly been offered this explanation as a general andtheoretical possibility in reply to my objections.Since the names of victims of vengeance are keptsecret the contradiction is not apparent, for it wouldonly be evident if all deaths were taken into consider-ation and not any one particular death. So longtherefore as they are able to conform to customand maintain family honour Azande are not inter-ested in the broader aspects of vengeance in general.They saw the objection when I raised it but they werenot incommoded by it.For Azande do not discuss problems of witchcraftamong themselves nor pool their information aboutvengeance. So little do they generalize about witch-craft that I found they were seldom able to say whichlineages in their neighbourhood were witches. Thereason for this is given in later chapters.Princes must be aware of the contradiction be-cause they know the outcome of every death in theirprovinces. When I asked Prince Gangura how heaccepted the death of a man both as the action ofvengeance-magic and of witchcraft he smiled andadmitted that all was not well with the present-daysystem. Some princes said that they did not allow aman to be avenged if they knew he had died fromvengeance-magic, but I think they were lying. Onecannot know for certain, for even if a prince were totell the kin of a dead man that he had died fromvengeance-magic and might not be avenged hewould tell them in secret and they would keep hiswords a secret. They would pretend to their neigh-bours that they were avenging their kinsman and aftersome months would hang up the barkcloth ofmourning as a sign that vengeance was accomplished,for they would not wish people to know that theirkinsman was a witch.Consequently if the kinsmen of A avenge his deathby magic on B and then learn that B’s kinsmen haveceased mourning in sign of having accomplishedvengeance also, they believe that this second ven-geance is a pretence. Contradiction is therebyavoided.[...]VZande belief in witchcraft in no way contradictsempirical knowledge of cause and effect. Theworld known to the senses is just as real to them asit is to us.

They areforeshortening the chain of events, and in a particu-lar social situation are selecting the cause that issocially relevant and neglecting the rest. If a man iskilled by a spear in war, or by a wild beast in hunting,or by the bite of a snake, or form sickness, thereaction is the same and it is not directed in differentmodes of expression by the different modes of death.In every case witchcraft is the socially relevant cause,since it is the only one which allows intervention anddetermines social behaviour. If a buffalo kills a manyou can do nothing about it as far as the buffalo isconcerned. But, though surely enough the buffalohas killed him, it would not have killed him if it hadnot been for the operation of witchcraft at the sametime, and witchcraft is a social fact, a person. In anumber of co-operating causes this single one isselected and spoken of as the cause of death becauseit is the ideological pivot around which swings thelengthy social procedure from death to vengeance.Belief in death from natural causes and belief indeath from witchcraft are not mutually exclusive.On the contrary, they supplement one another, theone accounting for what the other does not accountfor. Besides, death is not only a natural fact but also asocial fact. It is not simply that the heart ceases tobeat and the lungs to pump air in an organism, but itis also the destruction of a member of a family andkin, of a community and tribe. Death leads to con-sultation of oracles, magic rites, and revenge.Among the causes of death witchcraft is the onlyone that has any significance for social behaviour. Theattribution of misfortune to witchcraft does notexclude what we call its real causes but is superim-posed on them and gives to social events their moralvalue.As a matter of fact Zande thought expresses thenotion of natural and mystical causation quite clearlyby using a hunting metaphor to define their relations.Azande always say of witchcraft that it is theumbagaor second spear. When Azande kill game there is adivision of meat between the man who first spearedthe animal and the man who plunged a second spearinto it. These two are considered to have killed thebeast and the owner of the second spear is called theumbaga. Hence if a man is killed by an elephantAzande say that the elephant is the first spear andthat witchcraft is the second spear and that togetherthey killed the man. If a man spears another in warthe slayer is the first spear and witchcraft is thesecond spear and together they killed him.VISince Azande recognize plurality of causes, and it isthe social situation that indicates the relevant one, wecan understand why the doctrine of witchcraft is notused to explain every failure and misfortune. Itsometimes happens that the social situation demandsa common-sense, and not a mystical, judgement ofcause. Thus, if you tell a lie, or commit adultery, orsteal, or deceive your prince, and are found out, youcannot elude punishment by saying that you werebewitched. Zande doctrine declares emphatically‘Witchcraft does not make a person tell lies’;‘Witchcraft does not make a person commit adul-tery’; ‘Witchcraft does not put adultery into a man.‘‘Witchcraft’’ is in yourself (you alone are respon-sible), that is, your penis becomes erect. It sees thehair of a man’s wife and it rises and becomes erectbecause the only ‘‘witchcraft’’ is, itself’ (‘‘witch-craft’’ is here used metaphorically); ‘Witchcraftdoes not make a person steal’; ‘Witchcraft doesnot make a person disloyal.’ Only on one occasionhave I heard a Zande plead that he was bewitchedwhen he had committed an offence and this waswhen he lied to me, and even on this occasioneverybody present laughed at him and told him thatwitchcraft does not make people tell lies.If a man murders another tribesman with knife orspear he is put to death. It is not necessary in such acase to seek a witch, for an objective towards whichvengeance may be directed is already present. If, onthe other hand, it is a member of another tribe whohas speared a man his relatives, or his prince, willtake steps to discover the witch responsible for theevent.It would be treason to say that a man put to deathon the orders of his king for an offence againstauthority was killed by witchcraft. If a man were toconsult the oracles to discover the witch responsibleRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:03am page 117E. E. Evans-Pritchard117"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"for the death of a relative who had been put to deathat the orders of his king he would run the risk of beingput to death himself. For here the social situationexcludes the notion of witchcraft as on other occa-sions it pays no attention to natural agents and em-phasizes only witchcraft. Also, if a man were killed invengeance because the oracles said that he was awitchand had murdered another man with his witchcraftthen his relatives could not say that he had been killedby witchcraft. Zande doctrine lays it down that hedied at the hand of avengers because he was a homi-cide. If a man were to have expressed the view that hiskinsman had been killed by witchcraft and to haveacted upon his opinion by consulting the poisonoracle, he might have been punished for ridiculingthe king’s poison oracle, for it was the poison oracleof the king that had given official confirmation of theman’s guilt, and it was the king himself who hadpermitted vengeance to take its course.In the instances given in the preceding paragraphsit is the natural cause and not the mystical cause thatis selected as the socially significant one. In thesesituations witchcraft is irrelevant and, if not totallyexcluded, is not indicated as the principal factorin causation. As in our own society a scientific theoryof causation, if not excluded, is deemed irrelevant inquestions of moral and legal responsibility, so inZande society the doctrine of witchcraft, if notexcluded, is deemed irrelevant in the same situ-ations. We accept scientific explanations of thecauses of disease, and even of the causes of insanity,but we deny them in crime and sin because here theymilitate against law and morals which are axiomatic.The Zande accepts a mystical explanation of thecauses of misfortune, sickness, and death, but hedoes not allow this explanation if it conflicts withsocial exigencies expressed in law and morals.For witchcraft is not indicated as a cause forfailure when a taboo has been broken. If a childbecomes sick, and it is known that its father andmother have had sexual relations before it wasweaned, the cause of death is already indicated bybreach of a ritual prohibition and the question ofwitchcraft does not arise. If a man develops leprosyand there is a history of incest in his case then incest isthe cause of leprosy and not witchcraft. In thesecases, however, a curious situation arises becausewhen the child or the leper dies it is necessary toavenge their deaths and the Zande sees no difficultyin explaining what appears to us to be most illogicalbehaviour. He does so on the same principles as whena man has been killed by a wild beast, and he invokesthe same metaphor of ‘second spear’. In the casesmentioned above there are really three causes of aperson’s death. There is the illness from which hedies, leprosy in the case of the man, perhaps somefever in the case of the child. These sicknesses are notin themselves products of witchcraft, for they existin their own right just as a buffalo or a granary existin their own right. Then there is the breach of ataboo, in the one case of weaning, in the other case ofincest. The child, and the man, developed fever, andleprosy, because a taboo was broken. The breach of ataboo was the cause of their sickness, but the sicknesswould not have killed them if witchcraft had not alsobeen operative. If witchcraft had not been present as‘second spear’ they would have developed fever andleprosy just the same, but they would not have diedfrom them. In these instances there are two sociallysignificant causes, breach of taboo and witchcraft,both of which are relative to different social pro-cesses, and each is emphasized by different people.But where there has been a breach of taboo anddeath is not involved witchcraft will not be evoked asa cause of failure. If a man eats a forbidden food afterhe has made powerful punitive magic he may die, andin this case the cause of his death is known before-hand, since it is contained in the conditions of thesituation in which he died even if witchcraft was alsooperative. But it does not follow that he will die.What does inevitably follow is that the medicine hehas made will cease to operate against the person forwhom it is intended and will have to be destroyedlest it turn against the magician who sent it forth.The failure of the medicine to achieve its purpose isdue to breach of a taboo and not to witchcraft. If aman has had sexual relations with his wife and on thenext day approaches the poison oracle it will notreveal the truth and its oracular efficacy will bepermanently undermined. If he had not broken ataboo it would have been said that witchcraft hadcaused the oracle to lie, but the condition of theperson who had attended the seance provides areason for its failure to speak the truth withoutRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:03am page 118Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande118"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"having to bring in the notion of witchcraft as anagent. No one will admit that he has broken ataboo before consulting the poison oracle, butwhen an oracle lies every one is prepared to admitthat a taboo may have been broken by some one.Similarly, when a potter’s creations break in firingwitchcraft is not the only possible cause of thecalamity. Inexperience and bad workmanship mayalso be reasons for failure, or the potter may himselfhave had sexual relations on the preceding night. Thepotter himself will attribute his failure to witchcraft,but others may not be of the same opinion.Not even all deaths are invariably and unani-mously attributed to witchcraft or to the breachof some taboo. The deaths of babies from certaindiseases are attributed vaguely to the SupremeBeing. Also, if a man falls suddenly and violentlysick and dies, his relatives may be sure that a sorcererhas made magic against him and that it is not a witchwho has killed him. A breach of the obligations ofblood-brotherhood may sweep away whole groupsof kin, and when one after another of brothersand cousins die it is the blood and not witchcraftto which their deaths are attributed by outsiders,though the relatives of the dead will seek to avengethem on witches. When a very old man dies unre-lated people say that he has died of old age, butthey do not say this in the presence of kinsmen,who declare that witchcraft is responsible for hisdeath.It is also thought that adultery may cause misfor-tune, though it is only one participating factor, andwitchcraft is also believed to be present. Thus is itsaid that a man may be killed in warfare or in ahunting accident as a result of his wife’s infidelities.Therefore, before going to war or on a large-scalehunting expedition a man might ask his wife todivulge the names of her lovers.[...]I am aware that my account of Zande magic suffersfrom lack of co-ordination. So does Zande magic.Magical rites do not form an interrelated system, andthere is no nexus between one rite and another. Eachis an isolated activity, so that they cannot all bedescribed in an ordered account. Any descriptionof them must appear somewhat haphazard. Indeed,by treating them all together in Part IV I have giventhem a unity by abstraction that they do not possessin reality.This lack of co-ordination between magical ritescontrasts with the general coherence and interde-pendence of Zande beliefs in other fields. Those Ihave described in this book are difficult for Euro-peans to understand. Witchcraft is a notion so for-eign to us that it is hard for us to appreciate Zandeconvictions about its reality. Let it be rememberedthat it is no less hard for Azande to appreciate ourignorance and disbelief about the subject. I onceheard a Zande say about us: ‘Perhaps in their countrypeople are not murdered by witches, but here theyare.’Throughout I have emphasized the coherency ofZande beliefs when they are considered together andare interpreted in terms of situations and socialrelationships. I have tried to show also the plasticityof beliefs as functions of situations. They are notindivisible ideational structures but are loose associ-ations of notions. When a writer brings them to-gether in a book and presents them as a conceptualsystem their insufficiencies and contradictions are atonce apparent. In real life they do not function as awhole but in bits. A man in one situation utilizeswhat in the beliefs are convenient to him and pays noattention to other elements which he might use indifferent situations. Hence a single event may evoke anumber of different and contradictory beliefs amongdifferent persons.I hope that I have persuaded the reader of onething, namely, the intellectual consistency of Zandenotions. They only appear inconsistent when rangedlike lifeless museum objects. When we see how anindividual uses them we may say that they are mys-tical but we cannot say that his use of them is illogicalor even that it is uncritical. I had no difficulty in usingZande notions as Azande themselves use them. Oncethe idiom is learnt the rest is easy, for in Zandelandone mystical idea follows on another as reasonably asone common-sense idea follows on another in ourown society.It is in connexion with death that Zande belief inwitchcraft, oracles, and magic is most coherent andis most intelligible to us. Therefore, though I havebefore briefly described the interplay of thesenotions at death it is fitting to give a slightly fullerRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:03am page 119E. E. Evans-Pritchard119"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"account in conclusion, for it is death that answers theriddle of mystical beliefs.It is not my intention to give a detailed descriptionof Zande funeral ceremonies and vengeance. I shallnot even attempt to recount the elaborate magicalrites by which vengeance is accomplished. These willfind a place in another volume. Here I give the barestoutline of what happens from the time a man fallssick to the time his death is avenged.It is with death and its premonitions that Azandemost frequently and feelingly associate witchcraft,and it is only with regard to death that witchcraftevokes violent retaliation. It is likewise in connexionwith death that greatest attention is paid to oraclesand magical rites. Witchcraft, oracles, and magicattain their height of significance, as procedures andideologies, at death.When a man falls sick his kinsmen direct theiractivities along two lines. They attack witchcraft byoracles, public warnings, approaches to the witch,making of magic, removal of the invalid to the bush,and dances of witch-doctors. They attack the diseaseby administration of drugs, usually summoning aleech who is also a witch-doctor, in serious sickness.A leech attends a man till all hope of his recoveryis abandoned. His relations gather and weep aroundhim. As soon as he is dead they wail, and therelatives-in-law dig the grave. Before burial thedead man’s kin cut off a piece of barkcloth andwipe his lips with it and cut off a piece of hisfinger-nail. These substances are necessary to makevengeance-magic. Sometimes earth from the firstsod dug when the grave is being prepared is addedto them.On the day following burial steps are taken to-wards vengeance. The elder kinsmen of the deadman consult the poison oracle. In theory they ask itfirst whether the dead man has died as a result ofsome crime he has committed. But in practice,except on rare occasions when his kinsmen knowthat he has committed adultery or some other crime,and that the injured man has made lethal magic, thisstep is omitted. Not that a Zande would admit itsomission. He would say that if this question were notdirectly put to the oracle it is contained in thosequestions that follow, for the oracle would not an-nounce that their magic would be successful unlessthe dead man were innocent of crime and were avictim of witchcraft.In practice, therefore, they first ask it to choosethe man who will undertake to act as avenger. Hisduties are to dispatch magic on the tracks of thewitch under the direction of a magician who ownsit, and to observe the onerous taboos that enable it toachieve its purpose. If the kin of the dead man wishto make certain of avenging him they insist onplacing only the names of adults as candidates forthis office, but usually senior men are anxious toavoid the ascetic routine it imposes and propose thename of a lad who is too young to feel the hardship ofsex taboos and yet old enough to realize the serious-ness of food taboos, and of sufficient character toobserve them. They ask the oracle whether themagic will be successful in its quest if a certain boyobserves the taboos. If the oracle says that it will beunsuccessful they place before it the name of anotherman or boy. When it has chosen a name they ask as acorroborative verdict whether the boy will dieduring his observance of the taboos. He might dieas a result of breaking a taboo or because the manthey wish to avenge was slain in expiation of a crime.If the oracle declares that the boy will survive ven-geance is assured.They then ask the poison oracle to choose amagician to provide vengeance-magic. They putbefore it the name of a magician and ask it whethervengeance will be accomplished if his medicine isused. If the oracle rejects one name they propose toit another.Having chosen a boy to observe the taboos and amagician to provide the medicines, they proceed toprosecute vengeance. I will not describe the varioustypes of medicines employed nor the rites that dis-patch them on their errand. It is not expected thatthey will immediately accomplish their purpose.Indeed, if people in the vicinity die shortly afterthe rites have been performed the kinsmen do notsuppose that they are victims of their magic.From time to time the kinsmen make presents ofbeer to the magician to stir up the medicines, be-cause Azande think that they go out on their missionand, not having discovered the guilty man, return totheir hiding-place. They have to be sent forth afreshon their quest by further rites. This may happenRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:03am page 120Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande120"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"many times before vengeance has been accom-plished, perhaps two years after magic has firstbeen made, and usually not before six months after-wards. Although the taboos are only incumbent on asingle boy in so far as the virtue of the magic isconcerned, all near kinsmen and the spouse of thedead must respect irksome prohibitions to a greateror lesser degree, for a variety of reasons, and all areanxious to end their fast. Nevertheless, everythingmust be done in good order and without haste. Fromtime to time they ask the poison oracle whether themedicines are being diligent in their search and forfurther assurance of ultimate success.In the past medicine of vengeance was placed onthe dead man’s grave, but it is said that peopleinterfered with it there, either removing it andplunging it into a marsh to deprive it of power, orspoiling it by bringing it into contact with someimpure substance, like elephant’s flesh. To-day theyoften continue to place some medicines on the gravebut they also hide others in the bush, generally in thecavity of a tree. There they are safe from contamin-ation by ill-disposed persons.Several months after magic has been made someone dies in the vicinity and they inquire of the poisonoracle whether this man is their victim. They do not,as a rule, inquire about persons who have diedseveral miles away from the homestead of the de-ceased. If the oracle tells them that the magic has notyet struck they wait till another neighbour dies andconsult it again. In course of time the oracle declaresthat the death of a man in the neighbourhood is dueto their magic and that this man is the victim whomthey have slain to avenge their kinsman.They then ask the oracle whether the slain man isthe only witch who killed their kinsman or whetherthere is another witch who assisted in the murder. Ifthere is another witch they wait till he also is slain,but if the oracle tells them that the man who recentlydied was alone responsible they go to their princeand present him with the wings of the fowl that diedin declaration of the witch’s guilt. The prince con-sults his own poison oracle, and if it states that theoracle of his subjects has deceived them they willhave to await other deaths in their neighbourhoodand seek to establish that one of them was caused bytheir magic.When the oracle of the prince agrees with theoracle of the kinsmen vengeance is accomplished.The wings of the fowls that have died in acknow-ledgement of their victory are hung up, with thebarkcloth and sleeping-mat of the boy who has ob-served taboos, on a tree at the side of a frequentedpath in public notification that the kinsmen havedone their duty.The owner of the medicine is now summoned andis asked to recall it. When his fee has been paid hecooks an antidote for the boy who has borne theburden of taboos, the kinsmen of the dead, and thewidow; and he destroys the medicine, for it hasaccomplished its task. He destroys it so that it cando no further harm. Those who are close kinsmen ofthe dead man may now live unrestricted lives.Thus death evokes the notion of witchcraft;oracles are consulted to determine the course ofvengeance; magic is made to attain it; oracles decidewhen magic has executed vengeance; and its magicaltask being ended, the medicine is destroyed.Azande say that in the past, before Europeansconquered their country, their customs were differ-ent. Provincials used the methods I have just de-scribed, but men who regularly attended court didnot make magic. On the death of a kinsman theyconsulted their poison oracles and presented to theirprince the name of a witch accused by them. If theprince’s oracle agreed with their oracles they exactedcompensation of a woman and twenty spears fromthe witch or slew him. In those days death evoked thenotion of witchcraft; oracles denounced the witch;compensation was exacted or vengeance executed.Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:03am page 121E.

It is unfor-tunate, therefore, that our knowledge of these cen-trally important ceremonies must depend uponhearsay evidence,1even though it may be derivedfrom Dinka who claim first-hand knowledge of thesubject. There can be no doubt, however, that theceremonies we now describe did, and perhaps do,actually occur; for although the ceremonies are nowknown to be officially forbidden, Dinka admit tohaving seen or heard of them, when they do notthink it imprudent to admit to interest in a customknown to be illegal, and felt to be repugnant toforeigners whose knowledge of its meaning is super-ficial. During my stay in Dinkaland, but in anotherpart of the country, one successful case attractedattention at a high official level, and in the discussionswhich followed the abortive ceremony already men-tioned those who tried to probe the intention of theparticipants were clearly aware, up to a point, of thegeneral procedures which ought to accompany thefull ceremonial burial of a master of the fishing-spear.During the course of these discussions I was told thenames of several masters of the fishing-spear who hadbeen put in the grave alive in comparatively recenttimes. Since the mystery which surrounds thecustom gives rise to many misunderstandings whichare to the disadvantage of the Dinka, I do not con-sider it a breach of confidence to represent thesituation as it was represented to me, omitting onlynames and places which would identify the actors. Inview of the ethnographical and theoretical interest ofthe ceremonies, I have added reports from others tothe little evidence which I was able to collect, in faceof the reticence induced partly by official prohibitionof these practices.The burial of a master of the fishing-spear with fullhonour is calleddhor beny ke pir,orthiok ( beny) ke pir,or sometimesbeny aci lo thoc. Thedhor2of the firstexpression is a technical term of Dinka religion forwhich I can find no certain equivalent in English. Itsobject may be either a clan-divinity (ok alo yanh wadhormeans ‘we are going todhorthe clan-divinity ofmy father’) or a master of the fishing-spear, and I donot think that it is used outside these contexts. WhenFrom Godfrey Lienhardt, ‘‘Burial Alive,’’ inDivinity and Experience: The Religion of the Dinka(Oxford: Clarendon, 1961).Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:08am page 122122"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"used of the clan-divinity, it has the sense of serving,or giving homage to, the divinity, at a ‘feast’ withsacrifice and hymns of the kind we have described.Peopledhorthe clan-divinity so that it may augmenttheir strength, and in doing so satisfy a demandwhich it makes upon them. Similarly, as will appear,in placing their master of the fishing-spear in thegrave while he yet lives, they think to augment theirvitality and also, normally, to gratify his own desire.With these elements of the meaning ofdhorin mind,we may perhaps translatedhor beny ke piras ‘to bury amaster while he lives’, which is its practical signifi-cance in ordinary Dinka usage. This also is the literalmeaning of the second expression commonly used ofthe ceremony,thiok ke pir. The third,beny aci lo thoc,3means literally ‘the master has gone to sit up’ or ‘themaster has gone to his seat’.Thocis to sit erect, and itis also something upon which one can sit erect, suchas a saddle. Its implication here is that the subject isnot lying prone in death as are the corpses of ordin-ary men, but is in some way propped up. It may be infact that masters of the fishing-spear do recline whenthey are placed in the grave alive; but the expressionused contradicts the impression of inert recumbencewhich is made by any mere corpse, and which isconveyed by the usual Dinka wordtocwhich appliesequally to the lying down of a corpse and the lyingin sleep of the living. Similarly, the ceremonies nowdescribed contradict the customary configuration ofideas surrounding the deaths of ordinary men andwomen.The following is a text typical of the accountswhich Dinka friends may give of what happens atthe deaths of masters of the fishing-spear. The authordid not claim to have witnessed such a ceremony,though he said that he knew of one which had beenheld in a tribe adjacent to his own. I have changedproper names, but the lineages actually mentionedwere known to me.When a master of the fishing-spear has fallen sick and isbecoming weak, he will call all his people and tell themto bring his whole camp (tribe or subtribe) to his hometo bury him whilst he lives. His people will obey himand quickly come, for if they delay and the master ofthe fishing-spear dies before they reach him, they willbe most miserable.They will come and drive their cattle-pegs into theground by the side of the home of the master of thefishing-spear who is to be buried alive. When theyhave arrived, the master will talk to his people andtell them what they are to do with him. When his talkwith the older people is finished, he will tell them tosend the young men forakoc (Cordia rothii)branches,and the young men will be quickly sent to fetchakoc.When they return, they clear a patch of ground sothat nothing harmful remains in it;4and when theyhave prepared the ground they dig a grave and put thebranches ofakocin it to make a platform. Then theywill cut into strips the skin of a bull previously sacri-ficed, and make it like anangareeb5on the frame theyhave prepared. And they will take a living ram andtether it at the bottom of the hole (grave) at the side ofthe platform. They then lift up the master of thefishing-spear, and put him into the earth while he yetlives.And he will not be afraid of death; he will be put inthe earth while singing his songs. Nobody amonghis people will wail or cry because their man hasdied. They will be joyful because their master of thefishing-spear will give them life (wei) so that they shalllive untroubled by any evil.When they have placed the master of the fishing-spear on the platform on the ground, they makeanother platform above it, also with strips of hide,and put a gourd of milk in the earth with him. Thenwhen all is completed, the young men and old men,girls, women and children, will all take cattle-dung andfling it upon the grave, until the grave is completelycovered over with a heap of dung. For the grave of amaster of the fishing-spear is not to be covered withearth. And they will sacrifice another bull and a cow-in-calf.After this is finished, they cover the top of the gravewith dungashes, and make a feast for the master ofthe fishing-spear. After another month, they will makebeer and porridge, and kill two bulls, and remove thefence ofawargrass with which the homestead ofthe master has been surrounded after the burial. Andthey will dance and sacrifice to all divinities so that theywill be pleased with men.The two texts which follow were dictated by afriend who claimed that, as a youth, he had beenpresent at the ceremonies he here describes.

I was only a boy. The master’s own home wascalled Malek, in the subtribe Magol, and he was themaster of the fishing-spear of that subtribe. His clanwas called Pakedang. They are few now but they arevery strong in invocation, so that in my country wesometimes call them ‘witches of the fishing-spear’.6There are other masters of the fishing-spear in thatsubtribe, but there are none to equal them.The master of the fishing-spear Deng Deng wasbecoming very old, and when his years were finishedand he was very old indeed, so that he could not seewell and all his teeth had fallen out, he told his lineagethat he wished to be buried alive, and that they shouldgo and tell the people of the country and see if theyagreed.They prepared the ground for his burial at a veryancient cattle-camp site called Malwal, which was alsohard bythehomestead of Deng Deng and near his cattle-byre.7So it was at his very own original home [pandennhom, literally ‘the head of his home’]. The clan whichcleared and dug the ground was Padiangbar; it is thatclan which buries a master of the fishing-spear alive inmy country.8They dug a very big hole on the highest point of thecattle-camp site, in the middle of the cattle. Next to itweretwobulls,abigwhiteoneandaredone.Theywerethe whole beasts of the clan-divinitiesMonGrass andFlesh. When the hole had been dug, they made twoplatforms [frameworks] ofakocwood, which had beenfetchedbytheyoungmenofPadiangbar fromfarawayinthe forest, as much as a day’s journey distant.They worked for three days, and the old man was stillabove the ground. They honoured the bulls with songsfor two days, speaking invocations each day in themorning and the evening. Then the masters of thefishing-spear of Pakedang, along with those of Paketoiand Pagong,9slit the throats of the bulls at about 10o’clock. Deng Deng’s mother was the daughter of awoman of Paketoi and his mother’s father was of theclan Pagong. So they were all there together, to jointogether his father’s and his maternal uncle’s families (bipanerden mat kek pan e wun).Deng Deng made invocations over the bulls, and thehorns of the first bull, the white one, sank forwards tothe ground. When the bull had been killed, they took itsskin and cut it into strips, and made a bed from it on theframework. And every day they made a feast (cam yai)and danced inside the cattle-byre during the daytime,and outside at night. And men slept in the byre withother men’s wives, and everyone agreed to this [literally‘and there was no bad word’].They then placed awar-shield, made from the hide ofa bull of the clan-divinity which had been killed in thepast, on top of the bed. It was awar-shield which had forlong been kept in the byre, and which the people hadanointed with butter every spring and autumn, duringthe ‘dividing months’.10They placed Deng Deng on theshield and lowered him into the grave.The red (brown) bull remained. When Deng Denghad been lowered into the hole, they made a platformover him, and so arranged it that the top of the platformwas level with the surface of the ground. They sanghymns, and after the singing was finished they made anenclosure ofdhotwood around the grave. The enclosurewas about twice the area of the surface of the grave, andof such a height that a man could just see over it if hetried. Then they took cattle-dung and partly coveredover the top of the grave, leaving part uncovered so thathis voice could be heard. From his grave, Deng Dengcalledtheolder mentogetheroutsidetheenclosure,andall the women and children, even his own wives, weresent away.The author of the text was therefore also sent away;but according to him, when the old master of thefishing-spear had finished speaking to the old men,they returned to the rest and reported to them whathe had said. The text continues:Deng Deng had died at the time of the harvest. He saidthat in the following dry season, in the month ofAkanythii,11his tribe would fight with a neighbouringtribe, and that he was distressed because his peoplewere not brave enough in war.Two months later, this fight took place, and eightof his people were killed and two from the neigh-bouring tribe. That neighbouring tribe soundly beathis tribe and drove them off as far as Agar Dinkacountry. Eventually, the Government forces cameand prevented thefts of cattle. But even then thatneighbouring tribe made a feast near the river inthe face of the dry-season pastures of his own tribe,which had been so harried that they could do nothingabout it.Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:08am page 124Burial Alive124"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"He added:While the master of the fishing-spear still speaks, theydo not cover the grave with dung. But when he nolonger replies when they address him, they heap up thedung over him. And when it has all sunk in, they makea shrine.12Some people may then say ‘The master ofthe fishing-spear has died’, but they will usually say‘The master has been taken into the earth’. Andnobody will say ‘Alas, he is dead!’ They will say ‘It isvery good.’The same informant told me of the following casewhich he clearly preferred not to discuss at length asit had occurred much more recently. He spoke asfollows:Two masters of the fishing-spear known to you todayare the sons of that master of the fishing-spear I sawburied. He was the master of the fishing-spear withsupremacy in the whole tribe of Kwek, and was a manof the clan Pagong who are the chief masters of thefishing-spear in that tribe.There follows a description which does not sig-nificantly differ from that previously given, and inwhich again it is made clear that the master of thefishing-spear was very old, though not sick, andasked that he might be buried. The site chosen wasagain an old cattle-camp site adjoining his home-stead. The following part of this text adds somethingto what has already been described:All the people of his tribe came, and the cattle weretethered around. They made an enclosure, but thistime they did not dance. The young men were sentaway when he was in the grave. The older men laterreported that he had spoken to them in this way: ‘I amgoing to see (deal with) in the earth the Powers ofsickness which kill people and cattle. And I am stilldispleased with my son Moror because we quarrelled. Ihave nothing bad in my heart towards other people.’After three months, there was no more cattle-plague,and after three months also his son Moror died. Hisfather had fetched him (aci wun lo dhiec).The indication of the ground-plan of such a cere-mony is given in figure 11.1I include this simple plan because it representswhat Dinka themselves drew in the dust to explainsuch a ceremony, and thus includes, one may sup-pose, a Dinka view of what is essential. The newgourd, to hold water for aspersions and the splitsacred cucumbers for drawing over the backs andchests of the sick, was strongly marked in the plan.The sacred spears, for consecration and reconsecra-tion, are placed round the shrine. At least four beastsare required. The bull-calf is tethered during invoca-tions, and then returned to the herd, where it be-comes the new ‘bull of the clan-divinity’. The bull ofthe clan-divinity is sacrificed, and provides the stripsof hide for the burial-platform. The cow-calf istethered during the invocations, and is then returnedto the herd, to become later the dam of a new ‘bullof the clan-divinity’, of which the bull-calf will bethe sire. Beasts for sacrifice to the clan-divinityshould be bred of consecrated stock, though this isnot always possible, at least in routine sacrifices. Thewhite ram was specifically stated to be the offering ofthe women, and those who provided the plan men-tioned also that butter would be brought in gourdsfor anointing the horns and the testicles of thesacrificial victim.Cattle-pegfor white ramCattle-pegfor cow calfForked branchshrineCattle peg for bull ofclan-divinityCattle peg for bull calfSacred spearsA new half-gourd of waterFigure 11.1Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:08am page 125Godfrey Lienhardt125"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"These accounts are typical of what one hears ofthe burial of masters of the fishing-spear in WesternDinkaland. I add to them some conclusions drawnfrom the inquiry into a suspected case of burial aliveto which I have already referred, and which (ifindeed it really was intended) was unsuccessfulowing to official intervention. In the course of thisinquiry it became apparent that certain activitieswere associated, in the minds of most of thosepresent, with ceremonial burial. Naturally, sincemost of those who had attended the preliminariesof the trampling of the calf (already described) wereimplicated in the accusation that they intended tobury their chief alive, they were anxious to testifythat their ceremony was intended only to strengthenthe old man, and was therefore innocent in the eyesof the Government’s law. The statements they made,however, reveal what for them would have beenconsidered significant in suggesting that burial alivewas intended. One emphasized that the old master ofthe fishing-spear was ‘not an important master of thefishing-spear’, rather minimizing his standing, be-cause it is known that not everyone who is technic-ally a master of the fishing-spear has sufficientstanding to be treated in this manner. Others empha-sized the frequency with which, in the ceremoniesand in the preliminaries to them, people spoke of‘strengthening’ the old man, and not of burying him.The son of the master of the fishing-spear said that hisfather had never told him that he wished to beburied, and it was in this case clear throughout theevidence and the reactions of those present to it thatthe desires of the master of the fishing-spear wereconsidered relevant to the interpretation of the cere-mony. Everyone seemed to take it for granted thatsuch a burial would normally take place only at theinitial instigation of the master of the fishing-spearconcerned, and not against his will. The old masterof the fishing-spear himself said that he had called hispeople to strengthen, and not to bury, him. Onepiece of evidence of innocence of intention whichwas strongly urged was that the young men of thecamp had not been sent to cut theakocwood fromwhich the platform for the grave is made, and thatwhen the people were making their sacrifice therewas noakocin the homestead. Further, the cattle hadnot been tethered outside around the home of thesick old man and, as his son insisted, there wereseveral beasts in the cattle-byre. It is clear from thisthat the tethering of cattle outside around the placeof burial is considered an important feature of theceremony. The manner in which the calf was killedwas said to be a quite normal procedure for the deathof a beast sacrificed for the recovery of a master ofthe fishing-spear, as was the fact that some of theyoung men had brought gourds of milk for libations.But, it was pointed out, the young men were alsodrinking milk, whereas when a master of the fishing-spear was buried alive milk was not drunk, it was‘respected’ (thek). Also, it was suggested, the sacri-fice was not large enough for a burial alive, and theceremony had not been mooted sufficiently longbeforehand to make it possible for all those membersof the sick man’s clan who would have come to beinformed. Only two days’ preparation had beenmade. One man said also that if a burial of a masterof the fishing-spear had been about to take place, alllineages in the subtribe would have produced beastsfor sacrifice, that the young men would have goneinto the woods and there slaughtered bulls and goatsand left them for the birds to eat, and for Powers ofsickness. Strangers, moreover, had been made wel-come at the ceremony, but in a burial alive theywould not have been encouraged to come near. Itwould also have been expected that the spear of anenemy should be taken and bent in the dust.Some of this evidence was questioned by theDinka elders who inquired into the case. It waspointed out, as a significant feature, that the youngwarriors and women of the whole subtribe wereabout the homestead, or near by in the cattle-camp, and that if only the strengthening ceremonyhad been intended the closer kin of the master of thefishing-spear would have been the only ones con-cerned. It was maintained that the trampling to deathof the calfwasa feature which suggested somethingmore than the ordinary sacrificial act, and that, mostimportantly, some of the warriors were carryingwarshields. There was some disagreement aboutthe situations in which it would be expected thatthe victim should be trampled to death (kacic), somesaying that this would really be done in the forest, inorder to free people from a serious pestilence, or as apreparation for war. We have remarked already uponRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:08am page 126Burial Alive126"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"the close connexion between religion and war amongthe Dinka. It was largely on these grounds, and onwhat was considered to be the untrustworthiness ofsome of the evidence of those accused – that, forexample, though the cattle had not been tethered inthe homestead, they had been brought to a cattle-camp near by – that the investigators decided thatthose who took part in the ceremony had a case toanswer.There are some differences between the substanceof these accounts from Western Dinkaland, and whathas been reported from other parts. Since evidenceis unavoidably slender, I quote at length from thefullest published accounts of what happens at a burialalive, those of Professor and Mrs. Seligman, MajorG. W. Titherington, and Ibrahim Eff. Bedri. Thefollowing is the information collected by Professorand Mrs. Seligman, whose visits to Dinkaland weremade in 1909–10 and 1911–12. Professor and Mrs.Seligman write:13In 1922 we found that Byordit [a rainmaker or masterof the fishing-spear of a section of the Bor Dinka] wasdead. Fear of the Government led to unwillingness tospeak of the manner of his passing, but we understoodthat after he had several times requested that he mightbe killed his couch was at last placed in the midst of acattle-hearth, i.e. upon a mass of dried and burntdung, and his people danced round him until somuch dust was raised that in a few hours the old man– a chronic bronchitic – was dead.The rain-maker of the Niel tribe was also one of ourinformants; he told us that his father and paternal unclehad both been killed in the traditional manner, the Nielcustom being to strangle theirban ̃in his own house,having first prepared his grave. They then wash thecorpse and kill a bullock in front of the house, skinningit immediately and making a couch (angareeb) of itsskin, which is placed in the grave and the body laidupon it; a cell should then be built over the couch sothat the earth does not come in contact with the body.The Niel take every care to guard theirban ̃fromaccidental death, for should he die suddenly as a resultof an accident some sickness would surely occur, eventhough his son or a close blood relative would imme-diately succeed him. If it was thought that theban ̃wasseriously ill, he would be killed, even though he werequite young, for it would be a dangerous matter if hewere to die of an illness, since as our informant pointedout, this would prevent any of his sons (i.e. presumablyany relative) from becomingban ̃in their turn. Actuallythis had never happened.An Agar Dinka gave the following account of theslaying of their rainmaker. A wide grave is dug, and acouch is placed in it, upon which the rainmaker lies onhis right side with a skin under his head. He is sur-rounded by his friends and relatives, including hisyounger children, but his elder children are notallowed near the grave, at any rate towards the end,lest in their despair they should injure themselves. Theban ̃lies upon his couch without food or drink for manyhours, generally for more than a day. From time totime he speaks to his people, recalling the past historyof the tribe, how he has ruled and advised them, andinstructing them how to act in the future. At lasthe tells them he has finished, and bids them coverhim up; earth is thrown into the grave and he is soonsuffocated.Captain J. M. Stubbs, writing of the Reik, informsus that theban ̃bithis laid on a bier in a roofed-in cellbuilt in the grave, and that his neck, elbows and kneesare broken; sometimes he is first strangled with a cow-rope. According to another account, theban ̃eats alittle millet, drinks milk, and throws the remainder tothe east, praying and affirming that he is going to hisfathers but that the food he leaves to his children. Acow-rope is placed around his neck, his elbows andknees are broken, and one of the sacred spears is placedin his hand, which he is helped to raise. His son takesthe spear, and theban ̃is strangled. It appears that this isdone in semi-privacy; then the drums beat, the peoplegather, and the grave is filled in. A shelter is built overit, which when it falls to pieces is not rebuilt, thoughthe ground around is kept cleared lest bush fires shouldsweep across the tomb. It seems that certain species oftrees are expected to grow on or near the grave, andthere may be some connection between this and theinitiation of sacrifice at the grave. Concerning the Bor,Archdeacon Shaw informs us that a rain-maker isburied in alwak(cattle-byre) which continues to beused, the grave being fenced off with short poles. He issaid to take the food of the community with him intothe grave, so when the next season arrives a hole is dugat the side of the byre so that the food may come outagain. This will ensure good crops, abundance oftermites and other food. Dr. Tucker writes of the Cicthat when theban ̃bithis buried, milk is poured into hisright hand, millet placed in his left and the hands closedover their contents, thus ensuring plenty until the newban ̃bithis installed.Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:08am page 127Godfrey Lienhardt127"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"We believe that all tribes sprinkle milk on the gravesof their rain-makers, and it is probable that all placesome property in the grave, while perhaps some bury abullock or a cow with their rainmaker.I was not able to confirm the presence of any ideathat the master of the fishing-spear took the food ofthe community with him into the grave, thoughundoubtedly most people say that he is buried withmilk and perhaps with a beast, sometimes an ox andsometimes a ram. It is thought, among the WesternDinka, that the sick master of the fishing-spear maytake some affliction of the community away with himinto the grave. There is one famous case in WesternDinkaland of a renowned master of the fishing-spearwho entered the grave clutching in his hand a tsetsefly, and thereby removed the scourge of tsetse fromhis people. It may now happen also that a living beastis buriedin place ofa master of the fishing-spear.Shortly after the abortive ceremony already men-tioned, it was reported that a burial alive wasintended in a village of the same district. Policedescended upon the village to find a new gravecontaining only a ram. Other discrepancies betweenmy own accounts and those of Professor and Mrs.Seligman from other parts of Dinkaland are left forcomment until other accounts have been considered,and a minimal measure of agreement between themall can be reached.The account of ‘Burial Alive among Dinka of Bahr-el-Ghazal Province’ published in 1925 by G. W. T.(Major G. W. Titherington),14then a Sudan PoliticalOfficer in that Province, agrees substantially withthat I myself was told. He says, however, that thecustom was originally confined to the clans of Pagongand Parum, from whom it was copied by Payi. Thevarious lineages represented among the people of amaster of the fishing-spear are said to bring beasts toslaughter at the feast for his burial. Major Tithering-ton also says that the burial takes place in a cattle-byre, which continues to be used as before until itfalls into disrepair, when earth is taken from the graveand used to make a mound-shrine. There is no men-tion of strangulation or of other violence done to themaster of the fishing-spear in Major Titherington’snote, and it is made clear that his manner of meetinghis death is voluntarily chosen by him. From the gravehe eventually raises a spear to indicate that he wishesthe grave to be filled in. Again, a platform is builtover him, and he rests upon a ‘pillow’ under thisplatform, which is covered with grass. An ox, buriedalive with him at the other end of this vast grave, issaid to die in eight days, and he himself is covered inten days unless he has given a sign that he wishes thisto be done earlier. Major Titherington mentions that,once in the grave, the master of the fishing-spear doesnot usually come out again, but that he has heard ofone successful case of change of mind.Finally, though in this book not much attentionhas been paid to the Northern Dinka whom I nevervisited, we cannot omit the accounts of the deaths oftheir masters of the fishing-spear which Ibrahim Eff.Bedri has given. They have to be considered inrelation to ceremonies for the installation of a masterof the fishing-spear which, among the NorthernDinka, seem to be elaborate. These Dinka, in closercontact with the Shilluk than any of the others wehave discussed, may have a development of ceremo-nial influenced by, but not modelled upon, that ofthe Shilluk kingship. In one article,15Ibrahim Eff.Bedri states briefly that generally the ‘famous’ rain-makers, when they become old or sick, should bekilled in some way. Suffocation, he says, is the mostcommon way. He continues:Aiyong Dit, the famous Rain Maker of Danjol, wasbuilt into his barn with his first wife and favourite bull,and left to die of starvation.Another way to kill a Beny Riem is to hold himstanding, cover the whole body with thick cow butter,and vigorously stretch his legs, fingers, arms and pri-vates and press the testicles. Then they break all thejoints. Some people say they are broken before thedeath but others say after.The question why the privates are stretched and thetesticles pressed, is always an annoying one, and issimply answered by a shrug with a prompt ‘I don’tknow.’In a longer account16Bedri writes that ‘When theelders of a section decide to kill theirBeny Rem,orwhen he himself has made the request, all the war-riors who were initiated by him are summoned.’17They are said to dance and sing in his honour, andfinally to suffocate him.

The account con-tinues:He is buried secretly by night usually in the bed of akhor or in the forest so that nobody else may knowhis grave.18He is buried in a deep hole sitting on abed made ofinderab19stakes, and with stakes at hisback bound with hide to keep him upright. Hismendyorspear20is put in his hand pointing in the directionof the enemies of the tribe. The body is then coveredwithLeyiegrass from the river bank, and the grave isfilled in.If an enemy interferes with the grave or the positionof the body he brings misfortune to the section.Further, it is said that all but children fast from thetime of the master’s death until his burial, that beforethe sunrise following his death people leave the vil-lage or the cattle-camp and stay in the sun untilmidday, that food which is cooked on fire is thrownaway and all the fires in the village are put out, andthat the grass around the village or cattle-camp isburnt and people return to their homes through thesmoke. A sheep is sacrificed and thrown to the birds.On the third day, another sheep is killed and halfof it boiled and eaten by those who have assistedin the burial, while half is thrown into the forestfor the dead man. Meat, water, and charcoal fromthe cooking are thrown on the grave ‘in orderto release people from the spiritual keeping of thedeadBeny Reminto which they had been symbolicallydelivered by placing a necklace of ostrich-eggbeads round his neck at his installation’. At the firstharvest after his death there is a big sacrifice attendedby all the people of his section who dance and drinkbeer:On the last day the heads of the sons of theBeny Remareshaved and this signifies the end of the period ofmourning, which is observed by his family only andnot by the whole section. If for any reason theBeny Remdies in another way, e.g. accidental drowning, a sheepis suffocated and buried with him in the same grave,and the rites are conducted in the same way.It is not always necessary to kill aBeny Remand it isgenerally sufficient if a sheep is killed and buried withhim, but this ceremonial killing is essential in the caseof aBeny Nialand there are always people accompany-ing him for this purpose.ByBeny RemandBeny NialIbrahim Eff. Bedri refersto a distinction something like that we have alreadymade between minor and major masters of thefishing-spear. In Northern Dinkaland, however,this distinction seems to be formally made by cere-monial action, in a way which I never encounteredamong the Western Dinka. It is said that the ordin-aryBeny Remis the spiritual leader of a tribe, whileaBeny Nialis an outstandingBeny Remwho seems tohave a wider following. The ordinaryBeny Remisinstalled after sacrifice, from the bones of which ashrine is made, while the fire upon which the fleshis roasted is used for starting a special sacred fire inthe new master’s home. There are then other cere-monies which may be summarized as follows. TheBeny Remsits on a bed ofambatch(a very light woodwhich is of considerable ceremonial importanceamong the neighbouring Shilluk). He is washed bythe elders, who then place special strings of ostrichegg-shell beads round his neck, and a circlet of roanantelope-hide round his head, and anoint him withbutter. He then sits on an untrimmed bull-hide, andall those who had any right to his office cut bitsfrom the hide, thereby renouncing their rights andreducing the hide to the usual, trimmed, ovalshape. Other ceremonies expressive of promisingallegiance are performed, and finally the sacredspear associated with the clan-divinity is placed inthe master’s hand. The warriors parade before himand he is sprinkled with blood and water. He thentravels from village to village of his tribe with a fewelders, carrying pieces of wood anointed withbutter, which seem to represent life and fertilityfor his people. At each village the women come outto meet theBeny Rem‘and those without childrentouch the pieces of wood with their hands and thentheir stomachs and kiss their hands as a good omenfor becoming pregnant’. This again is a much richerand more explicit ceremonial than I have foundelsewhere among the Dinka, though to a largeextent it simply presents overtly what the masterof the fishing-spear means to the Dinka as, in amore latent way, that meaning may be found amongthe Western Dinka.The installation of theBeny Nial, who is auto-matically destined for burial alive, is thus de-scribed:21Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:08am page 129Godfrey Lienhardt129"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"A Dindyor member who is deemed of exceptionalcharacter and shows interest in his people’s affairs, iscarried (in order to evince their feelings) in anambachbed on the shoulders of elders who run with himtowards the four directions singing, while the chorusrepeats ‘beny aci jaj, beny aci riak kany’ (The Chief hasbeen carried, the Chief destroys things). I do not knowwhether they mean their own or their enemies’ things.Such aBeny Riemmust not be left to die a natural death,otherwise some evil, such as famine, will fall on thecountry.Elsewhere, Bedri writes: ‘The people . . . lower theambach bed and before it reaches the ground theBenyRemjumps from it as though returning to life again.’2The information assembled above indicates thatthere is some variety in the practice described fordifferent parts of Dinkaland, but that, except for theelaborate ceremonies of the Northern Dinka which Ihave not found elsewhere, these varieties canscarcely be ordered on a regional basis. Detailsfrom ceremonies described for one part are repeatedin another, while considerable differences mayappear in different accounts of the ceremonies per-formed in one area. It is safe for one who knows theDinka to say that nothing in any of the accountsgiven above would surprise Dinka anywhere, eventhough it might not be part of their actual practice.A characteristically Dinka symbolism is integralto all.The fundamental principle, clear in all accounts, isthat certain masters of the fishing-spear must not orshould not be seen to enter upon physical death andthe debility which precedes it in the same way asordinary men or domestic animals. Their deaths areto be, or are to appear, deliberate, and they are to bethe occasion of a form of public celebration. It is withthis point that we may start a consideration of thematerial presented above.First, it is necessary to make clear that the cere-monies described in no way prevent the ultimaterecognition of the ageing and physical death ofthose for whom they are performed. This death isrecognized; but it is the public experience of it, forthe survivors, which is deliberately modified by theperformance of these ceremonies. It is clear also thatthis is the Dinka intention in performing the rites.They do not think that they have made their mastersof the fishing-spear personally immortal by buryingthem before they have become corpses or, in someaccounts, by anticipating their deaths by ritualkilling. The expressions used for the deaths ofmasters of the fishing-spear are euphemisms for anevent which is fully admitted. In my experience theyare not even inevitably used, though a Dinka wouldprefer to say gently ‘The master has gone to theearth’ or ‘The master has gone to sit’, rather than‘The master has died’, particularly at the time ofdeath. These euphemisms replace the involuntaryand passive connotations of the ordinary verb for‘to die’ (thou) by expressions suggesting a positiveact. Similarly (though this point is not specificallymade in any of the accounts) when we hear that thepeople ‘bury their master of the fishing-spear’ it is asan alternative to ‘letting him die’. In other words,the deliberately contrived death, though recognizedas death, enables them to avoid admitting in this casethe involuntary death which is the lot of ordinarymen and beasts. Further, it is not the master of thefishing-spear who ‘kills’ himself, though he requestsor receives a special form of death. The action toavoid, for him, the mere deprival of life which deathrepresents for ordinary Dinka, is action taken by hispeople. And, as we see in most of the accounts given,their intention is not primarily to undertake thespecial ceremonies forhissake, but for their own.If we regard the ceremonies so far described inthis way, we do not need to make much of thevariations which seem to contradict each other withregard to the part played, in the ceremony, by themaster of the fishing-spear’s own volition. Itispos-sible for the Dinka to conceive of the burial of amaster of the fishing-spear alive against his will,though it must be said that, in the case of theWestern Dinka, I have never heard that this hasbeen done within the limits of what might be con-sidered real historical tradition. The account whichthese Dinka will give of the custom almost invariablybegins with the request of the old master of thefishing-spear himself, and his securing of the agree-ment of his people. There is, however, a story whichtells of the burial of one master of the fishing-spearRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:08am page 130Burial Alive130"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"against his will, and I doubt if it would surprise anyDinka. It is told as follows among the Agar Dinka:Jokom was a person of long ago. Long ago he thoughtthat he would build a cattle-byre with people, withsome people standing and then others standing on theirheads and other people on their backs. And he built fortwo days and the cattle-byre collapsed. And his soncalled Macot thought about this, and acted craftily, andspoke with the people of his father’s camp, and said‘The camp of my father is being finished [killed]. Betterthat we bury my father alive.’ The people of the campagreed.A clan called Pabuong brought out amangok(blue-grey) bull to bury their master Jokom. Jokom did notknow they were going to bury him alive, even whenthey had dug the earth out. When they had finisheddigging, they brought out the bull and deceived themaster of the fishing-spear into coming to the grave.When he came, they seized him and pushed him in, andpushed the bull in with him, and covered the gravewith wood and covered it with earth and then clearedthe ground around it.They stayed there by the grave for about five daysand after that the master of the fishing-spear and thebull died. And while they yet lived, the bull bellowedand the master answered it.His son Macot remained. When people fought withspears he took a rod and went between the people andspoke, that the fighting might end, and people wereafraid [to continue]. And if a man had been killedMacot said that compensation must be paid [ratherthan revenge taken] and people listened to him becausethey feared his word.The cruel master of the fishing-spear who ‘triedto build a cattle-byre with living people’ figures inthe lore of many Dinka;22and in this story his deathagainst his will is clearly intended to follow from hiscruelty. Even here, however, though he does notconsult his people, his son must. We do not have togo further than a consideration of the communallabour involved, however, to conclude that in suchceremonies the will of the people of the master of thefishing-spear is what is primarily significant for theDinka. Their purpose, in burying the master alive, isserved whatever may be his intentions in the situ-ation, though it is usually supposed that he takes theinitiative, and this is expected of him.We have earlier discussed the Dinka belief that themaster of the fishing-spear ‘carries the life’ of hispeople. It appears from the account of Ibrahim Eff.Bedri that, among the Northern Dinka, this belief issymbolically represented by the ostrich shell beads,which stand for his people, which a master keeps inhis possession. Among the Western Dinka, at least, itis this belief which is invoked when one asks why it isnecessary to bury a master of the fishing-spear alive.If he ‘dies’ like ordinary men, the ‘life’ of his peoplewhich is in his keeping goes with him. It may be thatthe frequent references to strangulation and suffoca-tion which we find in other accounts relate also tothis belief; for, as we have shown, for the Dinka‘life’,wei, is recognized particularly in breath, andthese forms of killing involve, above all, the reten-tion within him of the master’s breath. He is not, inour idiom, allowed to ‘breathe his last’ or ‘expire’.This situation should not be interpreted too materi-alistically or literally. The Dinka know, as we havesaid, that the master dies. What they represent incontriving the death which they give him is theconservation of the ‘life’ which they themselvesthink they receive from him, and not the conser-vation of his own personal life. The latter, indeed, isfinally taken away from him by his people so that theymay seem to divide it from the public ‘life’ which isin his keeping, and which must not depart from themwith his death.The action by which this separation is achieved isclearly shown in some of the accounts which we havegiven. In my own discussions with the WesternDinka, one feature of their reaction to the death ofa master of the fishing-spear was very marked; it wasthat people should not mourn, but rather should bejoyful. It is conceded to the man’s close kin – thosefor whom his own personality has been most signifi-cant – that they may indeed break down under thestrain imposed, by custom, upon them, in having tocontrol the expression of the sadness they may feel. Itis said also, by some, that the closest kin may observesome of the customs of mourning. This is clearly feltto be a concession to their sense of personal bereave-ment, a recognition by the Dinka indeed of theartifice by which, in a collective act of will andcontrol of sentiment, they repudiate the contradic-tion in experience which the inevitability of personalRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:08am page 131Godfrey Lienhardt131"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"death would otherwise here represent. For the rest ofthe master’s people (and even for the close kin in thatthey are also his people) the human symbolic actioninvolved in the ‘artificial’ burial must be seen totransform the experience of a leader’s death into aconcentrated public experience of vitality and, in theDinka world, aggressiveness. It is sometimes said thatthe cattle of his people, bellowing because they havenot been milked, alone mourn his death with theircries; but also, since the crying of cattle heavy withmilk is one of the most joyful sounds a Dinka can wishto hear, their cries simultaneously call to mind theplenty with which the master of the fishing-spear hasalways in life been ideally associated – the fecundityof cattle and the watered pastures upon which theydepend. To confirm this impression, and re-createthe whole configuration of experience which, in aprevious chapter we have seen to be associated withthe master of the fishing-spear, we find in someaccounts that the materials necessary for the burialhave riverain associations, or are connected with thedry-season pastures which represent for the Dinkamuch of the ‘life’ which they hope to ensure forthemselves. In some accounts the fence round agrave is made withawargrass, the grass of the riverainpastures which appears and gives sustenance to thecattle before others in a protracted dry season, as wehave earlier described. It is also, it will be remem-bered, the grass from beneath which the prototype ofspear-masters, Aiwel Longar, watered his cattle in atime of famine and drought. In another account (p.302) it is said thatdhotwood is required. This again isassociated with the dry-season pastures, and, it maybe remembered, is the tree with branches of whichsacrificial victims are covered as they lie in stateimmediately after death. Finally, it is fairly consist-ently stated that the wood from which the frameworkof the platform on which the master reclines is madeisakoc(Cordia rothii), a wood which is renowned forits sappy moistness, and which, in putting forth itsleaves before other trees, is associated with moistureand persistence through the most arid and difficultperiod of the dry season.If the burial is thus associated by a wide range ofassociations with a social triumph over death andthe factors which bring death in Dinkaland, thisassociation is reinforced by the militant displaywhich the ceremony involves. Fighting was for theDinka often a condition of survival, and it still hassomething of the value attached to it which musthave made it a serious necessity in the time of theircomplete autonomy. One of the functions ofmasters of the fishing-spear was to open and closeage-sets; and though the age-sets seem never tohave had in themselves specific regimental func-tions, their pride and reputation were and are stillconnected with their military prowess. Conse-quently, a renowned master of the fishing-spearwas himself at the centre of the military organiza-tion of his people, and the inspiration of the mostactive fighting men. So, though every public sacri-fice involves warlike display, at the burial of amaster of the fishing-spear the fighting power ofhis people is particularly emphasized. Members ofgroups other than those rallied by the ceremony arein danger if they approach it; the young men arefully armed for war; and the cattle are tetheredduring the day, not taken out in their separateherding groups which are weak in the face of attack.In other ways also the ceremony emphasizes theunity, and equivalence, of those taking part. Thelineages represented in the community should allcontribute victims to the feast; and, very characteris-tically of Dinka thought, it is specifically said in onetext that the master’s maternal kin are ‘put together’with his paternal kin. His daughters and their familiesalso bring their offerings to the grave at his burial. Heis recognized as ‘the maternal uncle of the camp’ (narwut), which such a leader is often called. A furtherindication of the solidarity which such a ceremonyideallycreatesisthestatement,inoneofthetexts,thatafter the burial men and women may sleep promiscu-ously together. I do not know if in fact this happens;but that it should be thought to do so is significant, notonly in its similarity to orgiastic behaviour at criticalperiodselsewhere,butinthatsuchanabandonmentofpersonal rights which would normally be stronglyasserted is a measure of the common interests andequivalence of members of the community.In his death, then, the Dinka master of the fishing-spear is made to represent to his people the survivalwith which masters of the fishing-spear are associ-ated in myth and present-day ritual. Nor, in onesense, are the Dinka deceiving themselves in main-Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:08am page 132Burial Alive132"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"taining that the death of an old master of the fishing-spear produces a renewal of life in his people.His burial ceremonies do create a militant self-consciousness, as we have seen. The masters of thefishing-spear who are the principal repositoriesof their tribal and subtribal traditions, are saidto recall these traditions when they lie in thegrave. They cannot die like ordinary men, for thetraditions and beliefs which they embody, reachingback to the myth of Aiwel, live on. Notions ofindividual personal immortality mean little tonon-Christian Dinka, but the assertion of collectiveimmortality means much, and it is this which theymake in the funeral ceremonies of their religiousleaders.NOTES1 Similar doubt surrounds the manner of the deaths ofthe kings of the Shilluk, which has considerable bear-ing on theories of ‘divine kingship’ which we haveborne in mind in the presentation of our account ofthe deaths of masters of the fishing-spear.2 A similar word also means ‘to be tired of’, but I do notthink the meanings are related.3 Thoughtocmeans ‘to rest’.4 That is, they clean the ground and remove any thorn-bushes.5 This is the bedstead of the Northern Sudan, made ofstrips of hide or rope laced across a wooden frame-work.6 In view of what we have earlier suggested, that there isonthewholeacorrespondencebetweenreligiousrepu-tation and political influence, which depends partly onthe size of the spear-master clan, it is interesting to seehere that their small numbers seen in relation to theirreligious reputation at once evokes the notion of some-thing unnatural – witchcraft.7 This refers to a wet-season camping site, many ofwhich are very near permanent villages.8 It is in this area particularly that the clan Padiangbar areregarded as having something of the strength of a spear-master clan (see pp. 145–6). Structurally, therefore,their role in the situation of the death of masters of thefishing-spear may be seen to have something incommon with the reported role off theororo, thedemoted members of the royal clan of the Shilluk, at9the death of the Shilluk king. See, for example, C. G.and B. Z. Seligman, 1932, pp. 49–50.9 I have retained the real clan-name here and in thecase of Padiangbar.10 That is at the times between the seasons, when theDinka move to and from the dry-season pastures.11 This is the height of the dry season.12 It is not clear whether this is actually on the site ofburial, or near by. I have never seen or heard of ashrine of this type (the mud shrine) separated from ahomestead.13 G. G. and B. Z. Seligman, 1932, pp. 196–8.14 G. W.

The sobs of the bystanders grew louder.Juan Gelman, Marcelo’s father, removed a tearfrom his right eye, turned around slowly and walkedaway with his ex-wife, Berta Schubaroff.On 1 October 1989, three months before thefuneral of Marcelo Gelman, another reburial hadoccurred. After resting for 112 years at the Catholiccemetery of Southampton, Brigadier General JuanManuel de Rosas was placed in his family’s tomb atthe Recoleta cemetery in the heart of Buenos Aires.The event was of great historical significance. Rosashad fled Argentina on board a British vessel in 1852after his defeat at the battle of Caseros. Ever since, hehad been depicted as the tyrant whose twenty-four-year rule was known simply as ‘‘the terror.’’ In the1930s, a movement of historical revisionism arosethat emphasized Rosas’s patriotism and claimed thatofficial history had misrepresented him. A public callfor the repatriation of the remains of Rosas was madein 1934. The political spirit of Rosas was reinvigor-ated, and nineteenth-century animosities betweenUnitarists and Federalists became fomented again inthe confrontation of liberals and nationalists.3Rosas’s name also became linked to the ten-yearpopulist government of Juan Domingo Pero ́n duringthe mid-twentieth century as liberal opponentscondemned his government as ‘‘the second tyr-anny.’’4A congressional debate about Rosas’sremains was held in the mid-1970s. Repatriationwas approved but not carried out because of thepolitical violence preceding the 1976 coup d’e ́tat.The 1989 reburial of Rosas by the Peronist presi-dent Carlos Menem was therefore full of historicreference.Symbolizing national reconciliation, the funeralprocession with the remains of Rosas was escortedby two groups of horsemen representing the Federal-ist and Unitarist armies that had fought one anotherduring the nineteenth-century civil wars. Descend-ants of Rosas and those of several of his onetimeenemies Paz, Viamonte, Lavalle, and Urquiza werepresent at the interment at the Recoleta nationalcemetery.5‘‘Today we bury more than one hundredyears of black legend, of darkness, of history writtenwith inaccuracies,’’ so spoke the priest AlbertoEzcurra in his homily (La Nacio ́n, 2 October 1989).President Carlos Menem had said the preceding daythat ‘‘Nobody, absolutely nobody has the legitimateright to continue to arrest our development becauseof bygone events, for history cannot be a heavy load,an insupportable burden, a painful memory or apetty opinion. History must be a chain of union,stronger than frustration, than war, than death’’ (LaPrensa, 1 October 1989).6According to Menem, thepolitical repatriation of Rosas served to close thewounds of the past that had continued to fester inthe Argentine nation for more than a century. How-ever, it was clear to everyone in Argentina thatMenem’s more pressing political objective was torelegate the fresh memories of the 1976–82 dirtywar to history. One week after Rosas’s reburial,president Menem pardoned 277 military officersand former guerrillas, among whom was Juan Gel-man, Marcelo’s father. Former president Rau ́l Alfon-sı ́n expressed his doubts about Menem’s success atbringing about a national reconciliation: ‘‘Onecannot decree the amnesia of an entire society be-cause every time anyone tried to sweep the pastunder the carpet, the past returned with a ven-geance’’ (La Nacio ́n, 10 October 1989).7Despite the different circumstances surroundingthe funerals of Juan Manuel de Rosas and MarceloGelman – the glory and honor bestowed upon thefirst and the controversy surrounding the exhum-ation of the last – both public ceremonies reveal thecentral importance of human remains and their re-burial in Argentine political culture. Their import-ance arises from the belief in the influence of thedead on the world of the living, and the obligation tobury comrades-in-arms with full honors. These twopolitical reasons add to a general human care for thedead and the emotional need for mourning. Thiscultural complex was exploited by the militaryjunta in their dirty war against the guerrilla insur-gency and left-wing sectors of Argentine society.State terror in Argentina between 1976 and 1982Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:08ampage 135Antonius C.

Between 10,000and 30,000 people disappeared during the seven-year military rule. This paper analyzes the ongoinganxiety about the spirit of the enemy dead, the acts ofresistance by relatives of the disappeared, and theconcealment and funerary obstruction of the victimsof Argentina’s dirty war as means to extend stateterror into the hereafter.Disappearance as TerrorTorture and disappearance are not the cruel realitiesof war, and the targeting of tens of thousands ofcivilians of the political left was not inevitable. Coun-terinsurgency is also possible with the help of mili-tary courts and due process. A confidential 1980status report by the American embassy in BuenosAires to the State Department in Washington saidabout the junta’s preference for disappearances:‘‘Disappearance is still the standard tactic for theArgentine security forces in dealing with capturedterrorists. The military’s commitment to thismethod is profoundly rooted in elements thatrange from effectiveness through expediency to cul-tural bias. We doubt whether international sanctionsand opprobrium will, in themselves, cause the gov-ernment to change the tactic and grant capturedterrorists due process’’ (quoted in Guest 1990:430).The rationale of turning disappearance into theprincipal repressive tactic was revealed in a rareinterview with the Supreme Court of the ArmedForces. Upon my provocative question why the juntahad not executed the guerrillas publicly, instead ofmaking them disappear, a brigadier general answeredwhile the other judges nodded in agreement: ‘‘If onewould have done what you have asked then therewould have been immediate revenge, not only on theexecutioner or those who presided over the trial butalso on their families. That is to say, the terror hadalso infused terror among the armed forces, and theyresponded with terror. This is the tremendous prob-lem, the tremendous tragedy of this war’’ (interview,20 December 1989).Argentine society became terror-stricken. Theterror was intended to debilitate people politicallyand emotionally without them ever fathoming themagnitude of the force that hit them. The armedforces had divided the country into five large zones,each subdivided into subzones. The subzones weredivided into areas, and the areas might be furthersubdivided into subareas. The areas and subareaswere the operational territories of the task forces(grupos de tarea). The special task forces stood gener-ally under the command of the army or the navy. Theair force participated to a far lesser extent in therepressive apparatus. The regular forces did notparticipate in the actual abductions, although armyunits might seal off a neighborhood and providelogistical support. The disappearances were gener-ally carried out by small task forces of five or sixmen, under the command of a lieutenant, whopertained to the various intelligence services of thearmed forces. Typically, they would first ask for a‘‘green light’’ from the local police station to preventthe police from responding to distress calls from anyconcerned neighbor. Next, the assault gang wouldforce its way into a home under the cover of dark-ness, threaten and beat the inhabitants into submis-sion, blindfold their victim, and leave in unmarkedprivate cars (CONADEP 1986:11–13; Mittelbach1986).The special task forces would take the abductedpersons to the 365 secret detention centers, whichwere usually located in Argentina’s police stations.Only one-quarter of the centers were situatedat military installations. The abducted were neverpublicly acknowledged as detainees or prisonersonce they disappeared into these so-called ‘‘pits’’(pozos) or ‘‘black holes’’ (chupaderos). Some werereleased into exile, but most of them were assassin-ated. The corpses were cremated or interredclandestinely as unidentified bodies in municipalcemeteries. They were also abandoned at roadsides,thrown in rivers, and even flung from planes at seaunder sedation (Garcı ́a 1995:461–70; Verbitsky1995).The disappearance of guerrillas sowed great un-certainty among the revolutionary organizations.They were severely hampered in their operationswhen they did not know whether their combatantsRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:08ampage 136State Terror in the Netherworld: Disappearance and Reburial in Argentina136"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"were dead or alive, had defected or deserted, wereheld up in traffic, or were being tortured for infor-mation about surprise attacks and upcoming meet-ings. It also allowed intelligence officers to take thedisappeared detainees on missions to identify theircomrades at border posts, railway stations, airports,and bus stops. Some pointed out complete strangersso that a comrade could leave unnoticed. They hopedthat the innocence of the unsuspected victim wouldsoon be discovered, and that his torture would end.The Argentine military leaders believed further-more that historical judgment could be decisivelyinfluenced if there was no body to mourn, dead tocommemorate, or epitaph to read. The disappear-ance of the corpses was motivated by a strategicconcern about the political future of the armedforces. Eventually the military would have to handpower to a democratic government, and they knewthat without a corpus delicti future criminal pros-ecution would be impossible.The disappearance were also ordered to preventthe mobilization of international public opinion. Alesson was learned from the adverse reactions to themass arrests during Pinochet’s first years in power,and from the public execution of convicted membersof the ETA during the Franco dictatorship.However, it was not just the fear of internationalprotests, operational advantages, or historical judg-ment that made the military choose disappearance astheir principal method of repression. The disappear-ances were directed at the core of Argentine society.They converted the torture of detainees into theanguish of friends, colleagues, relatives, and familymembers. Disappearances had, and continue to have,very complex effects. People knew that torture was acommon practice in Argentina among the securityforces. Since many relatives were present at theabductions – 60 percent of the disappeared weredetained in the home – they feared that the abductedwere being tortured (CONADEP 1986:11). Yet,they were helpless because the authorities deniedhaving them in custody. Tormenting thoughts aboutthe suffering of the disappeared person hauntedthose left behind. The term ‘‘home front’’ seldomhad a more sinister double meaning.Unlike the public display and dismemberment ofenemy corpses in nineteenth-century Argentina, thedisappearances of the 1970s had their greatest effectwithin the homes of their victims. Michel Foucaulthas described how the spectacle of torture in eight-eenth-century France served to assert the power ofthe king. The public confession and dismembermentof criminals demonstrated to the people that the lawwas the will of the divine ruler, and that anyone whoviolated that law was an enemy of the sovereign andhad to be punished by the sword. However, despitethis awesome display of force, it also showed specta-tors the limits of power. ‘‘A body effaced, reduced todust and thrown to the winds, a body destroyedpiece by piece by the infinite power of the sovereignconstituted not only the ideal, but the real limit ofpunishment’’ (Foucault 1979:50). The sovereign’spower did not reach beyond the dust of the assassin,making it finite and therefore, according to Foucault,vulnerable.The disappearances in Argentina were so terrify-ing exactly because they were not public but in-tensely private. Violent death was taken away fromthe eye and control of the people, confined to thesecrecy of the detention centers, and spread throughsociety. Fear of the military did not diminish as it wastaken out of the public arena but it increased,through the conversion from public into secret intoprivate. The continued absence of the disappearedson, daughter, husband, or wife etched a silhouettein the homes of surviving family members that hadlasting political and psychological effects (see APDH1987; ICIHI 1986; Kordan et al. 1988). The disap-pearances absorbed the political consciousness of therelatives into a desperate search (see Hagelin 1984;Herrera 1987). The social problems of Argentinesociety that had impelled people to become politic-ally active dwarfed in comparison to the disappear-ance of loved ones. The initial paralysis made placefor political protest. In a convoluted way, the repres-sive attempt to silence the political opposition inArgentina had the reverse effect. Human rights or-ganizations emerged during the military dictatorshipthat dedicated all their political energy to publicprotest.Even though many relatives had a premonitionthat the disappeared had been killed, it was difficultto reconcile oneself with such fatality.

Thissuffering dispersed in all directions of people’s exist-ence. The victimized relatives felt guilty about theirsuffering, and had to justify their public protests,while the victimizers claimed innocence in the ab-sence of a corpse. Victory and omnipotence wereinstilled as defeat and fear. Disappearance extendedwar and torture into civil society and the hereafter.The strategy of obliterating all physical traces ofthe disappeared continued with different means afterthe guerrilla insurgency had been defeated and theoverall military repression of Argentine societybegan to lessen. Two official attempts were madeto have the disappeared pronounced dead in absenceof a corpse. The military junta issued a law inSeptember 1979 that declared all persons presumeddead who had disappeared between 6 November1974 and 6 September 1979. They hoped that thisdecree would end the insistent appeals by humanrights organizations. After their 1982 defeat in theFalklands/Malvinas War, the ruling military juntawas forced to step down and hand power to theinterim government of General Reynoldo Bignone.This interim government published a final report inApril 1983 about the 1976–1982 dictatorship anddeclared once again all disappeared as presumeddead (San Martino de Dromi 1988:343, 360;Somos, 1983, no. 346, p. 15).At the same time, General Bignone secretlyordered the destruction of all documentation relatedto persons who had been detained during the 1976–1982 dictatorship, thus preventing the verification ofthe presumption of death made in their officialreport. When Rau ́l Alfonsı ́n assumed power in De-cember 1983, he installed a commission to inquireinto the whereabouts of the disappeared. This com-mission stated in a letter to Alfonsı ́n that its task was‘‘hindered by an essential lack of documentary infor-mation regarding the specific operational orders ofthe repression, the identification of those arrested,prosecuted, sentenced, freed or killed, and theplaces where they were held or should have beengiven a decent burial’’ (CONADEP 1986:264).I have now given tactical, strategic, legal, andpolitical reasons for making the corpses of politicaldetainees disappear, but what is the cultural signifi-cance? What is the cultural bias, referred to in the1980 report of the American embassy in BuenosAires, that made the Argentine military prefer thepractice of disappearance? And why did the militarycontinue to conceal the disappeared after the dirtywar had ended? The French anthropologist RobertHertz (1960:83) has said that ‘‘It is the action ofsociety on the body that gives full reality to theimagined drama of the soul’’ or, in the rephrasingof Huntington and Metcalf (1979:14), ‘‘the fate ofthe body is a model for the fate of the soul.’’ Thus, astudy of how Argentine culture has conceived of thespirit of deceased political opponents can reveal whydisappearance became the preferred repressivetactic. How have enemy corpses been treated inother violent domestic conflicts in Argentina?Reburial at Recoleta National CemeteryThe abuse of the corpses of political opponents is nota recent practice in Argentina. Defeat and terror innineteenth-century Argentina were intimately tiedto the destination of the corpse. Decapitation and thedisplay of their heads on public squares became thefate of many commanders. It was an extreme humili-ation that defiled the personal honor of the fallenleader, and damaged the collective honor of hisfamily and political following. The beheading andsubsequent exhibition of the trophy were particu-larly dishonorable because they placed the victim onthe level of the native American Indians who oftenbefell the same fate in Argentina. It also symbolizedthe political dismemberment of the fallen leaderfrom his supporters, and the power of the newrulers. The importance of honor, charisma, andclientalism in these times made decapitation, ratherthan execution, imprisonment, or exile, the pre-ferred practice of victory. Godoy Cruz, for instance,exhibited the head of the Federalist leader FelipeAlvarez to ‘‘serve as a warning to those who havebeen led astray by his example’’ (quoted in Halperı ́nDonghi 1975:380). The Chilean caudillo Carrera,who had taken refuge in Argentina, was eventuallycaptured on 31 August 1821 and executed four dayslater after a summary trial. His head and right armwere sent on display to Mendoza, and his left arm toRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:08ampage 138State Terror in the Netherworld: Disappearance and Reburial in Argentina138"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"San Juan (CGE 1974:283). Felipe Alvarez and Fran-cisco Ramı ́rez were decapitated in the same year.The latter’s head was placed in an iron cage and puton display in a church in Santa Fe ́(Rock 1987:97).The flight of a party of ragged cavalrymen in 1841with the decaying body of General Lavalle to preventit from falling into the hands of General Oribe’senemy troops has become legendary. Ernesto Sa ́batodescribed their getaway in his novelOn Heroes andTombsas follows: ‘‘Thirty-five leagues to go still.Three days’ march at full gallop, with the corpsethat stinks and distills the liquids of putrefaction,with sharpshooters in the rear guard covering theirretreat, comrades who perhaps have little by littlebeen decimated, run through with lances, or hadtheir throats slit. From Jujuy to Huacalera: twenty-four leagues. Only thirty-five leagues to go now, theytell themselves. Only four or five days’ march, withGod’s help’’ (Sa ́bato 1990:472). As the days pass andthe stench becomes unbearable, the men decide toremove the bloated flesh, and preserve the general’sbones and heart. It would take two full decadesbefore the remains of General Lavalle were repatri-ated and reburied with national honor at Recoletacemetery (Frias 1884).There was a widespread conviction in the nine-teenth century, grounded in the Catholic belief thatthe soul survives after death, that human remainscarried a spiritual power that could affect the worldof the living. The belief in this spiritual force (virtus)can be traced back to medieval times when theremains of saints became relics for the believers(Angenendt 1994:155–8; Snoek 1995:11–20). Justas saints were believed to heal medieval worshippersbecause their relics contained a life force, so theremains of slain commanders in nineteenth-century Argentina continued to provide strength totheir comrades and inflict harm on their enemies.The mutilation of enemy corpses was regarded as away to disperse, although not to destroy, the spiritualforce of the deceased.8This same fear of the spirit of the dead can also befound in the terrible curse placed on Juan Manuel deRosas by Jose ́Ma ́rmol from his exile in Montevideoon 25 May 1843: ‘‘Not even the dust from yourbones will America have’’ (Ma ́rmol 1894:58). Asimilar belief is expressed by Sarmiento aboutFacundo Quiroga, a caudillo who together withRosas was vilified in Sarmiento’s literary indictmentCivilization and Barbarism. Sarmiento went so far as toevoke the spirit of Facundo Quiroga to reveal the illsof the Argentine nation: ‘‘Terrible shadow ofFacundo! I am going to conjure you up so that,shaking the blood-stained dust from your ashes,you will arise to explain to us the secret life aninternal convulsions that tear at the entrails of anoble people! You possess the secret! Reveal it tous! . . . Facundo has not died; he is alive in the popu-lar traditions, in the Argentine politics and revolu-tions; in Rosas, his heir, his alter ego: his soul haspassed to this other mold, more finished and per-fect’’ (Sarmiento 1986:7–8). The belief that thespirit of a dead person could pass into a living personturned the corpse into an object of contestation, andits ultimate destination became a matter of greatpolitical significance. Sarmiento’s fear about the con-tinued influence of Facundo’s spirit on Argentinepolitical life seemed to come true. One year afterhis assassination in 1835 at Barranco Yaco, Facundo’sremains were exhumed from the cemetery of Co ́r-doba at the express order of Rosas. The bones werecleansed, disinfected, perfumed, and reburied inBuenos Aires (Buenos Aires Nos Cuenta, no. 5, pp.20–2).9What had been despised could now berevered and honored. The same spiritual force thatused to be feared was now believed to be beneficialto the nation. At Recoleta cemetery Facundo joinedthe many military commanders who had fought inthe nineteenth-century civil wars. The remains ofother illustrious Argentines who died in places suchas Washington, Paris, Montevideo, and Santiago deChile – many of them in exile and some others byaccident – were also exhumed and reburied at Reco-leta. In this way, the cemetery became eventually thepantheon of the nation, and the life force of thoseburied there continued to infuse Argentine society.Just as Durkheim has said that society worshippeditself in religion, so the Argentine nation seemed torepresent and celebrate itself at the Recoleta cemet-ery. To be reburied at Recoleta meant to achieveimmortality in the eyes of the Argentine people. Thisimmortality was achieved by the ceremonial reburialand, as a consequence, by the continued presence ofthe reburied person’s ossified remains and eternalRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:08ampage 139Antonius C. G. M. Robben139"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"spirit in the public place. Their life force becameembodied in the people who visited the grave, whileits political effects were determined by the strengthof conviction of their ideological adherents.At first sight, Recoleta seems very much like a lateeighteenth-century Parisian cemetery. ‘‘[The me-morials] were to be ‘a source of emulation forposterity’ to inspire visitors to the cemetery toequal or excel the deeds or accomplishments oftheir predecessors. The cemetery, then, was tobecome a school of virtue’’ (Etlin 1984:43). Yet,Recoleta turns into a disturbing source of incessantpolitical conflict when understood within the con-text of the place of the dead in the world of the living.Mortal enemies are buried next to one another, andvictims rest in the same cemetery as their assassins.Facundo is buried there together with his slayers.Rosas rests there, and so do Sarmiento, Ma ́rmol, andmany other adversaries he had forced into exile.Their reburial at Recoleta did not represent theirreconciliation in death but the reinvigoration of theirideas. These ceremonial reburials encouraged polit-ical adversaries to believe that the ideological battlesof the past had not yet been decided and that theiropposed political spirits still resonated among theArgentine people. Recoleta cemetery became in thisway as much a source as a metaphor of continuedpolitical strife in Argentina.Repatriation and Reburial in the Twentieth CenturyThe Argentine political obsession with corpses andtheir spirits continued well into the twentieth cen-tury, albeit different in form and meaning. Beheadingbecame replaced by disappearance as the practice ofterror and intimidation inflicted on political oppon-ents and surviving relatives. The disappearance ofthe body of Evita Duarte de Pero ́n, one of the mostprominent and charismatic figures in twentieth-century Argentine politics, illustrates the preoccu-pation with the dead body in Argentine politicalculture.10Her embalmed body was missing formore than a decade and its bizarre wanderings canbe compared to those of General Lavalle in thenineteenth century.Evita died on 26 July 1952. For two weeks, anestimated 65,000 mourners a day passed by her bodyin state at the headquarters of the labor union con-federation CGT in Buenos Aires. After months ofdedicated work, the body was preserved in a perfectstate by a Spanish embalmer. A 1955 coup d’e ́tatended the official Evita cult and the glorification ofPero ́n. Their names were removed from buildings,streets, squares, and public works. Evita’s embalmedbody was taken from the trade union headquartersunder protest of its embalmer, Doctor Ara. Lieuten-ant Colonel Moore Koenig, who was in charge of theoperation, responds in the fictionalized accountSanta Evitaby Eloy Martı ́nez: ‘‘You know very wellwhat is at stake . . . It is not the cadaver of thatwoman but the destiny of Argentina. Or both, whichto many people seems the same. Look how the deadand useless body of Eva Duarte has become confusedwith the country . . . [By] embalming it, you movedhistory from its place. You left history inside. Yourealize that whoever has this woman, has the countryin its fist?’’ (Martı ́nez 1995:34).It would take more than two decades before thecorpse of Eva Pero ́n came to rest in a tomb atRecoleta cemetery. The officers entrusted in 1955with the disappearance of the body were at a lossabout what to do. At this point, fact and fictionbecome entwined in a complex tangle. However, itcan be documented from several sources that themummified body was shipped out of the country in1957. Eloy Martı ́nez tells the uncorroborated storythat a number of identical coffins, all but one con-taining wax casts of the real body, were sent todifferent places in the world to conceal the truewhereabouts of Evita’s remains.In 1970, a commando force of Montoneros guer-rillas first kidnapped and later executed GeneralAramburu. Aramburu had been responsible for theoverthrow of Pero ́n in 1955. His summary executionwas perceived by many Peronists as a deed of justice.The disappearance and profanation of Evita’s bodywere among the list of charges. One year later, apublic notary handed President Lanusse a letterwritten by General Aramburu in 1957 stating thatEvita’s corpse had been buried secretly in Milan.Supposedly, the body was first flown to BuenosAires for examination, and then returned to Pero ́n,who was living in exile in Madrid at the time. Theembalmed body remained in his house for severalRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:08ampage 140State Terror in the Netherworld: Disappearance and Reburial in Argentina140"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"years. Purportedly, the spiritist Lo ́pez Rega burnedcandles and spoke incantations as Marı ́a Estela, Per-o ́n’s third wife, lay atop the coffin to receive Evita’sspiritual energy. The nineteenth-century belief in thelife force of human remains continued unshaken inoccultist circles, and was even embraced by thefuture head of state.Pero ́n returned to Argentina in 1973 to head thegovernment as president with his wife as vice presi-dent. Pero ́n died in 1974 and was succeeded byMarı ́a Estela Martı ́nez de Pero ́n. In mid-October1974, a Montoneros task force kidnapped the bodyof General Aramburu from the Recoleta cemetery asransom for Evita’s embalmed corpse, which hadremained in Pero ́n’s Spanish residence. Aramburu’scoffin was returned a few hours after Evita’s bodywas repatriated on 17 November 1974 (Gillespie1982:183). Pero ́n’s widow, Marı ́a Estela, placedEvita next to the embalmed body of Pero ́n at herpresidential residence in Olivos. When the militaryoverthrew Marı ́a Estela Martı ́nez de Pero ́n in March1976, they handed Evita’s body to her two sisters,who reburied her at the family tomb at Recoletacemetery (Anderson 1993:121; Martı ́nez 1995;Page 1983:344, 424 –5, 500;Somos, 1984, no. 415,pp. 46–9; Taylor 1979: 69–71).The strange journey of Evita’s body has the qualityof a phantasmagorical story, were it not that thedocumented wanderings of the embalmed body andthe disputes over its resting place reveal the con-tinued importance of human remains and their burialin Argentine political culture. The 1934 and 1975attempts to retrieve the remains of Juan Manuel deRosas from Great Britain provide additional proof ofthe importance of the body, the spirit, and theirreburial in Argentine political culture.11The political right considered the repatriation ofthe remains of Rosas in 1934 as an appeal to authori-tarian rule. These fervent Rosistas were convincedthat world capitalism and parliamentary democracywere in a major crisis. Fascism would replace theseoutdated systems in the entire world. Just as Rosashad pacified the country after decades of civil war, soa new strong leader would protect Argentina againstthe threat of communism. As one of the proponentsof repatriation said in 1934, ‘‘It has been exactly onehundred years since we gave birth to this sameillness, and it was precisely the iron hand of Rosaswhich ended the dissolute anarchy’’ (Manuel Ga ́lvez,quoted in Barletta and Ame ́zola 1992:26 –7). Theopponents of repatriation feared the reincarnation ofRosas’s political spirit in his right-wing heirs: ‘‘Themost serious is not to bring the ashes, but to bring hisspirit. . . . Bringing his remains would not mean any-thing, if it would not imply giving amnesty to atyrant. The Argentine people must know that togive him amnesty is to make way for his imitators.History is not only a science concerned with texts,but history is also the spirit of times in the heart ofgenerations. To bring his remains is to awaken thespirit that gave them life’’ (Ricardo Rojas, quoted inBarletta and Ame ́zola 1992:30 –1). The repatriationof Rosas’s remains was debated with great intensity inthe Argentine press but never became official policy.The issue of repatriation arose again four decadeslater, but the political discourse changed. Whereasthe 1934 debate evolved around the rehabilitation ofRosas and his political ideas, the 1973–1974 con-gressional debates were embedded in a general dis-course about the similarities between Pero ́n andRosas. Both leaders had been forced into exile, hadprotected the sovereignty of Argentina against im-perialist incursions, and had ruled with the supportof the popular masses. Just as in the mid-1950s, theopponents of repatriation continued to denouncePero ́n as the ‘‘second tyrant’’ who thrived on mobrule and a hostile attitude toward the United States.The Rosista historian Jose ́Marı ́a Rosa rebutted that‘‘The hatred towards Rosas . . . is the best homageto his memory, because it demonstrates that hispolitical ideas are still current’’ (quoted in Barlettaand Ame ́zola 1992:45). The repatriation of Rosas’sremains was approved by Congress in October 1974and authorized by the government of Marı ́a Estela dePero ́n in June 1975. The diplomatic efforts bythe Argentine embassy in Great Britain were sus-pended three months later because of the spiralingpolitical violence in Argentina (Barletta and Ame ́zola1992:40–1).The twentieth-century belief in the survival afterdeath of political ideas evoked by the presence ofhuman remains is a continuation of the nineteenth-century religious conviction that enemy corpses maypossess a vengeful spiritual force, but there is aRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:08ampage 141Antonius C.

In the nineteenth cen-tury, there was a belief in the spirit as a supernaturalenergy – a soul orvirtus– which could pass betweenorganic substances. In the twentieth century, thespirit becomes a metaphor for the ideas associatedwith the remains of the deceased. Notwithstandingthis reinterpretation of the spirit, the cultural focusand political rituals that surround it have remainedremarkably similar. Victors in both centuriesbelieve that reburial would turn the enemy deadinto martyrs and invigorate their spirit, so theyresorted to mutilation and disappearance as repres-sive practices.This treatment of enemy corpses betrays the con-tinued cultural belief in a relation between body andspirit, and the great significance of a proper funeral.If reburial symbolizes the transition of the soul fromthe land of the living to the land of the dead ances-tors, as Hertz (1960:78–81) has argued, then theunceremonial burial of the hidden corpses of tens ofthousands of Argentines implies that the spirits of thedeceased must be still wandering through the mistypassage between life and death. The great efforts thatwent into reburying Juan Lavalle, Juan Manuel deRosas, Evita Pero ́n, and many other illustrious Ar-gentines at Recoleta cemetery provide a culturalexplanation why surviving relatives searched forthe remains of the victims of Argentine state terrorin the 1970s.Contested Exhumations and Revolutionary ProtestThe first evidence of the mass executions that hadoccurred during the dirty war surfacd in late Octo-ber 1982, only months after the Falklands/MalvinasWar. Eighty-eight unmarked graves with an esti-mated four hundred unidentified bodies were foundat the park cemetery of Grand Bourg near BuenosAires. The gruesome discovery was made during theexhumation of the skeletal remains of the unionleader Miguel Angel Sosa, who had disappeared in1976. On the evening of 25 May 1976, his nakedbody was found floating in the Reconquista River. Itshowed obvious signs of torture. The police estab-lished Sosa’s identity, did not notify his relatives, andburied him as an unidentified corpse. The 1982exhumation was made at the request of relativeswho had been tipped off in 1981 by an employee ofthe ministry of the interior (Cohen Salama 1992:60–62;Somos, 1982, no. 319, p. 11). The effect of thediscovery on the Argentine public was devastating.There was both disbelief and anger. Soon, more massgraves were opened and the bullet-ridden skullswere exhibited on the edge of their makeshift gravesin what was called a ‘‘horror show.’’ The display ofpiles of bones and perforated skulls revealed to thestunned Argentines the horrors of the militaryregime as well as their own mortality and the chancethat they could have very well met the same fate.The Madres de Plaza de Mayo, a human rightsorganization consisting of hundreds of mothers of thedisappeared, believed in October 1982 that the ex-humations would give the disappeared a name and anidentity.12At last, the hastily interred bodies wouldbe wrested from anonymity and given a properburial. As new mass graves continued to be opened,but the identification of the victims failed to be madebecause of improperly performed exhumations thatdestroyed crucial evidence, the Madres began toraise questions about the sense of these disinter-ments. Its president, Hebe de Bonafini, expressedin January 1984 the conviction that ‘‘there is suffi-cient proof to send a great number of those guilty ofthis horror to prison,’’ but she had doubts about thepolitical will to prosecute them (Humor, 1982, no.92, p. 47;Somos, 1984, no. 382, p. 20). The Madres’faith in the justice system declined further when theAlfonsı ́n government decided that the nine com-manders of the three military juntas of 1976 –1982were to be tried under martial law by the SupremeCourt of the Armed Forces. The Madres continuedtheir rounds around the Plaza de Mayo on Thursdayafternoons at 3:30 as they had been doing since April1977.13They placed white scarves on their heads,walked arm in arm, and talked to the sympathizerswho continued to join their thirty-minute protest.Sometime during the second half of 1984, theMadres de Plaza de Mayo began to formulate theiropposition to the exhumations, and this was theprincipal cause of their separation into two inde-pendent organizations in 1986.14Reflecting on theintense soul-searching in 1984 about which positionto take on the exhumations, Hebe de Bonafini hassaid: ‘‘It cost us weeks and weeks of meetings atRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:08ampage 142State Terror in the Netherworld: Disappearance and Reburial in Argentina142"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"which there were many tears and much despair,because the profound Catholic formation of ourpeople creates almost a need to have a dead body, aburial, and a Mass’’ (Madres, 1987, no. 37, p. 10).15Despite the anguish, the de Bonafini group decidedto keep the wounds inflicted by the disappearancesopen to resist a national process of forgetting. ‘‘It hasbeen eleven years of suffering, eleven years that havenot been relieved in any sense. Many want thewound to dry so that we will forget. We want it tocontinue bleeding, because this is the only way thatone continues to have strength to fight . . . But,above all, it is necessary that this wound bleeds sothat the assassins will be condemned, as they de-serve, and that what has happened will not happenagain. This is the commitment in the defense of lifewhich the Madres have taken upon themselves’’(Madres, 1987, no. 29, p. 1).In December 1984, the de Bonafini group con-demned the exhumations as a government scheme tohave them accept the presumption of death of alldisappeared. The Madres demanded that first theassassins had to be identified before any furtherexhumations were to be carried out (Madres, 1984,no. 1, p. 2). Their position was strengthened by aparcel received on 13 November 1984 by Mrs.Rubinstein, whose daughter Patricia had disappearedon 7 February 1977. An accompanying letter fromthe so-called Condor Legion read: ‘‘Dear Madam: Asthe culmination of the incessant search for yourdaughter Patricia, we have decided to send youonly part of what remains of her, but which shallundoubtedly satisfy your yearning to reunite earlierwith your dear daughter than foreseen by Jehovah’’(Madres, 1984, no. 1, p. 15). A forensic examinationdetermined that the bones belonged to a man be-tween twenty and forty years of age. In the eyes ofthe Madres, the perpetrators were using the fateof the disappeared as a bargaining chip. If a dealcould be struck that would end all legal prosecutionand public protests, then they would be willingto reveal the makeshift resting places of thedisappeared.A new argument against forensic investigationsarose in 1986. The de Bonafini group protestedagainst proposed legislation to impose a statute oflimitations on the ongoing depositions against mili-tary officers accused of human rights violations. Theyargued that since an exhumation only determinedthe cause of death, but did not identify the execu-tioner, any future prosecution would become impos-sible because of a ten-year statute of limitations.Only by providing a legal status to disappearance,comparable to a kidnapping, could legal action betaken against the guilty without any time restrictions(Madres, 1986, no. 19, p. 16). By mid-1986, belief inthe prosecution of the hundreds of military officersaccused of serious violations was declining rapidly.The government had prepared legislation to imposea final date on the presentation of court depositions(ley de Punto Final), while the outcome of the trialagainst the nine junta members had not satisfied theMadres. Their ideas about forensic investigations hadchanged from personal hope to legal justice, andended in disillusionment and defiance. Their oppos-ition to the exhumations turned from a legal into apolitical argument.The leading figures of the de Bonafini group wereof course well aware of the psychological toll of theenduring uncertainty and had a team of psychother-apists at hand to provide assistance. The Madresnever opposed individual exhumations when askedfor by relatives, but they remained firmly against theopening of mass graves and the performance ofunsolicited identifications. They realized that therecuperation of the remains would allow relativesto grieve for their dead, but they regarded thedeliberate setting in motion of this mourning processas a sinister ploy to achieve resignation and depol-iticization among the surviving relatives. Mourningwould break the solidarity of the Madres and pro-duce a reconciliatory attitude. Continued politicalprotest weighed more heavily than individualrelief because anxiety was the hinge of memory andoblivion.Since 1988, the issue of exhumations fell in thebackground of attention, with the exception of late1989 when the remains of Marcelo Gelman werebeing exhumed. ‘‘We know that they are exhumingcadavers.

The Madres want to keep the disappearedalive by leaving their remains unidentified in massgraves, and divulge their ideals instead. ‘‘They haveinterred their bodies it doesn’t matter where, buttheir spirit, their solidarity, and their love for thepeople can never be buried and forgotten’’ (Hebe deBonafini,Madres, 1989, no. 58, p. 11). Reburialwould confine them to the world of the dead, insteadof allowing their spirit to influence the dealings ofthe living, very much as friend and foe believed thatthe spirit of Evita, Facundo, and Rosas could influ-ence the affairs of the world.The position of the Madres of the de Bonafinigroup is remarkable. They did not only go againstthe cultural grain of Argentine society with its pro-found Catholic formation, as they themselves real-ized very well, but they also radically changed thepolitical significance of reburials and the spiritualmeaning of the human remains. Body, spirit, andfuneral were dissociated. The ossified remains losttheir meaning, and so did their reburial. The spirit asmetaphor for political ideas was exalted as the onlything worthy of survival in the embodiment of kin-dred political spirits.In 1988, as most military officers accused of grosshuman rights violations had become immune toprosecution as a result of the June 1987 Due Obedi-ence Law (ley de Obediencia Debida), the de Bonafinigroup started on a path of ideological radicalizationthat made them embrace the political project attrib-uted to the disappeared. They denounced the polit-ical system as corrupt and ethically bankrupt, andtalked about the need to form grassroots organiza-tions in factories, schools, universities, and poorneighborhoods because ‘‘there will be no liberationwithout revolution. Our children took this road.Today the Madres follow it. Tomorrow it will bethe entire population. In order not to forget, not toforgive, not to succumb and to fight for victory’’(Hebe de Bonafini,Madres, 1988, no. 43, p. 16). Bylate 1988, the idea arose that the Madres have to‘‘socialize their maternity’’ (Madres, 1988, no. 48, p.17) and adopt the suffering of all victims of politicalviolence in the world. ‘‘When we understood thatour children were not going to appear, we socializedmotherhood and felt that we are the mothers ofeverybody, that all are our children’’ (Hebe de Bona-fini,Madres, 1989, no. 53, p. 17). Pressing socialproblems such as widespread poverty, decliningsocial services, high unemployment, poor benefitsfor the aged, government corruption, police brutal-ity, and the privatization of state companies havebecome a political platform to pursue the revolu-tionary ideals of their disappeared children.The development of the arguments against ex-humation and reburial demonstrates a continuousrefinement of the understanding of the consequencesof state terror and its many ramifications in thepolitical life of the Argentines. In the eyes of theMadres de Plaza de Mayo, reburials become syn-onymous with spiritual and physical death. Reburialsdestroy the living memory of the disappeared, andinter them in an enclosed remembrance. The Madresfear that the disappeared will be forgotten, and thatthey will be relegated to an increasingly more distantpast, to the time of the dictatorship and the dirtywar. Instead, they try to keep the spirit of theirdisappearedchildrenalivebyreincarnatingtheir political ideals. This position led the Madresto condemn the exhumation of Marcelo Gelman:‘‘With these tactics they implement the obliterationand reconciliation demanded by the assassins, theChurch and a few Montoneros. These tactics arerepudiated by the people’’ (Sur, 7 January 1990).The de Bonafini group of Madres condemns thevery exhumations that could give them an answerto their original plea about the whereabouts of thedisappeared.Reburial and ReconciliationThe relatives of exhumed and identified missingpersons have generally felt a great sense of reliefat finally being able to reunite with the remains oftheir loved ones. Berta Schubaroff expressed thissentiment at seeing her son’s remains in thefollowing way: ‘‘I felt that I was emotional becauseI found my son. I kissed him again. I kissed allhis bones, touched him, caressed him. But the emo-tion confounded with the pain, because once I foundhim, he turned out to be dead. So I cried the deathof my son, and those thirteen years of search van-Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:08ampage 144State Terror in the Netherworld: Disappearance and Reburial in Argentina144"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"ished. I can’t relate anymore to this period’’ (quotedin Cohen Salama 1992:249). Juan Gelman confessedto similar sentiments a few weeks later: ‘‘I feel that Ihave been able to rescue him from the fog’’ (quotedin Cohen Salama 1992:250). But what did he rescuefrom the fog? His son’s remains or his spirit? Theremembrance of the political assassination or hisson’s ideals? Was Juan Gelman talking about thefog that drifts between the land of the living andthe land of the dead? Or was he referring to similarstate terror practices during World War II, in par-ticular the 1941Nacht und Nebel(night and fog)decree with which General Keitel ordered the disap-pearance of the Jews on the eastern front? A similarhistorical spirit may have persuaded Berta Schubaroffto bury her son in a Jewish cemetery out of vindica-tion, even though she never practiced the Jewishfaith. She had become conscious of her Jewish heri-tage when she learnt that her son’s tormentors hadtreated him as a ‘‘shit Jew’’ (judı ́o de mierda), and shetherefore wanted to demonstrate her forgotten iden-tity openly through a Jewish reburial (Cohen Salama1992:250).The feelings of Marcelo Gelman’s parents, theirsense of having rescued their son in medias res, andthe detachment from the thirteen-year search ex-perienced upon caressing the bones, are feared bythe de Bonafini group of Madres. Most human rightsorganizations, however, have become convinced ofthe judicial, historical, political, and psychologicalimportance of forensic investigations. Exhumationsprovide evidence for legal prosecution, give histor-ical proof of the human rights violations committedby the military, and can provide forensic evidenceabout disappeared women who gave birth in captiv-ity. Exhumations also make reburials possible thatallow surviving relatives to begin a process ofmourning. Reburials rehabilitate the disappeared be-cause the public ceremony gives a deference to thedeceased which had been denied by the military,precisely because they believed that they were sub-versive of society and thus undeserving of its publicrespect.Robert Hertz has argued that reburials servethree general purposes: ‘‘to give burial to theremains of the deceased, to ensure the soul peaceand access to the land of the dead, and finally tofree the living from the obligations of mourning’’(Hertz 1960:54). These purposes seem to havebeen served in Argentina as much for the nine-teenth-century generals and statesmen who cameto rest at Recoleta cemetery as for the nearly twohundred disappeared who were exhumed, identi-fied, and finally reburied. The torn fabric of societyis restored by funerary rituals, the deceased arereconciled with their forebears, and their soulscome to rest in sacred ground, only to be recap-tured periodically in commemorations. However,the violent death suffered by the disappeared andtheir political role in Argentine history accordthem a special position that continues to infusesociety with potential conflict. Reburials turnfrom rituals of remembrance into acts of restor-ation for their comrades-in-faith, and into acts ofdefiance and public provocation for their politicalopponents. It is this political significance whichcaused the persistent efforts to repatriate JuanManuel de Rosas and rebury him at Recoleta cem-etery, and which gave political meaning to thereburial of Marcelo Gelman at La Tablada Jewishcemetery. The fight about the remains of victims ofviolence thus becomes a struggle about the survivalof their political spirit and the reconstruction oftheir legacy to Argentine history and society.The belief in the eternity of the spirit, the imper-ishability of the bones, and the human need to mournthe dead are indeed as deeply engrained in Argentinesociety as they are in most cultures. The politicalpractice of obstructing funerary rituals preventspeople from coming to terms with their dead andfrom reconciling eventually with their opponents.This continued effort to hold the surviving relativeshostage to their anguish led one group of the Madresde Plaza de Mayo to forego all claims to the humanremains – instead of clinging to the desperate hopeto ever recover them – and to appropriate thepolitical ideals of the disappeared. Political animos-ities have thus become further entrenched, and con-tinue to kindle the memory of past humiliations andinjustices. State terror will only come to an endwhen the perpetrators of violence acknowledgetheir common humanity with their victims – theliving as well as the dead – and by returning thedead for proper reburial.Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:08ampage 145Antonius C.

He left BuenosAires in 1975 after receiving death threats from theArgentine Anticommunist Alliance (AAA), a right-wing paramilitary organization run from the ministryof social welfare headed by Lo ́pez Rega, the right handof Pero ́n’s widow Marı ́a Estela Martı ́nez de Pero ́n.2Marı ́a Claudia Iruretagoyena was seven months preg-nant when she was abducted, and she was still seenalive on October 7, about one week after her husbandMarcelo had already been killed. Her mother-in-lawBerta Schubaroff became a member of the Grand-mothers of the Plaza de Mayo (Abuelas de Plaza deMayo), and continued to search for a surviving grand-child.3In the nineteenth century, the Unitarists pursued astrong central government under the hegemony of theport city of Buenos Aires. They wanted to continue toenrich themselves with the profitable foreign trade, andthe import and export tax revenues. The Federalistsdesired a federal government which would give greaterpolitical autonomy to the provinces, and protect therudimentary local industries against foreign imports.Rosas championed the Federalist cause, but his ouster in1852 reestablished the dominance of Buenos Aires. Inthe twentieth century, the Unitarist ideas lived on inliberal politicians who wanted to open the Argentineeconomy to foreign investment, while the Federalistideas were embraced by protectionist nationalists.4An official decree from 14 August 1956 ordered thepublication of a ‘‘black book about the second tyranny’’that would divulge to the Argentine people the cor-ruption and misgovernment of Pero ́n. This book out-lines in detail the historical analogies between Rosasand Pero ́n (Comisio ́n de Afirmacio ́n 1987:25–34).5Rosas died in 1877 and entered the clause in histestament that his remains could only be reburied inArgentina if a 1857 sentence would be revoked thathad declared him to be a traitor to the country (BuenosAires Nos Cuenta, no. 13, p. 107; Martı ́nez 1978:115–27).6The reburial of Rosas had been carefully orchestrated.Three weeks before the historic event, on 11 Septem-ber, Menem had attended the commemoration in theprovince of San Juan of the 101st anniversary of thedeath of Domingo Sarmiento. Sarmiento and Rosas hadbeen archrivals for decades. Rosas had forced Sar-miento into exile for championing the Unitarist cause,while Sarmiento had reviled the Federalist Rosas in hismemorable denouncementCivilization and Barbarism(Sarmiento 1986).7The pardoned officers consisted of military com-manders who had been indicted for human rightsviolations, junta members convicted for waging the1982 Falklands/Malvinas War, and the leaders ofseveral military mutinies in 1986 and 1987. Themembers of the 1976–1982 military juntas who hadbeen convicted for their repressive regime and thedisappearances of the 1970s remained in prison, butwere pardoned in December 1990.8It is plausible to assume that the desecration of thecorpse was also related to the Catholic belief inPurgatory and the survival of the soul after death.The mutilated were believed to suffer horribly asthey were cleansed of their earthly sins. NatalieZemon Davis comes to the same doctrinal explan-ation in her interpretation of the mutilation ofcorpses by Catholic crowds during the sixteenth-century religious wars against the Huguenots inFrance. Protestant crowds were particularly keenon torturing Catholic priests, but were indifferentto the corpse, possibly because ‘‘the souls of the deadexperience immediately Christ’s presence or thetorments of the damned, and thus the dead body isno longer so dangerous or important an object to theliving’’ (Davis 1975:179). On the other hand, theexhumation, mutilation, and public display of themummified remains of priests, nuns, and saintsduring the Spanish civil war was an iconoclasticattack by the Republican left on the conservativeChurch and the Nationalists (Lincoln 1989: 117–27). Mutilation must be distinguished from themedieval practice of multiplying saintly relicsthroughdismemberment(dismembratio)(Snoek1995:22–4).9In 1708, a small chapel was built at the presentlocation of the cemetery for the order of the HolyRecollect (Santa Recoleccio ́n). The barefoot friars wholived in reclusive meditation were calledrecoletos,and the church that was erected in 1732 was popu-larly called Recoleta. Deceased members of import-ant families and brotherhoods were buried inside thechurch, while others were laid to rest in theadjoining holy ground.10The body of Juan Domingo Pero ́n was also not leftundisturbed. In July 1987, someone broke into Per-o ́n’s tomb at Chacarita cemetery and stole the handsfrom the corpse, the very hands Pero ́n used to raisein his characteristic pose during his speeches fromRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:08ampage 146State Terror in the Netherworld: Disappearance and Reburial in Argentina146"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"the balcony of the presidential palace as he receivedthe cheers and chants of the Peronist masses.11Commissions to recover the remains of Rosas werealso installed in 1917 and 1954, but these attemptsdid not reach congress (Barletta and Ame ́zola1992:50).12The following books provide historical backgroundto the Madres de Plaza de Mayo: Bousquet (1984);Diago (1988); Fisher (1989); Guzman Bouvard(1994); Oria (1987); and Sa ́nchez (1985).13The first protest was held on Saturday afternoon, 13April 1977, but was moved initially to Friday andsoon to Thursday afternoons. The city was desertedon Saturdays, and Friday was believed to be anunlucky day (Simpson and Bennett 1985:157–8).14The group that split itself off from the main organiza-tion called itself the Linea Fundadora (Founding Line)because several of its members belonged to the ori-ginal group of fourteen women who began the publicprotest in 1977. They cooperated with the CONA-DEP investigation and supported the exhumations.The main group, which continued under the nameMadres de Plaza de Mayo, condemned any cooper-ation with the government as a political concessionand opposed the exhumations.15Elena Nicoletti, a member of the psychological teamof the Madres, has argued that the Madres haverejected all mortuary rituals of Western culturebecause these rites cannot initiate a genuinemourning process in the absence of any certaintyabout the fate of the disappeared (Nicoletti1988:116).BIBLIOGRAPHYAndersen, Martin Edwin, 1993Dossier Secreto: Argentina’sDesaparecidos and the Myth of the ‘‘Dirty War.’’Boulder,Colo.: Westview Press.Angenendt, Arnold, 1994Heilige und Reliquien: DieGeschichte ihres Kultes von fru ̈hen Christentum bis zur Gegen-wart.

R. Radcliffe-Brown[...]The marriage ceremony and the peace-making danceboth afford examples of the custom which the Anda-manese have of weeping together under certain cir-cumstances. The principal occasions of thisceremonial weeping are as follows: (1) when twofriends or relatives meet after having been for sometime parted, they embrace each other and weep to-gether; (2) at the peace-making ceremony the twoparties of former enemies weep together, embracingeach other; (3) at the end of the period of mourningthe friends of the mourners (who have not themselvesbeen mourning) weep with the latter; (4) after a deaththe relatives and friends embrace the corpse and weepover it; (5) when the bones of a dead man or womanare recovered from the grave they are wept over; (6)on the occasion of a marriage the relatives of eachweep over the bride and bridegroom; (7) at variousstages of the initiation ceremonies the female relativesof a youth or girl weep over him or her.First of all it is necessary to note that not in any ofthe above-mentioned instances is the weeping simplya spontaneous expression of feeling. It is always a ritethe proper performance of which is demanded bycustom. (As mentioned in an earlier chapter, theAndamanese are able to sit down and shed tears atwill.) Nor can we explain the weeping as being anexpression of sorrow. It is true that some of theoccasions are such as to produce sorrowful feelings(4 and 5, for example), but there are others on whichthere would seem to be no reason for sorrow butrather for joy. The Andamanese do weep fromsorrow and spontaneously. A child cries when he isscolded or hurt; a widow weeps thinking of herrecently dead husband. Men rarely weep spontan-eously for any reason, though they shed tears abun-dantly when taking part in the rite. The weeping onthe occasions enumerated is therefore not a spontan-eous expression of individual emotion but is anexample of what I have called ceremonial customs.In certain circumstances men and women are re-quired by custom to embrace one another andweep, and if they neglected to do so it would be anoffence condemned by all right-thinking persons.According to the postulate of method laid down atthe beginning of the chapter we have to seek such anexplanation of this custom as will account for all thedifferent occasions on which the rite is performed,From A. R. Radcliffe-Brown,The Andaman Islanders(New York: The Free Press, 1964 [1922]).Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:09am page 151151"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"since we must assume that one and the same rite hasthe same meaning in whatever circumstances it maytake place. It must be noted, however, that there aretwo varieties of the rite. In the first three instancesenumerated above the rite is reciprocal, i.e. twopersons or two distinct groups of persons weep to-getherand embraceeach other,both parties to theritebeingactive.Intheotherfour instancesitisone-sided;a person or group of persons weeps over anotherperson (or the relics of a person) who has only apassive part in the ceremony. Any explanation, to besatisfactory, must take account of the difference be-tween these two varieties.I would explain the rite as being an expression ofthat feeling of attachment between persons which isof such importance in the almost domestic life of theAndaman society. In other words the purpose of therite is to affirm the existence of a social bond be-tween two or more persons.There are two elements in the ceremony, the em-brace and the weeping. We have already seen that theembrace is an expression, in the Andamans as else-where, of the feeling of attachment, i.e. the feeling ofwhich love, friendship, affection are varieties.Turning to the second element of the ceremony, weare accustomed to think of weeping as more particu-larly an expression of sorrow. We are familiar, how-ever,withtearsofjoy,andIhavemyselfobservedtearsthat were the result neither of joy nor of sorrow but ofa sudden overwhelming feeling of affection. I believethat we may describe weeping as being a means bywhich the mind obtains relief from a condition ofemotional tension, and that it is because such condi-tions of tension are most common in feelings of griefand pain that weeping comes to be associated withpainful feelings. It is impossible here to discuss thissubject, and I am therefore compelled to assumewithout proof this proposition on which my explan-ation of the rite is based.1My own conclusion, basedon careful observation, is that in this rite the weepingis an expression of what has been called the tenderemotion.2Withoutdoubt,onsomeoftheoccasionsofthe rite, as when weeping over a dead friend, theparticipants are suffering a painful emotion, butthis is evidently not so on all occasions. It is true,however, as I shall show, that on every occasion of therite there is a condition of emotional tension due tothe sudden calling into activity of the sentiment ofpersonal attachment.When two friends or relatives meet after havingbeen separated, the social relation between them thathas been interrupted is about to be renewed. Thissocial relation implies or depends upon the existenceof a specific bond of solidarity between them. Theweeping rite (together with the subsequent exchangeof presents) is the affirmation of this bond. The rite,which,itmustberemembered,isobligatory,compelsthe two participants to act as though they felt certainemotions, and thereby does, to some extent, producethose emotions in them. When the two friends meettheir first feeling seems to be one of shyness mingledwith pleasure at seeing each other again. This isaccording to the statements of the natives as well asmy own observation. Now this shyness (the Andama-neseusethesamewordastheydofor‘‘shame’’)isitselfa condition of emotional tension, which has to berelieved in some way. The embrace awakens to fullactivity that feeling of affection or friendship that hasbeen dormant andwhich it is the business of the rite torenew. The weeping gives relief to the emotionaltension just noted, and also reinforces the effect ofthe embrace. This it does owing to the fact that astrong feeling of personal attachment is alwaysproduced when two persons join together in sharingand simultaneously expressing one and the sameemotion.3The little ceremony thus serves to dispelthe initial feeling of shyness and to reinstate theconditionof intimacyand affectionthat existedbeforethe separation.In the peace-making ceremony the purpose of thewhole rite is to abolish a condition of enmity andreplace it by one of friendship. The once friendlyrelations between the two groups have been inter-rupted by a longer or shorter period of antagonism.We have seen that the effect of the dance is to dispelthe wrath of the one group by giving it free expres-sion. The weeping that follows is the renewal of thefriendship. The rite is here exactly parallel to that onthe meeting of two friends, except that not twoindividuals but two groups are concerned, and thatowing to the number of persons involved the emo-tional condition is one of much greater intensity.4Here therefore also we see that the rite is an affirm-ation of solidarity or social union, in this instanceRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:09am page 152The Andaman Islanders152"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"between the groups, and that the rule is in its naturesuch as to make the participants feel that they arebound to each other by ties of friendship.We now come to a more difficult example of therite, that at the end of mourning. It will be shown laterin the chapter that during the period of mourning themourners are cut off from the ordinary life of thecommunity.Byreasonofthetiesthatstillbindthemtothedeadpersontheyareplaced,asitwere,outsidethesociety and the bonds that unite them to their groupare temporarily loosened. At the end of the mourningperiod they re-enter the society and take up oncemore their place in the social life. Their return tothe community isthe occasion on which they and theirfriendsweep together. In this instance also, therefore,the rite may be explained as having for its purpose therenewal of the social relations that have been inter-rupted. This explanation will seem more convincingwhen we have considered in detail the customs ofmourning. If it be accepted, then it may be seen thatinthe first three instances of the rite of weeping (thoseinwhichtheactionisreciprocal)wehaveconditionsinwhich social relations that have been interrupted areabouttoberenewed,andtheriteservesasaceremonyof aggregation.Let us now consider the second variety of the rite,and first of all its meaning as part of the ceremony ofmarriage. By marriage the social bonds that have tothat time united the bride and bridegroom to theirrespective relatives, particularly their female rela-tives such as mother, mother’s sister, father’s sisterand adopted mother, are modified. The unmarriedyouth or girl is in a position of dependence upon hisor her older relatives, and by the marriage thisdependence is partly abolished. Whereas the princi-pal duties of the bride were formerly those towardsher mother and older female relatives, henceforthher chief duties in life will be towards her husband.The position of the bridegroom is similar, and it mustbe noted that his social relations with his male rela-tives are less affected by his marriage than those withhis female relatives. Yet, though the ties that havebound the bride and bridegroom to their relativesare about to be modified or partially destroyed by thenew ties of marriage with its new duties and rightsthey will still continue to exist in a weakened andchanged condition. The rite of weeping is the ex-pression of this. It serves to make real (by feeling), inthose taking part in it, the presence of the social tiesthat are being modified.When the mother of the bride or bridegroomweeps at a marriage she feels that her son or daughteris being taken from her care. She has the sorrow of apartial separation and she consoles herself by ex-pressing in the rite her continued feeling of tender-ness and affection towards him in the new conditionthat he is entering upon. For her the chief result ofthe rite is to make her feel that her child is still anobject of her affection, still bound to her by closeties, in spite of the fact that he or she is being takenfrom her care.Exactly the same explanation holds with regard tothe weeping at the initiation ceremonies. By theseceremonies the youth (or girl) is gradually withdrawnfrom a condition of dependence on his mother andolder female relatives and is made an independentmember of the community. The initiation is a longprocess that is only completed by marriage. At everystage of the lengthy ceremonies therefore, the socialties that unite the initiate to these relatives are modi-fied or weakened, and the rite of weeping is the meansby which the significance of the change is impressedupon those taking part in it. For the mother theweeping expresses her resignation at her necessaryloss, and acts as a consolation by making her feel thathersonisstillhers,thoughnowbeingwithdrawnfromher care. For the boy the rite has a different meaning.He realises that he is no longer merely a child, de-pendent upon his mother, but is now entering uponmanhood. His former feelings towards his mothermust be modified. That he is being separated fromher is, for him, the most important aspect of thematter, and therefore while she weeps he must givenosignoftenderness inreturn butmust sitpassiveandsilent. So also in the marriage ceremony, the riteserves to impress upon the young man and womanthat they are, by reason of the new ties that they areforming with one another, severing their ties withtheir families.When a person dies the social bonds that unite himto the survivors are profoundly modified.

It is this affection still bindingthem to him that they express in the rite of weepingover the corpse. Here rite and natural expression ofemotion coincide, but it must be noted that theweeping is obligatory, a matter of duty. In this in-stance, then, the rite is similar to that at marriage andinitiation. The man is by death cut off from thesociety to which he belonged, and from associationwith his friends, but the latter still feel towards himthat attachment that bound them together while helived, and it is this attachment that they express whenthey embrace the lifeless corpse and weep over it.There remains only one more instance of the riteto be considered. When the period of mourning for adead person is over and the bones are recovered themodification in the relations between the dead andthe living, which begins at death, and is, as we shallsee, carried out by the mourning customs and cere-monies, is finally accomplished. The dead person isnow entirely cut off from the world of the living, savethat his bones are to be treasured as relics andamulets. The weeping over the bones must betaken, I think, as a rite of aggregation whereby thebones as representative of the dead person (all that isleft of him) are received back into the society hence-forth to fill a special place in the social life. It reallyconstitutes a renewal of social relations with the deadperson, after a period during which all activesocial relations have been interrupted owing to thedanger in all contact between the living and the dead.By the rite the affection that was once felt towards thedead person is revived and is now directed to theskeletal relics of the man or woman that once wastheir object. If this explanation seem unsatisfactory, Iwould ask the reader to suspend his judgment untilthe funeral customs of the Andamans have beendiscussed, and then to return to this point.The proffered explanation of the rite of weepingshould now be plain. I regard it as being the affirm-ation of a bond of social solidarity between thosetaking part in it, and as producing in them a realisa-tion of that bond by arousing the sentiment of at-tachment. In some instances the rite therefore servesto renew social relations when they have been inter-rupted, and in such instances the rite is reciprocal. Inothers it serves to show the continued existence ofthe social bond when it is being weakened or modi-fied, as by marriage, initiation or death. In all in-stances we may say that the purpose of the rite is tobring about a new state of the affective dispositionsthat regulate the conduct of persons to one another,either by reviving sentiments that have lain dormant,or producing a recognition of a change in the condi-tion of personal relations.The study of these simple ceremonies has shownus several things of importance. (1) In every instancethe ceremony is the expression of an affective state ofmind shared by two or more persons. Thus theweeping rite expresses feelings of solidarity, theexchange of presents expresses good-will. (2) Butthe ceremonies are not spontaneous expressions offeeling; they are all customary actions to which thesentiment of obligation attaches, which it is the dutyof persons to perform on certain definite occasions.It is the duty of everyone in a community to givepresents at a wedding; it is the duty of relatives toweep together when they meet. (3) In every instancethe ceremony is to be explained by reference tofundamental laws regulating the affective life ofhuman beings. It is not our business here to analysethese phenomena but only to satisfy ourselves thatthey are real. That weeping is an outlet for emotionalexcitement, that the free expression of aggressivefeelings causes them to die out instead of smoulder-ing on, that an embrace is an expression of feelings ofattachment between persons: these are the psycho-logical generalisations upon which are based theexplanations given above of various ceremonies ofthe Andamanese. (4) Finally, we have seen that eachof the ceremonies serves to renew or to modify inthe minds of those taking part in it some one or moreof the social sentiments. The peace-making cere-mony is a method by which feelings of enmity areexchanged for feelings of friendship. The marriagerite serves to arouse in the minds of the marryingpair a sense of their obligations as married folk,and to bring about in the minds of the witnesses achange of feeling towards the young people such asshould properly accompany their change of socialstatus. The weeping and exchange of presents whenfriends come together is a means of renewing theirfeelings of attachment to one another.

DanforthThe funeral laments of rural Greece are generallyclassified asmiroloyia.1In Potamia they are also re-ferred to asnekratika traghoudhia, meaning deathsongs. The most important defining characteristicsof these laments are their performance by women atdeath rituals and their association with the expres-sion of intense grief and sorrow. Greek funerallaments are part of a longstanding oral tradition inwhich the literary concept of one authentic or cor-rect version of a song does not exist. These lamentsare composed, performed, and transmitted orally.The degree to which each performance is an originalcreation or composition varies greatly from oneregion of Greece to another, and, within any region,from one performer to another.2In Potamia, although several women have theability to compose very original laments, the vastmajority of laments sung are well known to mostwomen. In such cases the variation that exists in-volves the complexity and the degree of elaborationwith which traditional themes are presented. Inaddition, each time a lament is sung, the propernames, kin terms, and descriptive phrases that fitthe circumstances of the deceased are inserted in theappropriate places. Thus the formulaic phrase ‘‘anold man, a kind father’’ (enas yerondas ky enas kalospateras) may replace ‘‘a youth, a handsome youngman’’ (enas nioutsikos ky enas kalos levendis). Similarly,any appropriate proper name or kin term can substi-tute for ‘‘my mother’’ in the verse ‘‘My mother isweeping for me with tears and with pain.’’ Finally,certain laments or themes are only appropriate forcertain categories of people. A lament suitable for ayoung girl who has died would not be sung at thefuneral of an elderly widow.Throughout rural Greece, it is the older womenwho maintain the tradition of singing laments atfunerals, memorial services, and exhumations.Given the rapid rate of urbanization and moderniza-tion in Greece, it is not surprising that most youngerwomen do not know laments, do not approve ofthem, and anticipate that they will not be sung atdeath rites for which they will be responsible in thefuture. These young women, who belong to anemerging village middle class with aspirationsfor a more modern and sophisticated way of life,From Loring M.

They spend much oftheir time crying, sobbing, and calling out to thedeceased. The singing is led by women who are lessdirectly touched by the death, more distant relativesof the deceased or women who are not related to himat all. In Potamia these women are not professionalmourners in any sense. They are not paid, nor arethey even specifically invited to attend a funeral.They are usually women who have become goodsingers and have learned many laments becausethey have had much experience with death. Oftenthe women who lead the singing are themselves inmourning and through their singing express theirown grief for their own dead.After the singing of each verse of a lament there isa break during which women whose grief is mostintense cry, sob, shout personal messages to thedeceased, or talk emotionally about the recentdeath. When the women who lead the singingbegin the next verse they interrupt these cries andshouts. Then those who are most upset pick up theverse and rejoin the singing. In extreme cases, whenthe close relatives of the deceased continue to cryand shout and do not resume the lament, they may beangrily instructed to do so by other women. Forexample, at a funeral in Potamia where the widowof the deceased was wildly hugging and kissing herdead husband, her sister, in an attempt to restrainand calm her, spoke to her sharply: ‘‘Don’t shout likethat! Sit down and cry and sing!’’The women of Potamia generally agree that thesinging of laments is preferable to wild shouting andwailing as a means of expressing grief at death rituals.Many women believe that such shouting is physicallyharmful and may cause illness. It is also likely thatduring this period of uncontrolled shouting the be-reaved relative of the deceased may say somethinginappropriate and embarrassing. She may, forexample, reveal information concerning privatefamily matters which would provoke undesirablegossip.4By contrast the singing of laments eliminates thepossibility of revealing embarrassing information,since these laments constitute a public language, acultural code, for the expression of grief. Theyprovide the bereaved with a set of shared symbols,what Le ́vi-Strauss (1963:199) has called a socialmyth, which enables them not only to organizetheir experience of death in a culturally meaningfulway but also to articulate it in a socially approvedmanner. Women singing laments are communicatingin a symbolic language and in the context of apublic performance. The goal of a structural analysisof Greek funeral laments is to learn this languagein order to understand what is being said aboutdeath.One of the most striking features of Greek funerallaments is the close resemblance they bear to thesongs that are sung at weddings throughout ruralGreece. In Potamia these wedding songs are callednifika traghoudhiaornifiatika traghoudhia, literallybridal songs. The classification of songs asmiroloyiaor asnifika traghoudhiadepends on the contextin which they are performed. These two categoriesof songs resemble each other with regard to theirmusical form, their narrative structure, and theiriconography. So close is this resemblance that manysongs can be sung at both death rites and weddings.Of such a song it is said: ‘‘You can sing it as afuneral lament, and you can also sing it as a weddingsong’’ (To les miroloyi, to les ke nifiko). The lyricsand the basic melody of these songs are the samewhether they are performed at death rites or atweddings, but the manner in which the melodyis sung varies according to the occasion. Whenthese songs are sung at weddings, the style ismore forceful, vigorous, and joyful; the melodymore elaborate, with trills and light melismaticphrases. At death rites the style is more somberand restrained; the melody flatter and less ela-borate.5This relationship between funeral laments andwedding songs is but one aspect of a larger corres-pondence or analogy between death rites andmarriage rites which is to be found in Greekculture.

Danforth157"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"between marriage and death may at first glanceappear startling, since the structural similarities be-tween these rites are largely masked by a culturalemphasis on the differences between them. Whattwo occasions could be more different than the joyfulcelebration of life that is a wedding and the sadcommemoration of death that is a funeral? Whatcould contrast more sharply than the white dress ofthe bride and the black dress of the widow; theformer gaining a husband, the latter losing one?Although it is important to bear in mind the logicalopposition that exists between these two episodes inthe life cycle, it is equally important to understandthe no less significant parallels.Van Gennep and Hertz have both pointed to thesimilarities that exist between funerals and weddingsin cultures throughout the world. Both death andmarriage are marked by elaborate rites of passage inwhich separation is an important theme. The analogybetween death and marriage is well developed inritual and folk song throughout the Balkans (Muslea)and particularly so in the long tradition of Greekfuneral laments (Alexiou 1974, Alexiou and Dronke1971).In Potamia, as in most villages of mainlandGreece, a bride leaves her home and family oforigin at marriage in order to live with her newhusband in his father’s home. For this reason awoman’s wedding, like her funeral, is for her parentsand her other close relatives a sad occasion atwhich her departure evokes the expression ofgrief.6The emotional power of this separation andthe psychological distance it introduces betweenmother and daughter are great, whether the daugh-ter is moving only a few hundred yards away, to theother side of her village, or whether she is leavingher village, and Greece as well, for the United Statesor Australia. It is therefore not at all surprising thatthe same songs are sung at both funerals and wed-dings, that these two rites of passage exhibit manyother important similarities, or that the metaphor ofdeath as marriage figures so prominently in Greekfolk songs.The following laments, sung at both funerals andweddings, suggest many of the parallels that existbetween these two rites of passage.10K\u0001aatse,N\u0001iiKom,aK\u0001oomap\u0001ooc,Kiay>Rio pRvi naf\u0001yygZB.—T\u0001vvRas\u0002eex\u0001aamposZnv%RadxvRism\u0002ooBbaR\u0002yyBu\u0002aag\u0001iin.Q\u0002aaxvR\u0001iisapt\u0002ZZnag\u0001aapZm.Q\u0002aaxvR\u0001iisapt\u0002ooDZm\u0001ZZtRZm.Q\u0002aaxvR\u0001iisapt\u0002aaegg\u0001oonia m.‘‘Stay here, Nikos, just for tonight,and leave tomorrow morning!’’‘‘In a short timethe painful separation will take place.I will be separated from my wife.I will be separated from Dhimitris.I will be separated from my grandchildren.’’In the context of death rites this lamentpresents Nikos, the deceased, as if he were stillalive, anticipating his death and his separation fromhis wife, his son Dhimitris, and his grandchildren. Itis sung at the house of the deceased shortly before thearrival of the village priest just prior to the funeralservice. The ‘‘painful separation’’ refers specificallyto the imminent removal of Nikos’ body from thehouse. In the context of marriage rites this lament issung when the groom and his party arrive at thehouse of the bride to take her to the church for thewedding service. It is at this point that the expressionof grief at the departure of the bride is most intense.The name of the bride replaces the name of thedeceased in the first line, while ‘‘my mother,’’ ‘‘myfather,’’ and ‘‘my brothers and sisters’’ are inserted inthe final lines.11K\u0001aatoy st\u0002ooD\u0001aafno potam\u0001oo,Ka\u0002iist\u0002aa dasi\u0002aatRiant\u0001aafylla,n-eKe~ii lalo~yyn tRe~iiBp\u0001eeRdiKeB.Ka\u0002iimi\u0002aap\u0001eeRdiKad\u0002ee lale~ii.—Giat\u0001ii,p\u0001eeRdiKam,d\u0002ee lale~iiB;—T\u0001iin\u0002aa lal\u0001ZZsv;T\u0001iin\u0002aap~vv;N-a>fZsa t\u0002ZZmano\u0001yyla moyd\u0001iixvBKami\u0002aapaRZgoRi\u0001aa.Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 5:03am page 158Metaphors of Mediation in Greek Funeral Laments158"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"M\u0002ZZnKla~iiB,mano\u0001yyla moy glyxi\u0001aa,Ka\u0002iim\u0002ZZn paraponi\u0001eesai:Ht\u0001yyxZmaBt\u0002ooe>grace,m\u0001aana m,n\u0002aa xvristo~yyme:S\u0001yyri,m\u0001aana m,st\u0002oosp\u0001iiti maB,s\u0001yyriKa\u0002iist\u0002ooKal\u0001oomaB:Down by the river Dhafnos,by the dense rose bushes,there three partridges are singing.But one partridge isn’t singing.‘‘My little partridge, why aren’t you singing?’’‘‘Why should I sing?

The presentation is some-what unusual in that the journey is not a departurefrom home, nor is it the deceased who crosses theriver, as one might expect. The journey is a returnhome, while the deceased is permanently ‘‘on theother side of the river,’’ ‘‘in a foreign land’’ (sta xena).What is emphasized here is the impossibility ofovercoming the separation introduced by death.The river, which symbolizes this separation, is liter-ally referred to as ‘‘heavy’’ (vari), as is the separationitself in lament 10, line 4. This suggests the power,the emotional or psychological ‘‘weight,’’ which thisirreversible separation connotes. At a wedding thislament is sung as the groom and his party make theirway from the groom’s home to that of the bride. Itrefers to the separation of the groom from his child-hood and his status as a single man.In addition to the parallels between marriage ritesand death rites suggested by the existence of songsthat are both funeral laments and wedding songs,there are also a great many similarities between theritual details of weddings and funerals as they areperformed in rural Greece. Both are rites of passagethat begin with the formal dressing of the centralcharacter in the ritual drama, the deceased in thecase of the funeral and the bride in the case of thewedding.

Wedding processions in Pota-mia are led by two young men holding large whitecandles. They are followed by several people carryingbaskets full of small packages of candy to be distributedafter thewedding.Thencomethebrideandgroom,andtheir relatives. This procession corresponds quiteclosely to the funeral procession, composed as it is ofacolytes with their staffs, women carrying baskets ofkoliva, the coffin with the body of the deceased, and thebereavedkin.Attheconclusionoftheweddingservice,which, like the funeral, takes place in the center of thevillage church, all those present, led by the close rela-tives of the bride and groom, file by the newly marriedcouple, greetthemwith a kiss, andpresent themwithagift of money, much as they do at the conclusion of thefuneral service. The procession from the church tothe house of the groom and the rites of incorpora-tion which take place there correspond to the proces-sion from the church to the graveyard and the rites ofburial.The analogy between marriage and death is evenclearer, and is explicitly articulated, at the funeral ofan unmarried person. On such occasions people say,‘‘We celebrate the funeral like a wedding’’ (Tin kidhiatin kanoume sa ghamo). In effect, the funeral of anunmarried person becomes his wedding. On suchoccasions funeral laments that are also wedding songsare particularly appropriate.[...]Just as a man at death is said to take ‘‘the blackearth’’ as his wife, so a woman at death is said to takeHaros (Politis 1978:224), or less frequently Hades(Passow 1972:265), as her husband. More oftenHades, rather than being a personification of death,is simply the name for the underworld, where themarriage takes place (Alexiou and Dronke1971:846). In these laments the husband is portrayedas an unknown and feared stranger who has snatchedthe young bride away from her home. The image ofmarrying a personification of death is also found inthe Orthodox funeral service, shorn, however, of itsassociations with classical mythology. God is asked,‘‘Why were we given up to decay? And whyto deathunited in wedlock?’’ (sinezefhthimen to thanato). Theanswer is simply that it is written. It is the will ofGod (Vaporis 1977:109).7As we have seen, death is in many important re-spects both like and unlike marriage. This paradox-ical relationship of simultaneous opposition andidentity, difference and likeness, is the essence ofmetaphor. To assert through ritual and song that afuneral is a wedding is to establish a metaphoricrelationship between the two rites of passage.This association, like all powerful metaphors, in-volves the ‘‘encapsulation of paradox’’ (Herzfeld1979:285). It provides a ‘‘perspective by incongru-ity’’ (Burke 1954:89–96 and 1964:94–9). It isan ‘‘appropriately ill-formed utterance’’ (Basso1976:116).By asserting similarity where there exists differ-ence, by demonstrating identity where there existsopposition, metaphors force us to see things in adifferent light. They establish relationships betweenthings that were thought to be unrelated. The powerof metaphors lies in their ability to change the waywe view our world. A metaphor makes somethingthat had been vague more concrete, more sharplydefined, and it does so in a specific way, for aparticular purpose. According to Fernandez(1971:58) the study of metaphor is the study of‘‘the ways in which men are aided in conveyinginchoate psychological experiences by appealing toa range of more easily observable and concreteevents in other domains of their lives.’’LifeAlive (+)Not separated (+)MarriageAlive (+)Separated (−)DeathNot alive (−)Separated (−)Figure 14.1Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 5:03am page 160Metaphors of Mediation in Greek Funeral Laments160"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Death is perhaps the most ‘‘inchoate’’ experiencemen confront. As such it would seem to be a par-ticularly suitable subject for metaphor. The meta-phoric assertion that death is marriage (and itscorollaries, that a funeral is a wedding and that thegrave is the home of one’s affines) is an attempt tomake death more familiar. More importantly, how-ever, the metaphor of death as marriage ‘‘moves’’death closer to life. It makes death a part of life byidentifying it with an experience from life. In doingso it denies the finality and the ‘‘otherness’’ of death.It creates the fiction that death is not the end of life,not a total negation of life.The metaphor of death as marriage is ultimatelyan attempt to mediate the opposition between lifeand death. It attempts to do this by establishingmarriage as a mediating term and then assertingthat death is marriage, that death is not what it reallyis, a polar term in the opposition between life anddeath, but that it is the mediating term. The meta-phor of death as marriage ‘‘moves’’ death from theopposite of life to the mediator between life anddeath, from the antithesis of life to a synthesis oflife and death.Marriage is a most appropriate metaphor to me-diate the opposition between life and death becauseof the paradoxical relationship of similarity and dif-ference which it holds with respect to death. Likedeath marriage involves departure and separation.However, the departure that takes place at marriageis not as extreme as that which occurs at death. Atmarriage one does not depart from life, from thisworld. One simply departs from one’s home andfamily of origin. After marriage, as after death, oneis apart; but after marriage, as is not the case afterdeath, one is still alive. Marriage therefore is a kindof half death, a partial death. Figure 14.1 illustratesthe position of marriage as a mediator between lifeand death.The opposition between life and death can neveractually be mediated. The mediation of marriage isonly metaphoric. However, the metaphor of mar-riage introduces or generates a new opposition, theopposition between one’s home and family of origin,on one hand, and the home of one’s affines, on theother. This opposition is weaker than that betweenlife and death because it can actually be mediated. Areturn from the home of one’s affines to one’s familyof origin is literally possible, even though one cannotreturn permanently without seriously interruptingthe accepted course of one’s life cycle. The processby which an extreme opposition is mediated meta-phorically and replaced by a weaker opposition thatcan actually be mediated is represented in figure14.2.The analysis of the relationship between the fu-neral and the exhumation presented in Chapter 3revealed that the return of the deceased from thegrave to his home and family, which is ritually at-tempted at the exhumation, is a negative transform-ation of his departure from home and family to thegrave, which occurs at death. However, this attemptto bring the deceased back to the world of the living isthwarted by the process of decomposition, whichtransforms a living person into dry bones. The analy-sis here of the relationship between the funeral andthe wedding demonstrates that both rites involve adeparture, from home and family to the earth atdeath, and from home and family of origin to thehome of one’s affines at marriage. In both cases thismovement is portrayed as extremely undesirable,as a movement from good to bad.Each of the three rites of passage under consider-ation, the wedding, the funeral, and the exhumation,is an episode in the life cycle of the individual. Assuch each rite is a ‘‘metaphoric transformation’’ ofthe other (Leach 1976:25).

Thegreeting of the skull at the exhumation by kissing itand placing money on it corresponds remarkably tothe greeting the bride and groom receive at theconclusion of the wedding ceremony, when thosepresent greet the newly married couple with a kissand pin money to their chests. The parallel betweenexhumation and marriage is also indicated by thewrapping of Eleni’s exhumed skull in a kerchief shehad embroidered as part of her dowry. Just prior toher exhumation, as people gathered at her housebefore setting out for the graveyard, several ofEleni’s relatives made comments that further em-phasized the relationship between her exhumationand her wedding, a wedding that never took place.One of Eleni’s sisters said that she planned to placea large sum of money on Eleni’s skull (money to beused to build a gate for the graveyard in Eleni’smemory) because she would have bought her anexpensive gift at her wedding. Eleni’s mother com-plained that more relatives had not come fromother villages, adding that if it had been Eleni’swedding more people would certainly have come.The analogy between exhumation and wedding isalso suggested by the fact that the movement in bothrites of passage is one of emergence. When theremains of a widow’s husband are exhumed, shecomes out into society (vyeni exo stin kinonia). Simi-larly, when a woman marries, it is said that she willgo out into society (tha vyi stin kinonia), or that herhusband will take her out into society (tha tin vgali exostin kinonia).8Thus just as a woman at marriageemerges into society from the confinement associ-ated with being single, so a widow at the exhumationof her husband’s remains re-emerges into societyfrom the confinement of widowhood.The metaphoric relationship between exhumationand wedding is suggested even more forcefully by thefact that of the sixteen laments sung at Eleni’s exhum-ation, ten were either songs that could be sung atweddings or else versions that had been slightlymodified or transformed to render them appropriatefor exhumations. Of the seven laments sung at Eleni’sexhumation that were presented all except one(lament 6) are wedding songs or transformations ofthem.In the following discussion of the laments sungat Eleni’s exhumation the texts as recorded atthe exhumation are presented on the left, while theversions of them that would be sung at a weddingare presented on the right.Lament5 (Exhumation)5A (Wedding)T\u0001vvRaK\u0001iinZsa,t\u0001vvRaq\u0002aaf\u0001yygvapt\u0002ZZma\u0001yyRZg~ZZBKiaptaRaxniasm\u0001eenZ.T\u0001vvRaK\u0001iinZsa,t\u0001vvRaq\u0002aaf\u0001yygvapt\u0002oosp\u0001iiti moyKiapt\u0002aa glyK\u0001aamad\u0001eeRfia.N-o%loi m\u0002eedi\u0001vvxnoynKio%loi m\u0002eel\u0001eene:\u0001\u0001\u0003e\u0001yyga.N-v>BKiZm\u0001aana moy m\u0002eedi\u0001vvxnei,d\u0002eem\u0002eeq\u0001eelei.Kio pat\u0001eeRaBmoy,Kiayt\u0002ooBmo~yyl\u0001eeei:\u0001\u0001\u0003e\u0001yyga.Fe\u0001yygvKla\u0001iigontaBKa\u0002iipaRaponem\u0001eenZ.Now I have set out.

Lament 9A is sungafter the wedding at the door of the house of thegroom and his parents, as the mother of the groomgreets her new daughter-in-law. The bride respondsto her mother-in-law’s question with politeness anddeference (indicated by the euphemistic reference toher fine new home and the form of address employed–i afendia s’). The movement described here, fromhomeandfamilyoforiginto thehomeof thegroom,isan unhappy, negatively valued departure. Lament 9,musically and structurally parallel, describes a dia-metrically opposed movement, a desired return fromthe grave to home and family of origin.In the context of an exhumation, the marriagemetaphor asserts that an exhumation is a wedding,but it establishes several analogies between the tworites which appear particularly incongruous, para-doxical, and ill-formed. Furthermore, they contra-Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 5:03am page 163Loring M. Danforth163"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"dict the analogies established by the same metaphorused in the context of funeral rites.The funeral-as-wedding metaphor establishesan analogy between a departure from the worldof the living for the grave, on one hand, and a depart-ure from one’s home and family of origin for thehome of one’s affines, on the other. The world of theliving is like one’s home and family of origin (bothpositively valued), and the grave is like the home ofone’s affines (both negatively valued). The appropri-ateness of this metaphor seems clear. The exhum-ation-as-wedding metaphor, however, establishes ananalogy between a return from the grave to the worldof the living, on one hand, and a departure from one’shome and family of origin for the home of one’saffines,ontheother.Thismetaphorassertsparadoxic-ally that the grave is like one’s home and family oforigin, and the world of the living is like the home ofone’s affines. Thus the exhumation-as-wedding meta-phor seems to contradict the funeral-as-weddingmetaphor.10This apparent contradiction recalls the relation-ship of opposition between the exhumation and thefuneral discussed in Chapter 3. The exhumationseems to reverse the movement brought about bythe funeral. However, this reversal proves to beillusory, since it is only the dry, white bones of thedeceased that return from the earth and not thedeceased himself. The exhumation in fact continuesthe departure that was initiated by the funeral; itdoes not reverse it.In effect, the laments sung during Eleni’s exhum-ation assert that the exhumation is a return at thesame time as they deny it. Although the lyrics of thelaments describe a return, both their musical andnarrative structure reveal that what is really takingplace is a wedding-like departure. The exhumation-as-wedding metaphor transforms a return into adeparture. It asserts that the world of the living towhich the deceased appears to have returned is reallythe home of his affines, that is, the underworld or thegrave. It also asserts that the mother to whom thedeceased appears to have returned is really hismother-in-law, the heavy tombstone. Thus thismetaphor captures the paradoxical nature of theexhumation and conveys to those who perform itthe message that the exhumation is not a resurrec-tion. It is a confirmation, not a negation, of death.The relationships between these three rites ofpassage, as well as the different movements theybring about, are illustrated in figure 14.3. Thisdiagram, modeled after Le ́vi-Strauss’ ‘‘culinary tri-angle’’ (Le ́vi-Strauss 1966 and Leach 1970:15–33),demonstrates how the relationships between threeterms in a semantic field can be expressed as a doubleopposition. Here the relationships between wed-ding, funeral, and exhumation are expressed interms of the opposition between life and death andthe opposition between departure and return.The metaphor of marriage, a rite of passage ofthe living, is applied to two rites of passage of thedead.

Virtu-ally everyone in Potamia has a child, sibling, orcousin who is living abroad.Xenitiais a recurrenttheme in the conversations of the residents of Pota-mia. Parents discuss the difficulty of not having theirchildren nearby. They often express the fear that oneof their children might die inxenitia, or that theythemselves might die at home alone with all theirrelatives far away.Xenitia, then, like marriage anddeath, involves a painful departure and a difficultseparation from the social network of family, friends,and fellow villagers.Many songs that can be sung at both weddings anddeath rituals are songs aboutxenitia. These songs arealso sung at family gatherings when close relatives areabsent or when someone present is about to depart.Lament 4 is an example of such a song. Here theperson living inxenitiamay represent either the de-ceased or the bride or groom, depending on thecontext in which the song is performed. In anotherversion of this song the main character announces thathe has married inxenitiaand will never return home.The departure of a child, particularly a daughter, forxenitiaat marriage is especially feared.NOTES1 The most thorough study of Greek funeral laments isMargaret Alexiou’sThe Ritual Lament in Greek Tradition(1974).

To dream of one is generally believed toforetell the other.

He claimsthat he needs a place ‘‘to carry his anger.’’ Theact of severing and tossing away the victim’s headenables him, he says, to vent and, he hopes, throwaway the anger of his bereavement. Although theanthropologist’s job is to make other cultures intelli-gible, more questions fail to reveal any further ex-planation of this man’s pithy statement. To him,grief, rage, and headhunting go together in a self-evident manner. Either you understand it or youdon’t. And, in fact, for the longest time I simplydid not.In what follows, I want to talk about how to talkabout the cultural force of emotions.1Theemotionalforceof a death, for example, derives less from anabstract brute fact than from a particular intimaterelation’s permanent rupture. It refers to the kindsof feelings one experiences on learning, forexample, that the child just run over by a car isone’s own and not a stranger’s. Rather than speak-ing of death in general, one must consider thesubject’s position within a field of social relationsin order to grasp one’s emotional experience.2My effort to show the force of a simple statementtaken literally goes against anthropology’s classicnorms, which prefer to explicate culture throughthe gradual thickening of symbolic webs of meaning.By and large, cultural analysts use notforcebut suchterms asthick description, multi-vocality, polysemy, rich-ness, andtexture. The notion of force, among otherthings, opens to question the common anthropo-logical assumption that the greatest human importresides in the densest forest of symbols and thatanalytical detail, or ‘‘cultural depth,’’ equals en-hanced explanation of a culture, or ‘‘cultural elabor-ation.’’ Do people always in fact describe most thicklywhat matters most to them?The Rage in Ilongot GriefLet me pause a moment to introduce the Ilongots,among whom my wife, Michelle Rosaldo, and I livedFrom Renato Rosaldo, ‘‘Introduction: Grief and a Headhunter’s Rage,’’ inCulture and Truth: The Remaking of Social Analysis(Boston: BeaconPress; London: Taylor & Francis, 1993 [1989]).Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:13am page 167167"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"and conducted field research for thirty months(1967–69, 1974). They number about 3,500 andreside in an upland area some 90 miles northeast ofManila,Philippines.3Theysubsistbyhuntingdeerandwild pig and by cultivating rain-fed gardens (swid-dens) with rice, sweet potatoes, manioc, and vege-tables. Their (bilateral) kin relations are reckonedthrough men and women. After marriage, parentsand their married daughters live in the same or adja-cent households. The largest unit within the society, alargely territorial descent group called thebertan,becomes manifest primarily in the context of feuding.For themselves, their neighbors, and their ethnog-raphers, headhunting stands out as the Ilongots’ mostsalient cultural practice.When Ilongots told me, as they often did, how therage in bereavement could impel men to headhunt, Ibrushed aside their one-line accounts as too simple,thin, opaque, implausible, stereotypical, or other-wise unsatisfying. Probably I naively equated griefwith sadness. Certainly no personal experienceallowed me to imagine the powerful rage Ilongotsclaimed to find in bereavement. My own inability toconceive the force of anger in grief led me to seek outanother level of analysis that could provide a deeperexplanation for older men’s desire to headhunt.Not until some fourteen years after first recordingthe terse Ilongot statement about grief and a head-hunter’s rage did I begin to grasp its overwhelmingforce. For years I thought that more verbal elabor-ation (which was not forthcoming) or another ana-lytical level (which remained elusive) could betterexplain older men’s motives for headhunting. Onlyafter being repositioned through a devastating loss ofmy own could I better grasp that Ilongot older menmean precisely what they say when they describe theanger in bereavement as the source of their desire tocut off human heads. Taken at face value and grantedits full weight, their statement reveals much aboutwhat compels these older men to headhunt.In my efforts to find a ‘‘deeper’’ explanation forheadhunting, I explored exchange theory, perhapsbecause it had informed so many classic ethnograph-ies. One day in 1974, I explained the anthropolo-gist’s exchange model to an older Ilongot man namedInsan. What did he think, I asked, of the idea thatheadhunting resulted from the way that one death(the beheaded victim’s) canceled another (the next ofkin). He looked puzzled, so I went on to say that thevictim of a beheading was exchanged for the death ofone’s own kin, thereby balancing the books, so tospeak. Insan reflected a moment and replied that heimagined somebody could think such a thing (a safebet, since I just had), but that he and other Ilongotsdid not think any such thing. Nor was there anyindirect evidence for my exchange theory in ritual,boast, song, or casual conversation.4In retrospect, then, these efforts to impose ex-change theory on one aspect of Ilongot behaviorappear feeble. Suppose I had discovered what Isought? Although the notion of balancing the ledgerdoes have a certain elegant coherence, one wondershow such bookish dogma could inspire any man totake another man’s life at the risk of his own.My life experience had not as yet provided themeans to imagine the rage that can come with devas-tating loss. Nor could I, therefore, fully appreciatethe acute problem of meaning that Ilongots faced in1974. Shortly after Ferdinand Marcos declared mar-tial law in 1972, rumors that firing squads hadbecome the new punishment for headhuntingreached the Ilongot hills. The men therefore decidedto call a moratorium on taking heads. In past epochs,when headhunting had become impossible, Ilongotshad allowed their rage to dissipate, as best it could, inthe course of everyday life. In 1974, they had anotheroption; they began to consider conversion to evan-gelical Christianity as a means of coping with theirgrief. Accepting the new religion, people said, im-plied abandoning their old ways, including headhunt-ing. It also made coping with bereavement lessagonizing because they could believe that the de-ceased had departed for a better world. No longerdid they have to confront the awful finality of death.The force of the dilemma faced by the Ilongotseluded me at the time. Even when I correctlyrecorded their statements about grieving and theneed to throw away their anger, I simply did notgrasp the weight of their words. In 1974, forexample, while Michelle Rosaldo and I were livingamong the Ilongots, a six-month-old baby died,probably of pneumonia. That afternoon we visitedthe father and found him terribly stricken. ‘‘He wassobbing and staring through glazed and bloodshotRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:13am page 168Grief and a Headhunter’s Rage168"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"eyes at the cotton blanket covering his baby.’’5Theman suffered intensely, for this was the seventh childhe had lost. Just a few years before, three of hischildren had died, one after the other, in a matterof days. At the time, the situation was murkyas people present talked both about evangelicalChristianity (the possible renunciation of takingheads) and their grudges against lowlanders (thecontemplation of headhunting forays into the sur-rounding valleys).Through subsequent days and weeks, the man’sgrief moved him in a way I had not anticipated.Shortly after the baby’s death, the father convertedto evangelical Christianity. Altogether too quick onthe inference, I immediately concluded that the manbelieved that the new religion could somehow pre-vent further deaths in his family. When I spoke mymind to an Ilongot friend, he snapped at me, sayingthat ‘‘I had missed the point: what the man in factsought in the new religion was not the denial of ourinevitable deaths but a means of coping with hisgrief. With the advent of martial law, headhuntingwas out of the question as a means of venting hiswrath and thereby lessening his grief. Were he toremain in his Ilongot way of life, the pain of hissorrow would simply be too much to bear.’’6Mydescription from 1980 now seems so apt that Iwonder how I could have written the words andnonetheless failed to appreciate the force of thegrieving man’s desire to vent his rage.Another representative anecdote makes my failuretoimaginetheragepossibleinIlongotbereavementallthe more remarkable. On this occasion, MichelleRosaldo and I were urged by Ilongot friends to playthe tape of a headhunting celebration we had wit-nessed some five years before. No sooner had weturned on the tape and heard the boast of a man whohad died in the intervening years than did peopleabruptly tell us to shut off the recorder. MichelleRosaldo reported on the tense conversation thatensued:As Insan braced himself to speak, the room againbecame almost uncannily electric. Backs straightenedand my anger turned to nervousness and somethingmore like fear as I saw that Insan’s eyes were red.Tukbaw, Renato’s Ilongot ‘‘brother,’’ then broke intowhat was a brittle silence, saying he could make thingsclear. He told us that it hurt to listen to a headhuntingcelebration when people knew that there would neverbe another. As he put it: ‘‘The song pulls at us, dragsour hearts, it makes us think of our dead uncle.’’ Andagain: ‘‘It would be better if I had accepted God, but Istill am an Ilongot at heart; and when I hear the song,my heart aches as it does when I must look uponunfinished bachelors whom I know that I will neverlead to take a head.’’ Then Wagat, Tukbaw’s wife,said with her eyes that all my questions gave herpain, and told me: ‘‘Leave off now, isn’t that enough?Even I, awoman, cannot stand the way it feels inside myheart.’’7From my present position, it is evident that the taperecording of the dead man’s boast evoked powerfulfeelings of bereavement, particularly rage and theimpulse to headhunt. At the time I could only feelapprehensive and diffusely sense the force of theemotions experienced by Insan, Tukbaw, Wagat,and the others present.The dilemma for the Ilongots grew out of a set ofcultural practices that, when blocked, were agoniz-ing to live with. The cessation of headhunting calledfor painful adjustments to other modes of copingwith the rage they found in bereavement. One couldcompare their dilemma with the notion that thefailure to perform rituals can create anxiety.8In theIlongot case, the cultural notion that throwing away ahuman head also casts away the anger creates aproblem of meaning when the headhunting ritualcannot be performed. Indeed, Max Weber’s classicproblem of meaning inThe Protestant Ethic and theSpirit of Capitalismis precisely of this kind.9On alogical plane, the Calvinist doctrine of predestinationseems flawless: God has chosen the elect, but hisdecision can never be known by mortals. Amongthose whose ultimate concern is salvation, the doc-trine of predestination is as easy to grasp conceptu-ally as it is impossible to endure in everydaylife (unless one happens to be a ‘‘religious virtu-oso’’). For Calvinists and Ilongots alike, the problemof meaning resides in practice, not theory. Thedilemma for both groups involves the practicalmatter of how to live with one’s beliefs, ratherthan the logical puzzlement produced by abstrusedoctrine.Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:13am page 169Renato Rosaldo169"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"How I Found the Rage in GriefOne burden of this introduction concerns the claimthat it took some fourteen years for me to grasp whatIlongots had told me about grief, rage, and head-hunting. During all those years I was not yet in aposition to comprehend the force of anger possible inbereavement, and now I am. Introducing myself intothis account requires a certain hesitation both be-cause of the discipline’s taboo and because of itsincreasingly frequent violation by essays laced withtrendy amalgams of continental philosophy and auto-biographical snippets. If classic ethnography’s vicewas the slippage from the ideal of detachment toactual indifference, that of present-day reflexivity isthe tendency for the self-absorbed Self to lose sightaltogether of the culturally different Other. Despitethe risks involved, as the ethnographer I must enterthe discussion at this point to elucidate certain issuesof method.The key concept in what follows is that of thepositioned (and repositioned) subject.10In routineinterpretive procedure, according to the method-ology of hermeneutics, one can say that ethnograph-ers reposition themselves as they go aboutunderstanding other cultures. Ethnographers beginresearch with a set of questions, revise themthroughout the course of inquiry, and in the endemerge with different questions than they startedwith. One’s surprise at the answer to a question, inother words, requires one to revise the questionuntil lessening surprises or diminishing returns indi-cate a stopping point. This interpretive approach hasbeen most influentially articulated within anthropol-ogy by Clifford Geertz.11Interpretive method usually rests on the axiomthat gifted ethnographers learn their trade by pre-paring themselves as broadly as possible. To followthe meandering course of ethnographic inquiry,field-workers require wide-ranging theoretical cap-acities and finely tuned sensibilities. After all, onecannot predict beforehand what one will encounterin the field. One influential anthropologist, ClydeKluckhohn, even went so far as to recommend adouble initiation: first, the ordeal of psychoanalysis,and then that of fieldwork. All too often, however,this view is extended until certain prerequisites offield research appear to guarantee an authoritativeethnography. Eclectic book knowledge and a range oflife experiences, along with edifying reading andself-awareness, supposedly vanquish the twin vicesof ignorance and insensitivity.Although the doctrine of preparation, knowledge,and sensibility contains much to admire, one shouldwork to undermine the false comfort that it canconvey. At what point can people say that they havecompleted their learning or their life experience?The problem with taking this mode of preparing theethnographer too much to heart is that it can lend afalse air of security, an authoritative claim to certi-tude and finality that our analyses cannot have. Allinterpretations are provisional; they are made bypositioned subjects who are prepared to know cer-tain things and not others. Even when knowledge-able, sensitive, fluent in the language, and able tomove easily in an alien cultural world, good ethnog-raphers still have their limits, and their analysesalways are incomplete. Thus, I began to fathom theforce of what Ilongots had been telling me abouttheir losses through my own loss, and not throughany systematic preparation for field research.My preparation for understanding serious lossbegan in 1970 with the death of my brother, shortlyafter his twenty-seventh birthday. By experiencingthis ordeal with my mother and father, I gained ameasure of insight into the trauma of a parent’slosing a child. This insight informed my account,partially described earlier, of an Ilongot man’s reac-tions to the death of his seventh child. At the sametime, my bereavement was so much less than that ofmy parents that I could not then imagine the over-whelming force of rage possible in such grief. Myformer position is probably similar to that of many inthe discipline. One should recognize that ethno-graphic knowledge tends to have the strengths andlimitations given by the relative youth of field-workers who, for the most part, have not sufferedserious losses and could have, for example, no per-sonal knowledge of how devastating the loss of along-term partner can be for the survivor.In 1981 Michelle Rosaldo and I began field re-search among the Ifugaos of northern Luzon, Philip-pines. On October 11 of that year, she was walkingalong a trail with two Ifugao companions when sheRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:13am page 170Grief and a Headhunter’s Rage170"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"lost her footing and fell to her death some 65 feetdown a sheer precipice into a swollen river below.Immediately on finding her body I became enraged.How could she abandon me? How could she havebeen so stupid as to fall? I tried to cry. I sobbed, butrage blocked the tears. Less than a month later Idescribed this moment in my journal: ‘‘I felt like in anightmare, the whole world around me expandingand contracting, visually and viscerally heaving.Going down I find a group of men, maybe seven oreight, standing still, silent, and I heave and sob, butno tears.’’ An earlier experience, on the fourthanniversary of my brother’s death, had taught meto recognize heaving sobs without tears as a form ofanger. This anger, in a number of forms, has sweptover me on many occasions since then, lasting hoursand even days at a time. Such feelings can be arousedby rituals, but more often they emerge from unex-pected reminders (not unlike the Ilongots’ unnerv-ing encounter with their dead uncle’s voice on thetape recorder).Lest there be any misunderstanding, bereavementshould not be reduced to anger, neither for myselfnor for anyone else.12Powerful visceral emotionalstates swept over me, at times separately and at othertimes together. I experienced the deep cutting painof sorrow almost beyond endurance, the cadaverouscold of realizing the finality of death, the tremblingbeginning in my abdomen and spreading through mybody, the mournful keening that started without mywilling, and frequent tearful sobbing. My presentpurpose of revising earlier understandings of Ilongotheadhunting, and not a general view of bereavement,thus focuses on anger rather than on other emotionsin grief.Writings in English especially need to emphasizethe rage in grief. Although grief therapists routinelyencourage awareness of anger among the bereaved,upper-middle-class Anglo-American culture tends toignore the rage devastating losses can bring. Para-doxically, this culture’s conventional wisdom usuallydenies the anger in grief at the same time thattherapists encourage members of the invisible com-munity of the bereaved to talk in detail about howangry their losses make them feel. My brother’sdeath in combination with what I learned aboutanger from Ilongots (for them, an emotional statemore publicly celebrated than denied) allowed meimmediately to recognize the experience of rage.13Ilongot anger and my own overlap, rather like twocircles, partially overlaid and partially separate. Theyare not identical. Alongside striking similarities, sig-nificant differences in tone, cultural form, andhuman consequences distinguish the ‘‘anger’’ animat-ing our respective ways of grieving. My vivid fanta-sies, for example, about a life insurance agent whorefused to recognize Michelle’s death as job-relateddid not lead me to kill him, cut off his head, andcelebrate afterward. In so speaking, I am illustratingthe discipline’s methodological caution against thereckless attribution of one’s own categories andexperiences to members of another culture. Suchwarnings against facile notions of universal humannature can, however, be carried too far and hardeninto the equally pernicious doctrine that, my owngroup aside, everything human is alien to me. Onehopes to achieve a balance between recognizingwide-ranging human differences and the modesttruism that any two human groups must have certainthings in common.Only a week before completing the initial draft ofan earlier version of this introduction, I rediscoveredmy journal entry, written some six weeks afterMichelle’s death, in which I made a vow to myselfabout how I would return to writing anthropology, ifI ever did so, ‘‘by writing Grief and a Headhunter’sRage . . .’’ My journal went on to reflect morebroadly on death, rage, and headhunting by speakingof my ‘‘wish for the Ilongot solution; they are muchmore in touch with reality than Christians. So, I needa place to carry my anger – and can we say a solutionof the imagination is better than theirs? And can wecondemn them when we napalm villages? Is ourrationale so much sounder than theirs?’’ All thiswas written in despair and rage.Not until some fifteen months after Michelle’sdeath was I again able to begin writing anthropology.Writing the initial version of ‘‘Grief and a Headhunt-er’s Rage’’ was in fact cathartic, though perhaps notin the way one would imagine. Rather than followingafter the completed composition, the catharsis oc-curred beforehand. When the initial version of thisintroduction was most acutely on my mind, duringthe month before actually beginning to write, I feltRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:13am page 171Renato Rosaldo171"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"diffusely depressed and ill with a fever. Then one dayan almost literal fog lifted and words began to flow. Itseemed less as if I were doing the writing than thatthe words were writing themselves through me.My use of personal experience serves as a vehiclefor making the quality and intensity of the rage inIlongot grief more readily accessible to readers thancertain more detached modes of composition. At thesame time, by invoking personal experience as ananalytical category one risks easy dismissal. Unsym-pathetic readers could reduce this introduction to anact of mourning or a mere report on my discovery ofthe anger possible in bereavement. Frankly, thisintroduction is both and more. An act of mourning,a personal report,anda critical analysis of anthropo-logical method, it simultaneously encompasses anumber of distinguishable processes, no one ofwhich cancels out the others. Similarly, I argue inwhat follows that ritual in general and Ilongot head-hunting in particular form the intersection of mul-tiple coexisting social processes. Aside from revisingthe ethnographic record, the paramount claim madehere concerns how my own mourning and conse-quent reflection on Ilongot bereavement, rage, andheadhunting raise methodological issues of generalconcern in anthropology and the human sciences.Death in AnthropologyAnthropology favors interpretations that equate ana-lytical ‘‘depth’’ with cultural ‘‘elaboration.’’ Manystudies focus on visibly bounded arenas where onecan observe formal and repetitive events, such asceremonies, rituals, and games. Similarly, studies ofword play are more likely to focus on jokes asprogrammed monologues than on the less scripted,more free-wheeling improvised interchanges ofwitty banter. Most ethnographers prefer to studyevents that have definite locations in space withmarked centers and outer edges. Temporally, theyhave middles and endings. Historically, they appearto repeat identical structures by seemingly doingthings today as they were done yesterday. Theirqualities of fixed definition liberate such eventsfrom the untidiness of everyday life so that they canbe ‘‘read’’ like articles, books, or, as we now say,texts.Guided by their emphasis on self-contained en-tities, ethnographies written in accord with classicnorms consider death under the rubric of ritualrather than bereavement. Indeed, the subtitles ofeven recent ethnographies on death make the em-phasis on ritual explicit. William Douglas’sDeath inMurelagais subtitledFunerary Ritual in a SpanishBasque Village;Richard Huntington and Peter Met-calf’sCelebrations of Deathis subtitledThe Anthropologyof Mortuary Ritual;Peter Metcalf’sA Borneo Journeyinto Deathis subtitledBerawan Eschatology from ItsRituals.14Ritual itself is defined by its formality androutine; under such descriptions, it more nearlyresembles a recipe, a fixed program, or a book ofetiquette than an open-ended human process.Ethnographies that in this manner eliminate in-tense emotions not only distort their descriptionsbut also remove potentially key variables from theirexplanations. When anthropologist William Doug-las, for example, announces his project inDeath inMurelaga, he explains that his objective is to use deathand funerary ritual ‘‘as a heuristic device with whichto approach the study of rural Basque society.’’15Inother words, the primary object of study is socialstructure, not death, and certainly not bereavement.The author begins his analysis by saying, ‘‘Death isnot always fortuitous or unpredictable.’’16He goeson to describe how an old woman, ailing withthe infirmities of her age, welcomed her death. Thedescription largely ignores the perspective of themost bereaved survivors, and instead vacillatesbetween those of the old woman and a detachedobserver.Undeniably, certain people do live a full life andsuffer so greatly in their decrepitude that they em-brace the relief death can bring. Yet the problem withmaking an ethnography’s major case study focus on‘‘a very easy death’’17(I use Simone de Beauvoir’stitle with irony, as she did) is not only its lack ofrepresentativeness but also that it makes death ingeneral appear as routine for the survivors as thisparticular one apparently was for the deceased.Were the old woman’s sons and daughters untouchedby her death? The case study shows less about howpeople cope with death than about how death can bemade to appear routine, thereby fitting neatly intothe author’s view of funerary ritual as a mechanicalRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:13am page 172Grief and a Headhunter’s Rage172"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"programmed unfolding of prescribed acts. ‘‘To theBasque,’’ says Douglas, ‘‘ritual is order and order isritual.’’18Douglas captures only one extreme in the range ofpossible deaths. Putting the accent on the routineaspects of ritual conveniently conceals the agony ofsuch unexpected early deaths as parents losing agrown child or a mother dying in childbirth. Con-cealed in such descriptions are the agonies of thesurvivors who muddle through shifting, powerfulemotional states. Although Douglas acknowledgesthe distinction between the bereaved members ofthe deceased’s domestic group and the more publicritualistic group, he writes his account primarilyfrom the viewpoint of the latter. He masks theemotional force of bereavement by reducing funer-ary ritual to orderly routine.Surely, human beings mourn both in ritual settingsandin the informal settings of everyday life. Considerthe evidence that willy-nilly spills over the edges inGodfrey Wilson’s classic anthropological account of‘‘conventions of burial’’ among the Nyakyusa of SouthAfrica:That some at least of those who attend a Nyakyusaburial are moved by grief it is easy to establish. I haveheard people talking regretfully in ordinary conversa-tion of a man’s death; I have seen a man whose sisterhad just died walk over alone towards her grave andweep quietly by himself without any parade of grief;and I have heard of a man killing himself because of hisgrief for a dead son.19Note that all the instances Wilson witnesses or hearsabout happen outside the circumscribed sphere offormal ritual. People converse among themselves,walk alone and silently weep, or more impulsivelycommit suicide. The work of grieving, probablyuniversally, occurs both within obligatory ritualacts and in more everyday settings where peoplefind themselves alone or with close kin.In Nyakyusa burial ceremonies, powerful emo-tional states also become present in the ritual itself,which is more than a series of obligatory acts. Mensay they dance the passions of their bereavement,which includes a complex mix of anger, fear, andgrief:‘‘This war dance (ukukina),’’ said an old man, ‘‘ismourning, we are mourning the dead man. Wedance because there is war in our hearts. A passion ofgrief and fear exasperates us (ilyyojo likutusila).’’ . . .Elyojomeans a passion or grief, anger or fear;ukusilameans to annoy or exasperate beyond endurance. Inexplainingukusilaone man put it like this: ‘‘If a mancontinually insults me then he exasperates me (ukusila)so that I want to fight him.’’ Death is a fearful andgrievous event that exasperates those men nearly con-cerned and makes them want to fight.20Descriptions of the dance and subsequent quarrels,even killings, provide ample evidence of the emo-tional intensity involved. The articulate testimony byWilson’s informants makes it obvious that even themost intense sentiments can be studied by ethnog-raphers.Despite such exceptions as Wilson, the generalrule seems to be that one should tidy things up asmuch as possible by wiping away the tears andignoring the tantrums. Most anthropological studiesof death eliminate emotions by assuming the positionof the most detached observer.21Such studies usuallyconflate the ritual process with the process ofmourning, equate ritual with the obligatory, andignore the relation between ritual and everydaylife. The bias that favors formal ritual risks assumingthe answers to questions that most need to be asked.Do rituals, for example, always reveal culturaldepth?Most analysts who equate death with funeraryritual assume that rituals store encapsulated wisdomas if it were a microcosm of its encompassing culturalmacrocosm. One recent study of death andmourning, for example, confidently begins byaffirming that rituals embody ‘‘the collective wisdomof many cultures.’’22Yet this generalization surelyrequires case-by-case investigation against a broaderrange of alternative hypotheses.At the polar extremes, rituals either display cul-tural depth or brim over with platitudes. In theformer case, rituals indeed encapsulate a culture’swisdom; in the latter instance, they act as catalyststhat precipitate processes whose unfolding occursover subsequent months or even years. Many rituals,of course, do both by combining a measure ofwisdom with a comparable dose of platitudes.Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:13am page 173Renato Rosaldo173"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"My own experience of bereavement and ritualfits the platitudes and catalyst model better thanthat of microcosmic deep culture. Even a carefulanalysis of the language and symbolic actionduring the two funerals for which I was a chiefmourner would reveal precious little about the ex-perience of bereavement.23This statement, ofcourse, should not lead anyone to derive a universalfrom somebody else’s personal knowledge. Instead,it should encourage ethnographers to ask whether aritual’s wisdom is deep or conventional, and whetherits process is immediately transformative or but asingle step in a lengthy series of ritual and everydayevents.In attempting to grasp the cultural force of rageand other powerful emotional states, both formalritual and the informal practices of everyday lifeprovide crucial insight. Thus, cultural descriptionsshould seek out force as well as thickness, and theyshould extend from well-defined rituals to myriadless circumscribed practices.Grief, Rage, and Ilongot HeadhuntingWhen applied to Ilongot headhunting, the view ofritual as a storehouse of collective wisdom alignsheadhunting with expiatory sacrifice. The raiderscall the spirits of the potential victims, bid theirritual farewells, and seek favorable omens along thetrail. Ilongot men vividly recall the hunger anddeprivation they endure over the days and evenweeks it takes to move cautiously toward the placewhere they set up an ambush and await the firstperson who happens along. Once the raiders killtheir victim, they toss away the head rather thankeep it as a trophy. In tossing away the head, theyclaim by analogy to cast away their life burdens,including the rage in their grief.Before a raid, men describe their state of being bysaying that the burdens of life have made them heavyand entangled, like a tree with vines clinging to it.They say that a successfully completed raid makesthem feel light of step and ruddy in complexion. Thecollective energy of the celebration with its song,music, and dance reportedly gives the participants asense of well-being. The expiatory ritual processinvolves cleansing and catharsis.The analysis just sketched regards ritual as a time-less, self-contained process. Without denying theinsight in this approach, its limits must also beconsidered. Imagine, for example, exorcism ritualsdescribed as if they were complete in themselves,rather than being linked with larger processesunfolding before and after the ritual period. Throughwhat processes does the afflicted person recover orcontinue to be afflicted after the ritual? What are thesocial consequences of recovery or its absence? Fail-ure to consider such questions diminishes the forceof such afflictions and therapies for which the formalritual is but a phase. Still other questions apply todifferently positioned subjects, including the personafflicted, the healer, and the audience. In all cases,the problem involves the delineation of processesthat occur before and after, as well as during, theritual moment.Let us call the notion of a self-contained sphere ofdeep cultural activity themicrocosmic view, and analternative viewritual as a busy intersection. In thelatter case, ritual appears as a place where a numberof distinct social processes intersect. The crossroadssimply provides a space for distinct trajectories totraverse, rather than containing them in completeencapsulated form. From this perspective, Ilongotheadhunting stands at the confluence of three analyt-ically separable processes.The first process concerns whether or not itis an opportune time to raid. Historical conditionsdetermine the possibilities of raiding, which rangefrom frequent to likely to unlikely to impossible.These conditions include American colonial effortsat pacification, the Great Depression, World War II,revolutionary movements in the surrounding low-lands, feuding among Ilongot groups, and thedeclaration of martial law in 1972. Ilongots use theanalogy of hunting to speak of such historical vicissi-tudes. Much as Ilongot huntsmen say they cannotknow when game will cross their path or whethertheir arrows will strike the target, so certain histor-ical forces that condition their existence remainbeyond their control. My bookIlongot Headhunting,1883–1974explores the impact of historical factorson Ilongot headhunting.Second, young men coming of age undergo aprotracted period of personal turmoil duringRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:13am page 174Grief and a Headhunter’s Rage174"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"which they desire nothing so much as to take a head.During this troubled period, they seek a life partnerand contemplate the traumatic dislocation of leavingtheir families of origin and entering their new wife’shousehold as a stranger. Young men weep, sing, andburst out in anger because of their fierce desire totake a head and wear the coveted red hornbillearrings that adorn the ears of men who alreadyhave, as Ilongots say, arrived (tabi). Volatile, envi-ous, passionate (at least according to their owncultural stereotype of the young unmarried man[buintaw]), they constantly lust to take a head. Mich-elle and I began fieldwork among the Ilongots only ayear after abandoning our unmarried youths; henceour ready empathy with youthful turbulence. Herbook on Ilongot notions of self explores the passion-ate anger of young men as they come of age.Third, older men are differently positioned thantheir younger counterparts. Because they have al-ready beheaded somebody, they can wear the redhornbill earrings so coveted by youths. Their desireto headhunt grows less from chronic adolescentturmoil than from more intermittent acute agoniesof loss. After the death of somebody to whom theyare closely attached, older men often inflict onthemselves vows of abstinence, not to be lifteduntil the day they participate in a successful head-hunting raid. These deaths can cover a range ofinstances from literal death, whether through naturalcauses or beheading, to social death where, forexample, a man’s wife runs off with another man.In all cases, the rage born of devastating loss animatesthe older men’s desire to raid. This anger at aban-donment is irreducible in that nothing at a deeperlevel explains it. Although certain analysts argueagainst the dreaded last analysis, the linkage ofgrief, rage, and headhunting has no other knownexplanation.My earlier understandings of Ilongot headhuntingmissed the fuller significance of how older menexperience loss and rage. Older men prove criticalin this context because they, not the youths, set theprocesses of headhunting in motion. Their rage isintermittent, whereas that of youths is continuous.In the equation of headhunting, older men are thevariable and younger men are the constant. Cultur-ally speaking, older men are endowed with know-ledge and stamina that their juniors have not yetattained, hence they care for (saysay) and lead(bukur) the younger men when they raid.In a preliminary survey of the literature on head-hunting. I found that the lifting of mourning prohib-itions frequently occurs after taking a head. Thenotion that youthful anger and older men’s ragelead them to take heads is more plausible than suchcommonly reported ‘‘explanations’’ of headhuntingas the need to acquire mystical ‘‘soul stuff’’ or per-sonal names.24Because the discipline correctlyrejects stereotypes of the ‘‘bloodthirsty savage,’’ itmust investigate how headhunters create an intensedesire to decapitate their fellow humans. The humansciences must explore the cultural force of emotionswith a view to delineating the passions that animatecertain forms of human conduct.SummaryThe ethnographer, as a positioned subject, graspscertain human phenomena better than others. Heor she occupies a position or structural location andobserves with a particular angle of vision. Consider,for example, how age, gender, being an outsider, andassociation with a neo-colonial regime influence whatthe ethnographer learns. The notion of position alsorefers to how life experiences both enable and inhibitparticular kinds of insight. In the case at hand, noth-ing in my own experience equipped me even toimagine the anger possible in bereavement untilafter Michelle Rosaldo’s death in 1981. Only thenwas I in a position to grasp the force of what Ilongotshad repeatedly told me about grief, rage, and head-hunting. By the same token, so-called natives are alsopositioned subjects who have a distinctive mix ofinsight and blindness. Consider the structural pos-itions of older versus younger Ilongot men, or thediffering positions of chief mourners versus those lessinvolved during a funeral. My discussion of anthro-pological writings on death often achieved its effectssimply by shifting from the position of those leastinvolved to that of the chief mourners.Cultural depth does not always equal culturalelaboration. Think simply of the speaker who isfilibustering. The language used can sound elaborateas it heaps word on word, but surely it is not deep.Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:13am page 175Renato Rosaldo175"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Depth should be separated from the presence orabsence of elaboration. By the same token, one-lineexplanations can be vacuous or pithy. The concept offorce calls attention to an enduring intensity inhuman conduct that can occur with or without thedense elaboration conventionally associated with cul-tural depth. Although relatively without elaborationin speech, song, or ritual, the rage of older Ilongotmen who have suffered devastating losses provesenormously consequential in that, foremost amongother things, it leads them to behead their fellowhumans. Thus, the notion of force involves bothaffective intensity and significant consequences thatunfold over a long period of time.Similarly, rituals do not always encapsulate deepcultural wisdom. At times they instead contain thewisdom of Polonius. Although certain rituals bothreflect and create ultimate values, others simplybring people together and deliver a set of platitudesthat enable them to go on with their lives. Ritualsserve as vehicles for processes that occur both beforeand after the period of their performance. Funeralrituals, for example, do not ‘‘contain’’ all the com-plex processes of bereavement. Ritual and bereave-ment should not be collapsed into one anotherbecause they neither fully encapsulate nor fully ex-plain one another. Instead, rituals are often butpoints along a number of longer processual trajec-tories; hence, my image of ritual as a crossroadswhere distinct life processes intersect.25The notion of ritual as a busy intersectionanticipates the critical assessment of the concept ofculture developed in the following chapters. In con-trast with the classic view, which posits culture as aself-contained whole made up of coherent patterns,culture can arguably be conceived as a more porousarray of intersections where distinct processes criss-cross from within and beyond its borders. Suchheterogeneous processes often derive from differ-ences of age, gender, class, race, and sexual orienta-tion.This book argues that a sea change in culturalstudies has eroded once-dominant conceptions oftruth and objectivity. The truth of objectivism –absolute, universal, and timeless – has lost its mon-opoly status. It now competes, on more nearly equalterms, with the truths of case studies that are em-bedded in local contexts, shaped by local interests,and colored by local perceptions. The agenda forsocial analysis has shifted to include not only eternalverities and lawlike generalizations but also politicalprocesses, social changes, and human differences.Such terms asobjectivity, neutrality, andimpartialityrefer to subject positions once endowed with greatinstitutional authority, but they are arguably neithermore nor less valid than those of more engaged, yetequally perceptive, knowledgeable social actors.Social analysis must now grapple with the realizationthat its objects of analysis are also analyzing subjectswho critically interrogate ethnographers – theirwritings, their ethics, and their politics.NOTESAn earlier version of this chapter appeared as ‘‘Grief anda Headhunter’s Rage: On the Cultural Force of Emo-tions,’’ inText, Play, and Story: The Construction and Recon-struction of Self and Society, ed. Edward M. Bruner(Washington, DC: American Ethnological Society,1984), pp. 178–95.1 In contrasting Moroccan and Javanese forms of mysti-cism, Clifford Geertz found it necessary to distinguishthe ‘‘force’’ of cultural patterning from its ‘‘scope’’(Clifford Geertz,Islam Observed[New Haven, Conn.:Yale University Press, 1968]). He distinguished forcefrom scope in this manner: ‘‘By ‘force’ I mean thethoroughness with which such a pattern is internalizedin the personalities of the individuals who adopt it, itscentrality or marginality in their lives’’ (p. 111). ‘‘By‘scope,’ on the other hand, I mean the range of socialcontexts within which religious considerations areregarded as having more or less direct relevance’’ (p.112). Inhislaterworks,Geertzdevelopedthenotionofscope more than that of force. Unlike Geertz, whoemphasizes processes of internalization within individ-ual personalities, my use of the termforcestresses theconcept of the positioned subject.2 Anthropologists havelong studied thevocabularyof theemotions in other cultures (see, e.g., Hildred Geertz,‘‘The Vocabulary of Emotion: A Study of JavaneseSocialization Processes,’’Psychiatry22 (1959): 225–37).

Clifford Geertz, for example, depicts Javanesefunerals as follows: ‘‘The mood of a Javanese funeralis not one of hysterical bereavement, unrestrainedsobbing, or even of formalized cries of grief for thedeceased’s departure. Rather, it is a calm, undemon-strative, almost languid letting go, a brief ritualizedrelinquishment of a relationship no longer possible’’(Geertz,The Interpretation of Cultures, p. 153). Incross-cultural perspective, the anger in grief presentsitself in different degrees (including zero), in differ-ent forms, and with different consequences.13 The Ilongot notion of anger (liget) is regarded asdangerous in its violent excesses, but also as life-enhancing in that, for example, it provides energy forwork.

I posed the question in twoways. I asked a general question: ‘‘Why do somany babies die on the Alto do Cruzeiro?’’ Then inthe course of recording personal reproductive his-tories, I asked each woman to tell me at length aboutthe circumstances surrounding each child’s death,including her perception of the baby’s key symp-toms, the various steps she took to remedy theillness, and her understanding of the cause of thedeath. The two questions elicited very differentanswers.In response to the general question on the inci-dence and causes of high child mortality in the com-munity, Alto women were quick to reply with blanketcondemnations of the hostile environment in whichthey and their children were forced to live and die.They responded:‘‘Our children die because we are poor andhungry.’’‘‘They die because the water we drink is filthywith germs.’’‘‘They die because we cannot afford to keep shoeson their feet.’’‘‘They die because we get worthless medicalcare.’’‘‘They die of neglect.

Their stomachs when they areround and full give one such pleasure! But somethingis wrong with the food we give them. No matter howmuch we feed them, they lose their fat and turn intotoothpicks. It makes one discouraged.’’Still another could identify the exact problem andits remedy: ‘‘They die from the miserableengano[ruse] ofpapa d’a ́gua. Babies need food to live.Most older babies require at least two cans [fourhundred grams each] of powdered milk a week.But people here can afford only one can, and so thebabies are fed mostly on water. Soon their bloodturns to water as well. Money would solve all ourproblems.’’Many others agreed with her: ‘‘Here on the Altothere are a multitude of children who live in neglect,eating garbage that other people leave behind,sucking on banana skins and on orange peels. It’sbecause their parents don’t earn enough to feedthem, and the only solution is to set the childrenout on the streets.’’In short, Alto mothers gave highly politicizedanswers to the question of child mortality in general,ones that stressed the external constraints on theability to care for their offspring. But when thesesame women were asked to explain why any oftheirownchildren died, their answers were more clinical,and the causes of death were seen as more proxim-ate, sometimes asinternalto the child. Often thedead infant was judged as lacking a vital life force, hisor her own ‘‘will’’ to live. And not a single Altomother stated that hunger was the cause of death forany of her own children, although many of the deadbabies were described as having ‘‘wasted’’ or‘‘withered’’ away, ‘‘shriveled up,’’ or ‘‘shrunk tonothing.’’ In response to what may have caused aparticular infant to ‘‘waste away,’’ Alto womenoften replied that the baby was born with a ‘‘fragile,’’‘‘nervous,’’ or ‘‘weak’’ constitution. Hunger, itseemed, only killed Alto children in the abstract. Itmay killyourchildren (perhaps) but not any of mine.It may be that Alto mothers had to exercise a certainamount of denial because the alternative – the rec-ognition that one’s own child is slowly starving todeath – is too painful or, given the role that motherssometimes play in reducing food and liquid (seechapter 8), too rife with psychological conflict.Alto women distinguished between child deathsviewed as ‘‘natural’’ (coming from God or fromnature) and those suspected to be caused by sorcery,evil eye, and magical possession. They attributedmost of their own children’s deaths to natural causes,especially to communicable diseases. But the womenalso explained child deaths in terms of failures inproper nurturing, including disregard for the normal‘‘lying-in’’ precautions for mother and newborn,mortal forms of neglect, and strong and passionateemotions. Table 16.1 gives a very condensedrendering of Alto mother’s perceptions of themajor pathogens affecting the lives of their offspring.Alto mothers considered simple diarrhea thegreatest single killer of their babies, carrying away71 of the 255 children who died. But more ‘‘com-plex’’ and complicated forms of diarrhea were alsoimplicated in the folk categorydoenc ̧a de crianc ̧a,‘‘child sickness,’’ and in some cases ofdentic ̧a ̃o(teething illness),gasto(wasting illness),susto(frightsickness), andfraqueza(general weakness and debil-ity). Were we to include all the folk pediatric diag-noses in which diarrhea was at least a secondarysymptom, then as many as 189 of the 255 deaths,74 percent of all infant and child deaths on the Alto,could be attributed to diarrhea. Mothers distin-guished among many different subtypes (qualidades)of infant diarrhea (e.g.,intestino, quentura, barrigadesmantelada), based on color, consistency, smell,and force of the stools. Mothers saved the dirtynappies of their ailing babies to discuss the differen-tial diagnoses with neighbors and elderly healingwomen of the Alto. In all, mothers recognized theseverity of this disease in particular as a primarychild-killer on the Alto. Among the other commu-nicable diseases commonly cited by mothers were (inorder of importance) measles, pneumonia and otherrespiratory ailments, infant jaundice, tetanus, fevers,whooping cough, smallpox, and other skin diseasesand infections.Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:13ampage 180Death Without Weeping180"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Underlying and uniting these diverse etiologicalnotions were the same structural principles thatinformed Alto people’s beliefs about the ‘‘nervous’’body. Here, once again, life was conceptualized as aluta, a power ‘‘struggle’’ between large and small,strong and weak. Infants were born both ‘‘weak’’ and‘‘hot’’; their tiny systems were easily overwhelmed.Poor infants were already compromised in the womb.Born (as the women said) of prematurely aged fatherswhose blood was ‘‘sick and wasted’’ and whose semenwas ‘‘tired’’ and of mothers whose breasts offeredblood and infection instead of rich milk, it is littlewonder that Alto babies were described as born‘‘already thirsty and starving in the womb,’’ as‘‘bruised and discolored,’’ their ‘‘tongues swollen intheir mouths.’’The babies of the rich were described as cominginto the world fat and fair and ‘‘greedy’’ for life.They emerged from the womb with a lusty cry. Thebabies of the Alto, ‘‘poor things,’’ came out ofthe womb ‘‘like wet little birds, barely chirping’’and with a ‘‘nausea’’ for food. ‘‘Our babies,’’ I wasoften told, were ‘‘born alreadywantingto die.’’Although few Alto mothers could give me theaccurate birth weights of their offspring, their de-scriptions of ‘‘skinny,’’ ‘‘wasted,’’ ‘‘pale,’’ ‘‘quiet’’newborns, infants who came into theworldwith nogosto(taste) for life and no will to suckle,seemed very much the descriptions of preterm andlow-birth-weight infants, babies all too aptly de-scribed by Alto women as born already ‘‘disadvan-taged.’’1What mothers expectantly looked for in theirnewborn infants were qualities that showed a readi-ness for the uphill struggle that was life. And so Altomothers expressed a preference for those babies whoevidenced early on the physical, psychological, andsocial characteristics of fighters and survivors.Active, quick, responsive, and playful infants weremuch preferred to quiet, docile, inactive infants,infants described as ‘‘dull,’’ ‘‘listless,’’ and spiritless.Although differences in infant temperament werebelieved to be innate, in a precarious environmentsuch as the Alto parasitic infection, malnutrition, anddehydration reproduced these same traits in a greatmany infants. A particularly lethal form of negativefeedback sometimes resulted when Alto mothersgradually withdrew from listless infants whose ‘‘pas-sivity’’ was the result of hunger itself.Conversely, for an Alto mother to say proudly of achild that she or he suffered many ‘‘crises’’ during thefirst year of life but ‘‘conquered’’ or ‘‘endured’’ thestruggle was a mother’s fondest testimony to somehidden inner strength or drive within the child.

The infant was quickly ‘‘spent,’’ ‘‘wasted,’’used up; her fight and her vital energy were gone.[...]Angel-Babies: The Velo ́rio de AnjinhosIf he died at this angelic age, the small child became an objectof adoration. The mother rejoiced over the death of theangel . . . weeping with delight because the Lord had carriedaway her fifth child.Gilberto Freyre (1986a:58)From colonial Brazil to the present the death of aninfant or a very young child was treated as a blessingamong the popular classes, an event ‘‘to be acceptedalmost joyfully, at any rate without horror’’ (Freyre1986b:144). The dead baby was ananjinho, a ‘‘littlecherub,’’ or aninocente, a ‘‘blameless creature’’ whodied unregretted because his or her future happinesswas assured. The bodies of the little angels werewashed, their curls were prettily arranged, andthey were dressed in sky blue or white shirts, withthe cord of the Virgin tied around their waists. Theirlittle hands folded in prayerful repose, their eyes leftopen and expectantly awaiting the Beatific Vision,angel-babies were covered with wild flowers, includ-ing floral wreaths on their heads. Little petitionprayers and messages to the saints were tucked intotheir hands to be delivered to the Virgin on arrival.Even the poorest were arranged on wooden planksladen with flowers or in large, decorated cardboardboxes ‘‘of the kind used for men’s shirts’’ (Freyre1986b:388). Thevelo ́rio de anjinhowas immortalizedin Euclides da Cunha’s classic,Rebellion in the Back-lands:‘‘The death of a child is a holiday. In the hut thepoor parents’ guitars twang joyfully amid the tears;the noisy, passionate samba is danced again and thequatrains of the poetic challengers loudly resound;while at one side, between two tallow candles,wreathed in flowers, the dead infant is laid out,reflecting in its last smile, fixed in death, the su-preme contentment of one who is going back toheaven and eternal bliss’’ (1944:113).The festive celebration of angel wakes, derivedfrom the Iberian Peninsula, has been noted through-out Latin America from the Andes of Peru tothe pampas of Argentina to the tropical coastalregions of Brazil and Colombia (see Foster1960:143–166; Schechter 1983, 1988; Belote andBelote 1984; Dominguez 1960; Lenz 1953). It isfound among Amerindians, blacks, whites, andcri-ollosand among the wealthy as well as the poor.Roger Bastide attributed the angel wake customs tothe introduction of the ‘‘baroque’’ in Brazil, whereasFreyre (1986b:388) suggested that the Jesuits intro-ducedanjinhobeliefs to console native women forthe alarming death rate of Indian children resultingfrom colonization.All-night drinking, feasting, party games, court-ing rituals, special musical performances, and dancescross many culture areas in South America, wherethe infant wake may last for three or four consecutivedays (Schechter 1983). Weeping is proscribed at theinfant wake because a mother’s tears make the angel-baby’s path slippery and dampen its delicate wings(Nations and Rebhun 1988). Rather, the mother isexpected to express her joy, as did the plantationmistress from Rio de Janeiro who exclaimed, ‘‘Oh,how happy I am! Oh, how happy I am! When I dieand go to the gates of Heaven I shall not fail ofadmittance, for there will be five little childrenpressing toward me, pulling at my skirts, and saying,‘Oh, mother, do come in, do come in’’’ (Freyre1986b:388). In rural Venezuela, the mother of thedead baby generally opens the dancing at her child’swake so that her angel may rise happily to thekingdom of heaven (Dominguez 1960:31).The body of the dead infant was fetishized duringtraditional angel wakes in rural Latin America. Thelittle corpose was sometimes taken out of the tinycoffin and handled like a doll or live baby. The corpsecould be displayed like a saint, propped up on a homealtar in between candlesticks and vases of sweet-smelling flowers. Or the dead child might be seatedin a little chair, elevated on a small platform, set upinside an open box, tied to a ladder placed on top ofRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:13ampage 182Death Without Weeping182"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"the casket (to suggest the angel’s ascent into heaven),or even tied to a swing suspended on ropes from thehouse beam. The infant’s flight on the swing was saidto symbolize the baby’s transformation into an angel.The custom of leasing out angel-corpses to enlivenlocal fiestas was described for the late nineteenththrough the twentieth centuries in the Argentinepampas as well as in Venezuela, Chile, and Ecuador(see Ebelot 1943; Lillo 1942). In all, the traditionalinfant wake was a grand pretext for ‘‘unbridledmerry-making,’’ perhaps (some suggested) as a cul-turally institutionalized ‘‘defense’’ against grief andmourning in a context in which infant death was alltoo common.But what of a situation where neither festive joynor deep grief is present? My own startlingly differ-ent ethnographic observations of angel-babies andthevelo ́rio de anjinhoin Bom Jesus today lead me toanother set of conclusions, which I must touch on asa prelude to my final discussion of mother love,attachment, grief, and moral thinking. In BomJesus today, where an angel-baby is sent to heavenon the average of one every other day, infant wakesare brief, rarely lasting more than a couple hours,and dispensed with a minimum of ceremony. Thevelo ́rioof an infant younger than one is at bestperfunctory. There are no musical accompaniments,no songs, no prayers, no ritual performances of anykind. Neither food nor drink is offered the casualvisitor, most of them curious neighborhood children.Household life simply goes on as usual around theinfant in her or his little casket, which may be placedon the kitchen table or across one or two straight-backed kitchen chairs. The infant’s grandmother orgodmother is in charge, in addition to the olderwoman who specializes in preparing the body forburial. There is neither great joy nor grief expressed,and the infant is rarely the focus of conversation.I recall one particularly poignant infant wake thattook place in an Alto household in 1987 on the dayfollowing the celebration of the one-year-old birth-day party and formal christening of another child ofthe household. Mariana, the middle-aged mother ofthe one-year-oldcac ̧ula, had purchased christeningclothes, a large decorative birthday cake withcandles, soft drinks, a wine punch for the adults,balloons, and party favors. The frosted cake was thecenterpiece, and Mariana was quite protective of it,frequently brushing away flies that gathered near itand more than once dusting away a persistent pro-cession of little ants. A borrowed record player wasturned up loud; samba and lambada music blastedinto the main street of the Alto, and the dancingspilled outside of the tiny house. The fiesta lasted forthe better part of that Sunday afternoon and earlyevening. The little birthday girl in her ruffled dresswas the center of a great deal of praise and attention.Meanwhile,Mariana’soldest,sixteen-year-olddaughter, herself the single mother of a four-month-old infant, sat out the festivities very muchon the margins. Her boyfriend was nowhere inevidence. To engage and entertain the girl a bit, Iasked if I might take a peek at her baby. She broughtme into the back room where her infant, in anadvanced stage of marasmic malnutrition, had beenleft to sleep through the party. She slept very deeply,indeed, for the next morning I was called back forher brief, understated wake and burial.The young mother sat in the front room repairinga fishing net. The grandmother’s only comment wasthe usualmoradorawords of consolation: ‘‘Manmakes; God takes.’’ The ‘‘snowball baby’’ in herwhite tunic, decoratively strewn with sweet forget-me-nots, took the place of the birthday cake as thecenterpiece on the table in the front room. A fewcrumbs of cake and frosting left over from the daybefore were still on the table, and a couple ofdeflated pink balloons lolled about on the mudfloor. The crepe paper decorations were still inplace. The previous day’s little birthday girl seemedconfused by the muted and ambivalent sentiments sosoon after her own animated party, and she was fussyand demanding, insisting to be lifted up to see herinfant niece. Finally, Mariana carried the child overto the table and let her peek inside the little casket.‘‘Baby, baby,’’ said the toddler. ‘‘Yes,’’ repeated hertired mother, ‘‘baby is sleeping,’’ and as Marianaleaned over to adjust the infant in her little cardboardpauper’s coffin, I saw her hand once again, almostinstinctively, brush away a line of ants, but this timefrom the infant’s frosted, white face.Men are rarely present at avelo ́rio de anjinho.Female relatives, neighbor women, and childrenoften mill about. Meanwhile, however, the womenRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:13ampage 183Nancy Scheper-Hughes183"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"and young girls of the household often go about theirregular housework. They wash clothes at the back ofthe house, sort beans in preparation for the mainmeal, and do piecework for the local hammockindustry, while the children do homework, playcheckers, cut out paper dolls, or read comic bookson the floor.The procession of the angels to the cemetery isformed on the spur of the moment from the childrenwho happen to be present. No special clothes areworn. There may or may not be a small floral wreathcarried in front of the ragtag little parade. Someadults, but never the infant’s own mother, mayfollow the procession to the graveyard. On oneoccasion the father, godfather, and paternal grand-father attended the funeral of a firstborn child, andall were deeply and visibly affected. On anotheroccasion the godfather (and uncle to the deadchild) followed the children’s procession at somedistance while walking his bicycle. Although hecame as far as the graveyard, before the baby wasput into the grave, the godfather left to attend apreviously scheduled soccer game.The procession of the angels takes the main, andonly paved, street of the Alto, but once at the foot ofthe hill it veers away from the mainprac ̧aof town andbypasses the church of Nossa Senhora das Dores. Theprocession does not stop (as it once did) for thepriest’s blessing; consequently, the bells of OurLady of Sorrows no longer toll for the death ofeach child of Bom Jesus da Mata. That way ofcounting the dead has gone the way of many otherfolk Catholic pieties, swept away by the reformistspirit of the Vatican Council and by the socialistphilosophy of the new regime of liberation theology.And no priest accompanies the procession to thecemetery, where the body is disposed of casuallyand unceremonially. Children bury children in BomJesus da Mata today. Where once clergymen andreligious sisters taught patience and resignation tochild death and other domestic tragedies, whichwere said to reveal the imponderable workings ofGod’s will, the new church participates in the publicindifference and social embarrassment toward infantdeath, which exists only as a bloody breech, a rup-ture with, and a glaring contradiction to the hier-archy’s prolife and pronatalist teachings. So insteadof the churchprac ̧ain the dead center of Bom Jesus,the procession of the angels discreetly passes throughthe back streets of town, under the trestles of therailroad or across the tracks, through the open-airyam market, past the rural sugar workers syndicatebuilding, just under the barred windows of themunicipal jail, close to the edge of the new reformschool for abandoned street children run by theFEBEM, and up the muddy trail to the municipalcemetery at the farthest edge of town. The childrenknow the route by heart; most have been partof other processions to bury dead siblings or play-mates’ siblings. The procession shares the streetwith cars, trucks, donkeys, wagons, and carts.Most cars and trucks hurriedly whiz by, and thechildren have to run to the side of the road withtheir little charge.At the cemetery Seu Valdimar, the disabled andoften ill-tempered municipal gravedigger and anassistant lead the children to the common spacewhere pauper children are buried. The temporaryspace is normally already waiting, and in a fewminutes the coffin is placed in the grave and coveredover, thereby leaving a small, fresh mound to markthe space. No prayers are recited, and no sign of thecross is made as the coffin goes into its shallow grave.Valdimar often chides the children for one reason oranother. It may be that the coffin is larger thanexpected, and he will have to enlarge the grave.Or he may scold the children for not tacking closedthe top of the coffin, although he surely knowswell the customs of the region. ‘‘Didn’t youhave any nails, any tacks?’’ he asked the brother ofone deceased child. ‘‘Soon the bugs will get to yourlittle sister,’’ he said unnecessarily. Other times Val-dimar can be gentle with the children, in his owngruff way.‘‘Have you any flowers?’’ Valdimar once asked theolder sister of a little toddler who had just beenburied. ‘‘No,’’ she shook her head sadly. ‘‘Well,hurry up and get some, then . . . I haven’t all day.’’Permission granted, the children scampered off inopposite directions to pull up flowers from otherfresh graves. ‘‘Notthatmany; be careful,’’ yelledValdimar. And the children returned to scatter thepicked flowers on top of the little one’s grave.

I have seen a grandfather gather thechildren into a small shop and carefully count out hisfew, wrinkled cruzados and negotiate quietly withthe shopkeeper so that every child in the processioncould have two pieces of hard candy. He himselfcarefully distributed the sweets, two by two toeach child, a sad, gentle smile on his face.I have tried to imagine, working slowly, intui-tively, and unobtrusively with the people of theAlto and with women and children in particular,what meaning the angel-baby and thevelo ́rio deanjinhohas for them. At times it seems as if thedead infant were a ‘‘transitional object’’ for thewomen of the Alto, not only in the ritual, anthropo-logical sense of a liminal being in between socialstatuses (‘‘Neither here nor there,’’ as one mothersaid of her dying infant) but in the psychoanalyticsense of a liminal, transitional ‘‘attachment’’ (as to ateddy bear or a ‘‘rubby’’ blanket), which, created outof the imagination, has a self-soothing quality (seeWinnicott 1964:167–72).Anjinhosallow Altomothers to ‘‘let go’’ of so many of their youngchildren by allowing them to ‘‘hold on’’ to an ideal-ized image of spirit-children populating the heavens,as close, really, as the stars can seem on a still night.All transitional objects ultimately foster autonomyand independence through the breaking or thebreaking out of ‘‘impossible’’ attachments (as ininfancy the ‘‘rubby blanket’’ or teddy bear substitutesfor the ‘‘impossible’’ desire to have mother’s breastavailable at will). Just so, for Alto women,anjinhosinheaven substitute for the impossible attachment tohalf-live babies in the hammock.The shaping of the emotions and responses atchild death is formed in early childhood as Altochildren, mere babies themselves, are schooled inthe normalization of child death as they are sooner orlater delegated the role of their dead siblings’ andplaymates’ pallbearers and undertakers. The averageAlto girl between the ages of five and thirteen par-ticipates in two or more angel processions each year.The average boy participates in at least one a year.One notes, in the reactions and fantasy play of Altochildren, the awesome power of these early ‘‘primalscenes’’ in shaping, routinizing, and muting lateradult responses to child death.Many little girls on the Alto do Cruzeiro have nobaby dolls to play with. Nor do they tend to fashionthem out of available scrap materials, such as tornsocks or the corn husks discarded on the main streetsafterfeirain the harvest months of June and July. Nordo they fashion dolls and play furniture from the redclay that is commonly found not far from the banks ofthe local river. Alto girls prefer active games, circledances, and pretend ‘‘talent shows’’ in which theycan imitate the beautiful and seductive children’stelevision star, Xuxa. Girls covet the cheap, plasticsoccer balls that any of their older brothers are luckyenough to own. Playing with dolls and playing houseare of little interest to Alto girls. I soon learned tobring costume jewelry, hair ribbons, play cosmetics,and small, battery-run video games as gifts for Altogirls and to leave at home the pretty little baby dolls,which elicited so little interest or curiosity. In a halfdozen of the more prosperous Alto homes where thechildren have an abundance of toys, girls are givendolls as presents, but these are treated as display,rather than play, objects and are often kept in theoriginal cellophane-covered boxes standing up on ashelf and are taken down for visitors to admire andare then carefully replaced.I am tempted to suggest why Alto children are souninterested in a form of play that is so commonamong little girls the world over. This lack of interestis born, perhaps, of an early and negative associationbetween lifeless dolls in pretty cardboard boxes andlifeless siblings in decorated cardboard coffins. Thispossibility was brought home to me during a conver-sation with Xiquinha, the elderly praying woman ofthe Alto, who had been washing and dressing deadchildren for their angel wakes since she was sevenand a half. In the following conversation, Xiquinhaexplained how she became a specialist in angel wakesat so tender an age.‘‘Whenever a baby died on the Rua dos Sapos,where I had been raised since I was a tiny child, aneighbor would call for me because I always enjoyeddressing the baby for its wake.

But not me; I adored it all.I would take the baby on my lap across my knees,and it wasjust like a little doll for me to play with.Little angel-bodies are different from [dead] bigbodies. Angel-bodies stay soft and flexible, so youcan handle them easily. I would wash it and put onits blue or white clothes and a veil for the little girlsand, if their mother had one, a blue ribbon aroundtheir waist. All little angel-girls are dressed likelittle brides. White is the color of virgins, whichall of them are. When an infant is stillborn, peoplecall it an angel-carobim[i.e., possibly derived fromcherubim] because it is untouched by this world.Blue is the color that the Virgin Mary loves best. Soyou want to have the little angels dressed that waywhen they arrive to greet the Virgin at the gates ofheaven.’’When my Brazilian informants tell me that theydo not weep, that they are pleased to have a littlecorac ̧a ̄o santain heaven looking after them, I aminclined to believe them and to take them at facevalue. In most cases the socialization experience hasbeen adequate. Angel-baby beliefs not only ‘‘con-sole’’moradores, they shape and determine the waythat death is experienced.Once as my then-fifteen-year-old daughter, Jenni-fer, and I were on our way up the Alto to an angelwake near the very top of the hill, Jennifer burst intoangry tears. She was to have been the ‘‘official’’photographer at the wake because the mother ofthe baby was unable to pay for a professional photog-rapher from the town. I had quite insensitivelyoffered Jennifer’s services without asking her per-mission. ‘‘I don’t want to photograph a dead baby,’’she yelled at me, quite reasonably. I apologized andbrought her inside Terezinha’s house along the way tocompose herself. Terezinha and her teenage daughterRosa ́lia were quite concerned. Why was Jennifer soupset? Did she have ‘‘boyfriend troubles’’? Rosa ́liawanted to know. When I explained that she wasupset about having to attend an infant wake, theystared at her unbelievingly. ‘‘Why?’’ they asked. ‘‘It’sonly a baby!’’On only one occasion out of the dozens ofangel wakes and burials that I have witnessed overthe years did a child express a subdued, yet nonethe-less ravaged, grief. It was just as little Mercea’s bodywas going into the dirt that her seven-year-oldcousin, Leonardo, turned to me to say in an anxiousaside: ‘‘Nancı ́, I don’t want any more of mine to die.’’Ashamed, I put aside my camera and my dog-eared,rain-soaked notebook and allowed myself, too, to sitdown on a low marble stone and rediscover and feelpain and grief for a moment: ‘‘I don’t either, Leo-nardo. I don’t either.’’Grief Work: A Political Economy of the EmotionsSorrow concealed, like an oven stopp’d,Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.William Shakespeare,Titus AndronicusAnd so when an infant dies on the Alto do Cruzeiro,few tears are shed, and women are likely to say thatthe death came as a blessing or a great relief. ‘‘I feelfree’’ or ‘‘I feel unburdened’’ is what many say. Thisis not to suggest, however, that the women are‘‘cold’’ and unfeeling, for very often the motherexpresses pity (pena) for the dead child, saying,‘‘Faz pena[what a shame],menina, to see them sufferand die.’’ But pity is distinctly different from thesentiments of grief (desgosto, nojo, luto), sadness (tris-teza), depression (depressa ̃o, deprimida), or bitters-weet longing or yearning for a lost or deadloved one (saudade). And just as there is no immedi-ate display of grief or mourning in many Altomothers, I have found no evidence of ‘‘delayed’’ or‘‘displaced’’ grief in the days, weeks, and monthsfollowing the death of an infant, unless, perhaps, anew pregnancy can be seen as a symptom of dis-placed grief.I made a point of visiting the homes of womenwho had recently lost an infant, both to offer supportand observe their responses to death. What I founddid not conform to the conventional biomedicalwisdom concerning ‘‘normal’’ grieving followingchild death, a model of ‘‘human’’ behavior that is,in part, the creation of a few influential psycholo-gists, among them John Bowlby (1961a, 1961b,1980), Elisabeth Ku ̈bler-Ross (1969), and RobertJay Lifton (1967, 1975, 1979).Several days following the death and burial of herfirst baby, a three-month-old daughter namedRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:13ampage 186Death Without Weeping186"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Daniella, I visited the young mother, Anita, to seehow she was getting along.

I stayed behind to chatwith a few of her neighbors, who confirmed that onedoes not really miss a very young baby.Sometimes, it is more obvious why grief at thedeath of an innocent ‘‘angel’’ is not forthcoming.When Dona Amor received word that her first andonly grandson was born puny and weak to heradopted and mentally disabled teenage daughter,who had been seduced and raped by a pimp, theold woman hurriedly lit a candle to Sa ̃o Antoˆnio, herpatron saint. She begged the saint to carry off theday-old infant, born, she said, of a ‘‘race of beasts.’’Amor’s prayers were answered later that same day.Laughing and clapping her hands, Amor told how shewent to the localcasa funera ́riato pick out the littlecoffin. She carried it to the hospital, where shewashed and dressed the infant in his baptismal/burialclothes. Then jauntily, as if ‘‘it were a basket of fruit,’’Amor put the little casket on her head and started offacross town to the municipal cemetery. When streetchildren laughed to see Dona Amor balancing thelittle coffin on her head in a solitary procession, theold woman shooed them off, saying, ‘‘There is noshame in burying the dead.’’ There was certainly nosorrow either.Against these altogether normative responsesto infant death on the Alto do Cruzeiro are themodern psychiatric theories of ‘‘healthy’’ versus ‘‘dis-ordered’’ mourning, which constitute a hegemonictheory of the emotions. The psychologists and psych-iatrists of mourning (see Freud 1957:244 –5; Bowlby1980; Lifton 1967) consider child death, and infantdeath in particular, to be among the most wrenchingof all experiences of loss, especially for the motherwho may not yet feel herself to be separate from thenewborn. ‘‘Infant deathis,’’ Marshall Klausremarked, ‘‘a kind of death to the self not dissimilarto the loss of a limb’’ (personal communication).Bowlby (1980:113–24) described the phases ofnormalmourning after the death of a young child asfollows: numbing and shock, disbelief, anger, depres-sion, disorganization, and reorganization.Every major hospital today has clinical socialworkers and nurses who specialize in helpingwomen (and men) to grieve the premature death ofan infant. They distribute helpful booklets, such as‘‘Newborn Death’’ (Johnson, Cunningham, Ewing,Hatcher, and Dannen 1982) to the bereaved parents.The advice offered is succinct andverydirect. Itcounsels the parents to ‘‘see, hold, touch, andname your [dead] newborn’’ and stresses the import-ance of the mother’s presence at a graveside serviceand burial (1). Weeping over the death is cast as ahuman right and a necessity: ‘‘We have finally cometo realize that crying is a strength. . . . Remember,you have a right to cry when your baby dies.Allowing your tears to come, while talking to others,can help you move through your grief’’ (4). But thebooklet cautions against taking to heart the ‘‘insensi-tive’’ comments of relatives and friends who may notknow the ‘‘right’’ things to say. Those around mayoffer just the kind of advice and comfort that ‘‘youdon’tneed’’: ‘‘Every parent will hear some well-meaning person say that you can have another baby.You’ll get the ‘don’t cry’ messages, and ‘just forgetabout it’ statements. Some people will act as if yourbaby never existed. Others will act as if you can be alittlesad, but not as much as if your baby were older.It’s as if they think the amount of sadness is somehowconnected to the size of the dead person’’ (8).If the inherent psychological conflicts producedby the loss of an infant or a very young child are notresolved, various pathologies are believed likely tooccur, of which chronic mourning (similar to Freud’snotion of melancholia) or its opposite, a ‘‘prolongedabsence of conscious grieving’’ (Bowlby 1980:139),is common. The absence of grief or the ‘‘inability toRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:13ampage 187Nancy Scheper-Hughes187"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"mourn’’ was first identified by Helene Deutsch(1937) in her clinical practice with women, someof whom were evidently rather ‘‘merry’’ widows.The ‘‘denial’’ of an ‘‘appropriate’’ grief may last,Bowlby wrote, for years, decades, and even insome cases ‘‘for the rest of a person’s life’’(1980:139). The ‘‘disordered mourner’’ may feelrelief and may be quite cheerful and seem welladjusted. Some may even report feelings of reliefand euphoria following the death of a loved one. Butsuch feelings are disallowed and pathologized. Liftonwas direct: ‘‘To be unable to mourn is to be unable toenter into the great human cycle of death and re-birth; it is to be unable to ‘live again’’’ (1975:vii).Those who cannot grieve are scarcely human. This isa weighty moralism, indeed.It strikes me as no coincidence that so much of thepsychological literature on disordered mourningconcernsfemalepatients who appear to be at a‘‘high risk’’ of producing, according to the canonsof psychotherapy, the wrong emotions in response todeath, either too much or too little sadness. In thegrief and mourning literature, as in the attachmentand bonding literature, we are faced with a biomed-ical prescription concerning the womanly duty notonly to marry and procreate but toloveoffspring andmourn the family’s dead. Emotion work is frequentlygendered work. And we may want to considerwhether the psychological theories on maternallove, attachment, grief, and mourning are not a‘‘rhetoric of control’’ (M. Rosaldo 1984) and adiscourse on power ‘‘by other means.’’Catherine Lutz (1988) recently pointed out in thisregard that conventional biomedical theories of emo-tion represent an American ‘‘ethnopsychology’’based on Western notions of mind and body, feelingand reason, nature and culture, self and other, maleand female, and individual and society. Psychother-apy is concerned with fostering emotional expres-sion; with ‘‘speaking truth’’ to the deeply repressed,hidden spaces of individual emotional life; and withovercoming the ‘‘cultural’’ constraints that producedistortions and defenses against knowing what one isreallythinking and feeling.5There is a presumedbinary split between public sentiments and privatefeelings, between what is cultural and what is ‘‘nat-ural.’’ Culture emerges as an artificial facade con-cealing the dangerous intensity of hidden orunconscious human passions and desires. What is‘‘real’’ and ‘‘authentic’’ is just what is most concealedfrom view.Along this same binary divide, women and thefemale are associated with nature, body, and feeling,just as men and the male are associated with culture,mind, and reason. It is expected that women will bemore emotionally responsive than men; conse-quently, society relegates more emotion work, in-cluding love work and grief work, to them. In theextensive psychological literature on grief and be-reavement (see, for example, Glick, Weiss, andParkes 1974:263–5; Scheff 1979), it is assumedthat the sexes differ in emotionality. Men are saidto cry less than women following the death of afamily member and are less often depressed. Oftenthey do not appear to be deeply moved or touchedby death. But this is treated as appropriate genderbehavior. There is no respected body of psycho-logical research on the ‘‘inability of men to cry’’comparable to the research on the ‘‘inability ofmothers to love.’’ And the clinical portraits of ‘‘fail-ure to grieve’’ are almost exclusively concerned withthe absence of ‘‘appropriate’’ emotionality in womenfollowing the death of a spouse or a child.Bereavement customs worldwide (see Kligman1988; Rosenblatt, Walsh, and Jackson 1976:26 –7)commonly assign women to prolonged and ritualizedgrieving, both during the funeral services and longafter they are over. It is widows who commonly cuttheir hair, cover themselves with ashes, mutilate theirbodies, or shroud themselves in black for the remain-der of their lives, while widowers walk freely, indis-tinguishable from ‘‘ordinary’’ men. This cross-cultural ‘‘specialization’’ of women in the divisionof emotional labor may be related to the generallylower status of women in the societies observed. Justas women may be coerced into feeding males beforethey themselves eat or into carrying the heaviestloads, they may be coerced into assuming the emo-tional burden for grief work. Just as plebeians wereexpected to weep openly on the death of their king,women are expected to show proper ‘‘deference’’ byweeping publicly for the death of kin.Alternatively, the expectation that women willgrieve for the dead may be an extension of theRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:13ampage 188Death Without Weeping188"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"division of labor found in many traditional rural andpeasant societies that delegates to older womenspecialists the task of washing and dressing the bodiesof the dead, as they do, for example, in the twoethnographic instances that I know best: westernIreland and rural Northeast Brazil. In ‘‘Ballybran,’’Ireland, the old women who dress the dead are alsoexpected to recite long and sorrowful ritualizedlaments; on the Alto do Cruzeiro the old womenwho dress the dead are expected to recite specialmortuary prayers, but they do so only for deadadults. ‘‘Why pray for angelbabies who have noneed of our prayers?’’ asked Xiquinha. ‘‘It’stheirjobto pray for us!’’ Given the often ‘‘coerced’’ nature ofpregnancy on the Alto do Cruzeiro – recall, forexample, the sexual and reproductive life of Lordes,whose second husband sadistically ‘‘enjoyed’’ seeingher pregnant again and again – it is also possible thatthe refusal to grieve for the death of their infants is attimes a gesture of defiance. It could be a way ofsaying, ‘‘You can make me pregnant, but you cannotmake me love all of them . . . orkeepall of themeither.’’Death Without WeepingAnd so I maintain that Alto women generally facechild death stoically, even with a kind ofbelle indiffe ́r-encethat is a culturally appropriate response. No oneon the Alto do Cruzeiro criticizes a mother for notgrieving for the death of a baby. No psychiatrist,pediatrician, or social worker visits the mother athome or tells her in the clinic what she is ‘‘supposed’’to be feeling at a particular ‘‘phase’’ in her mourning.She is not told that crying is a healthy (and womanly)response to child death or that it is ‘‘natural’’ to feelbitter and resentful (which reduces anger to a man-ageable medical ‘‘symptom’’) or that she must ‘‘con-front’’ her loss and get over her unhealthy emotional‘‘numbness.’’Poor Brazilians ‘‘work’’ on the self and emotionsin a very different fashion. Instead of the mandate tomourn, the Alto mother is coached by those aroundher, men as well as women, in the art of resignation(conformac ̧a ̃o) and ‘‘holy indifference’’ to the vagariesof one’s fate on earth and a hopefulness of a betterlife beyond. In this cultural milieu a deficit of emo-tion is not viewed as unhealthy or problematic (as inthe overly repressed Anglo-Saxon culture of theUnited States); rather, an excess is. To experiencestrong emotions and passions – of love and lust, envyand anger, ecstasy and joy, grief and longing – is formost Brazilians, rich as well as poor, urban as well asrural, the most ‘‘natural’’ and expected occurrence.It is what being human is all about. But if allowed torun riot, these emotions are understood as the har-bingers of much misery and suffering. Excessiveemotions can bring down large and powerful house-holds as well as small and humble ones. They can ruinlives and livelihoods. They can destroy relationships.They can cause physical as well as mental sickness.The Brazilian folk ethnopsychology of emotion isbased on a very different construction of the body,self, personhood, and society. One can, for example,contrast the once popular belief in American societythat cancers were caused by the repressions of theinner self, by passion turned inward and feeding onitself (see Sontag 1979), with the popular belief inBrazilian culture that emotional outbursts can dissi-pate the individual, poison the blood, and causetuberculosis or cancer.The strong mandatenotto express grief at thedeath of a baby, and most especially not to shedtears at the wake, is strongly reinforced by aNordes-tinofolk piety, a belief that for the brief hours thatthe infant is in the coffin, she is neither human childnor blessed little angel. She is something other:a spirit-child struggling to leave this world andfind its way into the next. It must climb. The pathis dark. A mother’s tears can impede the way, makethe road slippery so that the spirit-child will lose herfooting, or the tears will fall on her wings anddampen them so that she cannot fly. Dona Amortold of a ‘‘silly’’ neighbor who was weeping freely forthe death of her toddler when she was interrupted bythe voice of her child calling to her from his coffin:‘‘Mama, don’t cry for me because mymorta ́liais veryheavy and wet with your tears.’’ ‘‘You see,’’ Amorsaid, ‘‘the child had to struggle even after death, andhis mother was making it worse for him. The littleone wasn’t an angel yet because angels neverspeak. They are mute. But he was no longer ahuman child either. He was analma penanda[wretched, wandering soul].’’Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:13ampage 189Nancy Scheper-Hughes189"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"‘‘What is the fate of such a child?’’‘‘Sometimes they are trapped in their graves.Sometimes when you pass by the cemetery, you cansee little bubbles and foam pushing up from theground where such infants are buried. And late atnight you can even hear the sound of the lost souls ofthe child-spirits wailing.’’In all, what is being created is an environment thatteaches women to contain their affections and holdback their grief during the precarious first year of thechild’s life. The question remains, however, whetherthese cultural ‘‘conventions’’ actually succeed in pro-ducing the desired effects or whether the dry-eyedstoicism and nonchalant air of Alto mothers aremerely ‘‘superficial’’ and skin-deep, covering up a‘‘depth of sorrow,’’ loss, and longing. Nations andRebhun, for example, maintained that the lack ofgrief is mere facade: ‘‘The inner experience of griefmay be hidden by the flat affect of impoverishedBrazilians. This behavior is part of a culturally man-dated norm of mourning behavior; rather than sig-nify theabsenceof strong emotion at child and infantdeath, it reveals thepresenceof grief’’ (1988: 158).What they wish to suggest, drawing inspirationfrom the writings of Robert J. Lifton and otherpsychologists of mourning, is that the ‘‘blankness’’and ‘‘flat affect’’ that they observed in certain poorwomen of the Northeast ‘‘is the blankness of theshell-shocked’’ (160). They continued, ‘‘The loss istoo great to bear, too great to speak of, too great toexperience fully. . . . Their seeming indifference is amask, a wall against the unbearable . . . While flam-boyantly open about such emotions as happiness andsexual jealousy, they adopt a generally flat affectwhen discussing painful topics’’ (158).Although I have no doubt (and have gone to greatlengths to show) that the local culture is organized todefend women against the psychological ravagings ofgrief, I assume that the culture is quite successful indoing so and that we may take the women at theirword when they say, ‘‘No, I felt no grief. The baby’sdeath was a blessing.’’ One need not speak of‘‘masks’’ or ‘‘disguises’’ or engage in second-guessingon the basis of alien and imported psychologicalconcepts of the self. Nations and Rebhun assumed a‘‘divided self’’ that conforms to our Western ethnop-sychiatry: a split between a public and a private selfand between a ‘‘true’’ and a ‘‘false’’ self-expression.Moreover, when they suggested that the ‘‘mothers’flat affect in response to infant deaths is due more tofolk Catholic beliefs than to a lack of emotionalattachment to infants’’ (141), they projected a verysecular view of religious belief as a superficial featureof the interior life, rather than as a powerful forcethat penetrates and constitutes the person.Until recently, most cultural and symbolic anthro-pologists tended to restrict their interest in emotionsto occasions when they were contained withinformal, public, collective, highly stylized, and ‘‘dis-tanced’’ rites and rituals, such as in healing, spiritpossession, initiation, and other life cycle events.They left the discussion of the more private, idiosyn-cratic feelings of individual, suffering subjects topsychoanalytic and biomedical anthropologists, whogenerally reduced them to a discourse on universaldrives and instincts.6This division of labor, based ona false dichotomy between collective, ‘‘cultural’’sentiments and individual, ‘‘natural’’ passions, leadsto a stratigraphic model of human nature in whichbiology emerges as the base and culture as the mereveneer or patina, as the series of carnival masks anddisguises alluded to previously.But the view taken here is that emotions do notprecede or stand outside of culture; they are part ofculture and of strategic importance to our under-standing of the ways in which people shape and areshaped by their world. Emotions are not reifiedthings in and of themselves, subject to an internal,hydraulic mechanism regulating their buildup, con-trol, and release. Catherine Lutz (1988) and LilaAbu-Lughod (1986), among others, understandemotions as ‘‘historical inventions’’ and as ‘‘rhet-orical strategies’’ used by individuals to expressthemselves, to make claims on others, to promoteor elicit certain kinds of behaviors, and so on. Inother words, emotions are discourse; they are con-structed and produced in language and in humaninteraction. They cannot be understood outside ofthe cultures that produce them. The most radicalstatement of this position is that without our cul-tures, wesimply would not know how to feel.In fieldwork, as in daily life, we often encounterradical difference, and we come up against things wedo not like or with which we cannot immediatelyRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:13ampage 190Death Without Weeping190"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"identify or empathize. These ‘‘discoveries’’ can makeus supremely uncomfortable. As anthropologistswith a commitment to cross-cultural understanding,we worry – as well we should – how our writtenmaterials will be read and received by those whohave not experienced the pleasures (as well as thepains) of living with the complex people whose liveswe are trying to describe. Consciously or uncon-sciously we may ‘‘screen out’’ or simply refuse toaccept at face value what we see or what we are beingtold, as, for example, when Renato Rosaldo (1980)at first refused to believe that his Ilongot friends werecapable of headhunting, as they insisted, for thesimple, expressive ‘‘joy’’ of it as well as to ‘‘kill’’the sadness and anger they felt. Rosaldo preferred tobelieve that there was a more ‘‘rational’’ and ‘‘instru-mental’’ purpose behind Ilongot headhunting, suchas avenging the death of a loved one. But his inform-ants, after listening attentively to Rosaldo’s explan-ation of the anthropologists’ model of exchangetheory, replied that ‘‘Ilongots simply did not thinkany such thing’’ at all (1983:180).The temptation to second-guess our informants isparticularly keen when their own explanations oftheir lives are ‘‘experience-distant’’ or counter-intuitive to our own sociological or psychologicalunderstandings of human behavior. Sometimes, asin Rosaldo’s case, it is because people’s explanationsmay appear, as they did to him, ‘‘too simple, thin,opaque, implausible, stereotypic, or otherwise un-satisfying’’ (179). Similarly, Thomas Gregor, whoinvestigated the ‘‘psychological impact’’ of infanti-cide among the Brazilian Amazonian MehinakuIndians, found that he could not accept the villagers’claims that infanticide was easily accomplished andleft no residue of guilt or blame: ‘‘We profoundlyreject interring healthy children and therefore weassume that deep down the Mehinaku must feel thesame way. Yet they claim otherwise. They institu-tionalize infanticide and assume that it is nearlypainless: ‘‘The white man really feels for his infant.We do not. Infants are not precious to us’’ (1988:6).These statements produced cognitive dissonancefor Gregor, who began from the premise of a ‘‘uni-versal human imperative requiring that children beprotected and nurtured’’ (3). While aware of thedanger of projecting his own moral repugnancetoward infanticide on the Amerindian villagers,Gregor found himself ultimately unable to ‘‘takeMehinaku opinion at face value’’ (6). The oft-repeated phrase ‘‘Infants are not precious to us,’’while emblematic of the ‘‘official’’ culture of Mehi-naku infanticide, was covering a large reservoir ofpersonal ambivalence and doubt. The Mehinakumother, Gregor wrote, who brought an infant toterm simply could not ‘‘be emotionally neutralabout infanticide’’ (6) because she was subject tothe same psychobiological feelings as the Westernmother. And so Mehinaku cultural practices wereinterpreted as psychological ‘‘defenses’’ and ‘‘distan-cing devices’’: the rejected neonate was not referredto as a ‘‘baby’’ but rather as akanupa, a ‘‘tabooed’’ or‘‘forbidden’’ thing; the infanticidal act was accom-plished very rapidly; and so forth. These led Gregorto conclude that, despite what the Indians told him,‘‘Mehinaku infants are, in fact, precious to the villa-gers and infanticide is edged with moral and emo-tional ambivalence’’ (19). The burden of proof was,however, very thin, overinterpreted, and extremelycircumstantial. It would not hold up in court. And itstrikes me as indefensible to argue in a post hocfashion that Mehinaku villagersmustconsider alltheir newborns precious because Western psycho-biological theories tell us that all humansarethis way.Gregor’s detailed descriptions of Mehinaku beliefsand practices toward theirkanupalead me to thinkthat these women view and treat some of theirneonates as prehumans, just as many women in theUnited States view and treat their fetuses. If we wantto draw comparisons and analogies, it may be moreappropriate to consider Mehinaku neonaticide as aform of ‘‘postpartum abortion.’’ It seems to be prac-ticed with similar intent and with a similar range ofsentiments, explanations, and emotions. And just asGregor would second-guess his informants’realfeel-ings on the matter, some psychologists similarlydismiss the apparent psychological relief and the‘‘indifference’’ of middle-class women who havehad to abort a fetus as ‘‘denial’’ of their loss, grief,and deep moral ambivalence. With theories such asthese, what is being ‘‘denied’’ are the disparate voicesand moral sensibilities of women.Renato Rosaldo, while later recovering from aprofound personal loss in his own life, was movedRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:13ampage 191Nancy Scheper-Hughes191"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"to reflect (1983) on his initial refusal to ‘‘hear’’ whathis Ilongot informants told him about ‘‘grief and theheadhunter’s rage.’’ In rethinking Ilongot emotions inlight of his own recent experience, Rosaldo came toaccept that one could indeed feel a passionate, mur-derous, yet almost joyously self-affirming, rage inresponse to the death of a loved one. Or perhapshis own experience of grief was shaped by his Ilongotteachers, for fieldworkistransformative of the self.And so Rosaldo returned from his own mourning tochallenge his anthropological colleagues to pay moreattention to what their informants were telling themand to make room in their highly abstract theorizingfor the often unanticipated ‘‘force’’ and intensity ofemotions in human life.NOTE1It has been well documented that preterm and low-birth-weight infants are at a considerably higher riskfor mortality in the early months of life.

Even for the biologistdeath is not a simple and obvious fact; it is a problemto be scientifically investigated. But where a humanbeing is concerned the physiological phenomena arenot the whole of death. To the organic event is addeda complex mass of beliefs, emotions and activitieswhich give it its distinctive character. We see lifevanish but we express this fact by the use of a speciallanguage: it is the soul, we say, which departs foranother world where it will join its forefathers. Thebody of the deceased is not regarded like the carcassof some animal: specific care must be given to it anda correct burial; not merely for reasons of hygienebut out of moral obligation. Finally, with the occur-rence of death a dismal period begins for the livingduring which special duties are imposed upon them.Whatever their personal feelings may be, they haveto show sorrow for a certain period, change thecolour of their clothes and modify the pattern oftheir usual life. Thus death has a specific meaning forthe social consciousness; it is the object of a collect-ive representation. This representation is neithersimple nor unchangeable: it calls for an analysis ofits elements as well as a search for its origin. It is tothis double study that we wish to contribute here.In our own society the generally accepted opinion isthat death occurs in one instant. The only purpose ofthe two or three days’ delay between the demise andthe burial is to allow material preparations to bemade and to summon relatives and friends. Nointerval separates the life ahead from the one thathas just ceased: no sooner has the last breath beenexhaled than the soul appears before its judge andprepares to reap the reward for its good deeds or toexpiate its sins. After this sudden catastrophe a moreor less prolonged period of mourning begins. Oncertain dates, especially at the ‘end of the year,’commemorative ceremonies are held in honour ofthe deceased.

AsLafitau has already pointed out, ‘In most primitivesocieties the dead bodies are only stored, so to speak,in the tomb where they are first placed. After a timethey are given a new funeral and they receive thefinal funerary rites which are due to them.’ Thisdifference in custom is not, as we shall see, a mereaccident; it brings to light the fact that death has notalways been represented and felt as it is in oursociety.In the following pages we shall try to establish thecomplex of beliefs relating to death and practicesfeaturing a double burial. To achieve this aim we shallfirst use data gathered exclusively from Indonesianpeoples, in particular the Dayak of Borneo, amongwhom this phenomenon takes a typical form. Weshall then show, on the basis of sources relating toother ethnographic areas, that these are not merelylocal customs. In our account we shall follow thesequence of the events themselves, dealing first withthe period between the death (in the usual sense ofthe word) and the final obsequies, and then with theconcluding ceremony.1. The Intermediary PeriodThe ideas and practices occasioned by death can beclassified under three headings, according towhether they concern the body of the deceased, hissoul, or the survivors. This distinction does not byany means have an absolute value, but it does facili-tate the presentation of the facts.(a)The body: provisional burialAmong peoples of the Malay archipelago who havenot yet been too deeply influenced by foreign cul-tures it is the custom not to take the body at once toits final burial place; this move can only be madeafter a more or less long period of time during whichthe body is placed in a temporary shelter.The general rule, among the Dayak, seems to havebeen to keep the bodies of chiefs and of wealthypeople inside their own houses till the time of thefinal burial. The body is then put in a coffin thecracks of which are sealed with a resinous substance.The Dutch Government forbade this practice, atleast in certain districts, for hygienic reasons; butquite different reasons besides that of foreign inter-ference must have limited the extent of this kind oftemporary burial. The living owe all kinds of care tothe dead who reside among them. There is an un-interrupted wake which, as in Ireland or among ourown farmers, entails much upheaval and great ex-penses, but for a much longer period. Furthermore,the presence of a corpse in the house imposes tabooson the inhabitants which are often severe: an incon-venience which is strongly felt because the Dayaklonghouse is frequently the whole village in itself. Itis for these reasons that the prolonged exposure ofthe body is nowadays exceptional.As for those deceased who do not seem to deservesuch heavy sacrifices, a shelter is provided by layingthe coffin, after it has been exposed for a few days,either in a miniature wooden house raised on piles or,more often, on a kind of platform simply covered bya roof. This temporary burial place is sometimes inthe immediate neighbourhood of the deceased per-son’s house, but more often it is in a deserted place inthe depth of the forest. Thus, if the deceased nolonger has a place in the big house of the living, he atleast possesses his own little house, one which isalmost identical with those temporarily occupiedby Dayak families when the cultivation of riceforces them to scatter over an area which is oftenvery extensive.This type of temporary burial, although appar-ently the most common one in the Malay archipel-ago, is not the only one that exists there; it may evenbe derived from a more ancient one which we findmentioned in several places: the exposure of thecorpse, wrapped in bark, in the branches of a tree.On the other hand, instead of exposing the coffin tothe atmosphere it is often preferred to bury it fairlydeep, even though this means digging it up later.Whatever the variety of these customs, which oftenco-exist in one place and are substituted one for theother, the rite, in its essence, is constant; the body ofthe deceased, while awaiting the second burial, istemporarily deposited in a burial-place distinct fromthe final one; it is almost invariably isolated.Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:14ampage 198A Contribution to the Study of the Collective Representation of Death198"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"[...][L]et us conclude provisionally that the Indones-ians attach a particular importance to the changesthat occur in the corpse; their ideas in this matterprevent them from terminating the funeral rites atonce and impose specific precautions and obser-vances on the survivors.So long as the final rite has not been celebrated thecorpse is exposed to grave perils. It is a belief familiarto anthropologists and folklorists that the body is atcertain times particularly exposed to the attacks ofevil spirits and to all the harmful influences by whichman is threatened; its diminished powers of resistancehave to be reinforced by magical means. The periodwhich follows death is particularly dangerous in thisrespect; that is why the corpse must be exorcised andbe forearmed against demons. This preoccupationinspires, at least partly, the ablutions and variousrites connected with the body immediately afterdeath: such as, for instance, the custom of closingthe eyes and other orifices of the body with coins orbeads; it also imposes on the survivors the duty ofkeeping the deceased company during this dreadedperiod, to keep watch by his side and to beat gongsfrequently in order to keep malignant spirits at bay.Thus the corpse, afflicted by a special infirmity, is anobject of solicitude for the survivors at the same timeas an object of fear.(b)The soul: its temporary stay on earthIn the same way as the body is not taken at once to its‘last resting-place’, so the soul does not reach itsfinal destination immediately after death. It mustfirst undergo a kind of probation, during which itstays on earth in the proximity of the body,wandering in the forest or frequenting the places itinhabited while it was alive: it is only at the end ofthis period, at the time of the second funeral, andthanks to a special ceremony, that it will enter theland of the dead. This at least is the simplest formtaken by this belief.[...]The stay of the soul among the living is somewhatillegitimate and clandestine. It lives, as it were,marginally in the two worlds: if it ventures into theafter-world, it is treated there like an intruder; hereon earth it is an importunate guest whose proximityis dreaded. As it has no resting place it is doomed towander incessantly, waiting anxiously for the feastwhich will put an end to its restlessness. It is thus notsurprising that during this period the soul should beconsidered as a malicious being: it finds the solitudeinto which it has been thrust hard to bear and tries todrag the living with it. Not yet having regular meansof subsistence such as the dead are provided with, ithas to pilfer from its relatives; in its present distressit remembers all the wrongs it has suffered during itslife and seeks revenge. It watches its relatives’mourning sharply and if they do not properly fulfiltheir duties towards itself, if they do not activelyprepare its release, it becomes irritated and inflictsdiseases upon them, for death has endowed it withmagical powers which enable it to put its bad inten-tions into practice. Whilst later, when it has its placeamong the dead, it will only visit its relatives whenexpressly invited, now it ‘returns’ of its own initia-tive through necessity or through malice, and itsuntimely appearance spreads terror.This state of the soul, both pitiful and dangerous,during this confused period explains the complexattitude of the living in which pity and fear aremixed in variable proportions. They try to providefor the needs of the deceased and to ease his condi-tion; but at the same time they remain on thedefensive and refrain from contacts which theyknow to be harmful. When, the very next day afterdeath, they have the soul led into the world of thedead, it is not known whether they are motivated bythe hope of sparing the soul a painful wait, or by thedesire to rid themselves as quickly as possible of itssinister presence; in fact both these preoccupationsare mingled in their consciousness. These fears of theliving can only end completely when the soul has lostthe painful and disquieting character that it has afterthe death.(c)The living: mourningNot only are the relatives of the deceased compelledto devote all kinds of care towards him during theintermediary period, not only are they the target ofthe spite and sometimes the attacks of the tormentedsoul, but they are moreover subjected to a whole setof prohibitions which constitute the mourning.Death, in fact, by striking the individual, has givenRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:14ampage 199Robert Hertz199"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"him a new character; his body, which (except incertain abnormal cases) was in the realm of theordinary, suddenly leaves it; it can no longer betouched without danger, it is an object of horrorand dread. Now we know to what degree the reli-gious or magical properties of things are regarded ascontagious by ‘primitives’: the ‘impure cloud’which, according to the Olo Ngaju, surrounds thedeceased, pollutes everything it touches; i.e. notonly the people and objects that have been in physicalcontact with the corpse, but also everything that isintimately connected, in the minds of the survivors,with the image of the deceased. His belongings mayno longer be used for profane purposes; they must bedestroyed or dedicated to the deceased, or at leaststripped, by appropriate rites, of the harmful qualitythey have acquired. Similarly, the fruit trees thatbelonged to the deceased, and the streams wherehe used to fish, are the objects of a strict taboo; if thefruit and fish are taken they are used exclusively asprovisions for the great funeral feast. The house ofthe deceased is impure for a more or less long periodand the river on the bank of which it is built istabooed.As for the relatives of the deceased, they feel inthemselves the blow that has struck one of them: aban separates them from the rest of the community.They may not leave their village nor pay any visits;those most directly affected sometimes spend wholemonths confined to a corner of their house, sittingmotionless and doing nothing. Neither may theyreceive visitors from outside, nor (should this beallowed) may they answer when they are questioned.They are forsaken, not only by men but also by theprotective spirits: as long as their impurity lasts theycannot hope for any help from the powers above. Theban which is imposed on them affects their entire wayof life. In consequence of the funerary contagion theyare changed, and set apart from the rest of humanity;therefore they can no longer live the way others do.They may not share the diet nor follow the ways ofdressing or adornment or of arranging the hair whichare proper to individuals who are socially normal andwhich are the sign of this community to which (for atime) they no longer belong; hence the numeroustaboos and special prescriptions to which people inmourning must conform.Although the funeral pollution extends to all therelatives of the deceased and to all the inhabitants ofthe house where the death occurred, they are not allequally affected: thus the length of the mourningvaries necessarily according to the degree of kinship.Among the Olo Ngaju, distant relatives are impureonly for the few days immediately following thedeath; then, after a ceremony during which severalhens are sacrificed, they may resume their ordinarylife. But as for the closer relatives of the deceased,the particular condition which affects them is notdissipated so quickly or so easily; a long time mustelapse before they can be completely freed of the banthat weighs upon them, a period which coincidesprecisely with the length of the temporary sepulture.During this period they must observe the taboosimposed on them by their state. A widower or awidow has no right to remarry, because the tie thatbinds the surviving spouse to the deceased will onlybe severed by the final ceremony. Indeed the closerelatives, because they are as it were one with thedeceased, share his condition, are included with himin the feelings which he inspires in the community,and are subject, like him, to a taboo during the wholeinterval between the death and the second funeral.The facts do not always have the typical simplicitywhich we find, for instance, among the Olo Ngaju.The delay, often very long, necessitated by the prep-arations for the burial feast would prolong almostindefinitely the privations and hardships of mourningif the adoption of a fixed and relatively close date didnot remedy this situation. It is very likely – thoughthis fact cannot, it appears, be historically proved forthe societies we are dealing with – that such ashortening of the mourning-period has occurredfairly frequently. Moreover, as Wilken has shown,the new date, set to mark the end of mourninginstead of the final burial, need not have been chosenarbitrarily. Indeed, the state of the deceased duringthe intermediary period is not immutable: he under-goes changes which gradually weaken the dangerouscharacter of the corpse and the soul and whichcompel the living, at certain dates, to hold specialceremonies. These dates, which at first constitutedfor the mourners merely stages towards liberation,have later become the time marking the end of theirimpurity. In this way compulsory mourning expiresRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:14ampage 200A Contribution to the Study of the Collective Representation of Death200"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"among the Olo Maanyan at the ceremony of theforty-ninth day and not, as among the Olo Ngaju,at the time of the final feast.On the other hand, according to many sources, thelifting of the mourning-taboos coincides with theacquisition of a human head by the relatives of thedecreased, and with the ceremony that takes place onthe occasion of this happy event. But this custom tooseems to be of an evolution whose principal stages wecan determine. Among the Olo Ngaju the sacrifice ofa human victim (whose head is cut off) is, as we shallsee, one of the essential acts of the funeral feast.Sacrifice is indeed an indispensable condition forthe conclusion of the mourning-period, but it ispart of a complex whole and is bound up with thefinal burial. Among the Sea Dayak of Sarawak this riteassumes an autonomous character; certainly theulitor taboo which constitutes the mourning ends com-pletely only with the feast for the deceased. ‘How-ever, if in the meantime a human head has beenacquired and celebrated in the village, the taboosare partially lifted and the wearing of ornaments isallowed again.’ Should this procedure continue, andthe practice of double burial be abandoned, a suc-cessful ‘head-hunt’, a partly fortuitous event and inany case external to the state of the deceased, will beenough to assure the release of the survivors.Thus the long mourning of the relatives amongthese Indonesians seems to be bound up with ideasabout the body and the soul of the deceased duringthe intermediary period; this mourning lasts nor-mally till the second burial. Divergent customs inwhich this relationship is not apparent are due, webelieve, to a later relaxation of the original custom.The idea that the last funeral rites may not becelebrated immediately after death but only at theend of a certain period is not at all peculiar to theIndonesians nor to any one particular race; this isproved by the fact that the custom of temporaryburial is extremely common.Certainly the special forms which this customtakes are extremely varied; and it is very likely thatethnic and geographical reasons contribute to thepredominance of a certain kind of temporary dis-posal of the body in a given cultural area, but that is aseparate problem which we do not intend to discusshere. From our point of view there is a strict simi-larity between the exposure of the corpse in thebranches of a tree, as is practised by tribes of CentralAustralia, or inside the house of the living, as is foundamong certain Papuans and among some Bantutribes, or on a platform specially raised, as is usuallydone by the Polynesians and by many Indian tribes ofNorth America, or lastly the temporary burialchiefly practised by South American Indians. Allthese various forms of temporary burial, which in atechnical classification would probably have toappear under separate headings, are equivalent forus. They all have the same object, namely to offer thedeceased a temporary residence until the naturaldisintegration of the body is completed and onlythe bones remain.But certain funeral customs cannot, it seems, bereduced to this general type: the aim of embalmmentis precisely to prevent the corruption of the flesh andthe transformation of the body into a skeleton;cremation on the other hand forestalls the spontan-eous alteration of the corpse with a rapid and almostcomplete destruction. We believe that these artificialways of disposal do not differ essentially from thetemporary ways that we have listed. The completedemonstration of this thesis would lead us too farfrom our subject; it must be enough for us merely toindicate here briefly the reasons which justify it inour eyes.Let us first note that mummification is in certaincases a mere result of temporary exposure or burial,due to the desiccating qualities of the soil or of theair. Furthermore, even when the survivors do notintend to preserve the corpse artificially, they do notalways abandon it completely during its decompos-ition. Since the transformation which it undergoes ispainful and dangerous for itself as well as for thosewho surround it, steps are often taken to shorten theputrefaction, to diminish its intensity or to neutralizeits sinister effects. A fire is kept burning beside thedeceased in order to keep malign influences at bay,and also to warm the wandering soul and to exercisea soothing action upon the body, which is surroundedby scented smoke and smeared with aromatic oint-ments. The transition from these customs to thepractice of smoking the corpse on a wickerworkframe or to a rudimentary embalmment is almostimperceptible. To pass from the spontaneous desic-Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:14ampage 201Robert Hertz201"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"cation, which leaves only the bones, to the specialform of desication which transforms the corpse intoa mummy, it is enough for the survivors to havedeveloped a desire to consign to the final grave abody as little changed as possible. In this the Egyptianfuneral ritual agrees essentially with the beliefs andpractices of the Indonesians: for seventy days, theembalmer fights the corruption which tries to invadethe corpse; it is only at the end of this period that thebody, having become imperishable, is taken to thegrave, that the soul departs for the fields of Ialu andthat the mourning of the survivors comes to an end.It seems legitimate therefore to consider mummifi-cation as a special case derived from temporaryburial.As for cremation, it is usually neither a final act,nor sufficient in itself; it calls for a later and comple-mentary rite. In ancient Indian ritual, for instance,what is left of the body after it has been burnt mustbe carefully collected, as are the ashes, and depositedat the end of a certain period in a funeral monument,the cremation, and the burial of the burned bones,correspond respectively to the first and the secondburial among the Indonesians. Evidently the verynature of the rite that is performed renders indeter-minate the interval between the initial ceremony andthe final one. This interval may be reduced to such anextent that both ceremonies form a single continu-ous whole, which does not, however, prevent thecremation being a preliminary operation andoccupying, within the system of funeral rites, thesame place as the temporary exposure. To this exter-nal similarity corresponds moreover a deeper resem-blance: the immediate purpose of the temporaryburial is, as well shall see, to give the bones timeto dry completely. This transformation is not,in the eyes of the ‘primitives’, a mere phy-sical disintegration; it changes the character of thecorpse, turns it into a new body, and is, conse-quently, a necessary condition for the salvation ofthe soul. This is precisely the meaning of cremation:far from destroying the body of the deceased, itrecreates it and makes it capable of entering a newlife; it thus achieves the same result as the temporaryexposure, but in a much faster way. The violentaction of the fire spares the dead and the living thesorrows and dangers involved in the transformationof the corpse; or at least, it shortens that periodconsiderably by accomplishing all at once the de-struction of the flesh and the reduction of the bodyto immutable elements which in nature happensslowly and progressively. Thus there is a differenceof duration and of means between cremation and thevarious modes of temporary sepulture, but not adifference of kind.In all the rites studied so far, the soft parts of thecorpse, where they are not preserved by artificialmeans, are purely and simply destroyed: they arelooked upon as mere perishable and impure elementsfrom which the bones must be separated; but morecomplex representations come to light in the prac-tice known as endocannibalism, which consists in theritual consumption of the deceased person’s flesh byhis relatives. This custom obviously does not have asexclusive aim the purification of the bones. It is not arefined cruelty like normal cannibalism, nor thefulfilment of a physical appetite; it is a sacred mealof which only certain definite groups of the tribe’smembers can partake and from which the women,among the Binbinga at least, are strictly excluded. Bythis rite the living incorporate into their own beingthe vitality and the special qualities residing in theflesh of the deceased; if this flesh were allowed todissolve, the community would lose strength towhich it is entitled. But, at the same time, endocan-nibalism spares the deceased the horror of a slow andvile decomposition, and allows his bones to reachtheir final state almost immediately. Furthermore, itsecures for the flesh the most honourable of sepul-tures. In any case, the existence of this practice doesnot essentially alter the general type that we aretrying to set up here, since after the consumptionof the flesh the bones are gathered and kept by therelatives of the deceased for a certain period, at theend of which the final funeral is celebrated. Duringthis period the soul is supposed to prowl around thebones and the sacred fire which is kept burningnearby, and silence is strictly imposed on close rela-tives of the deceased. Thus, endocannibalism, what-ever its direct causes might be, takes its place amongthe various practices observed in order to lay barethe bones in the intermediary period between deathand the last funeral rites.[...]Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:14ampage 202A Contribution to the Study of the Collective Representation of Death202"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"We must beware of attributing to the variousrepresentations a generality and an explanatoryvalue which they do not have. It would be arbitraryto elevate such and such a particular belief into auniversal truth; to affirm for instance that the newbody of the deceased is always formed by his vola-tised flesh. In fact, as we shall see, the bones are oftenthought to be the material support of the disincar-nated soul. These opposed concepts agree in theiressential point; in different ways they express aconstant theme. Two complementary notions seemto compose this theme. The first is that death is notcompleted in one instantaneous act; it implies alasting procedure which, at least in a great manyinstances, is considered terminated only when thedissolution of the body has ended. The second is thatdeath is not a mere destruction but a transition: as itprogresses so does the rebirth; while the old bodyfalls to ruins, a new body takes shape, with which thesoul – provided the necessary rites have been per-formed – will enter another existence, often super-ior to the previous one.During this entire period when death is not yetcompleted, the deceased is treated as if he were stillalive: food is brought to him, his relatives and friendskeep him company and speak to him. He retains allhis rights over his wife and guards them jealously.The widow is literally the wife of a person in whomdeath is present and continuous; thus she is con-sidered during that period as impure and accursedand is condemned in a great many societies to theabject existence of an outcast; it is only at the time ofthe final ceremony that she can be freed and allowedby the kin of the deceased either to remarry or toreturn to her family. In the same way, the inheritancesometimes remains intact till the day the deceasedhas truly left this world. But the most instructivefacts are those concerning the succession of kings andchiefs.The custom of not proclaiming the successor to achief until the final ceremony, a custom which wehad already encountered in Timor, is reported fromseveral peoples belonging to different ethnic groups.We may imagine the dangers of such an interregnumto the societies which are subjected to it. The deathof a chief causes a deep disturbance in the social bodywhich, especially if it is prolonged, has weightyconsequences. It often seems that the blow whichstrikes the head of the community in the sacredperson of the chief has the effect of suspendingtemporarily the moral and political laws and ofsetting free the passions which are normally kept incheck by the social order. Thus we often encounterthe custom of keeping the death of the chief secretduring a period varying in length; those closest to thedeceased are the only ones to know the truth, andthey rule in his name; for others, the chief is merelyill. In Fiji, the secret is kept for a period varyingbetween four and ten days; then, when the subjects,who begin to suspect something and who are impa-tient to be able legitimately to pillage and destroy,come to ask whether the chief has died, they are toldthat ‘his body is decomposed by now’. It onlyremains for the disappointed visitors to go away;they have come too late and have missed their op-portunity. The idea at work here, adds the authorwho reports these facts, is that so long as the decom-position is not sufficiently advanced, one is not reallyfinished with the deceased, and his authority cannotbe transmitted to his successor: the hand of thedeceased can no longer hold the sceptre, but it hasnot yet let go. One must wait for the King to beentirely dead before one can cry: Long live theKing! . . .We have concentrated on demonstrating the re-lationship linking the condition of the soul and theperiod of mourning to the state of the corpse duringthe period preceding the final burial; but we do notmaintain that the three terms are indissolubly tiedtogether and cannot be found in isolation. Thisabsolute assertion would be immediately contra-dicted by the facts; indeed it is hardly necessary tosay that a belief in a temporary stay of the soul onearth and the institution of prolonged mourning arefound in societies where no double burial has beenreported. The end of the period of waiting is some-times set conventionally: thus among certain Indiantribes of South America a rope is tied to the corpse,which is buried at once, and its extremity remainsvisible on the surface of the tomb; when this ropehas vanished, as a result of rain or wear, it is anindication that the soul of the deceased, which wasnear the corpse until then, has finally left for theother world. But most often, when the deceasedRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:14ampage 203Robert Hertz203"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"receives final burial without delay, it is the ideasrelative to the passage of time itself which deter-mine the end of the observances. The death will notbe fully consummated, the soul will not leave theearth, the mourning of the living will not be endedtill a certain period of time, considered complete,has elapsed; this period may be a month or a year;the coming of that day will then mark the close ofthe bad phase, the beginning of another life. Oftenit is the belief in the eminence and sanctity of aparticular number which influences the choice: thatis probably how we should explain the fact, socommon among South American tribes, that thelength of the soul’s stay on earth or its journey tothe other world is set at four days. Should we lookupon these facts as detached and modified parts ofthe more complex whole that we have analysed? It isseldom possible to answer this question with cer-tainty, but one would be tempted to answer in theaffirmative if our view were accepted that there is anatural connection between the beliefs concerningthe disintegration of the body, the fate of the soul,and the state of the survivors during that sameperiod.2. The Final CeremonyThe custom of a great feast connected with the finalburial is general among the Indonesians; it is to befound under different names in most islands of theMalay Archipelago, from the Nicobars on the west toHalmahera on the east. This feast, which lasts forseveral days, sometimes even a month, is of extremeimportance to the natives: it requires elaborate prep-arations and expenses which often reduce the familyof the deceased to extreme poverty; many animalsare sacrificed and eaten in banquets that often degen-erate into huge orgies; invitations for this occasionare sent out to all the surrounding villages and theyare never refused. In this way the feast tends toacquire a collective character; the expenses usuallyexceed the resources of a single family and, further-more, such an interruption of normal life cannot berepeated often. Among the Olo Ngaju, thetivahisusually celebrated for several deceased persons atone time, the families concerned sharing the ex-penses. In other societies the feast is repeated atregular intervals – every three years, for instance –and is celebrated in common for all those who havedied in the meantime; it thus no longer directlyconcerns the family of a particular dead person, butthe village as a whole.The final ceremony hasthree objects: to give burial to the remains of thedeceased, to ensure the soul peace and access to theland of the dead, and finally to free the living fromthe obligations of mourning.(a)The final burialAmong the Dayak of southeast Borneo, the finalresting-place of the body is a small house, madeentirely of ironwood, often finely carved, and raisedon fairly high posts of the same material; such amonument is calledsandong, and constitutes a familyburial place which can hold a large number ofpeople, and lasts many years. There are two kinds,which differ only in their contents and dimensions:thesandong raung, intended to hold coffins containingthe dried remains of the deceased, and thesandongtulang, very much smaller, intended to hold only thebones wrapped in a cloth, or enclosed in an urn, andwhich have often been incinerated previously. Thereis no fixed place for this monument: often it iserected in the immediate neighbourhood of thehouse, inside the palisade which protects the village;often too it is erected fairly far away, on land spe-cially reserved for the family.These two types of final burial place are not pecu-liar to the southeastern Dayak; they are found amongother tribes in Borneo itself and on other islands. Wemight perhaps be justified in relating these two typesof burial to more primitive forms which are alsofound in the same ethnic family. Thesandong tulangseems to be derived from a custom still in practiceamong the tribes of the interior of Borneo whichconsists in enclosing the remains of the deceasedinside the trunk of an iron-wood tree which hasbeen hollowed out for the purpose; and thesandongraungis probably only a modification of the custom,very common in the Malay Archipelago, by which allthe coffins containing the bones are finally laid to-gether in crevices in rocks or in underground caves.These variations in the type of final burial place arehowever of secondary importance to us; the import-ant thing is that in most cases it has a collective, at theRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:14ampage 204A Contribution to the Study of the Collective Representation of Death204"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"very least familial, character; in this it contrastsclearly with the temporary burial in which, as wehave seen, the corpse is usually isolated. The transferof the remains, at the time of the final ceremony, istherefore not a mere change of place; it brings about aprofound change in the condition of the deceased; itdelivers him from the isolation in which he wasplunged since his death, and reunites his body withthose of his ancestors. This much emerges clearlyfrom the study of the rites practised in the course ofthe second funeral.The remains of the person or persons for whomthe feast is to be celebrated are taken from theirprovisional sepulture and are brought back to thevillage, into the sumptuously decorated men’s house,or into a house specially erected for the purpose;there they are laid on a sort of catafalque. But first anoperation has to be performed which, according toone author, is the essential act of this feast: the bonesare washed carefully. If, as sometimes happens, thebones are not completely bare, the flesh still clingingto them is detached. They are then put into a newwrapping, which is often precious. These rites are farfrom insignificant: by purifying the body, by givingthe deceased a new attire, the living mark the end ofone period and the beginning of another; they abol-ish a sinister past and give the deceased a new andglorified body with which to enter worthily thecompany of his ancestors.But he does not depart without having been bid asolemn farewell and without the last days of hisearthly existence being filled with pomp. As soon asthe coffin is placed on the catafalque, among the OloNgaju, the widower or widow sits down very close toit and says to the deceased: ‘You are with us for a whilestill, then you will go away to the pleasant place whereour ancestors live.’ They try to satisfy the deceased bydisplaying near his bones the sacred vases and mostprecious treasures belonging to the family, which heenjoyed during his life-time and which will assure himan opulent life in the other world.[...](b)The admittance of the soul to the land of the deadParallel to that which is done to the remains of thedeceased, a funeral service is performed whichchanges the condition of the soul: namely, it putsan end to its anxiety by solemnly introducing it intothe society of the dead. It is an arduous task whichrequires powerful help, since the road that leads tothe other world is strewn with perils of all kinds, andthe soul will not reach the end of the journey unlessit is led and protected by some powerful psycho-pomp, such as Tempon Telon of the Olo Ngaju. Inorder to guarantee this indispensable help to thesoul, priests and priestesses, summoned by thefamily of the deceased, recite long incantations tothe accompaniment of a drum.[...]By putting an end to the troubles of the soul, thefinal ceremony removes every cause that the soul hashad since its death to be ill-disposed towards theliving. It is still true, of course, that even afterthe great funeral feast the dead belong to anotherworld, and that a too intimate contact with them isdangerous for the living. However, the souls generallyleave their relatives alone once the latter have dis-charged their last duties towards them. In many cases,this negative position is not all: there are regularrelations and an exchange of services between thecommunity of the living and that of the dead. Incertain Indonesian societies the appeased souls areactually worshipped, and they then settle near thedomestic hearth in some consecrated object or in astatuette of the deceased which they animate: theirpresence, duly honoured, guarantees the prosperityof the living. Thus the act that re-unites the soul of thedeceased to those of his ancestors sometimes conferson it the character of a tutelary divinity, and solemnlyensures its return to the heart of the family home.(c)The liberation of the livingThe customs examined so far have dealt with thewelfare of the deceased; any benefit to the living wasmerely incidental. But we find a series of no lessimportant practices performed at the funeral feast,whose direct object is to end the mourning of therelatives of the deceased and to bring these back intocommunion with society.On the first day of thetivah, after a banquetattended only by women, one of these preparesseven small parcels of rice for the souls of thedead, and seven others for the evil spirits; at thesame time she pronounces a formula which clearlyRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:14ampage 205Robert Hertz205"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"reveals the meaning of this act: ‘I place here yourfood; by this I crush all resistance, all that is impure,all bad dreams, and I set an end to all tears.’ Thisoffering is the signal that the time has come for theliving to part from the dead and to dispel the uneasewhich has enveloped them during the mourning. It isonly the first manifestation of a theme which will betaken up many times during the feast.The living, especially the relatives of the deceased,occupy the central place in the song of the priestesseswhich leads the souls into the celestial city. Duringthe entire time of the incantations, the priestessescarry the souls of the givers of the feast in theiraprons, like small children; each time they ascendto heaven to ask the good spirits for help, they taketheir prote ́ge ́s with them. Also a kind of fascinationdraws the souls of the living towards the regionsabove: they have to be recalled by name if theyare not to stay in the other world where they havefollowed the dead. But these spiritual journeys arenot made in vain. The priestesses never fail tocall the spirits’ attention to the givers of the feast:‘Rise’, they call to the most powerful among thespirits, ‘squeeze the body of this man here to drivemisfortune from him, remove the stench that petri-fies like the thunderbolt, dispel the impure cloud ofthe deceased, repel the fate that degrades and thatcauses life to retreat.’ It is not enough to ‘kill theadversity’ which oppressed the living. Tempon Telonmust regenerate them and ensure their long life bysprinkling their body with revivifying water. He hasalso to give them ‘the potent charms which securewealth, success in commerce, and the lustre ofglory’. Naturally, the priestesses simultaneously per-form the acts which their song imposes on, orascribes to, the celestial spirits; and these rites,both oral and manual, bring about a profound changein the living: delivered from the evil which possessedthem, they return to normal life with a new fund ofvital and social power.But if the living are to be rid of their impurity asacrifice is essential, preferably that which in the eyesof the Dayak and most Indonesians has irresistableefficacy: the sacrifice of a human victim whose headis cut off and afterwards kept. An entire day, at thetime of thetivah, is devoted to this essential rite. Theprisoners or slaves, who have previously been de-prived of their souls by a magical intervention, arechained to the sacrificial post; the male relatives ofthe deceased act collectively as sacrificers, dancingand leaping around the victim and striking him atrandom with their spears. The screams of pain aregreeted with joyful shouts, because the more cruelthe torture the happier the souls are in heaven. Atlast, when the victim falls to the ground he is sol-emnly decapitated in the midst of an intense joy; hisblood is collected by a priestess who sprinkles it onthe living ‘to reconcile them with their deceasedrelative’; the head is either deposited with thebones of the deceased or attached to the top of apost erected near thesandong. The funeral sacrifice,without any doubt, is not meant simply to release thefamily of the deceased from the taboo; its functionsare as complex as the aim of the feast of which it isthe decisive act. The mystic fury of the sacrificers,while it desacralises the living, gives peace and beati-tude to the soul of the deceased and (probably)regenerates his his body. The liberation of themourners is only the most obvious among thechanges brought about simultaneously by virtue ofthe sacrifice, that which interests the living mostdirectly.Every religious ceremony must be followed bypractices which free the participants from the dan-gerous character they have acquired and whichenable them to re-enter the profane world. Therites acquire a special importance at the time of thefuneral feast, to the extent sometimes of constitutinga second feast, distinct from the first one and suc-ceeding it. The perils incurred during a ceremonylike thetivahare in fact particularly intense. Nodoubt it has beneficial consequences and constitutesa kind of victory over misfortune; but on the otherhand it touches the kingdom of death and compelsthe living to enter into relations with the forces ofevil and with the residents of the other world. That iswhy the relatives of the deceased and also those whohave taken part in the funeral proceedings are com-pelled to purify themselves. They bathe in the river,and to increase the effectiveness of this the blood ofsacrificed animals is sometimes mixed with thewater, and while they swim to the bank the priest-esses, who follow them in boats, thrust aside evilinfluences from their bodies with the help of burningRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:14ampage 206A Contribution to the Study of the Collective Representation of Death206"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"torches and sacred brooms. At last, if all therites have been correctly observed, the living arewashed clean of all pollution and freed of the deathlycontagion.[...]We have seen that in Indonesia the feast that endsthe funeral rites simultaneously releases the livingfrom the obligation to mourn; this is a constantfeature. The content of the rite may vary but thegeneral meaning of it is fixed: the relatives of thedeceased are unburdened of the dangerous characterthat misfortune has bestowed upon them, and theyreceive a ‘new body’, such as normal life demands;they part finally with death and with evil forces, inorder to make their rightful re-entry into the worldof the living.The institution of secondary burial, whose mean-ing and generality we have tried to show, oftenundergoes a marked regression. In some societiesunmistakable traces of the original custom subsist:the Dene, for instance, at a certain time after deathopen the sarcophagus holding the remains of thedeceased and merely look at them without daringto run the risk and pollution entailed by contact withthe corpse. After a meal has been offered to the soulsthe tomb is closed for ever. Among other peoples,the last rite consists in trampling on the grave, or insealing it by the erection of a funeral monument.Only then does the deceased come into full posses-sion of the place which up till that time he merelyoccupied. In other cases, even these survivals are notfound: the only object of the feast is to terminate thefuneral period, to put an end to the period ofmourning, or to make final provision for the well-being of the disembodied soul. But these functions inturn are removed from the final ceremony or losetheir importance. We have seen that there is a closesolidarity between the body and the soul of thedeceased: if the true funeral takes place immediatelyafter death, one tends naturally to ensure the salva-tion of the soul from that moment on. On the otherhand, the mourning has changed in nature; it is nolonger a question of the survivors marking theirparticipation in the present condition of the de-ceased, but of expressing a sorrow that is consideredobligatory. Hence the duration of the mourning is nolonger dependent on ideas about the deceased: it isentirely determined by causes of a domestic or socialkind. Furthermore, special practices are no longerneeded to liberate the relatives of the deceased; theyregain their former position unaided at the end of theprescribed period. Thus impoverished, the finalceremony is now merely a simple anniversary ser-vice, whose only object is to pay last respects to thedeceased and to commemorate his death.3. ConclusionIt is impossible to interpret the body of facts that wehave presented if we see in death a merely physicalevent. The horror inspired by the corpse does notspring from the simple observation of the changesthat occur in the body. Proof that such a simplisticexplanation is inadequate lies in the fact that in oneand the same society the emotion aroused by deathvaries extremely in intensity according to the socialstatus of the deceased, and may even in certain casesbe entirely lacking. At the death of a chief, or of aman of high rank, a true panic sweeps over thegroup; the corpse is so powerfully contagious thatamong the Kaffir the entire kraal must be deserted atonce and even enemies would not be willing to livethere. On the contrary, the death of a stranger, aslave, or a child will go almost unnoticed; it willarouse no emotion, occasion no ritual. It is thus notas the extinction of an animal life that death occasionssocial beliefs, sentiments and rites.Death does not confine itself to ending the visiblebodily life of an individual; it also destroys the socialbeing grafted upon the physical individual and towhom the collective consciousness attributed greatdignity and importance. The society of which thatindividual was a member formed him by means oftrue rites of consecration, and has put to work ener-gies proportionate to the social status of the deceased:his destruction is tantamount to a sacrilege, implyingthe intervention of powers of the same order but of anegative nature. God’s handiwork can be undone onlyby himself or by Satan. This is why primitive peoplesdo not see death as a natural phenomenon: it is alwaysdue to the action of spiritual powers, either becausethe deceased has brought disaster upon himself byviolating some taboo, or because an enemy has ‘killed’him by means of spells or magical practices. TheRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:14ampage 207Robert Hertz207"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"ethnographers who report this widespread belief seein it a gross and persistent error; but we ought ratherto consider it as the naı ̈ve expression of a permanentsocial need. Indeed society imparts its own characterof permanence to the individuals who compose it:because it feels itself immortal and wants to be so, itcannot normally believe that its members, above allthose in whom it incarnates itself and with whom itidentifies itself, should be fated to die. Their destruc-tion can only be the consequence of a sinister plot. Ofcourse, reality brutally contradicts this assumption,but the denial is always received with the same indig-nant amazement and despair. Such an attack must havean author upon whom the group may vent its anger.Sometimes the deceased himself is accused: ‘Whatcause did you have, you ingrate, to forsake us?’ And heis summoned to return. More often the near relativesare accused of culpable negligence or of witchcraft;the sorcerers must at all costs be discovered andexecuted; or, finally, curses are directed against themurderous spirits, as by the Naga, for instance, whothreaten them with their spears and defy them toappear.Thus, when a man dies, society loses in him muchmore than a unit; it is stricken in the very principle ofits life, in the faith it has in itself. Consider theaccounts by ethnographers of the scenes of furiousdespair which take place when death sets in orimmediately after the expiry. Among the Warra-munga, for instance, men and women throw them-selves pell-mell on the dying person, in a compactmass, screaming and mutilating themselves atro-ciously. It seems that the entire community feelsitself lost, or at least directly threatened by thepresence of antagonistic forces: the very basis of itsexistence is shaken. As for the deceased, both victimand prisoner of evil powers, he is violently ejectedfrom the society, dragging his closest relatives withhim.But this exclusion is not final. In the same way asthe collective consciousness does not believe in thenecessity of death, so it refuses to consider it irrevoc-able. Because it believes in itself a healthy societycannot admit that an individual who was part of itsown substance, and on whom it has set its mark, shallbe lost for ever. The last word must remain with life:the deceased will rise from the grip of death and willreturn, in one form or another, to the peace ofhuman association. This release and this reintegra-tion constitute, as we have seen, one of the mostsolemn actions of collective life in the least advancedsocieties we can find. And when, closer to us, theChristian Church guarantees ‘the resurrection andthe life’ to all those who have fully entered it, itonly expresses, in a rejuvenated form, the promisethat every religious society implicitly makes to itsmembers.Only what was elsewhere the achievement of thegroup itself, acting through special rites, here be-comes the attribute of a divine being, of a Saviourwho by his sacrificial death has triumphed over deathand freed his disciples from it; resurrection, insteadof being the consequence of a particular ceremony, isa consequence, postponed for an indeterminateperiod, of God’s grace. Thus, at whatever stage ofreligious evolution we place ourselves, the notion ofdeath is linked with that of resurrection; exclusion isalways followed by a new integration.Once the individual has surmounted death, he willnot simply return to the life he has left; the separ-ation has been too serious to be abolished so soon.He is reunited with those who, like himself and thosebefore him, have left this world and gone to theancestors. He enters this mythical society of soulswhich each society constructs in its own image. Butthe heavenly or subterranean city is not a merereplica of the earthly city. By recreating itself beyonddeath, society frees itself from external constraintsand physical necessities which, here on earth, con-stantly hinder the flight of the collective desire.Precisely because the other world exists only in themind, it is free of all limitations: it is – or can be –the realm of the ideal. There is no longer any reasonwhy game should not be perpetually abundant in the‘happy hunting-grounds’ of the other world, or whyevery day of the eternal life should not be a Sunday tothe Englishman eager for psalms. Moreover, in somesocieties, the way in which earthly life ends is a kindof blemish; death spreads its shadow over this world,and the very victory that the soul has gained overdeath opens up for it an infinitely pure and morebeautiful life. These notions, of course, do notappear at first in a clear-cut and precise form. It isespecially when the religious society is differentiatedRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:14ampage 208A Contribution to the Study of the Collective Representation of Death208"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"from domestic or political social life that death seemsto free the believer from the bodily and temporalcalamities which kept him separated from Godwhile on earth. Death enables him, regenerated, toenter the community of Saints, the invisible churchwhich in heaven is worthy of being about the Lordfrom whom it proceeds. But the same conception ispresent, in a vague and concealed form, from thebeginning of religious evolution: in rejoining hisforefathers, the deceased is reborn transfiguredand raised to a superior power and dignity. Inother words, in the eyes of primitives, death is aninitiation.This statement is not a mere metaphor; if death,for the collective consciousness, is indeed the pas-sage from the visible society to the invisible, it is alsoa step exactly analogous to that by which a youth iswithdrawn from the company of women and intro-duced into that of adult men. This new integration,which gives the individual access to the sacred mys-teries of the tribe, also implies a profound change inhis personality, a renewal of his body and soul thatgives him the religious and moral capacity he needs.The similarity of the two phenomena is so funda-mental that this change is often brought about by thepretended death of the aspirant, followed by hisresurrection into a superior life.Death, as it is seen by the collective conscious-ness, should not be compared only with initiation.The close relationship that exists between funeralrites and rites of birth or marriage has often beennoticed. Like death, these two events give rise to animportant ceremony in which a certain anxiety ismixed with the joy. In all three cases, the mysticaldangers incurred must be guarded against, and puri-ficatory rites must be observed. The similarity ofthese practices expresses a basic analogy: marriagebrings about a double change of status; on the onehand it withdraws the fiance ́e from her own clan orfamily in order to introduce her into the clan orfamily of the husband; and on the other hand, ittransfers her from the class of young girls into thatof married women. As for birth, it accomplishes, forthe collective consciousness, the same transform-ation as death but the other way round. The individ-ual leaves the invisible and mysterious world that hissoul has inhabited, and he enters the society of theliving. This transition from one group to another,whether real or imaginary, always supposes a pro-found renewal of the individual which is marked bysuch customs as the acquisition of a new name, thechanging of clothes or of the way of life. This oper-ation is considered to be full of risks because itinvolves a stirring to action of necessary but danger-ous forces. The body of the new-born child is no lesssacred than the corpse. The veil of the bride and thatof the widow are of different colours, but theynonetheless have the same function, which is toisolate and set apart a redoubtable person.Thus death is not originally conceived as a uniqueevent without any analogue. In our civilisation, thelife of an individual seems to go on in approximatelythe same way from birth to death; the successivestages of our social life are weakly marked andconstantly allow the continuous thread of the indi-vidual life to be discerned. But less advanced soci-eties, whose internal structure is clumsy and rigid,conceive the life of a man as a succession of hetero-geneous and well-defined phases, to each of whichcorresponds a more or less organised social class.Consequently, each promotion of the individual im-plies the passage from one group to another: anexclusion, i.e. a death, and a new integration, i.e. arebirth. Of course these two elements do not alwaysappear on the same level: according to the nature ofthe change produced, it is sometimes the one andsometimes the other on which the collective atten-tion is focused, and which determines the dominantcharacter of the event; but both elements are in factcomplementary. To the social consciousness, death isonly a particular instance of a general phenomenon.It is easy for us to understand now why death haslong been looked upon as a transitory state of acertain duration. Every change of status in the indi-vidual, as he passes from one group to another,implies a deep change in society’s mental attitudetoward him, a change that is made gradually andrequires time. The brute fact of physical death isnot enough to consummate death in people’s minds:the image of the recently deceased is still part of thesystem of things of this world, and looses itself fromthem only gradually by a series of internal partings.We cannot bring ourselves to consider the deceasedas dead straight away: he is too much part of ourRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:14ampage 209Robert Hertz209"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"substance, we have put too much of ourselves intohim, and participation in the same social life createsties which are not to be severed in one day. The‘factual evidence’ is assailed by a contrary flood ofmemories and images, of desires and hopes. Theevidence imposes itself only gradually and it is notuntil the end of this prolonged conflict that we givein and believe in the separation as something real.This painful psychological process expresses itself inthe objective and mystical shape of the belief that thesoul only gradually severs the ties binding it to thisworld: it finds a stable existence again only when therepresentation of the deceased has acquired a finaland pacified character in the consciousness of thesurvivors. There is too deep an opposition betweenthe persisting image of a familiar person who is likeourselves and the image of an ancestor, who issometimes worshipped and always distant, for thissecond image to replace the former immediately.That is why the idea of an ‘intermediary state be-tween death and resurrection’ imposes itself, a statein which the soul is thought to free itself from theimpurity of death or from the sin attaching to it.Thus, if a certain period is necessary to banish thedeceased from the land of the living, it is becausesociety, disturbed by the shock, must graduallyregain its balance; and because the double mentalprocess of disintegration and of synthesis that theintegration of an individual into a new world sup-poses, is accomplished in a molecular fashion, as itwere, which requires time.It seems that society cannot for long becomeconscious of itself and of the phenomena whichconstitute its life except in an indirect way, after ithas been in a sense reflected in the material world.The infection which for a time takes possession of thebody, shows in a perceptible form the temporarypresence of evil spirits. The gradual destruction ofthe earthly body, which prolongs and completes theinitial assault, expresses concretely the state of be-wilderment and anguish of the community for solong as the exclusion of the deceased has not beencompleted. On the other hand, the reduction of thecorpse to bones, which are more or less unchange-able and upon which death will have no further hold,seems to be the condition and the sign of the finaldeliverance. Now that the body is similar to those ofits ancestors, there seems to be no longer any obs-tacle to the soul’s entering their community. It hasoften been remarked, and rightly, that there is a closerelationship between the representation of the bodyand that of the soul. This mental connection isnecessary, not only because collective thought isprimarily concrete and incapable of conceiving apurely spiritual existence, but above all because ithas a profoundly stimulating and dramatic character.The group requires actions that will focus the atten-tion of its members, orientate their imagination in adefinite direction, and which will inspire the belief ineverybody. The material on which the collectiveactivity will act after the death, and which will bethe object of the rites, is naturally the very body ofthe deceased. The integration of the deceased intothe invisible society will not be effected unless hismaterial remains are reunited with those of his fore-fathers. It is the action of society on the body thatgives full reality to the imagined drama of the soul.Thus, if the physical phenomena which constitute orfollow death do not in themselves determine thecollective representations and emotions, they never-theless help to give them the particular form thatthey present, and lend them a degree of materialsupport. Society projects its own ways of thinkingand feeling on to the world that surrounds it; and theworld, in turn, fixes them, regulates them, andassigns them limits in time.The hypothesis we have advanced above seemsconfirmed by the fact that in the very societieswhere the custom of secondary burial is predomin-ant certain categories of people are purposely ex-cluded from the normal funeral ritual.This is the case, firstly, with children. The OloMaanyan place a child less than seven years old in acoffin which will not be changed and which theycarry to the family burial place the very day of thedeath. A sacrifice performed the next day suffices toenable the soul, purified, to enter the realm of thedead at once. The mourning of even the father andmother lasts only a week. But the most commonpractice among the Dayak and the Papuans seems tobe to enclose the bodies of small children inside atree or to hang them in branches. The conceptunderlying this custom is clearly revealed to us bythe Dayak of Kutai: they believe that men come fromRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:14ampage 210A Contribution to the Study of the Collective Representation of Death210"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"the trees and must return there. That is why when aBahau woman bears a premature child, or if she hasbeen tormented by bad dreams during pregnancy,she can refuse the child by returning it to the treethat it has left either too early or in a worryingfashion. They obviously hope, as is explicitly statedof other peoples, that the soul will soon be reincar-nated, perhaps in the womb of the same woman, andwill this time make a more auspicious entry into thisworld. The deaths of children thus provoke only avery weak social reaction which is almost instantan-eously completed. It is as though, for the collectiveconsciousness, there were no real death in this case.Indeed, since the children have not yet enteredthe visible society, there is no reason to exclude themfrom it slowly and painfully. As they have not reallybeen separated from the world of spirits, they returnthere directly, without any sacred energies needingto be called upon, and without a period of painfultransition appearing necessary. The death of a new-born child is, at most, an infra-social event; sincesociety has not yet given anything of itself to thechild, it is not affected by its disappearance andremains indifferent.In various Australian tribes, old people who, be-cause of their great age, are incapable of taking partin the totemic ceremonies, who have lost their apti-tude for sacred functions, are buried immediatelyafter death instead of being exposed on a platform tillthe complete desiccation of their bones, as are othermembers of the tribe. This is so because, due to theweakening of their faculties, they have ceased toparticipate in social life; their death merely conse-crates an exclusion from society which has in factalready been completed, and which every one hashad time to get used to.Finally, the type of death also causes numerousexceptions to the normal ritual. All those who die aviolent death or by an accident, women dying inchildbirth, people killed by drowning or by light-ning, and suicides, are often the object of specialrites. Their bodies inspire the most intense horrorand are got rid of precipitately; furthermore, theirbones are not laid with those of other deceasedmembers of the group who have died a normaldeath. Their unquiet and spiteful souls roam theearth for ever; or, if they emigrate to anotherworld, they live in a separate village, sometimeseven in a completely different area from that in-habited by other souls. It seems, in the most typicalcases at least, that the transitory period extendsindefinitely for these victims of a special maledictionand that their death has no end.In cases of this kind it is not weakness of theemotion felt by the group which opposes the per-formance of normal funeral rites, but on the con-trary it is the extreme intensity and suddenness ofthis emotion. An analogy throws more light uponthis phenomenon. We have seen that birth, likedeath, frees dangerous forces which make motherand child taboo for a while. Usually these forcesgradually disperse and the mother can be freed.But if the event occurs in an unusual fashion – forinstance, if twins are born – then, according to theilluminating expression of the Ba-Ronga, ‘this birthis death’, for it excludes from normal life those whoseem fated to such a birth. It endows them with asacred character of such strength that no rite willever be able to efface it, and it throws the entirecommunity into a state of terror and consternation.Similarly, the sinister way in which some individualsare torn from this world separates them for everfrom their relatives: their exclusion is final andirremediable. For it is the last sight of the individual,as he was when death struck him down, whichimpresses itself most deeply on the memory of theliving. This image, because of its uniqueness andits emotional content, can never be completelyerased. So it is pointless to wait a certain period oftime in order then to reunite the deceased with hisancestors;reunionbeingimpossible,delayis senseless; death will be eternal, because societywill always maintain towards these accursed individ-uals the attitude of exclusion that it adopted fromthe first.The explanation we propose enables us thereforeto understand at the same time why in a given societydouble burial rites are practised, and why in certaincases they are not.Let us sum up briefly the results of our investi-gations.

A study of the data, however, reveals that therites of separation are few in number and verysimple, while the transition rites have a durationand complexity sometimes so great that they mustbe granted a sort of autonomy. Furthermore, thosefuneral rites which incorporate the deceased into theworld of the dead are most extensively elaboratedand assigned the greatest importance.Once again I must be satisfied with a few briefsuggestions. Everyone knows that funeral rites varywidely among different peoples and that furthervariations depend on the sex, age, and social positionof the deceased. However, within the extraordinarymultiplicity of detail certain dominant features maybe discerned, and some of these I shall class together.Funeral rites are further complicated when withina single people there are several contradictory ordifferent conceptions of the afterworld whichmay become intermingled with one another, so thattheir confusion is reflected in the rites. Further-more, man is often thought to be composed ofseveral elements whose fate after death is not thesame – body, vital force, breath-soul, shadow-soul,midget-soul, animal-soul, blood-soul, head-soul,etc. Some of these souls survive forever or for atime, others die. In the discussion that follows Ishall abstract from all these variations, since theyaffect the formal complexity of rites of passage butnot their internal structure.Mourning, which I formerly saw simply as anaggregate of taboos and negative practices markingan isolation from society of those whom death, in itsphysical reality, had placed in a sacred, impure state,1now appears to me to be a more complex phenom-enon. It is a transitional period for the survivors, andthey enter it through rites of separation and emergefrom it through rites of reintegration into society(rites of the lifting of mourning). In some cases, thetransitional period of the living is a counterpart ofthe transitional period of the deceased,2and theFrom Arnold van Gennep,The Rites of Passage, tr. Monika B.

Mourning requirements arebased on degrees of kinship and are systematized byeach people according to their special way of calcu-lating that kinship (patrilineally, matrilineally, bilat-erally, etc.) It seems right that widowers and widowsshould belong to this special world for the longesttime; they leave it only through appropriate rites andonly at a moment when even a physical relationship(through pregnancy, for example) is no longer dis-cernible. The rites which lift all the regulations (suchas special dress) and prohibitions of mourning shouldbe considered rites of reintegration into the life ofsociety as a whole or of a restricted group; they areof the same order as the rites of reintegration for anovice.During mourning, social life is suspended for allthose affected by it, and the length of the periodincreases with the closeness of social ties to thedeceased (e.g., for widows, relatives), and with ahigher social standing of the dead person. If the deadman was a chief, the suspension affects the entiresociety. There is public mourning, the proclamationof holidays, and, following the death of certain pettykings of Africa, a ‘‘period of license.’’ At this verymoment (1908) in China, new political, economic,and administrative necessities tend to mitigate theconsiderable effects on the society of the Emperor’sand Empress Regent’s deaths.4Formerly, social lifeeven in the households in China was completelysuspended on such occasions for many months –a suspension which in our time would be simplycatastrophic.The transitional period in funeral rites is firstmarked physically by the more or less extendedstay of the corpse or the coffin in the deceased’sroom (as during a wake), in the vestibule of hishouse, or elsewhere. But this stay is only an attenu-ated form of a whole series of rites whose import-ance and universality has already been pointed out byLafitau. ‘‘Among most savage nations, the deadbodies are only in safekeeping in the sepulchrewhere they have initially been placed. After a certaintime, new obsequies are given them, and what is duethem is completed by further funeral duties.’’5Thenhe describes the rites of the Caribs: ‘‘They areconvinced [that the dead] do not go to the land ofsouls until they are without flesh.’’ The existence of atransitional period also interested Mikhailowski.6The chief rite of this period consists of either remov-ing the flesh or waiting until it falls off by itself. Onthis idea are based, for instance, the ceremoniesperformed by the Betsileos of Madagascar, whohave a first series of rites while waiting for the corpseto decompose in its abode (where its putrefaction isaccelerated by a great fire) and then a second seriesfor the burial of the skeleton.7For others, the transition stage is sometimessubdivided into several parts, and, in the postliminalperiod, its extension is systematized in the form ofcommemorations (a week, two weeks, a month,forty days, a year, etc.) similar in nature to rites ofthe anniversary of a wedding, of birth, and some-times of initiation.Since funeral stages already have been closely stud-ied for Indonesia,8I shall use instances from datapertaining to other regions. The ceremonies of theTodas are similar to the Indonesian rites.9They in-clude cremation, preservation of the relics and burialof the ashes, and the erection of a circle of stonesaround them. The whole procedure lasts severalmonths. The dead go to Amnodr, a subterraneanworld, and there they are called ‘‘Amatol’’; theroute is not the same for all the clans, and it issurrounded with obstacles. The ‘‘bad’’ fall from athread which serves as a bridge into a stream onwhose shores they live for a while, mingling withindividuals from all sorts of tribes. The buffaloes alsogo to Amnodr.

The dead go by a long andtortuous route toward the north, where the dark andcold land of the dead is located.12The length of thejourney seems to coincide with the period duringwhich the doll is kept. Thus there is a series ofpreliminary rites, a transitional period, and a finalfuneral when the dead person reaches his final abode.The Northern Ostyaks place the land of the deadbeyond the mouth of the Ob, in the Arctic Ocean;13it is illuminated only by the light of the moon. Notfar from that world the road divides in three forkswhich lead to three entrances, one for the assassin-ated, the drowned, the suicides, etc., another for theother sinners, and a third for those who have lived anormal life. For the Irtysh Ostyak, the other world isin the sky. It is a lovely country reached by ascendingladders each three hundred to one thousand feetlong, or by climbing up a chain; from it the gods,the sacred bears (totems perhaps),14and the deadsometimes come back to earth – or so say the ancientlegends of the epics.15It seems to me that there mustbe a relationship between the length of time duringwhich the dolls are kept and the supposed duration ofthe journey into the other world.The funeral ceremonies of the Kol of India furnisha good example of a combination of known prophy-lactic rites with rites of passage.16Their order runsas follows: (1) Immediately after death the corpse isplaced on the ground ‘‘so that the soul should moreeasily find its way to the home of the dead,’’ which isunder the earth. (2) The corpse is washed andpainted yellow to chase away evil spirits who wouldstop the soul on its journey. (3) For the same purposethe assembled relatives and neighbors utter pitiablecries. (4) The corpse is placed on a scaffold with thefeet facing forward so that the soul should not findthe way back to the hut, and for the same reason theprocesion travels by detours. (5) The cortege mustnot include either children or girls; the women cry;the men are silent. (6) Each man carries a piece ofdry wood to throw on the pyre. (7) Rice and thetools of the deceased’s sex are placed there, and inthe mouth of the corpse there are rice cakes andsilver coins for the journey, since the soul retains ashadow of the body. (8) The women leave, and thepyre is lighted;17the litter is also burned to preventthe deceased’s return. (9) The men gather the calci-fied bones, place them in a pot, and bring the potback to the deceased’s house where it is hung from apost. (10) Grains of rice are strewn along the route,and food is placed in front of the door so that thedeceased, should he return in spite of all precautions,will have something to eat without harming anyone.(11) All the deceased’s utensils are carried far away,because they have become impure and because thedeceased may be hidden in them. (12) The house ispurified by a consecrated meal. (13) After a certaintime the ceremony of ‘‘betrothal,’’ or ‘‘union of thedeceased with the population of the lower world,’’ isperformed. Marriage songs are sung, there isdancing, and the woman who carries the pot leapswith joy. (14) A marriage retinue with music, etc.,goes to the village from which the deceased and hisancestors have originated. (15) The pot containingthe bones of the deceased is deposited in a smallditch, above which a stone is erected. (16) On theirreturn the participants must bathe. All those whohave been mutilated or who have died because of atiger or an accident remain evil spirits and cannotenter the land of the dead. That land is the home ofthe ancestors to which only persons who have beenmarried can go. They return to the earth from timeto time, and when they wish they are reincarnated inthe first-born (this holds especially for grandfathersand great-grandfathers).18This is not the place for a comparative descriptionof worlds beyond the grave.19The most widespreadidea is that of a world analogous to ours, but morepleasant, and of a society organized in the same way asit is here.

It logically follows that the children who havenot yet been incorporated into the society of theliving cannot be classified in that of the dead. Thus,for Catholics, children who die without baptismforever remain in the transition zone, or limbo; thecorpse of a semicivilized infant not yet named, cir-cumcised or otherwise ritually recognized, is buriedwithout the usual ceremonies, thrown away, orburned – especially if the people in question thinkthat he did not yet possess a soul.The journey to the other world and the entranceto it comprise a series of rites of passage whosedetails depend on the distance and topography ofthat world. First I should mention the Isles of theDead to be found in the beliefs of ancient Egypt,20Assyro-Babylonia,21the Greeks in various times andregions (cf. Hades of Book XI of theOdyssey),22theCelts,23Polynesians,24Australians,25and others.These beliefs undoubtedly are the reason for thepractice of giving the deceased a real or miniatureboat and oars. Some peoples see the other world as acitadel surrounded by walls (such as Sheol, theunderworld abode of the dead in Hebrew traditionwhich has bolted doors26or the Babylonian Aralu),27as a region with compartments (for instance, theEgyptian Duat), as situated on a high mountain (asdo the Dyaks), or in the interior of a mountain (as inHindu India).What is important to us in these cases is that, sincethe deceased must make a voyage,28his survivors arecareful to equip him with all the necessary materialobjects – such as clothing, food, arms, and tools – aswell as those of a magico-religious nature – amulets,passwords, signs, etc. – which will assure him of asafe journey or crossing and a favorable reception, asthey would a living traveler. Thus, in some particu-lars, these rites are identical with those discussed inchapter III. The Lapps, for instance, took care to killa reindeer on the grave so that the deceased mightride it during the difficult journey to his final destin-ation.29Some believed the journey lasted threeweeks, while others said three years.A great many similar customs could be men-tioned. The passage is marked, for instance, by theancient Greek rite of ‘‘the obol (coin) for Charon.’’30This rite has also been encountered in France, wherethe deceased was given the largest coin available, ‘‘sothat he would be better received in the otherworld.’’31The practice persists in modern Greece.Among the Slavs the money for the deceased isintended to pay the expenses of the trip, butamong Japanese Buddhists it is given to the oldwoman who runs the ferry across the Sanzu; theBadaga use it for the passage over the thread of thedead. Moslems cannot cross the bridge formed by asharpened sword unless they are pure or ‘‘good.’’ Inthe Zend-Avesta dogs guard the bridge of Chinvatjust as in the Rig-Veda Yama’s dogs, who are spottedand have four eyes, guard the paths that lead to oneof the ancient Hindu abodes beyond the grave, a sortof cavern, ‘‘a closed and covered enclosure’’ which isreached through a dark underworld.32Sometimes special powers – magicians, evilspirits, deities – are charged with showing the deadthe way, or with leading them in groups. (Those ofancient Greece are known as psychopompoi – guidesof souls to the afterworld.) This role of Isis and ofHermes-Mercury is quite well known. Among theMuskwaki (commonly known as Fox) at the lifting ofmourning the deceased is guided toward the prairiesof the next world by a young warrior who takes thename of the deceased, gallops for several miles,makes a detour, and returns. He retains that namehenceforth and is considered the adopted child of therelatives of the deceased.33The Luiseno Indians of California have a dramaticceremony which has the direct effect of sending thespirits of the dead away from the earth and ‘‘attach-ing,’’ or fastening, them, as if by a physical bond, tothe four sections of the sky and particularly to theMilky Way.34Because of the familiar themes combined in theHaida’s ideas about the next world, I shall describethem in some detail. The road to the afterworld leadsto the banks of a sort of bay; on the other side of it isthe land of souls, from which a self-propelled raft issent by a soul to the deceased. When he has arrivedon the other bank, the deceased begins the search forhis wife, which takes a very long time, since thevillages are scattered like those of the Haida andeach dead person has only one wife assigned tohim. When he is dying, a man indicates in whichvillage he wants to live, and messengers are sent toguide him on his voyage.

The dead send riches to their poor earthlyrelatives. In the land of the souls sacred dances areperformed, and everyone amuses himself. Beyondthat land lives a chief called Great Moving Cloud,who is responsible for the abundance of salmon.After some time in the land of souls the deceasedequips a canoe, reassembles his belongings, and amidthe lamentations of his companions goes away to acountry called Xada. This is his second death, and healso goes through a third and a fourth. Upon hisfifth death he returns to earth as a blue fly. Somethink the four deaths occur only after several humanreincarnations. There are different countries forthe drowned, for those dead by violent means,for shamans, and so forth.The funeral rites for a person who dies in theordinary way are given below. The face of the de-ceased is painted, a sacred headdress is placed on hishead, and he is seated on the bier, where he remainsfor four to six days. Special magical songs are sung,recited first by the members of the clan and then bythose of the opposite clan. All sorts of food and drinkand tobacco leaves are thrown into a ‘‘crying fire.’’These become multiplied many times and are takenby the deceased to the other world. Relatives put onthe signs of mourning – they shave their heads andstain their faces with pitch. The coffin is carried outthrough a hole in the wall and is taken to the gravehouse, where only the deceased of the same clan canbe placed.For ten days the widow fasts, uses a rock in placeof a pillow, and bathes daily without washing herface. Then she gathers some children of the oppositeclan and serves them a meal. (The Haida are exog-amous.) ‘‘This feast was called ‘causing one’s self tomarry.’ The object of it was that she might marrysomeone next time who had still more property,and that she herself and her new husband mighthave long lives and be lucky. Another informantadded that the widow went through regulationsmuch like those of a girl at puberty.’’35Briefly,while the purpose of the rites is to unite the corpsewith those of members of his clan and to providehim with what he will need during his voyage andin his sojourn beyond the grave, these rites are atthe same time prophylactic and animistic (theopening in the wall of the house, the coffin, thevault, etc., prevent a return of the deceased) orprophylactic and contagious (mourning, baths, etc.).The funeral rites of ancient Egypt furnish a goodexample of a system of rites of passage whose pur-pose is incorporation into the world of the dead.Here I shall examine only the Osirian ritual,36whosefundamental idea is the identification of Osiris andthe deceased on one hand, the sun and the deceasedon the other. I think there must at first have been twoseparate rituals which were unified on the theme ofdeath and rebirth. As Osiris the deceased is dismem-bered and then reconstituted; he is dead and is bornagain in the world of the dead, and so there are aseries of resurrection rites. As Ra (the sun), thedeceased dies each evening upon arrival at the edgeof Hades. His mummy is thrown into a corner andabandoned; but the series of rites it undergoesduring the night in the sun’s barge, revives him littleby little, and in the morning he is again alive andready to resume his daily journey in the light, abovethe world of the living. These multiple rebirths of thesun ritual have been combined with the single recon-stitution of the deceased upon his first arrival inHades, according to the Osirian ritual, so that thisreconstitution has come to take place daily. Theperformance of the converging rites is in accordancewith the general idea that the sacred, the divine, themagical, and the pure are lost if they are not renewedin periodic rites.The following is the syncretic pattern accordingto theBook of What Is in Hadesand theBook of theDoors.37Different conceptions of Duat (Hades)were current in different periods and places, butthrough fusions and combinations the priests ofThebes developed a complete plan. Hades was‘‘like an immense temple, very long, divided into acertain number of rooms separated by doors andhaving at each end an outside court and a pylon(gateway building) contiguous to both the insideworld and the outside world.’’38In the first hour ofthe night, when the sun was dead, he received in hisbarge the souls which were ‘‘pure,’’ that is, buried inaccordance with the proper rites and provided withthe necessary talismans, and the doors guarded bybaboons and spirits were opened to him. The deadRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:15am page 217Arnold van Gennep217"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"who did not go in the sun’s bark had to vegetateeternally in the vestibule.39According to theBook of the Doors, the doors wereidentical to those of fortresses and were guarded atthe entrance and the exit by a god in the form of amummy, at the bend by two uraei (cobras) emittingflames and nine mummy-gods; passage was obtainedby an incantation.40The journey is described in theGuide for the Traveller in the Other World.41For details Irefer the reader to the works cited, but I want tomention that each compartment was separated fromthe preceding one by doors whose opening had to besecured by ritual means. The names of the first threeand of the last are unknown; the names of the fourthand the doors following it were ‘‘the one which hidesthe corridors,’’ ‘‘the pillar of the gods,’’ ‘‘the oneadorned with swords,’’ ‘‘the portal of Osiris,’’ ‘‘theone which stands upright, motionless(?),’’ ‘‘theguardian of the flood,’’ ‘‘the great one of beings,the begetter of forms,’’ and ‘‘the one which inclosesthe gods of Hades.’’ At the exit there was also avestibule.These ‘‘opening of the doors’’ had a counterpartin the ritual of daily worship – the opening of thedoors of the naos (the part of the temple within thewalls): the cord was broken, the seal was removed,and the bolts were slid.42Then came the dismember-ment and reconstitution of the god, a rite which wasalso part of the funeral (opening the mouth,43etc.).The second opening of the naos reaffirmed the first.The god was washed with water and incense, dressedin sacred bands, and anointed with paint and per-fumed oils. Then the statue was replaced in the naosand installed on the sand, just like the mummy andthe statue of the deceased in the funerary ritual. Theritual closing of the naos which followed was theprincipal rite of departure from the sanctuary.44Thus the divine worship had for its object the dailyrevival of Ra-Osiris, just as the funeral rites both (1)revived the deceased and made him a god by mum-mification and various rites, and (2) prevented a realand final death by a reconstitution and nocturnalrebirth.45There are, therefore, parallels among thefuneral rites, the daily worship, the inauguration of atemple, and the ritual of enthronement.46The deathand rebirth, simultaneously, of Ra, Osiris, the king,the priest, and every deceased man who was ‘‘pure’’certainly constitutes the most extreme case knownto me of a dramatic representation of the death andrebirth theme. It should be added that birth into lifeon earth was in itself considered a rebirth.47All these rites of rebirth prevented the deceasedfrom dying again each day. The belief in such apossibility is found among many peoples, sometimescombined with the idea that after each death thedeceased passes from one abode to another, asamong the Haida. Among the Cheremiss, somegroups believe that the deceased dies only once,but others – for example, the Cheremiss of Vyatka– say that a man may die seven times and pass fromone world to another and that he is then changed intoa fish.48The Cheremiss rites consist of feeding thedeceased often at first and then periodically through‘‘commemorations.’’ The events of the afterlife ex-plain in part the alimentary and sumptuary rites ofthe Vogul and the Ostyak, some of whom believethat the soul of the deceased lives for a time in theworld under the sea or in the skies,49then diminisheslittle by little until it is only the size of a certain smallinsect or transforms itself into that insect, and thendisappears altogether.50The doctrine of worldssuperimposed on each other is widespread in Asiaand existed in Mithraism. (There were seven planet-ary worlds and successive initiations.)Like children who have not been baptized,named, or initiated, persons for whom funeral ritesare not performed are condemned to a pitiableexistence, since they are never able to enter theworld of the dead or to become incorporated inthe society established there. These are the mostdangerous dead. They would like to be reincorpor-ated into the world of the living, and since theycannot be, they behave like hostile strangers towardit. They lack the means of subsistence which theother dead find in their own world and consequentlymust obtain them at the expense of the living. Fur-thermore, these dead without hearth or home some-times have an intense desire for vengeance. Thusfuneral rites also have a long-range utility; theyhelp to dispose of eternal enemies of the survivors.Persons included among the homeless dead varyamong different peoples. In addition to those alreadymentioned, this category may include those bereft offamily, the suicides, those dead on a journey, thoseRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:15am page 218The Rites of Passage218"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"struck by lightning, those dead through the violationof a taboo, and others. What I have said holds ingeneral, but the same act does not have the sameconsequences among all peoples, and I want toreiterate that I do not claim an absolute universalityor an absolute necessity for the pattern of rites ofpassage.In this connection, I want to mention the diversebeliefs concerning the fate, in the next world, ofpersons who have committed suicide. Lasch isolatedfour categories: (1) Suicide is considered a normalact, and the fate of the person who has committed itis the same as that of the ordinary dead; in case ofserious illness, mutilation, etc., suicide may even bea means of insuring that the soul is in good conditionand not weakened or multilated, (2) Suicide isrewarded in the other world (suicide of the warrior,the widow, etc.). (3) The person who has committedsuicide cannot be incorporated with the other deadand must wander between the world of the dead andthat of the living. (4) Suicide is punished in the nextworld, and the individual must wander between thetwo worlds for the duration of the time he wouldnormally have lived, or he is admitted only to a lowerregion of the world of the dead, or he is punished bytortures, etc. (as in hell).51Obviously the characterof the funeral rites, those pertaining to prophylaxisand purification as well as rites of passage, differswith each one of the four categories.The rites of passage are present also in rites ofresurrection and reincarnation, for even if a soul hasbeen separated from the living and incorporated intothe world of the dead, it can also reverse the direc-tion and reappear among us, either by itself or underthe constraint of another person. The means aresometimes very simple. It may be sufficient for thesoul to be reincarnated in a woman and to reappearin the form of a child. That is the case, for instance,among the Arunta of Australia, who think that soulslies in wait in stones, trees, etc., and that from therethey leap into women who are young, fat, anddesirable. The rites of reintegration into the worldof the living which ensue are those that have beenstudied with reference to birth and naming.The ceremonies of the Lushae tribes of Assamfurnish a good example of the ‘‘eternal return.’’52The deceased is dressed in his best clothes and tied ina sitting position on a scaffold of bamboo, while nextto him are placed the tools and weapons of his sex. Apig, a goat, and a dog are killed, and all the relatives,friends, and neighbors divide the meat; the deceasedis also given food and drink. At nightfall he is placedin a grave dug right next to the house. His nearestrelative says goodbye and asks him to prepare every-thing for those who will come and join him. Thesoul, accompanied by those of the pig, the goat, andthe dog – without whom it would not find its way –goes dressed and equipped to the land of Mi-thi-hua,where life is hard and painful. But if the deceased haskilled men or animals on the hunt, or if he has givenfeasts to the whole village, he goes to a pleasantcountry on the other side of the river, where hefeasts continuously. Since women can neither fightnor hunt nor give feasts, they cannot go to thisbeautiful country unless their husbands take themthere. After a certain time, the soul leaves one or theother of these regions and returns to earth in theform of a hornet. After another lapse of time it istransformed into water and evaporates in the form ofdew, and, if a dewdrop falls on a man, that man willbeget a child who will be a reincarnation of thedeceased.53When the child is born, two chickensare killed, and the mother washes herself and thechild. The child’s soul spends the first seven daysperched like a bird on the clothes or the bodies of hisparents; for this reason they move as little as pos-sible, and during this time the household god isappeased with sacrifices. All sorts of ceremoniesfollow, and during one of them the nearest maternalrelative gives a name to the child – that is, the child ispermanently incorporated into the clan.Sometimes the souls of the dead are reincarnateddirectly into animals, vegetables, etc., especially intothe totems. In that case there are rites incorporatingthe deceased into totemic species.There is not always a special place beyond thegrave for the dead. At least it frequently happens thattheir abode is in the environs of the house, the tomb(called ‘‘the isba of the dead’’ by the Votyak), or thecemetery (called ‘‘village of the dead’’ by the Man-dan). In that case the burial is the real rite of incorp-oration in the world of the dead. This is very clearamong the Cheremiss. Perhaps as a result of theMoslem influence of the Tatars, the Cheremiss alsoRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:15am page 219Arnold van Gennep219"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"believe in a next world, analogous to the Ostyakheaven, which is reached by a pole forming abridge over a cauldron, or by a ladder. TheMordvinian dead also have their abode in the tombor the cemetery.54The bond with the living, andtherefore the transition, lasts for a longer time inthese instances, since, as has been pointed out, it isperiodically renewed by the living, either by com-munal meals or by visits or by feeding the deceased(through a hole in the ground and in the coffin, witha reed, by depositing food on the tomb, etc.). But amoment always comes when this tie is broken, afterbeing loosened bit by bit. The last commemorationor the last visit completes the rites of separation inrelation to the deceased and the reconsolidation ofthe society or restricted group of the living.The following is a list of rites of passage con-sidered in isolation; I make no claim that it iscomplete, any more than other lists given in thisvolume.Among rites of separation, some of which havealready been reviewed, it is appropriate to include:the various procedures by which the corpse is trans-ported outside; burning the tools, the house, thejewels, the deceased’s possessions; putting to deaththe deceased’s wives, slaves, or favorite animals;washings, anointings, and rites of purification ingeneral; and taboos of all sorts. In addition, thereare physical procedures of separation: a grave, acoffin, a cemetery, a wicker mat, places in thetrees, or a pile of stones is built or used in a ritualmanner; the closing of the coffin or the tomb is oftena particularly solemn conclusion to the entire cere-mony. There are periodic collective rites expellingsouls from the house, the village, and the tribe’sterritory. There are struggles for the corpse, wide-spread in Africa, which correspond to the bride’sabduction. Their true meaning seems not to havebeen understood up to now: it is that the living donot want to lose one of their members unless forcedto do so, for the loss is a diminution of their socialpower. These struggles increase in violence with thehigher social position of the deceased.55As for thedestruction of the corpse itself (by cremation, pre-mature putrefaction, etc.), its purpose is to separatethe components, the various bodies and souls. Onlyvery seldom do the remains (bones, ashes) constitutethe new body of the deceased in the afterlife, what-ever Hertz may think on the matter.56Among rites of incorporation I shall first mentionthe meals shared after funerals and at commemora-tion celebrations. Their purpose is to reunite all thesurviving members of the group with each other, andsometimes also with the deceased, in the same waythat a chain which has been broken by the disappear-ance of one of its links must be rejoined. Sometimesa meal of this sort also takes place when mourning islifted. When the funerals are observed in two stages(provisional and permanent), there is usually a com-munion meal for the relatives at the end of the first,and the deceased is thought to partake of it. Finally, ifthe tribe, clan, or village is involved, convocation bydrum, crier, or messenger gives the meal even moreof the character of a collective ritual.As for rites of incorporation into the other world,they are equivalent to those of hospitality, incorpor-ation into the clan, adoption, and so forth. They areoften alluded to in legends whose central theme is adescent to Hades or a journey to the land of the dead,and they are mentioned in the form of taboos: onemust not eat with the dead, drink or eat anythingproduced in their country, allow oneself to betouched or embraced by them, accept gifts fromthem, and so forth. On the other hand, drinkingwith a dead person is an act of incorporation withhim and the other dead, and it consequently enablesone to travel among them without danger, as doesthe payment of a toll (coins, etc.). There are otherspecial rites such as a club blow administered by thedead on a newcomer’s head,57the Christian sacra-ment of extreme unction, or the custom of placingthe deceased on the earth. Finally, the ‘‘dances of thedead’’ performed by certain American Indians, bythe Nyanja of Africa,58by members of secret soci-eties, and by other special magico-religious groupsshould perhaps be included in this category.NOTES1 Van Gennep,Tabou et tote ́misme a`Madagascar, pp. 40,58–77, 88, 100–3, 338–9, 342.2 This is what George Alexander Wilken had alreadyseen about Indonesia (‘‘Uber das Haaropfer: UndRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:15am page 220The Rites of Passage220"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"einige andere Trauergebra ̈uche bei den Vo ̈lken indo-nesiens,’’Revue coloniale internationale, 1886 and1887, see p. 254); he has been followed by RobertHertz, who generalizes his point (‘‘Contribution a`une e ́tude sur la repre ́sentation collective de lamort,’’Anne ́e sociologique, X [1905–6], 82–3, 101,105, 120).

If thedeceased was a man, the widow sleeps next to it;among the Irtysh Ostyak, according to Patkanov (DieIrtysch-Ostiaken, p. 146), the doll has in recent timesbeen replaced by the pillow and undergarments ofthe deceased.12 V.

Incidentally, there is no doubt that there wassome Christian infiltration into the beliefs of theVogul and the Ostyak (the devil, hell, punishment).14 See my summary in theRevue de l’histoire des religions,vol. XL (1899), of the monograph by N.

Dieterich(Mutter Erde, pp. 25–9) has collected parallels for thelatter practice, which he explains as ‘‘a return to thebosom of Mother Earth’’; it can be seen that here, atleast, this theory is not acceptable. I would like toadd that the Kol bury dead children but do not burnthem ‘‘because they do not have souls’’ (the Kolacquire a soul only on their wedding day) and donot have the right to go to the land of their ancestors,the purpose of cremation being to give access to it.Another of Dieterich’s theories (Mutter Erde, pp. 21–5) also collapses on this point.19 See, among others, Tylor,Primitive Culture, ch. xiii.20 On the subject of the fields and islands of Aaru, thejudgment and journey of the dead, see Gaston Mas-pe ́ro,Histoire ancienne des peuples de l’Orient classique,I(Paris: Hachette, 1895), 180ff., with bibliography.21Ibid., pp. 574ff.22 See, among others, Ervin Rohde,Psyche ́(2d edn.;Tu ̈bingen: J.

The final rebirth is se-cured on the twelfth hour, according to the Thebanritual, by the passage of the sacred barge, from tail tohead, across the gigantic serpent ‘‘The life of thegods’’ – symbol, says Jequier, of the renewal due tothe serpent’s ability to change skins each year (Le livrede ce qu’il y a dans l’Hade`s, pp. 132–3).

Our familywanted to have a simple funeral [ for him], but when the funeral company, which had conductedour mother’s funeral three years earlier, arrived to discuss it, we were told that it is not proper tohave a smaller funeral for our father than for our mother. The Buddhist temple priests nodded inagreement with the funeral professionals. As a result, we purchased a 2 million yen coffin for ourfather, a million yen more expensive than that of our mother, and had three priests instead of two.One can imagine [what funeral professionals will say] when our turn comes; they will explain [toour children], ‘‘for your grandfather’s funeral your father purchased the most expensive coffin.’’‘‘The Halt of the Salt-Purification Rite in Funeral Ceremonies,’’Asabi ShimbunBefore the Rites of SeparationThe handling of the deceased, whether transporting,dressing, or bathing, is the most important responsi-bility of funeral professionals. Near the end ofmy fieldwork at Moon Rise, a colleague told meabout a funeral professional who had failed inthis responsibility and was subsequently fired.My colleague told me that, while this funeral profes-sional was transporting the deceased and hisfamily from a hospital to the Moon Rise funeralhall, the back door of the company van had openedand the coffin had slid onto the street and fallenopen; the deceased had landed face down on thepavement with an upturned coffin beside him. (Ap-parently the back door of the van had not beensecurely locked.) The family members were furious;enraged, they shouted at the professional that he hadinjured (kizu wo tsuketa) the deceased, who wasalmost hit (hikareru tokoro datta) by a car behindthe van. The funeral professional knelt on the pave-ment, touching his forehead to the ground, andapologized to the family in a continuous kowtow.The family’s ire did not dissipate, however, until themanagers had apologized and offered to pay for theentire funeral.From Hikaru Suzuki, ‘‘The Phase of Negated Death,’’ inThe Price of Death: The Funeral Industry in Contemporary Japan(Stanford: Stanford UnityPress, 2000).Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:15am page 224224"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"What was manifested in this episode was theperception of the continued life of the deceased inthe eyes of the family. Although dead in the medicalor physical sense, the deceased was not yet acknow-ledged to be dead. Japanese believe that a personexperiences death twice, once at the hospital andagain at cremation. The pronouncement of death bya doctor does not complete the deceased’s death; it isonly after cremation that the finality of death isattained. As Ebersole points out in reference to theIzanami and Izanagi in Nihonshoki myth (where‘‘Izanami’s entry into Yomi and her ‘death’ are notviewed permanent until Izanagi breaks the taboo ofentering the burial hall and view[ing] the corpse’’),‘‘the finality of death is a result of the actions of theliving’’ (Ebersole 1989, 88).Contemporary Japanese funeral ceremonies nor-mally take two to three days. Several events occurbefore the funeral ceremony, starting with the an-nouncement of death, followed by the transportationof the deceased, the consultation (uchiawase), thebathing ceremony (yukan), and the wake (tsuya).These performances of commercial funerals, how-ever, have different meanings from those of commu-nity funerals. In community funerals, rituals ofsosho ̄(attempted resuscitation) were executed immedi-ately after death. In contemporary funerals theperiod from death at a hospital to the end of a funeralceremony can also be called a phase ofsoseior‘‘resurrection,’’ but for a different reason. In com-munity funerals the bereaved conducted a series ofrituals to resuscitate the deceased by attempting tocall back the spirit that had escaped from the body; intoday’s ceremony the living neither consider death aresult of spirit ascendance nor attempt ritual resusci-tation. The deceased is treated as if still alive, anddeath is delayed until the end of the funeral.On the morning of November 29, 1994, theMoon Rise telephone rang at 10:00 a.m. The recep-tionist answered it. ‘‘It has happened’’ (hassei desu),she announced to the funeral staff in the room. AtMoon Rise, the term ‘‘happen’’ (hassei) indicates thatsomeone has died. She looked around to see whocould take the call. It was another busy morning;recent deaths and funeral ceremonies in progresswere all vying for attention. Most of the funeralstaff were out of the office, at hospitals, at thehomes of the deceased, and in the different roomsor halls of the auditorium. She put the call through toTomi, who had been organizing another ceremonyschedule.Tomi reached for a notepad and a pencil. Heopened his conversation with a sympathetic phrasethat is used when hearing news of a death in a family.‘‘I am very sorry for the loss of your family member’’(konotabiwa makotoni goshu ̄sho ̄sama deshita). I noticedthat the funeral staff spoke this sympathetic phraseonly once during the initial conversation with thedeceased’s family. Tomi quickly switched to a busi-nesslike manner and said, ‘‘I am sorry, but I need toask you several questions concerning the deceased.’’He asked the person’s name, gender, and age; thename of the chief mourner; the place where theperson had died; the time of death; and the addressand phone number of the person’s home. Then heasked if the deceased was a Mutual-Aid Cooperativemember (gojokai-kaiin); what religion and which sectthe deceased belonged to; and what price of coffinthe family desired. If the deceased had purchased aMutual-Aid Cooperative (MAC) membership, therewas a specific set of funeral materials providedaccording to the price of the MAC membershipfee. If the deceased was a MAC member, the familycould simply ask for the prepaid coffin. However, theitems provided on the membership installment planare usually the inexpensive ones, and it is commonfor the funeral staff to provide information about ahigher-priced range of coffins. Funeral staff alwaysend the conversation by reassuring the family thatthey are on their way. ‘‘Please feel at ease; we will beseeing you as soon as we can get ready,’’ Tomi saidand hung up the phone.As soon as the phone call was completed, Tomiand Mitake, an assistant, began packing the neces-sary materials. First, they put the ¥100,000coffin that the deceased’s family had chosen into acompany hearse. Because the deceased was a Bud-dhist belonging to a Jodoshinshu ̄sect, they packed aJodoshinshu ̄coffin cover (kan-ooi) and the braided-string decoration that goes with the cover (sutachi). Itis important to know what religion and sect thedeceased belonged to; this determines the type ofcoffin cover and other funeral materials. Whether asword (morigatana) is necessary or not also dependsRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:15am page 225Hikaru Suzuki225"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"on the specific Buddhist sect. For instance, theNichirensho ̄shu ̄and Jodoshinshu ̄sects do not requirethe sword. Also, for the Buddhist sects of Jodoshin-shu ̄, Shingonshu ̄,Jo ̄doshu ̄, Zenshu ̄(So ̄to ̄, Ohbaku,or Rinzaishu ̄), Nichirenshu ̄, and Tendaishu ̄, coffincovers are made of thick silk in bright colors suchas red, purple, or orange with gold and have largeflower designs on them. In contrast, the Nichiren-shoshu ̄sect and Shinto ̄use white and silver withdiagonally striped designs. For Christians, the coffincover is black velvet with a silver cross stitched onthe front. Death garments differ for Buddhist andShinto ̄members as well.Other objects that are packed include: dry ice cutinto rectangular shapes; a box of stationery (tebunko),necessary during a wake and funeral ceremony; a pairof coffin stands (kandai); deodorants (bo ̄shu ̄zai); achrysanthemum; a death robe (shinisho ̄zoku); candles;a candle stand (ro ̄sokutate); a vase; and incense (senko ̄).For Nichirenshoshu ̄, Shinto ̄, and Christians, thechrysanthemum is not necessary. Without muchtalk, the two men loaded these items quickly intothe van. Moon Rise has three types of hearses. Theone used most often is an ordinary white van that hasbeen altered to leave room for a coffin and twopassenger seats in the back. The minibus is largerthan the van and has eight passenger seats as well asspace for a coffin. The stretcher hearse is a blackCadillac that has been modified with a stretcher onthe left and two passenger seats on the rear right. Thishearse is used when the family members cannotdecide on the price of the coffin at the time of theinitial phone call, or when a family member specific-ally states that they do not want to put the deceased ina coffin until he or she is taken home, in which casethe body is laid on the stretcher. All of these hearseshave black lace curtains so that they can be immedi-ately distinguished from other vans on the street.They are used specifically for transporting the deadfrom hospitals to their homes or to the funeralauditorium. Although these hearses could be usedfor transporting the body to the crematorium afterthe funeral, they are unpopular for that purpose. Infact, MAC members can use these hearses free ofcharge but rarely choose to do so, preferring thelavishly decorated golden hearse for the trip to thecrematorium.I joined Tomi in the van as soon as the coffin andother materials were loaded. Mitake led the way inanother van. In most cases two funeral staff memberswork together at the initial stages of greeting thefamily of the deceased. Working in pairs speeds theencoffining; having two vans is convenient if the be-reavedneedaridehomeor totheauditoriumfromthehospital. As usual, Mitake raced past other cars,speeding along, and we followed closely in the secondvan.Itiscustomaryforfuneralstafftorushtohospitalswhatever the traffic conditions; I noticed that policenever stop them for speeding.The hospital we went to that day was a modern,beautifully designed structure. From the outside itlooked almost like a hotel. There was even a small giftshop on the first floor, unusual in Japan.1The hos-pital, Tomi told me,had beenbuilt recently bythe citygovernment and accepted only city officials and theirfamily members. Tomi remarked that just by knowingthe name of a hospital he could guess the approximatesocial status of the patients and their family. Com-panies often built hospitals for their workers, al-though private hospitals for the general public arealso stratified by cost. Passing the entrance andparking spaces in front, we drove into the basementto the back door of the hospital, unloaded the coffinonto a hospital gurney, and headed to the room for thesoul.2The room for the soul (reianshitsu, literally, thepeaceful room for the soul) was on the top floor. Ingeneral, those who die are segregated immediatelyfrom other patients. In most hospitals, the room forthe soul is located at the back or in the basement.Tomi explained that modern hospitals have relocatedthe room nearer to the sky than to the ground, in anattempt to change the common dark image of death.On our way there, we passed spacious tatami roomswhere family and relatives could wait for the funeralstaff. Pretty pastel-colored sofas and small tables linedthe corridor. Sunlight and fresh air entered throughtall windows. This hospital was distinctly differentfrom most others, where the rooms of the deceasedhave few or no windows and smell of antiseptic.Transporting the DeceasedThe deceased had been laid on a bed across from thedoor. The body was covered with a comforter andthe face with a white cloth. I could only see the longRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:15am page 226The Phase of Negated Death226"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"braided black hair. A young woman and a middle-aged man were standing in front of the body. (Laterwe learned that the man was the father and thewoman the sister of the deceased.) A narrow pieceof stained glass resembling a church window hung onthe wall where the deceased lay. In one corner of theroom on a table was a set of materials for burningincense sticks (sho ̄ko ̄). After bowing and introducingthemselves, Tomi and Mitake confirmed that theman was the Mr. Yamaha who had called MoonRise. The funeral staff explained that they wouldbegin preparing for the departure. They rolled thetable with the incense to the bed. Tomi lit a candle onthe table and asked Yamaha and his daughter Sanae toburn incense. The father chose an incense stick, lit itwith the candle flame, and placed it in the incensepot (ko ̄ro). He then pressed his hands together infront of his chest and bowed to the deceased. Sanaeand each funeral staff member followed and offeredincense. Since the medical staff had not alreadyoffered incense to the deceased, we waited forthem to do so.While waiting, Tomi asked the relatives if theywould like to have a bathing ceremony for the de-ceased. He explained that although the body is wipedclean with antiseptics by nurses, a bathing ceremonyprovides a true bath for the deceased. ‘‘We use a realbathtub. Wouldn’t you like to have her bathed for thelast time in this life?’’ asked Tomi. Yamaha and Sanaelooked at each other. ‘‘Will I be able to put makeup onYoshiko one last time with my own hands?’’ Sanaeasked. ‘‘Certainly,’’ Tomi answered. When Sanae wasassured that she could, the father said, ‘‘Please goahead with that [bathing ceremony]’’ (so ̄shite kudasai).Tomi then asked if the father planned to have awake athome or at the auditorium. The father said that hewanted to have both the wake and the funeral at thefuneral auditorium, but wished to take Yoshiko homefirst. ‘‘My daughter Yoshiko was very sick for half ayear and [during that time] she couldn’t even comeback home once,’’ he explained. ‘‘I am sorry to hearthat,’’ Tomi said in a sympathetic tone. Their conver-sation stopped; the medical staff had finally arrived.The medical staff burned incense for the deceasedin the hierarchical order of doctors first, then seniornurses, and finally the younger nurses. When all thepeople who had cared for the dead woman hadoffered her incense, Tomi extinguished the candleand moved the table to its original position. Nursesand doctors bowed to Yamaha and left; there was noconversation between the medical staff and thefamily.When they were alone again, Tomi asked thefather’s permission to begin the preparation of thebody. ‘‘Yes, please,’’ the father answered with a nod.Sometimes the family wants to help, but most of thetime, as in the case of Yamaha and his daughter, theychose to watch the funeral staff perform their tasks.The Buddhist death garments are laid out first;they are completely white and consist of a triangularhead cloth (zukin), a pair of hand guards (tekko ̄), arobe (kyo ̄-katabira), a pair of knee guards, a pair ofJapanese-style socks (shiro-tabi), and beads (juzu).The comforter was removed from the corpse (theface cloth was not taken away at this time), revealingthe body of Yoshiko in heryukata(Japanese gown, athin kimono).Tomi and Mitake shared the task of putting on thedeath garments. The hand guards and knee guardswere easily placed, but putting on Japanese socks canbe time-consuming because the big toes must fit intothe division for them. Anchoring the beads betweenthe fingers is often the most difficult part of theprocess. When the deceased has just passed awayand rigor mortis has not set in, the hands laid onthe chest easily fall apart. Sometimes hospital nurseshave already tied the hands together with a cord, butin this case they had not. The funeral staff had tostruggle to keep the hands and beads in place.3Whenall of death garments were in place, except for thehead cloth,4Tomi gently removed the white clothcovering the face of Yoshiko, and she was ready to beencoffined.The coffin, which had been left outside of theroom on the stretcher, was brought in. The coffinstands were set on the floor, the coffin placed onthem, and the lid removed. Tomi supported Yoshi-ko’s neck and head while Mitake lifted her feet.Yoshiko was so light they were able to carry hereasily to the coffin without any help. (The funeralstaff sometimes ask family members or nurses forhelp if the body is particularly heavy.) When thedeceased was encoffined, the funeral staff opened afresh packet of a deodorant set, which contains fourRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:15am page 227Hikaru Suzuki227"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"fragrance bags and a small perfume spray. The fra-grance bags were placed at the top, left, and rightand beneath the deceased, and the perfume wassprayed directly onto the interior of the coffin. Theperfume is sufficiently powerful to be effective forthe rest of the day. Next, the four rectangular dry iceblocks were placed directly on the deceased’s body –one on the chest, two on the stomach, and one on thefeet. Last, Yoshiko was covered with two blanketsand the lid of the coffin was closed. When the brightorange coffin cover and the braided purple stringwere in place on the coffin, it was ready to leave.The funeral staff lifted the coffin onto the gurneyand rolled it to the elevator door while the rest of usfollowed. We all entered the elevator and got out atthe basement where our van was parked; Tomi andMitake loaded the coffin into the van. Sanae decidedto come with us so she could remain with Yoshiko.Sanae sat in the back of the van beside the coffin. Thefather said he would drive his car and lead us to hishouse. With nurses sending us off at the back gate,we left the hospital.5In more than half of the cases in which a personhas died in a hospital, the funeral staff are asked totake the body home first. Often the deceased hadexpressed feelings of homesickness while hospital-ized, or the family has missed the deceased and wantsall the family members to be united one last time.While we were taking the body home, Sanae con-tinued to sob with her arm on the coffin. The silenceat the red traffic light emphasized the sound of herweeping. Tomi called to her and said, ‘‘Cheer up,Miss Yamaha, we will be home very soon.’’ Sanaeanswered ‘‘Yes’’ (hai), quietly.We arrived at the deceased’s home, an apartmenton the third floor of a newly built condominium.Tomi and Mitake helped Sanae out of the van. Theythen checked the width of the elevator and stairs.The elevator was too small to carry the coffin hori-zontally – a problem because the deceased mustalways be transported in a lying posture – so theycould not use the elevator. Although the stairs werevery narrow and steep, they were the only choice.‘‘Customers are deities’’ (okyakusama wa kamisamadesu), Tomi later told me. I responded, ‘‘You mean,the deceased are deities.’’ ‘‘You got me on this one’’(ippon yarareta) was his reply.The coffin was carried with extreme care sincestriking the coffin in any way would be consideredrude, inconsiderate, and immoral behavior on thepart of the funeral staff. It was the beginning ofwinter, but perspiration was rolling down both themen’s faces. After ten minutes of struggle on thestairs, they were able to safely negotiate the coffininto the apartment. The apartment was very clean. Inoticed Tomi surveying the rooms while he wasworking.Yoshiko was welcomed by family members andrelatives who were waiting inside. ‘‘You are finallyback,’’ the women in the house sobbed as the coffinwas set down in the room beside the kitchen. Mitakebrought materials for burning incense from his vanand prepared them for the family. One by one, eachfamily member and relative burned a stick of in-cense. The window of the coffin was opened andthe family began telling Yoshiko how much theymissed her.The family wanted to keep the deceased at homeuntil other family members arrived. They said theywould call us when they were ready to transport thedeceased to the auditorium. We headed back to theauditorium to wait for their call. On the way back,Tomi told me that he once had to carry a deceased allthe way up to the twentieth floor. ‘‘Japanese eleva-tors in these condominiums are too narrow,’’ hecomplained. ‘‘Do Americans have the custom oftaking the deceased back to their home?’’ he askedme. When I said I hadn’t heard of such a case, hecommented with a little envy, ‘‘American funeralprofessionals must have an easier time than we do.’’The father called two hours later and was requestedto prepare a photo of the deceased as well as his ownseal (inkan).6The funeral staff returned to thefamily’s home and collected the coffin to take tothe auditorium; the family followed them in theircar.Moon Rise’s Kokura Funeral Auditorium has fivefuneral halls (equipped with chairs) and six tatamirooms. Each hall and room has a name instead of anumber to make it easy to find and avoid confusion.The Yamaha family was taken to the tatami roomcalled the Moon Room (tsuki-no-ma) on the firstfloor. On the left-hand side of the room there wasa funeral altar.

Yamaha was sitting alone near Yoshiko. Itseemed that the rest of the family had left for awhile to do errands. This was my first chance totalk to him. ‘‘I am so sorry about your daughter’sdeath,’’ I began. He nodded and told me that Yoshikohad become ill in June and within six months wasmuch worse. ‘‘She passed away when none of us hadtime enough to care for her. It is often said thatchildren who die earlier than their parents are bring-ing unhappiness to parents [oyafuko ̄-mono], but I don’tblame her. It really was not her fault.’’ ‘‘Sickness isnot a crime,’’ I agreed. He continued telling me howmuch he regretted that he had not taken enough careof her; he seemed to feel that Yoshiko’s death was hisfault. I served him green tea, which he accepted withhis head down. I left quietly.Thirty minutes later I took freshly cooked rice andrice balls to the Yamaha family’s room. This timeSanae was sitting alone near the coffin, looking at herdead sister and sobbing. She stopped crying when Ientered the room. I set the rice bowl and rice ballson the small table. The room, saturated withmourning, was totally silent. Not knowing whatexactly should be said, I told her that the auditoriumprepares these foods for the deceased but that shewas welcome to bring other items or food for hersister if she wished. She nodded and said, ‘‘Any-thing?’’ I said nothing made out of metal but anythingthat could be burned.8I asked her how old Yoshikowas. Sanae told me that Yoshiko was only 29. ‘‘Shewent so quickly, without enjoying her life,’’ Sanaesobbed. There is a Japanese saying that those who arepretty and well liked die young (bijin-bakumei); I toldSanae that Yoshiko must have been such a person.‘‘Yes, she was a good-natured person,’’ Sanae replied.‘‘She suffered so much at the end, but after she diedher face became peaceful at last. Don’t you thinkso?’’ She was looking at her sister through the coffinwindow. I agreed that Yoshiko looked peaceful. Thiswas my first encounter with the death of someonearound my age; the experience made me think aboutmy own life, and the grief of the Yamaha family left adeep mark in my memory.[...]The Bathing CeremonyTraditionally, the bathing ceremony (yukan) wasperformed to cleanse the impurity of the deceasedand further safeguard both the deceased and theliving from death pollution. The ritual was per-formed by close family members at home. Thebathing ritual ceased after World War II, in partbecause of a decrease in deaths occurring in thehome and an increase in hospital deaths, wherenurses wipe the body with antiseptic.9Having intro-duced a commercialized bathing service in Novem-ber 1994, Moon Rise now has a contract with aBathing Service Company called CSC, and CSCreinstated the old custom as part of the contempor-ary funeral ceremony, for an additional charge of¥50,000.Hirata and Oka, who work for CSC and MoonRise, met the Yamaha family after Tomi had finishedhis consultation. They bowed first and asked imme-diately who the chief mourner was. They both kneltin front of the deceased’s father, and Oka sincerelystated the words of condolence (okuyami no kotoba)and followed them with a deep bow. She then apolo-gized to the family members in advance that thebathing staff would be moving around the roomconstantly during the ceremony. She also askedwhich religion the deceased had belonged to so thatshe would not use the wrong type of death garments.A clean fluffy futon was brought in and placednear the body. (All the necessary accoutrements arebrought in the CSC vans.) A nylon sheet was laid inthe middle of the tatami room and the tub wasbrought in. Next, the coffin was opened. A bigbath towel was slipped beneath the body; Hiratagrasped both sides of the towel and twisted thetowel over the deceased’s body to make a handle tolift the deceased. Hirata and Oka took hold of thetowel and the deceased’s neck and legs, lifted her,and laid her gently on the futon. This method oflifting the deceased was used throughout theceremony.The nightgown and some parts of the death gar-ments that Tomi and Mitake had put on her at thehospital were removed. When Yoshiko was com-Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:15am page 229Hikaru Suzuki229"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"pletely naked, a large white towel was laid on top ofher, covering her body. Her hands and fingers weretaken out of the pressed-together position. Thebathing staff then began to massage the deceased’sjoints; by this time rigor mortis had begun to set in.The staff bent her arms, wrists, and hands intodifferent positions to loosen the stiffness. Thenthey carried her to the bathtub in the towel. Thebody of the deceased is laid on a stretcher-cum-hammock that hangs inside the tub; this designallows water and soap to drain through while thedeceased is being washed. On one side of the tubthere are three rubber hoses connected to the van;two hoses provide hot and cold water, and the thirdvacuums out the used water after the ceremony iscompleted.When Yoshiko was on the stretcher, Hirata ex-plained that the traditional bathing ceremony wasmeant to cleanse the deceased of the impurities ofthis world before her soul’s departure to Buddha-hood. Then he brought out a wooden bucket (oke)and a wooden ladle (shaku) with a long handle.Following the custom of the traditional bathing cere-mony, he added cold water to the hot water in thebucket to make the water warm (which is the oppos-ite of the usual way to make warm water). Hirataexplained that the initial stage of the ceremony, ‘‘thesplashing of water,’’ would be performed by thefamily members, and he described to them how todo it. The person should stand in front of the de-ceased and hold the wooden bucket in the right handand the wooden ladle in the left. Then the personshould scoop the warm water out of the bucket in onemovement and pour it on the deceased, beginningwith the lower part of the body and working up to theheart. Hirata warned the Yamahas not to add morewater to the ladle before emptying it completely.Returning a partially full ladle to the bucket is likecalling back the soul to this life and would confuse thedeceased (whose soul should travel toward Buddha-hood, not back toward life). The Yamahas rose andtook turns performing as they had been instructed.The splashing of water (particularly the way thewater was mixed, the use of wooden bucket andladle, and the prohibition against refilling the ladlebefore it was emptied) is closely connected to theconcept of impurity in traditional funeral rituals.Everything, from preparing the warm water to thematerials used, was performed contrary to usualeveryday practices. Hirata explained that non-ordin-ary behavior by the living indicated the irreversibilityof the deceased’s death so that the person woulddepart from this world. The performance of pouringwater, during which a family member is not allowedto add water in the midst of the ritual act, alsodenotes that the deceased is forbidden fromreturning to or staying longer with the living. Thebathing ritual was intended to make clear to thedeceased the distinction and the boundary betweenthis world and the world after. What lay behind thisperformance during community funerals had beenfear that the malevolent spirit (onryo ̄) would harmthe living. However, in the commercialized bathingceremony, the staff members put little emphasis onthe concept of impurity, and the performance of therituals is designed to bring the family memberstogether and let them be part of the ceremony.The remainder of the bathing service was verydifferent from the traditional bathing ritual; therewas no mention of impurity again by the bathingstaff. After the family had taken turns wetting thebody, Hirata asked them to sit down while the staffperformed the rest of the ceremony. Oka beganwashing Yoshiko’s toes with body soap and a fluffybath sponge. During this time, Yoshiko’s torso waskept covered with a white towel. Oka soaped herfrom her toes, up her legs and arms. Hirata sham-pooed her hair, and when that was finished, hehelped Oka wash the chest, stomach, and abdomen.The front part of the body is uncovered by lifting thetowel up toward the family. While Oka was soapingthe body, Hirata kept his back toward the family,effectively blocking their view. The two worked in acoordinated rhythm, assisting each other in washingevery part of Yoshiko’s body. Hirata lifted the torsoforward so that Oka could sponge her back.10Whenall of the body had been soaped, they rinsed off thelather with warm water from a shower head. Thenthey dried her with many bath towels. Yoshiko waslifted so that thick cotton could be put between thebuttocks and legs. The towel covering her was ex-changed for a fresh large white one. Then Hirataasked Yamaha and Sanae to come forward to dryYoshiko’s face. Hirata handed a fresh towel to theRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:15am page 230The Phase of Negated Death230"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"father. This was for the sake of performance becausethe deceased had been dried completely by thebathing staff.The deceased was carried back to the futon bymeans of the wrapped and twisted towel. The deathrobe had been spread neatly on the futon earlier; itwas a simple matter to place the deceased on top ofit. Yoshiko was then dressed in a new set of deathgarments: a white gown (kyo ̄-katabira), knee guards,and Japanese-style socks (shiro-tabi). Those that hadbeen used at the hospital were discarded. When thedeceased was dressed, her hands were pressed to-gether and a pair of hand guards (tekko ̄) and beads(juzu) were carefully attached.Oka knelt on the tatami near Yoshiko’s face. Sheremoved the cotton from inside the nose, ears, andmouth where the hospital nurses had placed it. Sheused long, narrow pieces of fresh cotton for the noseand ears, and thicker, wider cotton for the mouth;this helps form aesthetically shaped cheeks and lips.Then Oka asked Sanae if she would like to apply themakeup. (Usually Oka applies the makeup, but inthis case Tomi had passed on the information that thesister had requested to do so.) Sanae brought out herown makeup kit. While she applied foundation to thedeceased, the aunt, Mariko, approached to observethe process. Sanae and Mariko began talking to thedeceased: ‘‘You are so clean. I’m so glad you had achance to take a bath; you couldn’t take a bath for along time, could you?’’ Their conversation dreweveryone near. Soon family and relatives all com-mented to each other how fresh Yoshiko looked afterher bath. Meanwhile, Sanae was asking the deceasedher color preferences. ‘‘Yoshiko, do you preferbrown eye shadow? Is red lipstick O.K.?’’ As ifYoshiko had replied, Sanae went on, ‘‘Yes, I knowyou always liked bright red.’’ As soon as Sanae com-pleted the makeup, Mariko murmured, ‘‘You look sobeautiful, as if you were a bride.’’ The statementtriggered the emotions of the entire family; theybroke into sobs. The deceased had died young andnever married.Meanwhile, Hirata had been cleaning the tub andputting it back into the van. When he returned, heasked the father to help him lay Yoshiko in the coffin.When she was settled in the coffin, he began the laststage of the bathing ceremony – the decorationaround the deceased’s face with white cotton andcloth. One pack of cotton, about the size of a bigcushion, was used to make a frame for the face. Okacut a flat rectangular sheet of cotton into four narrowrectangular pieces and handed them to Hirata, whocarefully laid each piece around the deceased’s facelike a picture frame. The cotton was added in manylayers to give depth. A triangular head cloth (zukin)was arranged on top of the deceased’s head. Okahanded blocks of dry ice wrapped in white flannelcloth to Hirata, who placed them on the stomach.Two comforters, one white and gold and one purewhite, were used to cover Yoshiko’s body. At thispoint, the finale of the bathing ceremony, Hiratacalled the family members for the last performance:all family members held the coffin lid and shut thecoffin. Hirata laid the coffin cover and the decorationstring on the coffin but kept the window open forviewing. The small incense table that had been movedout of the way was put back in front of the coffin. Thecandle and incense were lit again. Hirata knelt downfacing family and relatives and said, ‘‘We have con-cluded the bathing ceremony. I am sure the next fewdays are going to be very difficult for you. I hope youwill all take care of your health. Thank you for yourpatience today.’’ We bowed to the family while kneel-ing on the tatami floor. The family bowed back to usand said, ‘‘Thank you for all you have done.’’ Webowed once again at the door. The whole bathingceremony had taken about an hour and a half.The reactions of the deceased’s family during bathingceremonies varied according to the age and gender ofthe deceased, as well as the cause of death. Theatmosphere of the bathing ceremony describedabove was very emotional because Yoshiko was ayoung unmarried woman. She had much unfinishedbusiness and was pitied for the unfortunate illnessthat had struck her down so quickly.In contrast, the bathing ceremony of Mori Rei, awoman in her nineties, was almost joyous. Whenwe entered the room, the male family membersstood up to go to the coffee shop in the auditorium.The son, Mori Teruo, a man in his late sixties whowas the chief mourner, said to me with a smile, ‘‘Idon’t think I want to see my mother take a bath,and mother would be embarrassed, too,’’ and leftRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:15am page 231Hikaru Suzuki231"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"with the other male relatives. The women familymembers stayed and watched us with much curios-ity. They chatted with each other and spoke to Reifrom the beginning. One woman commented,‘‘How lucky you are to have a bath for the lasttime.’’ The other woman added, ‘‘How nice to bewashed by such a young man and young women.I didn’t think that young people did such thingsthese days.’’ No aspect of the bathing ceremonypassed without comment from the women. Whenthe bathtub was carried in and the shower was usedto wash the deceased, the women came to admirethe Western bathtub. ‘‘This is such a convenientthing, isn’t it?’’ one woman said to the others, whoall nodded in agreement. Before Hirata had achance to announce the completion of the cere-mony, the women were complimenting the de-ceased. ‘‘You look so fresh and young.’’ ‘‘Rei looksso nice; now she is ready to meet her husband inheaven.’’ The family seemed not only satisfied butpleased as well. The women told me during theceremony that Rei had died quietly in her sleep.The reaction of the living naturally corresponded tothe peaceful nature of this woman’s death. Every-one was celebrating her death and her life.One bathing ceremony that I remember clearlywas for Tano Genzo ̄, a man in his sixties. It tookplace at his home on a morning in early spring; theweather was still so cold that the boiler in the vantook some time to heat the water. From the begin-ning, Hirata, Oka, and I all felt something wasdistinctly different about the reaction of this family.The atmosphere of the room was very heavy. It wasnot the silence that made me uneasy, but the waythe family either stared at us or avoided our eyeswhile inspecting each other’s faces as if they weretrying to read each other’s thoughts. As soon as weunclothed Tano Genzo ̄, we saw a blue line on hisneck, which looked like a scar. I assumed that thedeceased had had an operation on his throat. Whilewe were washing the deceased, the family did notspeak to us, to each other, or to the deceased.There was an atmosphere of intense silence, am-bivalence, and seriousness. When Oka and I wentoutside to the van for fresh towels, she commentedthat the atmosphere was extraordinary. ‘‘I don’tunderstand this family,’’ she whispered. ‘‘All familiesreact in some way, but these people are completelysilent, as if they’ve been turned to stone’’ (ishimi-taini kataku natteru).When the bathing was completed, male membersof the family helped Hirata place the deceased intothe coffin; so far no one had said a word. Then, as thebathing staff prepared to frame the deceased’s facewith cotton, the son, who was the chief mourner,approached and said something in a low voice that noone else in the room could hear. Hirata nodded andreplied, ‘‘I will do so.’’ After we had left, Hirata toldus that the son had said, ‘‘Could you hide that scar?’’Hirata had arranged the cotton around the face,and later the comforter, up to Tano’s chin to hidehis scar.The second time the son spoke he asked if it wasall right to put objects in the coffin. Interestingly, thefirst object they brought out was a Buddhist sutra.Often family members bring clothes, eye-glasses,and other objects that were used by the deceased indaily life or that were valuable to the deceased. But inthis case many Buddhist objects were placed in thecoffin. Hirata announced the end of the ceremony,and we bowed to the family and moved toward thedoor. At this point the family surprised me again: allof them came out of the house. The three of us gotinto the van and Hirata started the engine, then thevan started to move. They were still standing in thecold rain. From inside the van we bowed at themwhile the car was moving forward. Then I saw theTano family members bowing to us with their headsdown low. I had never seen the bereaved bowing solow. I looked back from the moving van; they werestill standing there.‘‘What is all this appreciation about? Weren’t theybowing a bit too deeply?’’ I asked Hirata, who hadbeen doing this job for three years. Hirata said thatthe deceased had committed suicide. According tohim, when people hang themselves, they often bitetheir tongues. Their lips cannot be opened easily.That was exactly how Tano was that day. Oka hadtried to put cotton in the mouth, but it had been shuttight. ‘‘The rigor mortis of the suicide victim occursmore rapidly than it does for people who die fromother causes,’’ Hirata added. The scar on Tano Gen-zo ̄’s neck was a mark from hanging. Hirata’s explan-ation unraveled the mystery of the family’s unusualRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:15am page 232The Phase of Negated Death232"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"behavior. ‘‘A suicide is still considered a very baddeath in Japan,’’ he said. ‘‘They must have beenworried that we would treat the deceased with fearor refuse to perform the ceremony if the fact wasrevealed. The deep bows were the expression oftheir appreciation to us, that we did the job withoutcausing the family to lose face.’’11Although the size of the funeral is determined bydeceased’s social status, age, and gender, the atmos-phere of the funeral corresponds to the cause ofdeath and the deceased’s personality. It was notdifficult to tell if a death had been a ‘‘good death’’or a ‘‘bad death’’ by the way families and relativesinteracted with the funeral staff. The death of ayoung person is always traumatic, as are violentdeaths whatever the age of the deceased, whereasanticipated deaths are more peaceful. Deceased whowere well liked called forth strong feelings of grief.Such distinctions were amplified in the vigils andfunerals.The Wake at the Funeral AuditoriumThe wake for the Yamaha family was scheduled for7:00 p.m. on the same day the deceased was trans-ported to the funeral auditorium. A few hoursbefore the wake, Doi, the conductor hired byMoon Rise, arrived to meet the bereaved. Hebegan by explaining the sequence of events anddetails about the wake and the funeral, such aswhere the bereaved would sit and what they wouldbe expected to do. He finished by asking the family ifthey had any questions or problems so far. Yamahaand Mariko asked how large the monetary donation(ofuse) for the priest should be.12‘‘That variesaccording to different temples, the rank of the decea-sed’s posthumous name (kaimyo ̄), and the number ofattending priests,’’ Doi replied. ‘‘In the case of mytemple, which is Jo ̄doshu ̄, I would enclose ¥100,000for one priest.’’ The higher the rank and the numberof the priests, and the higher the rank of the posthu-mous name given, the larger the donation. Doi drewa picture of a donation envelope and wrote ‘‘contri-bution’’ on the upper portion and the name of thechief mourner below the ribbon. The father, whowas also worried about his funeral speech as the chiefmourner, asked what he was expected to say.Opening his file, Doi took out copies of samplespeeches and told Yamaha that he need only saya few words and thank the guests for coming inspite of their busy schedules. This meeting, whichwas a basic lesson on Japanese funerals, took about40 minutes.The Buddhist priest, from a Jo ̄doshinshu ̄secttemple, arrived about fifteen minutes before seven.He was a young man in his late thirties. We bowed tohim, and he lightly bowed back to the funeral pro-fessionals. A woman funeral assistant was there totake him to his waiting room, but instead he wentdirectly to the tatami room where family and rela-tives had gathered for the wake. The family greetedthe priest with a bow and began to talk to him aboutthe deceased. Priests often do not have any know-ledge of the deceased; the wake is the first time apriest is told about the cause of death and the decea-sed’s life in general. Sometimes this may even be thefirst time the priest meets the family.13While thefamily was talking to the priest, Doi went into theroom and introduced himself to the priest.The guests arrived gradually. The first and mostimportant obligation of a guest is to offer incensemoney to the deceased’s family. In communityrituals, incense money, or condolence money(ko ̄den), was predominantly offered on the day ofthe funeral, but today those who cannot attend thefuneral ceremony present their gifts at the wake.Incense money is enclosed in a special envelopewith one’s name on the lower portion in front andthe amount of money on the back. The amount ofmoney varies according to the giver’s relationship tothe deceased or to the bereaved (see table 19.1).The gift of incense money necessitates a returngift (ko ̄den-gaeshi). The exchange is a formal per-formance during which both sides present theirgifts and then bow deeply. These exchanges aremade even more solemn by elders who presenttheir envelopes with both hands and use traditionalincense money wrappers (fukusa) made out of dark-colored silk. This custom is fading, however. Theyounger generations, including people in their fiftiesand sixties, hand an unwrapped envelope of incensemoney directly to relatives or helpers who representthe bereaved family. I occasionally saw embarrassedguests, who had forgotten to inscribe their name onRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:15am page 233Hikaru Suzuki233"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"the envelope, quickly writing their names on thespot.It is not unusual for the funeral staff to help thedeceased’s families prepare a money offering to thepriests, and also to assist guests with their incenseenvelopes. The coffee shop at the Moon Rise audi-torium sells such basic funeral items as envelopes forincense money, rosaries (juzu), black neckties, blacksocks, and black stockings, because guests quiteoften forget to bring these items or wear inappropri-ate attire.While representatives from Yamaha’s family at thefront desk were keeping track of incense money andgiving return gifts, funeral assistants guided thoseguests who had finished the exchange to the tatamiroom. The room was becoming crowded, and anassistant had to ask people to move forward and addmore cushions (zabuton). The guests were all seatedneatly in two rows facing the coffin and the wakealtar at the front of the room. The priest sat at thevery front of the altar, and the family was seated inthe front row on the right. Finally the wave ofarriving guests subsided. It was time to begin.Doi took a seat near the priest. He straightenedhis back and announced the beginning of the wake.He gave the deceased’s name and age, the time ofdeath, and the priest’s rank and temple. Then heasked the priest to begin his sutra chanting. Thepriest began with the rhythmic ‘‘nam-mu-a-mi-da-bu-tsu’’ (Lord have mercy upon him/her), loudly atfirst, then more quietly at the end. After repeatingthe verse, he chanted the sutra text for twentyminutes. Unless one is a specialist in religion, it isdifficult to understand even a word of what is beingchanted.

By 8:10 p.m. everyonehad offered incense. The priest, who had been facingthe altar, turned around to the family and guests. Heannounced that the prayers for the wake (otsutome)had been completed.

Why do flowers fade away? Why do fruitsripen and fall? All lives exist for the sole purpose tobecome and to reach Buddhahood. The life of thephysical body may stop at an early stage. But thespiritual life grows and develops without any limita-tions or bounds. The end of the physical life is not thefinal end. There is a life beyond in the world of Buddha[jo ̄butsu].Unfortunately, the guests did not seem overlyimpressed with the priest’s story; at least I did notnotice anyone nodding in agreement. The message ofthe preaching was difficult to accept, even contra-dicting the emotions felt by a family that had lost adaughter so young. When the priest had completedhis Buddhist exhortation, a funeral assistant servedhim a cup of tea. The priest pressed his handstogether (gassho ̄), bowed, and drank a sip. Then hechatted with the chief mourner while sipping tea.Ten minutes later, the priest bowed once more to thefamily and left the room.The priest’s departure was the cue for otherguests to leave. The vigil was about to begin. Familyand relatives gathered around the table that had beenprepared by a funeral assistant while guests wereleaving. The Yamaha family asked Doi to join thevigil, but he courteously declined for the reason thathe had to prepare for the funeral the following day.The funeral assistant helped the family arrange twolarge plates of vegetarian sushi, nuts, other fooditems, plates, and cups. The assistant and thewomen of the family began serving sake and beerto the male family members and relatives. By 9:15p.m., observing that the gathering was proceedingon its own, the funeral assistant also left.The family spent a few more hours drinking andtalking. At community funerals, wakes commonlyserved only vegetarian food (sho ̄jin), no meat oralcohol. However, almost all the wakes I observedduring my fieldwork served alcohol. Men drank, butfew women did so. Drinking patterns at wakes andfunerals varied according to the circumstances of thedeceased’s death and reflected a pattern in society atlarge. In the case of the Yamaha family, sipping sakewas a way to share the sadness of losing a youngdaughter. For those who had lost an old grand-mother, drinking was a way to celebrate her longlife and peaceful death. For those who had lost lovedones in an accident or by suicide, gulping beer helpedtemporarily dull their grief. Drinking is not taboo atcontemporary wakes or at funerals. On the contrary,it is an appropriate or even necessary gesture todemonstrate one’s sympathy, pain, and sorrow overa particular death. Moon Rise’s funeral auditoriumhas refrigerators stocked with beer beside eachtatami room because drinking during a wake goeson until midnight and sometimes throughout thenight.The women in the Yamaha family retired beforemidnight, leaving the men drinking. After emptyinga dozen large beer bottles and a dozen small sakebottles, male participants asked the funeral staff tocall them cabs for the ride home. By midnighteveryone had left except the two relatives whowere staying overnight with Yoshiko in the tatamiroom.14Their bedding (futon, pillows, and blankets)was rented for this purpose.Quite a few families do not have anyone stay withthe deceased for the vigil. Elder funeral stafflamented about this to me. ‘‘Some families leavetheir deceased all alone. It’s shameful.’’ But in fact,the feeling of shame for not attending the deceasedduring the vigil is weakening. In community funerals,sitting or lying near the deceased’s coffin or bedsidethroughout the night was essential.

For thisreason, the family took turns keeping incense burningto ward off evil spirits and prevent them fromentering the body. Today, however, funeral staff andfuneral conductors are often asked the same questionsby family members: Is it really necessary to stay withthe deceased at night? Will anyone be at the auditor-ium for the night shift? Funeral professionals com-monly state that it is not compulsory to stay with thedeceased during the vigil and that there are threefuneral professionals on the overnight shift. Uponhearing this, most families conclude that they do notneed to remain because, as they put it, ‘‘The deceasedis taken care of by the funeral staff.’’ The funeral staffmake sure the family understands that that they willnot be in the deceased’s room itself but in the night-shift room downstairs. A typical response to this is:‘‘It’s okay [sorede kekko ̄desu], as long as someone is inthe building.’’ The bereaved, however, should not besolely blamed for this change in practice; even thefuneral professionals themselves put out all incenseand candles at night to avoid the risk of fire.Why then did families cease to stay up with thedeceased through the night? The change in this prac-tice demonstrates that both the family and funeralprofessionals do not consider the deceased to be in astate of impurity. In this chapter I have describedfunerary performances after the announcement ofdeathandprior toafuneralceremony.Whatisexplicitduring this period is the absence of the perception ofimpurity, death pollution, and evil spirits. These con-cepts are irrelevant not only to professionals of MoonRise but also to the bereaved. The reason the Yamahafamily left two relatives with Yoshiko was not becauseshe was in a dangerous transitional state but because‘‘shewillbelonely’’(hitoride kawaiso ̄dakara).Similarly,the funeral staff complained about the bereaved whodid not stay with the dead, saying, ‘‘They are not fullyshowing respect to the deceased.’’ On the one hand, ifthe living perceive the deceased to be alive, there is noimpurity or danger of evil spirits to be dealt with. Onthe other hand, if funeral professionals view the de-ceased as alive but in a state of unconsciousness, then afamily member should stay to assist the person just aswould be done during a hospitalization. Both of thesetwo commonly expressed rationales by the living andprofessionals place the deceased, until the end of thefuneral ceremonies, in a resuscitated state rather thanin a biological or social transition phase. The beliefin the ‘‘living-dead’’ explains why funeral profession-als (who are engaged before cremation) displayextreme respect and caution while treating the decea-sed’s body.NOTES1 This is a direct result of the differences between healthcare in the United States and Japan. Japanese healthcare is socialistic; the government provides health careto all Japanese. Thus, city, prefectual, and publicuniversity hospitals have little money to spend ondecor or patient conveniences.2 The room for the soul in Japan and a morgue inAmerica are different. The former is a single room(it varies in size) for one corpse, whereas in Americathe dead share one room.3 Funeral staff do not use cord to tie the hands as thenurses do, although it would greatly facilitate arran-ging the beads between the deceased’s pressed hands.Any action that makes it appear as if it causes pain forthe deceased is strictly prohibited among funeral staff.The reason the funeral staff is prohibited from per-forming the same action that the medical staff isallowed to perform is a complex structure of perspec-tive that illustrates the linguistic difference between‘‘corpse’’ (shitai) and ‘‘a deceased’s remains’’ (itai).The latter term implies the body of one’s family,relative, or a close friend. It is a term that demon-strates respect to the deceased and the family. In con-trast, the use of the wordshitaiimplies a cadaver thathas no relationship to anyone; it is a thing or an object.Thus, the ‘‘deceased’s remains’’ need to be treated as ifthe person were still alive. The funeral industry musttreat the deceased with extreme care so that the familydoes not believe the funeral staff have treated thedeceased as a ‘‘corpse’’ and thus without respect.4 The head cloth is not placed on the deceased’s headuntil the encoffining.5 Usually nurses send off the deceased from the hospital,but doctors are sometimes present. I was told by thefuneral staff that the number of medical staff sendingoff the deceased depends on the number of gifts thedeceased’s family has given them during the period ofhospitalization. The more gifts that were given, themore medical staff are willing to send him or her off.Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:15am page 236The Phase of Negated Death236"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"6 A seal is a character-based stamp that is used as asignature.

On theblackboard of the funeral staff’s office, where ordin-arily the deceased’s names are written, a sign said‘‘Secret’’ and ‘‘Do not Disturb.’’ Uchiumi said thatthe incident was concealed from the public becausethe son’s parents were highly regarded doctors in thelocal area who feared their son’s suicide would harmtheir reputations. Uchiumi explained to me, ‘‘Sui-cide destroys the family name.

ConklinThe Wari’1(Pakaa Nova) are an indigenous popula-tion of about 1,500 people who live in the westernBrazilian rain forest, in the state of Rondoˆnia nearthe Bolivian border. Until the 1960s, they disposedof nearly all their dead by consuming substantialamounts of corpses’ body substances. All Wari’elders living today took part in or witnessed mortu-ary cannibalism, and their recollections offer anopportunity to view cannibalism from the perspec-tives of those who participated in it. This articleexplores the question of why cannibalism was thepreferred means for disposing of the dead, empha-sizing indigenous interpretations of the logic andmeanings of cannibalism.From a cross-cultural perspective, Wari’ customsappear unusual in several respects. In most othersocieties, mortuary cannibalism involved the con-sumption of only small amounts of a corpse’s bodysubstances, which typically were ingested by a deadperson’s consanguineal kin.2Among the Wari’, how-ever, the dead person’s affines ideally consumed all ofthe roasted flesh, brains, heart, liver, and – sometimes– the ground bones. Cannibalism was the preferredtreatment for all Wari’ corpses, except in a fewcircumstances in which bodies were cremated.The Wari’ practiced both exocannibalism (theeating of enemies and social outsiders) and endocan-nibalism (the eating of members of one’s own group)but considered the two forms of anthropophagy tohave little in common. The eating of enemies, whichwill not be examined in detail here,3involved overtexpressions of hostility: enemy body parts wereabused and treated disrespectfully, and the freshlyroasted flesh was eaten off the boneak karawa, ‘‘likeanimal meat’’ (see Vilac ̧a 1992:47–130). In contrast,the very different customs of mortuary cannibalismexpressed honor and respect for the dead.This article focuses on how mortuary cannibalismfit into Wari’ experiences of grief and mourning. Myapproach traces themes emphasized by contempor-ary Wari’ in reflecting on their past participation incannibalistic funerals. The question ‘‘Why did youFrom Beth A. Conklin, ‘‘ ‘Thus Are Our Bodies, Thus Was Our Custom’: Mortuary Cannibalism in an Amazonian Society,’’AmericanEthnologist, 22, 1 (1995): 75–101.Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:17ampage 238238"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"eat the dead?’’ tended to draw a limited range ofresponses. The most common reply was ‘‘Je’ kwer-exi’,’’ ‘‘Thus was our custom.’’4This statementshould be taken seriously; for many Wari’, cannibal-ism was simply the norm; for reasons I discuss in thisarticle, it was considered to be the most respectfulway to treat a human body. Beyond this, when olderpeople reflected on deeper, personal motives, theytended to link cannibalism to a process of achievingemotional detachment from memories of the dead:‘‘When we ate the body, we did not think longingly[koromikat] about the dead much.’’ Numerousmiddle-aged and elderly people – of both sexes andin various villages – independently offered the ex-planation that cannibalism altered memories and theemotions of grief in ways that helped them deal withthe loss of a loved one. Elders were bemused and attimes rather irritated by anthropologists’ singularobsession with the eating of bodies, for they insistedthat cannibalism cannot be understood apart fromthe entire complex of mortuary rites and mourningbehaviors aimed at reshaping emotional and spiritualrelations between the living and the dead.To understand cannibalism’s role in mourning,I propose to show that Wari’ practices reflectedtwo concepts of widespread salience in lowlandSouth America: the idea of the human body as alocus of physically constituted social relationshipsand social identity, and ideas about human-nonhu-man reciprocity. These concepts merged in a year-long series of traditional mourning rites that focusedon actual and symbolic transformations of a deadperson’s body, from human to animal form. Canni-balism was a powerful element in a social processof mourning structured around images of ances-tors’ regeneration as animals with ongoing, life-supporting relations to their living relatives.Wari’ testimonies concerning the affective dimen-sions of cannibalism are unusual in the ethnographicliterature, for we have few detailed accounts ofcannibalism from the viewpoint of its practitioners.Most peoples who formerly practiced it no longer doso, leaving few individuals able or willing to speak topersonal experiences of people-eating. Perhaps be-cause of this, anthropological analyses of cannibalismhave tended to focus mostly on the level of societalsystems of meaning and symbolism. Cannibalism aspraxis is poorly understood. This is particularlystriking in the case of mortuary cannibalism: al-though it is, by definition, a cultural response to afellow group member’s death, we know little abouthow the socially constituted symbols of mortuarycannibalism relate to emotions and fit into individ-uals’ lived experiences of coming to terms with arelative’s death. Wari’ recollections offer insightsinto one people’s experiences.In the anthropology of anthropophagy, mortuarycannibalism has received rather short shrift. Theethnographic and ethnohistorical literatures aredominated by accounts of the exocannibalism ofenemies, which has been reported more frequently,and described in more depth, than endo- or mortu-ary cannibalism. Concomitant with this predominantfocus on enemy-eating, universalist theories of can-nibalism have tended to interpret anthropophagy as afundamentally antisocial act. Psychogenic theoristsfrom Freud (1981[1913]) to Sagan (1974) haveviewed all forms of people-eating as an expressionof individuals’ egocentric, oral-aggressive impulses.Recent social anthropological theories also have em-phasized themes of antisociality. Lewis (1986:63–77) subsumed endo- and exocannibalism alikeunder a model in which consumption and ingestionreflect oral and genital aggression, and agonisticdesires for dominance. Arens (1979) interpretedcannibalism as a universal symbol of barbarism,otherness, and inhumanity.Mortuary cannibalism data have a special place incannibalism studies, for the meanings associated withconsuming one’s fellows tend to be quite differentfrom the motives for eating enemies. Mortuary can-nibalism systems present the greatest potential chal-lenge to interpretations of cannibalism as anantisocial act of aggression and domination, and thefew ethnographic studies of mortuary cannibalismhave tended to highlight its socially integrative di-mensions. Analyses of several Melanesian systemshave examined the role of mortuary cannibalism aspart of the assemblage of cultural symbols and ritualswhereby social groups defined and reconstitutedthemselves after a death (Gillison 1983; Lindenbaum1979; Meigs 1984; Poole 1983). Sanday’s (1986)cross-cultural analysis emphasized the semantic com-plexity of anthropophagy and showed that cannibal-Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:17ampage 239Beth A. Conklin239"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"ism may symbolize not only evil and chaos but alsosocial order and the regeneration of life-givingcosmic forces.Recent general theories of mortuary cannibalismhave considered only a limited set of cultural motiv-ations, however, and have focused exclusivelyon ethnographic data from a single region, Mela-nesia. The diverse Melanesian endocannibalismsystems expressed a variety of cultural meanings,but they tended to share in two main ideas: theassumption that cannibalism primarily benefitsthose who consume human substance; and the notionof an economy of biosocial substance in which can-nibalism serves as a means of acquiring body sub-stances, vital energies, or personal attributescontained in the dead person’s corpse and of trans-ferring them to those who eat it. These conceptshave been widely assumed to characterize all endo-cannibalism systems. In the two most recent anthro-pological syntheses of cannibalism theory, Sandaystated that ‘‘[e]ndocannibalism recycles and regener-ates social forces that are believed to be physicallyconstituted in bodily substances or bones’’ (1986:7)and Lewis asserted that ‘‘the ritual consumption ofparts of the human body enables the consumer toacquire something of the body’s vital energy’’(1986:73). Neither interpretation applies to theWari’ case.Although both endo- and exocannibalism werewidely practiced in lowland South America wellinto the 20th century (Dole 1974; Me ́traux1947:22–5), the Amazonian literature has receivedlittle attention in recent North American and Britishdiscourse on cannibalism, although it has been oflongstanding interest among Brazilian and Frenchanthropologists. Some Amazonian endocannibalismreflected concepts similar to the Melanesian themeof recycling dead people’s energies or attributes (see,for example, Acosta Saignes 1961:161–2; Dole1974:307; Erikson 1986:198; Reichel-Dolmatoff1971:138–9), but many South American systemsexpressed quite different ideas, often involvingnotions of altering relations between body and spiritor between the living and the dead. Wari’ informantsuniversally denied that their consumption of eitherkin or enemies had anything to do with recyclingsubstance, attributes, or energies from the dead tothose who ate them.5They consistently representedcannibalism not as a boon for the eaters of humanflesh but as a service for those who did not eat: thedeceased and their close kin.Wari’ mortuary customs reflect complex socialand symbolic systems about which a great deal morecan be said than is possible in this article. I referinterested readers to the works of other anthropolo-gists who have studied Wari’ society (Mason 1977;Von Graeve 1972, 1989) and the puzzle of Wari’anthropophagy (Meireles 1986; Vilac ̧a 1989, 1992).Meireles has examined the role of cannibalism indefining self-other relations in the construction ofWari’ personhood and emphasized the symbolism offire as mediator of human-nonhuman relations. Vilac ̧apresented symbolic-structuralist interpretations ofboth exo- and endocannibalism, with special atten-tion to affinal relations, festivals, and origin mythsrelated to anthropophagy. Her analysis has focused onWari’ conceptions of the social universe as structuredaround oppositions and reciprocal exchanges be-tween predators and prey. Symbolic oppositions be-tween the categories ofWa r i ’(‘‘we, people’’) andkarawa(‘‘animals’’) recur in Wari’ ideology and ritualsat multiple levels: humans vs. animals, Wari’ vs. non-Wari’, consanguines vs. affines, the living vs. thedead. Vilac ̧a (1992:291) has emphasized that mortu-ary cannibalism symbolically associated the deadperson with the category of prey and identified theliving Wari’ with the category of predators.My analysis complements Vilac ̧a’s and Meireles’sinterpretations by situating cannibalism in relation tothree other dimensions of Wari’ experience: socialprocesses of mourning, body concepts, and the regen-erative imagery of ancestors’ transformations intoanimals. To examine relationships among the social,symbolic, and ritual systems, I first describe theethnographic context and mortuary rites and discusswhy the Wari’ case does not fit the major materialistand psychogenic models proposed to explain canni-balism elsewhere. I then examine social and psycho-logical dimensions of Wari’ body concepts to showwhy the corpse’s destruction by cannibalism or cre-mation was considered essential. Finally, I exploreWari’ ideas about human-animal relations that suggestan answer to the question of why the Wari’ preferredcannibalism rather than cremation.Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:17ampage 240‘‘Thus Are Our Bodies, Thus Was Our Custom’’: Mortuary Cannibalism in an Amazonian Society240"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Ethnographic ContextThe Wari’ speak a language in the Chapakuran lan-guage family isolate. They entered permanent rela-tions with Brazilian national society between 1956and 1969, when the former national Indian agency,the SPI (Servic ̧o de Protec ̧a ̃o aos I ́ndios), sponsored aseries of pacification expeditions that terminatedWari’ autonomy. The Wari’ now reside in eightmajor villages in indigenous reserves along tributar-ies of the Mamore ́and Madeira Rivers in the muni-cipality of Guajara ́-Mirim, Rondoˆnia. Prior to thecontact they had no canoes and inhabited interfluvial(terra firme) areas of the rain forest, away from thelarger rivers. Today, as in the past, subsistencedepends on slash-and-burn farming, hunting, fishing,and foraging. Maize is the principal staple crop,and hunting is the most socially valued food-gettingactivity.Precontact villages typically were comprised ofabout thirty people living in several nuclear familyhouseholds. Contemporary Wari’ communities areadministered by FUNAI (Fundac ̧a ̃o Nacional doI ́ndio), the Brazilian government Indian agency,whose policies of population concentration andsedentarization have disrupted traditional settlementpatterns and social organization. Today’s villages, of80–400 people, are located at nontraditional sitesnear major rivers or roads accessible to transporta-tion to town.Wari’ society is staunchly egalitarian, and socialrelations are characterized by a high degree of flexi-bility. Leadership is ephemeral; there are no‘‘chiefs,’’ and no formal positions of political author-ity above the household level. Mason (1977) categor-ized Wari’ kinship terminology as a Crow/Omaha –type system. Wari’ kin groups are ego-centeredbilateral kindred; there are no lineages, and nointernal segregation based on age grades or ceremo-nial activities. Precontact postmarital residence wasflexible, with couples free to live near either spouse’sbilateral kin after initial matrilocal bride service. Ofcentral importance for understanding mortuarycustoms is the role of affinity as the strongest organ-izing principle in Wari’ society. Alliances amongfamilies related by marriage6are important in foodsharing, mutual aid, funeral duties and, in the past,were one basis for war alliances. Wari’ society is byno means conflict-free, but most decision making isconsensual, and the general tenor of social relationsemphasizes mutuality and reciprocity among kin,affines, and allies.The precontact Wari’ were divided into named,territorially based subgroups (Oro Nao’, Oro Eo’,Oro At, Oro Mon, Oro Waram, and Oro Waram-Xijein) that were the largest social units with whichindividuals identified. A subgroup’s members werecommitted to peaceful coexistence and cooperationin warfare and emergencies. Amicable relationsamong the villages in a subgroup were affirmed andmaintained by festival exchanges, including celebra-tions calledhu ̈roroinandtamarathat are models forthe human–nonhuman alliance exchanges repre-sented in mortuary cannibalism.After the first peaceful contacts with outsiderswere established in the Rio Dois Irma ̃os area in1956, government (SPI) agents and New Tribesmissionaries witnessed several anthropophagous fu-nerals. Most of the Wari’ population entered contactin 1961–2. News of Wari’ funerary cannibalismbecame public knowledge in early 1962, when anSPI agent sold his eyewitness account to a Sa ̃o Paulonewspaper (Folha de Sa ̃o Paulo1962). In response, acompeting paper sent journalists to the Rio Negro-Ocaia contact site, where they photographed dis-memberment and roasting at a child’s funeral (deCarvalho 1962). Brazilian anthropologists and SPIofficials convinced the paper not to publish thesephotographs and attempted to use the ensuing publi-city to call public attention to the tragicsituation of the recently contacted Wari’ (Cruzeiro1962:123–5).Contact with the pacification teams introduceddevastating epidemics of measles, influenza, tuber-culosis, and other cosmopolitan diseases. Within twoor three years of contact, approximately 60 percentof the precontact population was dead. Chronicallyill, psychologically traumatized, and unable to huntor plant crops, the survivors became extremelydependent on outsiders for food and medical care.Missionaries and government agents manipulatedthis dependency to put an end to cannibalism bythreatening to withhold food and medicines fromthose who continued to eat the dead. They insistedRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:17ampage 241Beth A. Conklin241"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"that corpses be buried instead. At each of the threemajor contact sites, Wari’ initially resisted thisforced change to burial.The deadly epidemics, however, created anotherreason to abandon cannibalism: traditional illnessconcepts could not explain the unfamiliar maladies,and so people listened when missionaries told themthat the new diseases were spread by eating infectedcorpses. Wari’ began burying people who died ofillness (the great majority of early postcontactdeaths), but, for a while, they continued to cannibal-ize those whose deaths were attributed to accidents,sorcery, and other nondisease causes. Familiescarried corpses into the forest, to be roasted awayfrom outsiders’ eyes. However, these efforts at de-ception ultimately failed, and by the end of 1962 orearly 1963, nearly everyone had abandoned canni-balism altogether. (The exception was a group ofabout thirty Oro Mon who lived autonomously until1969.) Today, all Wari’ follow Western customs ofburying corpses in cemeteries in the forest.7No anthropologist has witnessed Wari’ anthro-pophagy, and many data presented here are basedon retrospective reconstructions. My primarysources are the testimonies of numerous olderWari’ who say that they participated in or observedmortuary cannibalism. During two years of medicalanthropological field work in 1985–7, I interviewedall 198 families in the communities of Santo Andre ́,Ribeirao, Lage, Tanajura, and Rio Negro-Ocaia (85percent of the total Wari’ population). Interviewswith adults of both sexes, aimed at collecting geneal-ogies and mortality and morbidity histories, oftenled to discussions of personal experiences with rela-tives’ deaths and funerals. I observed aspects ofcontemporary mourning behavior, including ritualwailing and the handling of a corpse, but no one diedin a village where I was present, and I attended noburials or complete funerals. Santo Andre ́, a com-munity of 190 people, was my principal residence,and I discussed issues treated in this article with allthe elders and many middle-aged people there. Themost detailed information and insights came fromseveral key informants: three men and two womenbetween ages 60 and 75, two men in their 50s, and aman and woman in their early 40s. Most Santo Andre ́residents are descendants of the precontact Rio DoisIrma ̃os area population, and this article describes thisgroup’s practices, which differed only in minordetails from other Wari’ communities.The Wari’ do not conform to Arens’ (1979) as-sertions that alleged cannibals seldom acknowledgeeating anyone and that cannibalism is primarily asymbol of inhumanity and barbarism projectedupon enemies, neighbors, and uncivilized ‘‘others.’’Wari’ anthropophagy is not merely alleged by out-siders; Wari’ themselves freely affirm practicing it inthe past, even though they are aware that outsidersconsider it barbaric. I found no one who denied thatcorpses customarily were cannibalized; numerouselders spoke openly of eating human flesh. Independ-ent descriptions of particular funerals were intern-ally consistent and corresponded to reports by NewTribes missionaries and SPI agents who observedcannibalism in the early postcontact period. By anyreasonable standards for the documentation of pastevents not witnessed by an ethnographer, there is noquestion that the Wari’ ate their dead.Traditional FuneralsToday, as in the past, funerals generally take place inthe house of a senior kinsman of the deceased.8Thehousehold’s sleeping platform (or raised floor) isremoved to permit mourners to crowd togetherunder the palm-thatch roof. Two loosely definedgroups have prescribed roles at funerals. The first istheiri’ nari9(‘‘true kin,’’ or close sanguines and thespouse). Wari’ define consanguinity in terms ofshared blood and classify spouses as consanguinesby virtue of sexual transfers of body fluids that createshared blood. Between spouses, it is said, ‘‘there isonly one body’’ (xika pe’ na kwere). Linked to thedeceased by shared body substance, the iri’ nari arethe principal mourners. From the time of biologicaldeath until the body is disposed of, they remainnearest the corpse, holding it in their arms andcrying.The second group of mourners,nari paxi(‘‘thosewho are like kin but are not truly related’’), mostproperly consists of the dead person’s own affinesand affines of the deceased’s close kin, but the term isextended to include all non-consanguines attendingthe funeral. Close affines are responsible for theRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:17ampage 242‘‘Thus Are Our Bodies, Thus Was Our Custom’’: Mortuary Cannibalism in an Amazonian Society242"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"work of funerals: female affines prepare maizechicha(a sweet, unfermented drink) and maizepamonha(dense, unleavened bread) to feed visitors, andmale affines (ideally, the dead person’s brothers-in-law or sons-in-law) serve as messengers summoningpeople to the funeral. They prepare and dispose ofthe corpse and funeral apparatus and look out for thewelfare of emotionally distraught mourners.In traditional funerals, the iri’ nari sit together,apart from other mourners. In contemporary fu-nerals, the spatial division is less marked, but closekin remain nearest the corpse. All mourners pressclose together around the body, leaning on eachother’s shoulders and wailing. Death wails are ofseveral types, including wordless crying, the singingof kinship terms for the deceased, and a more struc-tured keening calledaka pijim(‘‘to cry to speak’’), inwhich mourners recount memories of the deceased,singing of shared experiences and the person’s lifehistory, deeds, and kindnesses. (On Amazonianritual lament, see Briggs 1992; Graham 1986; Seeger1987; Urban 1988, 1991.) From the moment ofdeath until the funeral’s end, everyone joins in aceaseless, high-pitched keening that sends a hauntingmantra of collective grief reverberating off the sur-rounding forest.The dead person’s humanity and social connec-tions are repeatedly affirmed in funeral actionsdirected at the corpse itself, which is the constantfocus of attention. Corpses are never left to lie alone.From the moment of death until the body is disposedof, grieving kin constantly cradle the corpse in theirarms, hugging it, pressing their own bodies againstit. Desire for physical contact can be so intense that,according to several Santo Andre ́residents, therewas a funeral a few years ago where the corpse wasin danger of being pulled apart by distraught kinstruggling to embrace it. Finally, a senior kinsmanenforced order by mandating that only one person ata time could hold the body.Numerous funeral actions express mourners’ self-identification with the dead person’s physical stateand desires to join the deceased in death. Any loss ofconsciousness, such as fainting, is considered a formof death. In one common funeral practice, closerelatives ‘‘die’’ (mi’ pin) by lying one on top of theother, in stacks of three or four people with thecorpse on top. When someone faints from the suffo-cating press of bodies, he or she is pulled out of thepile and someone else joins the pile, in a processrepeated again and again. In a 1986 funeral, peoplepiled into the homemade coffin, embracing thecorpse on top.In traditional funerals, the male affine helpersconstructed the ritual firewood bundle and roastingrack. Ideally, these were made of roofbeams, decor-ated with feathers and painted with red annatto(urucu ́, Bixa orellana). A beam was taken from eachhouse in the dead person’s village, leaving thethatched roofs sagging in visible expression of death’sviolation of the community’s integrity. Funerals forinfants were less elaborate; regular, undecoratedfirewood was used. When preparations were com-pleted, the helpers lit the fire, spread clean mats onthe ground, and dismembered the body, using a newbamboo arrow tip. Internal organs were removedfirst, and the heart and liver were wrapped in leavesto be roasted. Body parts considered inedible, in-cluding the hair, nails, genitals, intestines, and otherentrails, were burned. The helpers then severed thehead, removed the brains, cut the limbs at the joints,and placed the body parts on the roasting rack.Young children’s body parts were wrapped in leavesin the manner used to roast small fish and soft foods.Several elders recalled that the most emotionallydifficult event in a funeral was the moment when thecorpse was taken from its relatives’ arms to bedismembered. As the body was cut, wailing andhysterical expressions of grief reached a feveredpitch. Up to this moment, funeral activities hadbeen dominated by mourners’ expressions of phys-ical and affective attachments to the dead person’sbody. Dismemberment represented a radical alter-ation of the corpse and mourners’ relations to it, agraphic severing of the attachments represented inthe body. According to these elders, it was dismem-berment, not cannibalism, that provoked the mostintense emotional dissonance. Once the corpse hadbeen cut, eating it was considered the most respect-ful possible treatment, for reasons discussed below.The dead person’s close consanguines (iri’ nari)did not eat the corpse. Consumption of a closeconsanguine or spouse’s flesh is strongly prohibited,because eating a close relative (with whom oneRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:17ampage 243Beth A. Conklin243"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"shared body substance) would be tantamount toeating one’s own flesh, or autocannibalism. It isbelieved to be fatal.10The nari paxi, affines and other non-kin, wereresponsible for consuming the corpse; they aresometimes referred to asko kao’ (‘‘those who ate’’).In a married person’s funeral, those who consumedthe body typically included the dead person’sspouse’s siblings, spouse’s parents, spouse’s parents’siblings, and the deceased’s children’s spouses, aswell as these individuals’ own close consanguines.Unmarried people typically were eaten by theirsiblings’ spouses, siblings’ spouses’ siblings, theirparents’ siblings’ spouses, and these individuals’close kin. Thus, Wari’ cannibalized members of thefamilies from which their bilateral consanguines hadtaken marriage partners. Meireles (1986) noted thatcannibalism restrictions generally coincided withincest prohibitions.Cannibalism was a primary obligation of affinity.Adult men were obliged to eat their close affines;refusal to do so would have insulted the dead per-son’s family. Women were not required to partici-pate in cannibalism but did so at their owndiscretion.11Distinctions of generation, age, orgender were largely irrelevant; male and femaleadults and adolescents consumed corpses of all agesand both sexes. Men’s and women’s corpses weretreated almost identically.Roasting usually commenced in the late afternoonand eating usually began at dusk. The dead person’sclosest kin divided the well-roasted brains, heart,and liver into small pieces, placed the pieces onclean mats, and called the others to begin eating.The affines (nari paxi) did not descend greedily uponthe flesh but hung back, crying and expressing reluc-tance to eat; only after repeated insistence by thedead person’s close kin (iri’ nari) did they accept theflesh. The iri’ nari then prepared the other bodyparts by removing the flesh from the bones anddividing it into small pieces. They usually arrangedthese on a mat along with pieces of roasted maizebread (pamonha); in some funerals, they placed theflesh in a conical clay pot and handed pieces to theeaters, cradling the pot in their laps in the affection-ate position used to hold someone’s head in repose orduring illness. In marked contrast to the aggressive,disrespectful treatment of enemies’ flesh in exocan-nibalism, funeral eaters did not touch the flesh withtheir hands but held it delicately on thin splinters likecocktail toothpicks. They are very slowly, alternatelycrying and eating. There appears to have been nospecial significance attached to ingesting particularbody parts, and no pattern determining who atewhich portions.The ideal was to consume all of the flesh, heart,liver, and brains; in practice, the amount actuallyeaten depended on the degree of the corpse’s decay.It is considered imperative that corpses not be dis-posed of (by cannibalism, cremation, or burial) untilall important relatives have arrived at the funeral,seen the body, and participated in the wailing eu-logies. The length of time before a body was roastedtraditionally varied according to the dead person’sage, status, and social ties: the older and moresocially prominent the deceased, the longer thedelay in roasting. Before the contact, when villageswere scattered over a wide territory, most adultswere not roasted until two or three days afterdeath, when decay was well-advanced.It was considered important to consume as muchflesh as possible. When, however, flesh was tooputrid to stomach – as it usually was in the case ofadult corpses – the eaters forced themselves toswallow small pieces from various body parts, thencremated the rest. The ideal of total consumptionwas realized mainly in funerals for infants and youngchildren who, having few social ties of their own,were roasted within a day or so of their deaths andeaten entirely. Complete consumption also appearsto have occurred for some terminally ill elderswhose relatives gathered and commenced wailinglong before biological death. In most adult and ado-lescent funerals, however, most of the flesh probablywas burned rather than eaten.Consumption of the corpse continued until dawn,at which time any remaining flesh was cremated.Treatment of bones varied. Sometimes they wereground into meal, mixed with honey, and consumed.In other cases, especially in the Rio Dois Irma ̃os area,the bones were burned, pulverized, and buried. Inall cases, the clay pots, mats, roasting rack, andfuneral fire remains were burned, pounded to dust,and buried in situ by the male affine helpers.

Theidea that institutionalized cannibalism may be motiv-ated by needs for dietary protein was proposed byHarner (1977) to explain Aztec human sacrifice andhas been elaborated by Harris (1977, 1985:199–234). Wari’ practices involved the ingestion of sig-nificant quantitites of flesh and ground bones, andthe adults who consumed them would have gainedsome nutrients, notably protein and calcium. Twofactors nevertheless militate against a materialistinterpretation of the Wari’ system.First, there is no reason to assume that the pre-contact population suffered significant food short-ages. Wari’ controlled a large territory with lowpopulation density and abundant game, fish, andBrazil nut resources. Elders assert that hunger wasinfrequent, although then, as now, there were dayswithout meat or fish. Missionaries present at the firstcontacts observed no signs of malnutrition, and theassumption that the precontact Wari’ did not sufferprotein shortages is consistent with biomedical stud-ies of similar groups. Although protein-scarcity hy-potheses were hotly debated in Amazonian culturalecology from the late 1960s through the early 1980s,researchers have never documented protein defi-ciency in relatively undisturbed native Amazonianpopulations living in circumstances similar to theprecontact Wari’. On the contrary, studies havefound adequate or more than adequate protein intake(Berlin and Markell 1977; Chagnon and Hames1979; Dufour 1983; Milton 1984). My own dataon household diets in two communities, and anthro-pometric assessments from four communities, indi-cate that contemporary Wari’ diets are generallyadequate, even with the depletion of game and fishnear today’s larger, more sedentary villages.A second argument against nutritional motivationsfor Wari’ cannibalism is that much potentially edibleflesh was burned rather than eaten, with no attempt topreserve it for later consumption. Even in cannibaliz-ing enemies, Wari’ did not maximize protein acquisi-tion: warriors usually took only the head and limbs,discarding the fleshy trunk. Clearly, social consider-ations took precedence over biological functionalismin shaping Wari’ practices.The Question of HostilityInterpretations of cannibalism as an act of hostilityare a staple of Western psychoanalytic theory (seeFreud 1981 [1913]; Sagan 1974), and the fact thatWari’ ate their affines raises the question of whethercannibalism expressed or mediated affinal tensions.Like Freudians, Wari’ recognize that eating can ex-press hostility, as it did in the aggressive consumptionof enemy flesh. My informants, however, universallyrejected the notion that mortuary customs expressedany form of overt, covert, or displaced hostility.They insisted that hostility has no place at funerals;individuals on bad terms with the deceased arebarred from attending, as reportedly happened afew years ago when a man was ordered away on thegrounds that ‘‘you did not love him, it is not goodthat you come here.’’ In addition, Wari’ emphasizedthat funeral ‘‘table manners’’ sharply differentiatedaffinal cannibalism from acts of eating that did ex-press aggression. As discussed below, eating hasmultiple cultural connotations and can express re-spect for that which is eaten.Sagan (1974:28) has dismissed the possibility ofcannibalism as an act of respect or compassion forthe deceased, asserting that such ideas are a merefacade for covert ambivalence, hostility, and sadisticurges rooted in resentments against the dead forhaving abandoned the living.12It is difficult to assess,retrospectively, the question of whether Wari’ mor-tuary cannibalism expressed aggression or hostility,but Wari’ practices and discourse on cannibalismoffer little support for this interpretation. Affinaltensions appear no greater among the precontactWari’ than in many noncannibalistic societies.Wari’ express few expectations of inherent affinalconflict; ideally, and to a large extent in practice,they treat affinity as a matter of amity and mutuallybeneficial reciprocity. Today, as in the past, mostmarriages are arranged or approved by the familiesinvolved, who are careful to establish and perpetuateRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:17ampage 245Beth A.

Affines call each other by consanguinealkin terms (Vilac ̧a 1989:41–45), exchange meat andfish frequently, and offer aid in emergencies. Whenconflicts among affines arise, there are culturalmechanisms for dealing with them, including ritualfights (mixita) and discussions between family heads.Affinity and ExchangeVilac ̧a has emphasized the importance of mortuarycannibalism as a marker of Wari’ affines’ relations toone another: ‘‘The funeral rite . . . reveals, throughthe opposition between those who eat together[comensais] and those who do not [na ̃o-comensais], theopposition cognates/affines. In the interior of Wari’society, cannibalism constructs and identifies affin-ity’’ (1992:293).Vilac ̧a (1992:293) also observed that Wari’ affinalcannibalism reflected a recurrent theme in SouthAmerican mythology, identified by Le ́vi-StraussinThe Raw and the Cooked(1969): the character-ization of affines (the ‘‘takers’’ of women) as realor potential cannibal prey. Besides the Wari’, theYanomami also practice affinal cannibalism, consum-ing their affines’ ground bones (Albert 1985). Six-teenth-century Tupinamba ́exocannibalism involvedanother kind of affinal cannibalism: a war captivewas married to a Tupinamba ́woman (makinghim an affine to her kin) before being killed andeaten (Staden 1928[1557]). In the cosmology of theArawete ́of central Brazil (who bury their dead),cannibalism is seen as a transformative mechanismfor creating affinal ties between humans and divin-ities: when Arawete ́die, the gods consume thehuman spirits (making them into beings like them-selves), then rejuvenate and marry them (Viveiros deCastro 1992). Viveiros de Castro has observed thatamong the Arawete ́, Tupinamba ́, Yanomami, andPakaa Nova (Wari’), cannibalism ‘‘links affinesor transforms into affines those whom it links’’(1992:259).13Wari’ affinal cannibalism might suggest a Le ́vi-Straussian model of exchanges of cooked meat(human flesh) for ‘‘raw’’ (virgin, fecund) womengiven in marriage (Le ́vi-Strauss 1969). As in manysocieties, eating is a Wari’ metaphor for sexualintercourse, and there are obvious parallels betweenaffinal exchanges of human flesh in funerals and thefrequent exchanges of meat (which men give tofemale affines) and fish (which women give to maleaffines) that mark affinity in everyday life. From astructuralist perspective, Wari’ mortuary cannibal-ism resonates with exchanges of meat and marriagepartners, but Wari’ do not see it that way. Everyonewith whom I raised this issue rejected an equation ofcannibalism with exchanges of sexual partners orfood; some found the suggestion insulting. Sexualand reproductive imagery has little place in Wari’mortuary practices, in marked contrast to its prom-inence in many other societies’ mortuary rites (Blochand Parry 1982), and in Melanesian endocannibalismpractices linked to elaborate ideas about male andfemale body substances (see Gillison 1983; Poole1983).From an emic point of view, what was importantin cannibalistic Wari’ funerals was not the exchangeof substance (human flesh) but the exchange ofservices. Disposal of the body is a primary obligationof affinity, a service performed out of respect for thedead person and his or her family. When asked why itwas the affines who ate the corpse, Wari’ eldersinvariably replied that the affines ate it becausesomebody had to eat it, and the dead person’s con-sanguines (iri’nari) could not do so (because of theprohibition against eating the flesh of someone re-lated to oneself by shared biological substance). Inaddition, a number of people asserted that onesimply does not feel like eating anything when griev-ing intensely. Eating, particularly meat-eating,expresses happiness and social integration. Symbolicoppositions between sadness and oral activity(eating, drinking, singing, shouting) are numerous:adults eat little during close kin’s illnesses, consumenothing at their funerals, and eat little whilemourning. People considered it irrational to suggesteating flesh at a close relative’s funeral.By Wari’ logic, these cultural assumptions defini-tively precluded cannibalism by consanguines. Thetask thus fell to affines, who were the only clearlydefined social group that had close social ties to thedead person’s family but did not share their intimatebiological and affective ties to the deceased.14Affinalcannibalism was a matter of pragmatism.Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:17ampage 246‘‘Thus Are Our Bodies, Thus Was Our Custom’’: Mortuary Cannibalism in an Amazonian Society246"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"It was also a matter of politics. Mortuary servicesare central in marking, strengthening, and reconsti-tuting affinal ties after a death. Funerals drawextended families together as does no other event,and they are the most prominent occasion (asidefrom mixita fights) when affines act as discretegroups in complementary opposition to one another.In fulfilling mortuary obligations, including disposalof the corpse, Wari’ families linked by marriageaffirm continuing commitments that transcend thelifetime of any individual member.If one accepts this indigenous view of the disposalof corpses (whether by burial, cannibalism, or cre-mation) as a service rendered to the family of thedeceased, assigning this task to affines does notappear particularly unusual cross-culturally. In nativeAmazonian societies, affines perform burial andother funeral duties among the Cashinahua (Ken-singer, in press), Canela (W. Crocker, in press),and Shavante (Maybury-Lewis 1974:281). Amongthe Mundurucu ́(Murphy 1960:72) and Kagwahiv(Kracke 1978:13), these tasks fall to members ofthe opposite moiety, the group from which thedead person’s moiety takes marriage partners.Wari’ mortuary cannibalism fit this pattern of dele-gating mortuary tasks to affines and reflected theassociations between affinity and cannibalism foundin other lowland South American societies’ mythsand cosmologies. But this does not explain whyWari’ actuallyatetheir affines, whereas otherpeoples with similar conceptual systems did not. Inthis article, the question to be addressed is not whythe Wari’ ate their affines, but why cannibalism wasthe preferred treatment for human corpses.Eating as an Act of RespectPleasing the dead by consuming their bodies is arecurrent theme in Wari’ discussions of mortuarycannibalism: the dead wanted to be eaten, or at leastcremated, and not to have done either would havegiven offense. For dying individuals, the idea of beingincorporated into fellow tribesmembers’ bodies ap-parently had considerably more appeal than the al-ternative of being left to rot in the ground alone.15One man told of his great-aunt (FFZ) who, on herdeathbed, summoned him and his father (normallyexpected to cry rather than eat at her funeral) andasked them, as a favor, to join in consuming her body.In contrast to Western views of eating as an act ofobjectification and domination of the thing con-sumed, eating can express respect and sympathy inWari’ culture, especially in contrast to the alterna-tive of burial. The ground is considered ‘‘dirty’’ andpolluting. Adults who take pride in their bodies donot sit in the dirt, ritual objects must not touch theearth, and people avoid spilling food on the ground.These values influence attitudes towards burial in theearth, which informants often described as not onlydirty, but also ‘‘wet’’ and ‘‘cold.’’ Respectful treat-ment for human remains is dry and warm; the onlytraditional space for respectful burial was beneathhousehold sleeping platforms, where small firesburned almost constantly, keeping the earth warmas well as dry. This is where funeral ashes wereinterred in the past and where placentae and miscar-ried fetuses continue to be buried. Before the con-tact, burial in the forest expressed dishonor andnormally occurred in only one context: if a womansuffered multiple stillbirths or neonatal deaths, herfamily might request a male affine to bury her deadinfant in an anthill or in wet earth beside a stream todiscourage her future babies from dying and riskingsimilarly unpleasant treatment.In contrast to the disrespect manifest in burial,eating can be a sympathetic act, as shown in this storyabout the Maize Spirit (Jaminain Mapak) told by aSanto Andre ́man. The story explains why one shouldnot leave maize lying on the ground:Long ago, a man was walking to his field carrying abasket of maize seeds to plant. A maize kernel fell tothe ground on the path. The man did not see it andwent on. The maize seed began to cry like a child.Another man came along and found it crying on theground. He picked it up andateit. In doing so, hesavedit, showing that he felt sympathy [xiram pa’] for it. Theman who ate the seed planted his field and it yieldedgreat quantities of maize. The man who had left theseed on the ground planted his field, but nothing grew.This parable demonstrates Wari’ ideas that abandon-ing a spirit-being to lie on the forest floor connotesdisrespect, whereas eating it expresses respect.Eating can be an act of compassion that pleases theRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:17ampage 247Beth A. Conklin247"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"thing consumed so that it bestows abundance on theeater.Similar ideas about eating as an expression ofrespect for the eaten are evident in food taboosassociated withjami karawa, animals whose spiritshave human form (see Conklin 1989:336–50).Spirits never die, and when a hunter kills a jamikarawa animal, its spirit assumes a new animalbody. However, animal spirits cannot completetheir transitions to new physical bodies as long asportions of their former bodies remain. To avoidprovoking spirits’ wrath, one must quickly roastand eat jami karawa. Animal spirits are offended bythe killing and disrespectful treatment of theirbodies, not by the eating of their flesh. On thecontrary, eating demonstrates respect, especially incontrast to the alternative of abandoning uneatenbody parts on or in the ground.Several funeral customs expressed these values ofhonoring the dead by preventing their body sub-stances from being lost to the earth. When corpseswere cut, a close kinsman of the deceased sometimeslay face down, supporting the corpse on his backduring the butchering, so that its fluids would spillonto his own body rather than onto the ground.Similarly, elders recalled that young children’scorpses had much fat that dripped as they roasted;to prevent it from falling into the fire, a child’sgrieving parents and grandparents would catch thefat in a clay pot and smear it over their own heads andbodies as they cried. Mortuary cannibalism ex-pressed similar compassion for the dead by savingtheir body substances from abandonment to theearth and, instead, incorporating them into a livingperson’s body.In the early postcontact period, many Wari’ foundthe forced change to burial repulsive. One SantoAndre ́man told of his father’s death, which occurredsoon after outsiders had put an end to cannibalism.Unhappy with the prospect of being buried, thedying man requested that, as an approximation oftraditional practices, his corpse be dismembered andthe pieces placed in a large ceramic cooking pot to beburied by his affines. Even today, burial continues tobe a source of covert dissatisfaction among someelders, who still view burial as a less loving way totreat a human body than cannibalism or cremation.They consider the body’s persistence problematic forclose kin, whose attachments to the dead requireattenuation and transformation.Attachments to the Socially Constructed BodyWari’ view the human body as a primary nexus ofkinship, personhood, and social relations. Kinship isdefined as physically constituted in shared body sub-stance (especially blood) that is created by parentalcontributions to conception and gestation and aug-mented by interpersonal exchanges of body fluids.As individuals mature, each major change in socialstatus (at female puberty, male initiation, marriage,childbirth, enemy killings, and shamanic initiation) isbelieved to involve corresponding changes in bloodand flesh induced by incorporating another individ-ual’s body substances (Conklin 1989:177–239). Asin numerous other lowland South American soci-eties, ideas about the physical bases of social related-ness reflect heightened recognition of individuals’interdependence as social actors (see J. Crocker1977; da Matta 1979:105; Melatti 1979:65–8; See-geret al. 1979; Turner 1980). Interpersonal attach-ments are conceived as shared physical substancethat links individual body-selves in an organic unitytranscending the boundaries of discrete physicalforms.Not only are kinship and social status physicallyconstituted, but many cognitive and emotional pro-cesses are conceptualized as organic changes in theheart and blood, and behavior is considered to berooted in the body (see Kensinger 1991 on similarconcepts among the Cashinahua). This is reflected inthe termkwerexi’, which means ‘‘body’’ or ‘‘flesh’’but also means ‘‘custom,’’ ‘‘habit,’’ and ‘‘personality.’’A stock Wari’ response to the ethnographer’s plea toknow ‘‘Why do you do that?’’ is a shrug and thephrase ‘‘Je’ kwerexi’,’’ ‘‘Thus is our custom,’’ or, trans-lated literally, ‘‘Thus are our bodies (or flesh).’’ Wari’consider spirits to have few personality qualities, andthey account for individual behavioral differencesmostly with reference to differences in body sub-stance, not differences in mind or spirit. Peoples’habits, eccentricities, and personality quirks are ex-plained with ‘‘His flesh is like that’’ (Je’ kwerekun)or‘‘That’s the way her body is’’ (Je’ kwerekem).

In contrast,Wari’ corpses are potent embodiments of identity,social relations, and interpersonal bonds. Body trans-formations were a primary symbolic focus in trad-itional mortuary rites that aimed to restructurerelations between the dead and the living.Detachment and DestructionGradual detachment from thinking about and re-membering the dead is considered a desirable socialgoal, for prolonged sadness (tomi xaxa) is believed toendanger individual health and productivity. Thenegative psycho-emotional process of grieving isdescribed with the verbkoromikat, which refers tothe negative experience of nostalgia: missing, re-membering, and thinking longingly about a lost ordistant object (usually a kinsperson, lover, or friend).Wari’ emphasize vision and hearing as primarysources of knowledge and stimuli to memory. Be-cause the sight of material objects evokes memories,they consider it essential to destroy or transform alltangible reminders of the dead. They burn a deadperson’s house and personal possessions and burn,discard, or give away crops planted by the deceased.Less-easily destroyed modern possessions, such askettles, machetes, and shotguns, usually are givento nonrelatives. Neighbors often change theirhouses’ appearance by altering doorways and paths,and close kin cut their hair. People traditionally haveavoided using dead people’s names or kin referents,although in speaking to outsiders they have recentlyrelaxed name avoidances.The cultural rationale for these practices reflectstwo concerns: banishing ghosts, and removing stim-uli that evoke memories of the dead.16Vilac ̧a hasnoted:According to the Wari’, the destruction by fire of allreminders of the deceased is, in the first place, aprotection against the sadness that is felt upon seeingsomething that belonged to the deceased or that wastouched, used or made by him; but it is also a way toavoid the coming of the ghost. [1992:228]These dual concerns are consistent with the twoprimary objectives identified in cross-cultural ana-lyses of death rites: to remove the deceased from theworld of the living to the symbolic world of the dead,and to facilitate survivors’ acceptance of the deathand the consequent alteration of social life withoutthe dead person (Bloch and Parry 1982:4). Withregard to separating the dead from the living, thedestruction of material traces is believed to lessenthe tendency of ghosts (jima) to return to earth. Jimagenerally do not cause illness, but they do frightenpeople, and, in the days following a death, the jima ofthe recently deceased may try to carry kin away forcompanionship in death. Destroying possessions andaltering appearances confuse jima so that, unable tofind their former homes and companions, theyreturn to the otherworld of the dead. Some peoplealso suggested that the smoke surrounding roastingcorpses obscured and confused the vision of jimawho returned during their own funerals.Banishing spirits, or liberating spirits from theirphysical bodies, has been cited as a motive for canni-balism in some other lowland South American soci-eties (Albert 1985; Clastres 1974:316; Dole1974:306; Ramos 1990: 196; Zerries 1960). Meir-eles asserted that the explanation for Wari’ cannibal-ism was ‘‘based in the idea that the dead person’s soulmust be banished, at the risk of afflicting the living’’(Meireles 1986:427). Vilac ̧a (1992:233, 243, 262)has interpreted roasting as a dissociative mechanismrequired for spirits’ liberation from their bodies andfull transition to the afterlife.17This idea is clear inWari’ food taboos that require quick consumption ofcertain game animals to liberate the animal spiritsfrom their bodies (Conklin 1989:345–346; Vilac ̧a1992:70), but it appears to be of limited relevance inexplaining cannibalism. None of my informantsspontaneously suggested that eating the dead liber-ated spirits or prevented their return. Rather, whenasked if it had that effect, some agreed that it might.Others insisted that cannibalism had nothing to dowith banishing spirits. As evidence, they cited thefact, which no one disputed, that the ghosts ( jima) ofRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:17ampage 249Beth A.

In a cross-cultural study ofgrief and mourning, Rosenblatt et al. suggested thattie-breaking and ‘‘finalizing’’ acts (such as ghostfears, taboos on names of the dead, and destructionof personal property) facilitate survivors’ transitionsto new social roles:[I]n a long-term relationship such as marriage, innu-merable behaviors appropriate to the relationshipbecome associated with stimuli (sights, sounds,odors, textures) in the environment of the relation-ship. When death . . . makes it necessary to treat therelationship as ended and to develop new patterns ofbehavior, these stimuli inhibit the change, because theyelicit old dispositions. To facilitate change, tie-breakingpractices that eliminate or alter these stimuli seem tobe of great value. [1976:67– 8]Battaglia has highlighted the cultural value ascribedto acts of ‘‘forgetting as a willed transformation ofmemory’’ (1991:3) in Melanesian mortuary ritesthat transform materially constituted aspects of thedead person’s former social identity and replacethem with new images. The importance that Wari’ascribe to the destruction of reminders and proces-sual alteration of memories and images of the deadwas evident in the ritual calledton ho’(‘‘the sweep-ing’’), practiced today in an attenuated form (seeVilac ̧a 1992:227–9; for parallels among the Canela,see Crocker and Crocker 1994:121). For severalmonths after a death, senior Wari’ consanguines,especially kin of the same sex as the deceased,make repeated trips to the forest to seek out allplaces associated with the dead person’s memory:the place where a hunter made a blind to wait fordeer, sites where a woman fished or felled a fruittree, a favorite log where the dead person liked tosit. At each spot, the kinsperson cuts the vegetationin a wide circle, burns the brush, and sweeps overthe burned circle. Elders said that, while doing this,they thought intensely about the dead person,recalling and honoring events of his or her life.Afterward, the burning and sweeping have defini-tively altered sentiments associated with each placeso that ‘‘there is not much sadness there.’’The imperative to destroy tangible elements trad-itionally extended to the corpse itself. Given thestrength of Wari’ ideas about the body’s social con-struction and the physical bases of social relatedness,it is understandable that corpses are powerful re-minders.19A number of individuals commented thattoday, when people are buried rather than eaten,their thoughts return again and again to images of thebody lying under its mound of earth. A Santo Andre ́father who had recently buried a young son tried toexplain this to me, saying:I don’t know if you can understand this, because youhave never had a child die. But for a parent, when yourchild dies, it is a very sad thing to put his body in theearth. It is cold in the earth. We keep rememberingour child, lying there, cold. We remember and we aresad. In the old days when the others ate the body, wedid not think about [koromikat] his body much. We didnot think about our child so much, and we were not sosad.The emotional potency of mourners’ subjective at-tachments to the dead and their physical bodies is oneof the keys to understanding Wari’ cannibalism.20In traditional funerals, mourners’ dramatic mani-festations of physical identification with the deadperson’s body were followed by a dramatic sunderingof these bonds, beginning with the corpse’s dismem-berment.

Cannibalism initiated and facilitated theconstruction of a new relationship between the livingand the dead by evoking images of the dead person’sregeneration in animal form, and human-animalreciprocity, in which endocannibalism was themythic balance to human hunting.Predation and ReciprocityWari’ myth traces the origin of endocannibalism tothe establishment of mutual predator-prey relationsbetween hunters and animals. A story calledPinomisa variation of a widespread Amazonian mythic themeof the origins of cooking fire (see, for example, Le ́vi-Strauss 1969; Overing 1986; Wilbert and Simoneau1990:111–33). (For analysis of the Wari’Pinommyth, see Meireles 1986; Vilac ̧a 1989, 1992.) TheWari’ version tells how mortuary cannibalism ori-ginated as the consequence of the theft of fire, whichoriginally was possessed by an avaricious old womanwho ate children raw. Violating Wari’ principles ofegalitarian sharing, this cannibal-crone let peopletemporarily use her fire only in exchange for largepayments of firewood and fish. Without fire, Wari’could not farm, could not roast and eat maize or fish(most game animals did not yet exist), and had tosubsist on raw forest fruits and hearts of palm.Finally, two boys managed to outwit the oldwoman and steal her fire. They and the other Wari’escaped by climbing a liana into the sky, but the oldwoman pursued them. At the last moment, a piranhacame to their rescue and cut the vine. The cannibal-crone fell into her own fire below, and from herburning body emerged the carnivores: jaguars,ocelots, andorotapan(an unidentified carnivore,probably wolf or fox). In Wari’ cosmology, jaguarsnot only kill and eat humans but also transformthemselves into other animal spirits that cause illnessby capturing and eating human spirits. Otheranimals, including birds, monkeys, deer, and tapir,originated when the Wari’ turned into animals inorder to jump from the sky back to earth, and somedecided to remain animals. People and animals thusshare a common origin. The myth highlights Wari’ideas about the balance of human-animal opposition:game animals came into existence, but peoplebecame prey for jaguars and animal spirit predators.The origin of endocannibalism is attributed toparallel events in this myth’s second part. The twoboys turned into birds to carry the fire to earth, but aman named Pinom killed them and selfishly kept thefire to himself. Others could only watch hungrilywhile Pinom’s family alone was able to cook food.Finally, a shaman tricked Pinom, captured thecooking fire, and shared it with everyone, therebyallowing the Wari’: to become a hunting and farmingsociety. Outwitted and enraged, Pinom told theWari’: ‘‘Now you will have to roast your children!’’This is interpreted as the mythic origin of endo-cannibalism, even though Pinom did not specifyeating the dead, or affines’ roles in it. Althoughmost Wari’ are now familiar with Christian conceptsof sin and retribution, no one interpreted Pinom’sdictum as a terrible punishment for human misdeeds.Instead, informants saw endocannibalism as a naturalbalance to humanity’s acquisition of fire: the pricefor gaining fire to roast (and eat) animals was to beroasted (and eaten) oneself.Reciprocity in relations between humans andanimals is a common cross-cultural concept, espe-cially among native American peoples whose survivaldepends on hunting and fishing. Sanday identified thisidea as a recurrent theme in native North Americanmyths about the origins of cannibalism and suggestedthat it reflected the following logic: ‘‘There is areciprocal relationship between the eater and theeaten. Just as animals are hunted, so are humans;whoever wants to get food must become food’’(1986:38–9). Notions of balanced, reciprocal,human-animal predation are central in Wari’ cos-mology and eschatology. Mortuary cannibalism re-flected ideas of a human-nonhuman alliancepredicated on reciprocal predation between livingpeople and the spirits of animals and ancestors.Afterlife and AllianceIn Wari’ visions of the afterlife, the spirits of the deadreside under the waters of deep rivers and lakes.

Conklin251"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"ancestors appear as they did in life, but everyone isstrong, beautiful, and free of deformity, disease, andinfirmity. The ancestors’ social world resembles pre-contact Wari’ society, with villages, houses, fields,and intervillage festival exchanges. Life is easy andcrops grow abundantly, but all food is vegetarian;there is no hunting or fishing because all animals havehuman forms underwater.In this underworld, the Wari’ ancestors are alliedand intermarried with a neighboring indigenousgroup called ‘‘Water Spirits’’ (jami kom). TheWater Spirits appear human, but they are not Wari’ancestors and have never lived on earth as ordinarypeople. Rather, they are primal forces that controlhuman death, animal fertility, and destructivestorms. Their leader is a giant with huge genitalianamed Towira Towira (towirameans ‘‘testicle’’),who resembles the masters of animals and othermythic figures common in lowland South Americancosmologies (see, for example, Reichel-Dolmatoff1971:80–6; Zerries 1954). Towira Towira is masterof the entire underworld; all its inhabitants, includ-ing Wari’ ancestors, are called jami kom.Wari’ believe that when ancestral spirits emergefrom the water, they assume the bodies of white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari), a wild, pig-likeanimal that roams in large herds.21In everydayspeech,jami mijak, ‘‘white-lipped peccary spirit,’’ isone of the most common ways of referring to thedead. The nonancestral Water Spirits (TowiraTowira’s tribe) also can become white-lipped peccar-ies but more commonly appear as fish, especially asmasses of small, easily killed fish that appear unpre-dictably in the flooded forest’s shallow waters.The Wari’ cosmological system reflects a typicallyAmazonian view of cycles of reciprocal transform-ation and exchange between humans and animals(see, for example, Pollock 1992, in press; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1971). What is unusual about the Wari’case is that it links these ideas to an elaborate systemof real cannibalism, framed in terms of symbolic andpsychological rationales not previously examined inthe mortuary cannibalism literature.At the core of Wari’ spiritual concerns is the ideaof an alliance between Wari’ society and the WaterSpirits (comprised of both Wari’ ancestors andTowira Towira’s tribe). This is envisioned as a cyclicfestival exchange identical to the earthly hu ̈roroinand tamara festivals that affirm and reproduce amic-able relations among Wari’ villages. These alliance-marking rituals are structured around dramatizationsof antagonistic oppositions between a host village andvisitors from another community. Hu ̈roroin culmin-ate in the hosts’ symbolic killing of male visitors byinducing an unconscious state calleditamthat isexplicitly equated with death by predation (huntingor warfare).22The hosts revive the visitors from this‘‘death’’ with a warm water bath, symbol of birth andrebirth. Revival of the slain ‘‘prey’’ distinguishes this‘‘killing’’ by itam from mere hunting or warfare. In aprocess parallel to shamanic initiation (in which ananimal spirit kills and revives the initiate), the hu ̈r-oroin festival’s symbolic killing and revival create abond between the killer and the killed, such that thetwo transcend their opposition and become allies.Role reversals are inherent in festival exchanges: thefirst party’s visitor/prey usually later sponsor a festi-val at which the first party’s host/killers become thevisitor/prey who are ‘‘killed.’’Wari’ relations with the Water Spirits are con-ceived in identical terms, as festival exchanges inwhich the terrestrial and underwater societies alter-nate in the roles of predators (hosts) and prey (visit-ors), enacting a reciprocity reducible to an eminentlyegalitarian proposition: ‘‘We’ll let you kill us if youlet us kill you.’’ The Water Spirits fulfill their side ofthis arrangement by visiting earth as white-lippedpeccaries and fish that sing tamara songs, dance, andallow Wari’ to kill and eat them.23Wari’ reciprocateat the moment of biological death, when humanspirits allow themselves to be killed by the WaterSpirits. This occurs when a dying person’s spirit( jami-) journeys to the underworld and becomes aguest at the hu ̈roroin party that is always in progressthere. The hosts, Towira Towira and his wife, offermaize beer. If the spirit accepts, it enters itam and‘‘dies’’ underwater; on earth, the person’s physicalbody dies. As in terrestrial alliance festivals, TowiraTowira later bathes the spirit and resuscitates it. Hethen paints it with blackgenipapodye (Genipa ameri-cana), marking the dead person’s new identity as aWater Spirit.24Each society benefits from this arrangement.Humans provide the Water Spirit society with newRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:17ampage 252‘‘Thus Are Our Bodies, Thus Was Our Custom’’: Mortuary Cannibalism in an Amazonian Society252"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"members who marry and bear children, enhancingthe reproduction of Water Spirit society. The WaterSpirits provide the living Wari’ with life-sustaininganimal food. For Wari’, this exchange not onlyreproduces the primary human-nonhuman relationsof their cosmology but also promises an enhance-ment of ecological resources important to theirsubsistence. White-lipped peccaries and fish are theonly food animals encountered in dense concentra-tions in this environment; aside from the scarce andeasily over-hunted tapir, they can yield the greatestquantities of animal food in return for the leastexpenditure of time and effort. Although theyare relatively easy to kill when encountered, theirappearance is highly unpredictable.25Given thiscombination of uncertainty and high potential prod-uctivity, it is not surprising that Wari’ rituals focus onenhancing relations with peccaries and fish.The mythic origin of the Wari’ alliance with theWater Spirits is recounted in a story calledOrotapan,which tells of how Wari’, who used to be the WaterSpirits’ prey, became their allies instead. As allies,they gained the right to kill Water Spirits (as peccar-ies and fish) in return for submitting to being killedby them (at the time of biological death) and subse-quently hunted, as peccaries, by the living. Threeelements central to Wari’ socio-ecological securityoriginated in this myth: the festivals of intervillagealliance that ensure peace among neighbors, humans’postmortem transformations to peccaries (which allythe human and the nonhuman), and the songs thatsummon peccaries and fish to earth.In the story ofOrotapan, the power to hunt and eatthe ancestors/Water Spirits (as peccaries and fish) isbalanced by humans’ destiny to become peccaries tobe hunted and eaten. This is a reprise of themes fromthe myth ofPinom, in which the power to hunt andeat animals was balanced by the imperative forhumans to become meat to be eaten, as corpsesconsumed in endocannibalism. Whereas thePinomstory emphasizes the primal balance between humanand animal predation, the myth ofOrotapanconcernsthe creation of cultural institutions that transformpotentially antagonistic, antisocial, predator-prey re-lations into cooperative, security-enhancing alli-ances. The alliance festivals’ symbolic predationsubstituted for the real killing and eating of humansby animals in a precultural era. By accepting thishuman place in the universe, alternating betweenthe position of eaters and the eaten, Wari’ gainedthe animal spirits’ powers of predation.The power to summon their ancestral/WaterSpirit allies to come to earth as animals is at thecore of the sacred in Wari’ life. In a precontact ritualthat continues today in at least one community,villagers gather at night, before communal huntingor fishing expeditions, to sing the songs from theOrotapanmyth that invite the Water Spirits to earth.People avoid speaking of this music’s power; Ilearned of it only because, after the one occasionwhen I heard the spirit-summoning songs sung col-lectively, the peccaries appeared early the nextmorning for the first time in several months. Theherd passed just outside the village, and nine white-lippeds were killed – three times as many as on anyday in the previous two years at Santo Andre ́. Theentire community ceased work to feast on thisbounty of meat, a tangible embodiment of thehuman-nonhuman alliance.Hunting the AncestorsIn contrast to Durkheimian views of death as arupture in the social fabric to be mended, nativeAmazonian systems often treat death, not as discon-tinuity, but as essential for the continuation of sociallife (Viveiros de Castro 1992:255; see Graham1995). The Wari’ case offers a prime example ofdeath treated as a creative moment, a productivecontext for extending and renegotiating socialties that regenerate the cycle of human-animalexchanges.Human death is necessary to the reproduction ofthe peccaries and fish upon which Wari’ subsistenceand survival depend, and the perpetuation of Wari’–Water Spirit cooperation depends on the bonds ofaffection that link the recently deceased to theirliving kin. Only the recently dead, who still remem-ber their terrestrial kin and are remembered bythem, maintain active exchange relations with theliving. The spirits of the recently dead send or leadthe peccary herd to their living relatives’ huntingterritories, or send their allies, the fish.

Before butchering,a shaman is supposed to look at each peccary carcassto identify the human spirit inside. Today, people arelax about this; sometimes shamans are summoned toview peccaries, sometimes they are not. A peccaryspirit usually is identified as being a close consan-guine, or occasionally an affine, of the hunter whoshot it.Wari’ see nothing odd about hunting their ownrelatives, as I learned from a conversation that tookplace the day after two white-lipped peccaries wereslain. An elderly shaman was chatting with a youngwidower still saddened by his wife’s death two yearsearlier. The shaman mentioned that he had talked tothe roasting peccaries (who were killed by the de-ceased wife’s patrilateral parallel cousin) and that oneturned out to be the dead wife. ‘‘Is that so?’’ re-sponded the young man. ‘‘Is it all right in the water?’’‘‘She’s fine,’’ the shaman replied. ‘‘With the peccar-ies, she took a peccary husband and has a peccarybaby.’’ ‘‘That’s nice,’’ was the widower’s onlycomment.Eavesdropping while eating fruit nearby, I nearbychoked. ‘‘Hey!’’ I exclaimed. ‘‘Doesn’t that makeyou sad? Aren’t you sad that your wife’s cousin killedher yesterday and that you ate her today?’’ The youngman looked perplexed at my outburst, then replied,‘‘No; why should I be sad? He just killed herbody; she isn’t angry. Her children are eating meat.It doesn’t hurt her; she just will have anotherbody. Why should I be sad? The ancestors arehappy that we have meat to eat.’’To Wari’, the idea that some of the animals they eatare beloved kin is neither morbid nor repulsive, but anatural extension of familial food giving, a concretemanifestation of the ancestors’ continuing concernfor their families on earth. There are numerousstories of encounters with peccaries that were inter-preted as gifts of food sent by specific ancestors. Oneman told me that in the 1970s, when his mother wasdying, she told her family that she would send thepeccaries three days after her death. True to promise,on the third night, the herd thundered into thevillage, stampeding under elevated houses, sendingwomen and children screaming while men scrambledfor their shotguns. Most deaths are not followed bysuch immediate drama, but all peccary killings arepotentially interpretable as visits from the ancestors.Each new death strengthens and reproduces theWater Spirits’ ties to the world of the living.Final RitesThe positive image of the ancestors’ regeneration asanimals was the central theme of the traditionalsequence of mourning rites. The dead person’s inte-gration into Water Spirit society is seen as a gradualprocess: while the spirit is adjusting to life in theunderworld, earthly survivors are adjusting to lifewithout the deceased. The full realization of theseprocesses traditionally was marked by a ritual huntcalledhwet mao, meaning ‘‘the coming out’’ or ‘‘thereappearance.’’ In the Rio Dois Irma ̃os area, it waslast observed two decades ago.Mourning is a period of attenuated sociality.Mourners withdraw from most productive activitiesand social interactions, do not sing, dance, or attendparties, and spend a great deal of time inside theirhouses. They farm, hunt, and fish less than usual,and, consequently, eat little meat. Hwet mao markedthe transition back to full engagement in social life.When senior kin decided that it was time formourning to end (typically about a month or twobefore the anniversary of the death), the familydeparted for an extended hunt deep in the forest.They killed as much game as possible and preservedit on a huge roasting rack over a smoky, slow-burningfire. It was considered especially important thatcertain animals present themselves to be killed asevidence of positive relations between the Wari’ andtheir nonhuman allies. An encounter with the white-lipped peccaries could indicate that the deceased wasfully integrated into life in the afterworld and, re-membering loved ones on earth, had sent the herd tofeed them.At the full moon, the hunting party returnedhome carrying large baskets laden with game. Themourners painted their bodies for the first time sincethe death and made a ritual entrance into the village,ideally at the time of day when the deceased haddied. Then, leaning over the baskets heaped withmeat, they cried and sang kinship terms for the deadperson one last time. After this final, public expres-Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:17ampage 254‘‘Thus Are Our Bodies, Thus Was Our Custom’’: Mortuary Cannibalism in an Amazonian Society254"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"sion of sorrow and remembrance, an elder an-nounced, ‘‘Sadness has ended; now happinessbegins.’’ Feasting and singing followed, initiatingthe return to normal social life. In feasting ongame, the ex-mourners marked their acceptance ofthis death as part of the cycle of human-animalexchanges. Thus, the process that began with thefuneral where the dead person’s affines cannibalizedthe corpse concluded with consanguines and affinestogether eating the animal meat provided by the deadand their spirit allies.Eating the DeadViewed in the context of the yearlong series oftraditional mourning rites structured around thedead person’s transition to white-lipped peccary,the roasting and eating of the corpse appears as afirst, symbolic marker of this change. Consistentwith Hertz’s (1960[1907]:34, 58) insight that trans-formations of the corpse often parallel changeshappening to the dead person’s spirit, Wari’ envi-sioned that at the moment when the cutting of thecorpse commenced at the earthly funeral, TowiraTowira began to bathe and resuscitate the spiritunderwater. This resuscitation made the deceasedinto a Water Spirit who eventually would return toearth as a peccary. For terrestrial mourners, thecorpse’s dismemberment and roasting evoked thishuman-to-animal transformation.‘‘When we made the big fire and placed the bodythere, it was as if the dead person became a white-lipped peccary [ak ka mijak pin na],’’ explained a maleelder of Santo Andre ́. Switching to Portuguese, heemphasized, ‘‘It appeared to be peccary [parece queix-ada].’’ As mourners watched a beloved relative’scorpse being dismembered, roasted, and eaten, thesight must have graphically impressed upon themboth the death’s finality and the dead person’s futureidentity as a peccary that would feed the living.Dismembering the body that is the focus of somany notions of personhood and relatedness madea dramatic symbolic statement about the dead per-son’s divorce from human society, and imminentchange from living meat eater to animal meat to beeaten. Cannibalism appears to have been the pre-ferred method for disposing of the dead becauseeating (as opposed to cremation) not only destroyedthe corpse but also affirmed the dead individual’seventual regeneration as an immortal animal.Cannibalism made a symbolic statement about theeaters as well as the eaten. At the same time that itevoked images of the dead as peccaries, numerousprior aspects of funeral rites and mourning behavioremphasized the humanity and social identity of theeaten, explicitly rejecting any equation of human fleshwith animal flesh. Thus, when mourners roasted andate human flesh, they themselves were cast as carni-vores, identified with the animal powers of predationtraced to thePinomandOrotapanmyths. Funeral dec-orations recalled these associations: firewood androasting racks were adorned with feathers of vulturesand scarlet macaws (Orotapan’s sacred bird), andfirewood was tied with ‘‘fire vine’’ (makuri xe), aliana associated with warfare and predatory powerslinked to the Water Spirits and the jaguar-cannibal inthe myth ofPinom.Eating the dead identified Wari’ society as a wholewith the transcendent powers of their allies, theimmortal Water Spirits. Cannibalism evoked andenacted the human position in this relationship, thealternation between the positions of meat-eater andmeat to be eaten. Bloch (1992) has argued that awide variety of religious and political rituals is struc-tured around a quasi-universal dynamic: the trans-formation of individuals from prey/victims intohunter/killers. This theme, which is explicit in theorigin myths ofPinomandOrotapan, was the centralimage underlying the traditional Wari’ mortuaryritual sequence. The death rites moved livingmourners from the position of being victims of theWater Spirit forces of death to becoming hunters ofWater Spirits embodied as animals. At the sametime, as was consistent with the egalitarian reci-procity that permeates Wari’ social arrangements,the rites also enacted the reverse dynamic, markinghumans’ postmortem destiny to become animals,transformed from eaters into the eaten.Mourning and TransformationThe image of the dead as peccaries dominates Wari’visions of death and the afterlife. The ancestors’return as peccaries is a powerful negation of death’sRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:17ampage 255Beth A. Conklin255"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"finality. It promises not only reunion after death butalso contacts during life through encounters with theherd that are the only interactions that ordinarypeople (nonshamans) have with their deceased kin.This is not just an abstract religious notion but amoving experience for the many individuals whohave interpreted encounters with peccaries as visitsfrom dead relatives.Cannibalism represented a dramatic affirmation ofthis human-to-animal transformation, an affirmationof the interdependency of human mortality andanimal fertility. Thematic links between death andregeneration are prominent in many societies’ mor-tuary rites (Bloch and Parry 1982; Metcalf and Hun-tington 1991), and the psychological importance ofideas about the continuity of life after death is widelyrecognized (see Lifton 1979). The Wari’ preferencefor cannibalism as a way to dispose of human corpsesreflected the intersection between these psycho-logical-spiritual concerns, cast in images of humanspirits’ regeneration as peccaries, and cultural con-cepts of the human body’s social meanings. As a focusof social identity and psycho-emotional ties betweenthe living and the dead, the dead person’s bodyserved as the primary locus for the playing out oftransformations of mourners’ memories, images,and emotions related to the deceased. Beginningwith the corpse’s dismemberment, roasting, andeating, and proceeding through the memory-altering‘‘sweeping’’ ritual (ton ho’) to the final hunt(hwet mao) and feast, the mourning rites posited aprocessual transmutation of socially projectedimages of the dead person’s body. The rites aimedto move mourners from experiences of loss, em-bodied in images of the deceased as corpse, to ac-ceptance of the death as part of a regenerative cycle,embodied in images of the deceased rejuvenated asan animal.It is difficult to assess, retrospectively, the extentto which the ritual transformations that operated onthe level of the culturally constructed person alsooperated on the level of the individual. However,contemporary Wari’ emphases on cannibalism’s psy-chological significance, as an act that facilitatedmourners’ detachment from all-consuming memor-ies of the dead, and elders’ expressions of emotionaldissonance concerning burial, suggest that manypeople found the body’s destruction by cannibalismmeaningful in personal experiences of grief andmourning. The eating of the dead was one powerfulelement in a social process of mourning understoodto have eased the experience of coming to terms witha loved one’s death. By casting the dead in the imageof the animals they would become, cannibalismoverlaid images of the deceased as corpse with newimages of the deceased as an animal with ongoingrelations to its living kin. It affirmed the transmuta-tion of specific kinship ties between the living and thedead into a general enhancement of life-supportingrelations between humans and animals. In essence,cannibalism was the dead person’s first offering ofself as food.ConclusionThe explanation for Wari’ mortuary cannibalismcannot be reduced to a single, simple function, forit reflected a complex amalgam of myth, eschat-ology, ideas about the human body, and social, psy-chological, and ecological concerns. Extending Le ́vi-Strauss’s (1977:65) observation about myth, theseare best understood as ‘‘aninterrelationof severalexplanatory levels.’’ As a central symbol in the ritesof mourning, cannibalism presented a powerful,symbolic condensation of beliefs about life’s continu-ity after death, affirmed in the ancestors’ regener-ation as animals. Mortuary cannibalism’s symbolicpotency derived from its evocation of multiple di-mensions of the social and ecological relations inwhich Wari’ perceive their security to be grounded.In the rites of mourning, human-nonhuman oppos-itions merged in what Sanday (1986:226) has called a‘‘ritual of reconciliation’’ that transformed unpre-dictable ecological and social constraints into ameaningful conceptual order. Much anthropologicaldiscourse on cannibalism has tended to treat cul-tural-symbolic and ecological interpretations asmutually exclusive paradigms, but, explored in indi-genous terms, the Wari’ system is a symbiosis ofsocial and ecological concerns that must be con-sidered holistically. The material motivations associ-ated with endocannibalism were not biological needsfor protein from human flesh, but concerns withstructuring cultural meanings in regard to human-Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:17ampage 256‘‘Thus Are Our Bodies, Thus Was Our Custom’’: Mortuary Cannibalism in an Amazonian Society256"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"animal relations that were essential, not just to sub-sistence but to the entire social order.In contrast to views of anthropophagy as theultimately antisocial act, the act of eating the deadaffirmed and reproduced the bases of Wari’ society.Endocannibalism was mythically linked to the originsof culture and the festival exchanges that transformpotentially antagonistic relations into cooperativealliances between neighboring villages, and betweenhumans and the nonhuman forces of death andanimal fertility. As mortuary rites renewed theprimary spiritual relations of the Wari’ universe, sothey also revitalized relations on the social plane withthe gathering of affines in support of the dead per-son’s family. Wari’ cannibalism involved not therecycling of vital energies or body substances, butthe renewal of vital institutions of socio-ecologicalsecurity.A Wari’ elder recalled that shortly after the con-tact, a missionary lectured him, saying, ‘‘Eating is foranimals. People are not animals, people are not meatto be eaten.’’ In Western thought, the revulsion thatcannibalism provokes is related to its apparent blur-ring of distinctions between humans and animals, intreating human substance like animal meat. ForWari’, however, the magic of existence lies in thecommonality of human and animal identities, in themovements between the human and nonhumanworlds embodied in the recognition through canni-balism of human participation in both poles of thedynamic of eating and being eaten.NOTES1The final syllable is stressed in all Wari’ words.Wa r i ’ispronounced ‘‘wa-REE,’’ ending in a glottal stop.2Most reports of endocannibalism involve eating onlysmall bits of flesh from specific body parts (the typicalMelanesian pattern) or consuming only the ashes ofcremated bones, which appears to have been the mostwidespread Amazonian pattern (see Dole 1974; Meir-eles 1986; Zerries 1960). In lowland South America,consumption of substantial amounts of fellow tribes-members’ boiled or roasted flesh has been reportedamong the Guayakı ́of Paraguay (Clastres 1974) andPanoan peoples along the Peru-Brazil border (Dole1974).3In excluding exocannibalism from this discussion, I donot mean to imply that it had no relation to mortuarycannibalism. Vilac ̧a (1992:289–94) has emphasizedthat Wari’ cannibalism of both enemies and affinesexpressed a broad ‘‘cannibal logic’’ of reversibility inthe positions of predator and prey in Wari’ relations tosocial others. Erikson (1986), Overing (1986), andViveiros de Castro (1992) have noted that the trad-itional anthropological distinction between exo- andendocannibalism blurs in the face of the complexforms of cannibalism envisioned in lowland SouthAmerican myths, cosmologies, and rituals.4All translations of Wari’ oral texts are my own, as areall translations of written texts (with foreign titles).5The assertion that eating corpses involved no transferof biosocial substances or energies is consistent withthe logic of Wari’ ethnomedicine, conception theory,and shared substance concepts, in which attributes aretransferred among individuals only by blood and itsanalogs (breast milk, semen, vaginal secretions, andperspiration), not by ingesting roasted flesh (see Con-klin 1989:274–304). Roasting is believed to dry up orneutralize the potency of blood and other body fluids;contact with corpses is polluting, but eating well-roasted flesh was not believed to transfer any qualitiesfrom the corpse to those who ate it. Clastres reporteda similar idea in Guayakı ́thought about endocannibal-ism: ‘‘On eating human flesh one does not acquireanything more, there is no positive influence’’(1974:316).6Extensive incest prohibitions promote dispersed aff-inal alliances (Meireles 1986:273), and families gen-erally intermarry with two or more different groupsof affines. At the same time, there is an emphasis onrepeating as well as proliferating affinal ties by takingspouses from families already linked by previous mar-riages.7The Wari’ traditionally practiced cremation as analternative way to dispose of corpses whose flesh wasconsidered dangerous to eat because it was contamin-ated by specific disease conditions. Corpses werecremated, not eaten, when they had pus in theirlungs, or symptoms resembling liver disorders (ascitesand cirrhosis). The outsiders who suppressed Wari’cannibalism, however, did not present cremation as anoption, perhaps because cremation is discouraged inLatin American Catholicism.8For more detailed discussions of funeral practices andvariations, see Conklin (1989:407–17) and Vilac ̧a(1992:208–21).

Themass death and social chaos of the contact-era epidem-ics brought similar disruptions of funeral practices,including painful episodes in which corpses wereabandoned, and subsequently ravaged by vultures,because the survivors were too sick to cut the largeamounts of firewood needed for roasting or crema-tion.9Nariis a verb meaning ‘‘to be related.’’ The propernominative designations for consanguines andaffines, respectively, areiri’ ka-nariandoro-ka-naripaxi. In this text, I follow Vilac ̧a (1992) in usingsimplified verbal forms, iri’ nari and nari paxi. Simi-larly, mixita, ton ho’ and hwet mao are verbs; thenominative designations areka-mixita-wa, ka-ton ho’-wa, andka-hwet mao-wa.10This antihomeopathic idea recurs in Wari’ shamanismand ethnomedicine. A shaman shares body substancewith his animal spirit companion and falls violently illif he eats that animal’s flesh. Similarly, certain ill-nesses are attributed to ingesting substances that aresimilar to one’s own body substance, but in a morepotent, incompatible state (Conklin 1989:302–12).Corpses’ flesh and body fluids, transformed by pu-trefaction, are considered dangerous only wheningested by their close consanguines. When eatenby affines and non-kin, roasted flesh is not believed tocause illness, although it is regarded as polluting.11Most women in the Rio Dois Irma ̃os region said thatthey participated in mortuary cannibalism. In the RioNegro-Ocaia region, many women said that they didnot eat human flesh because they disliked its stench.Vilac ̧a (1992:216–17) cited one senior man who alsoclaimed never to have eaten the dead. In addition,some women who usually participated in cannibalismtold of decisions not to eat a specific affine’s corpsebecause they felt too close, emotionally, to the deadperson. Men were expected to perform impassivelythe duty of consuming the corpse, regardless oftheir feelings of intimacy with the deceased or therevulsion provoked by the smell and taste of decayedflesh.12Rosaldo (1989) has called attention to the power ofemotions in shaping cultural responses to death.Wari’ anger over relatives’ deaths generally appearsto have been directed outwards, into sorcery accus-ations against Wari’ in other communities or retali-atory attacks on Brazilians or other indigenouspopulations. Wari’ testimonies about mortuary can-nibalism give little reason to think that it expressedor vented anger or resentment, although the possi-bility cannot be ruled out entirely.13In a provocative discussion that is beyond the scope ofthis article, Albert (1985) and Overing (1986) havediscussed associations between affinity and images ofcannibalism among the Yanomami and Piaroa, res-pectively, in relation to issues of social harmony,violence, warfare, and the internal dynamics of en-dogamous, egalitarian societies. Carneiro da Cunhaand Viveiros de Castro (1985) have addressed relateddynamics of vengeance and reciprocity in Tupinamba ́exocannibalism.14A similar rationale shaped affines’ roles in euthanasia:when an elderly person suffering from a terminalillness wished to die, he or she summoned a maleaffine to perform the killing. Funerals were only oneof several contexts in which Wari’ traditionally calledupon affines to perform such services.15A horror of burial, and preference for being canni-balized or cremated, has been reported amongPanoans (Erikson 1986:198), Yanomami (Lima Fig-ueiredo 1939:44), Guayakı ́(Clastres 1974:319), andTupinamba ́war captives (Viveiros de Castro1992:289–90).16Efforts to extinguish material traces of the dead arewidespread in lowland South America. Especiallycommon are name avoidances and the destructionof dead people’s houses and personal property (see,for example, Albert 1985; Gregor 1977:264; Jack-son 1983:200; Kracke 1981:262; Me ́traux 1947).The dual rationales of discouraging ghosts fromreturning to their homes, and removing remindersthat cause sadness to the bereaved, are recurrentthemes. Kracke commented that among the Kagwa-hiv, these two different rationales are given ‘‘so inter-changeably that it almost seems as if they are differentways of phrasing the same thing’’ (1988:213–14).17According to Vilac ̧a, ‘‘Only after the body is roastedand devoured, is thejam[spirit] of the deceasedbathed under the water, and [it] passes to full livingin the world of the dead’’ (1992:247).18Vilac ̧a has emphasized that ‘‘for the Wari’ culinarypreparation (which is initiated with the cutting of theprey) and devouring are interrelated and indissoci-able processes. The cadaver is roasted in the fire that,in its origin, is cooking fire (see the myth ofPinom).In this sense the cadaver is prepared as prey andshould be ingested as such’’ (1992:263).Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:17ampage 258‘‘Thus Are Our Bodies, Thus Was Our Custom’’: Mortuary Cannibalism in an Amazonian Society258"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"19Viveiros de Castro (1992:213) has noted Tupi ideasof a connection between the persistence of a corpse’sflesh and the persistence of memories linking thedead and the living.20Vilac ̧a’s Wari’ informants echoed these sentiments.She cited one man’s explanation: ‘‘‘If we bury, wethink about where he [the deceased] walked, wherehe worked; we think about his skin being there in theearth still. With the fire it is good, it finishes allthe body, we don’t think more’’’ (Vilac ̧a 1992:265).21White-lipped peccaries are prominent in nativeAmerican myths and rituals, from Mexico south tothe Argentinian Chaco (see Donkin 1985:83–94;Sowls 1984:185–7). They often are consideredclosely related to people. InThe Raw and the Cooked,Le ́vi-Strauss (1969:84) identified peccaries as anintermediary between jaguars (the quintessentialanimal predators) and human beings.22Hu ̈roroin parties are structured around oppositionsbetween a host community and visitors from else-where who sing and dance for their hosts. Malevisitors stage dramatic raids on the hosts’ village,destroy property, and perform parodies of sexualintercourse with host women. Hosts punish thesetransgressions by forcing the visitors to drink andvomit vast quantities of maize beer. With repeatedvomiting, some lose consciousness and enter itam, inwhich they bleed from the mouth and experienceinvoluntary muscular contractions that force thebody into a rigid fetal position. When this occurs,the party’s sponsor cries, ‘‘I’ve killed my prey!’’ (‘‘Pa’pin’ inain watamata!’’). Submission to the physicallypainful ‘‘death’’ of itam affirms both a man’s physicalstamina and his trust in the allies who care for andrevive him (see Conklin 1989:148–54; Vilac ̧a1992:186–91).23Metaphors of reciprocity pervade relations to thepeccaries. Just as precontact party hosts sent theirguests home bearing gifts, Wari’ hunters tradition-ally gave presents to the spirits of slain white-lippedpeccaries, and occasionally do so today. Beforebutchering, a peccary carcass is surrounded withitems such as bows and arrows, baskets, chicha,shotguns, clothing, and cigarettes. The peccary istold to carry the ‘‘images’’ ( jami-) of these itemshome and tell fellow Water Spirits that they, too, willbe given gifts when they visit the Wari’.24Pollock has described strikingly similar eschato-logical beliefs among the Kulina of Acre, Brazil. Atdeath, Kulina spirits journey to the underworld andreceive a ritual welcome from their ancestors who, aswhite-lipped peccaries, fall upon the spirit and con-sume it. Like Wari’, Kulina believe that the ancestorsreturn to earth as white-lipped peccaries that arehunted by living people. Unlike Wari’, the Kulinasystem carries this cycle one step further: white-lipped peccary meat becomes the souls of Kulinababies.25Kiltie observed that ‘‘[w]hite-lippeds are distinctiveamong all the terrestrial herbivorous mammals inneotropical rain forests in being the only species thatforms large herds, which may include over 100 indi-viduals’’ (1980:542). Hunting white-lipped peccariesis an unpredictable business, for the herds range overhuge territories, never lingering long in one place anddisappearing for weeks or months at a time. However,when the herd does appear, it offers relativelyeasy targets and multiple kills are common, makingwhite-lipped peccaries the single most important ter-restrial game in the diets of the Wari’ and manyother native Amazonians. Fishing involves similarpatterns of high potential yield with a high quotientof procurement uncertainty; in the flooded forest,dense concentrations of huge numbers of small,easily-caught fish occasionally appear, quite unpre-dictably, in the fluctuating waters of temporarystreams and ponds.26Although the spirit was believed to be revived whenits corpse was dismembered and roasted, this revivaldoes not appear to have been contingent on thecorpse’s being eaten. Several individuals describedscenarios in which a spirit, revived when its corpsewas cut, returned to earth and saw its own, stilluneaten body roasting. Without exception, inform-ants asserted that Towira Towira revived all spiritsalike, regardless of whether their corpses were can-nibalized, cremated, or buried. Vilac ̧a (1992:265)has suggested that, since the change to burial, Wari’have come to see the rotting of the corpse as a kind ofnatural ‘‘cooking’’ that substitutes for the roasting attraditional funerals.REFERENCESAcosta Saignes, Miguel, 1961 Estudios de Etnologia An-tigua de Venezuela.

The firstsection focuses on the case of the householder. Forhim, I argue, the ‘good’ death is a sacrificial act whichresults not only in a re-creation of the deceased, butalso in a regeneration of time and of the cosmos. Inthe second section I turn to a group of ascetics whoare intimately associated with death, corpses and thecremation ground. By contrast with the householder,the somewhat macabre practice of the Aghori asceticis directed at a suspension – rather than a renewal –of time, and is thus an attempt to escape from therecurrence of death implied by the endless cycle ofrebirths.1The singularity of his means to this end lies(as Eliade (1969:296) perceived) in a peculiarlymaterial and literal play on the common Hindutheme of the combination of opposites; but boththe end itself and its theological justification are –we shall find – expressed in thoroughly conventionallanguage.2Although the life of the householder and the life ofthe ascetic are oriented towards two different goals,both share in the same complex of interconnectedassumptions about the relationship between life anddeath. As Shulman (1980:90) puts it:The Hindu universe is a closed circuit: nothing newcan be produced except by destroying or transformingsomething else. To attain more life – such as a son, orthe ‘rebirth’ of the sacrificial patron himself – the lifeof the victim must be extinguished. Life and death aretwo facets of a single never-ending cycle.Consistent with this, we shall encounter an image oflife as a limited good: thus a barren woman mayconceive by causing the child of another to witheraway and die. Death regenerates life: the house-holder sacrifices himself on his funeral pyre inorder than he may be reborn; while the powerderived from his intimacy with death and decayenables the Aghori ascetic to confer fertility on thehouseholder (and this despite his own disparagementof the ordinary mortal condition). What is more, thepower to convert death into life is seen as intim-ately connected with the performance of asceticFrom Jonathan Parry, ‘‘Sacrificial Death and the Necrophagous Ascetic,’’ inDeath and the Regeneration of Life, eds.

The cremation rituals of the householder– with their insistence on the complete eliminationof the remains of the deceased – recall, moreover,the ascetic’s denigration of the ‘gross’ physical body.Seen from this point of view the opposition betweenascetic and householder would not appear radical.But from another perspective the differenceisfun-damental, for while the renouncer’s goal is a per-manent state of being unfettered by any materialform, the cremation rituals of the householder holdout only the promise of a renewed existence which isitself impermanent, and in which the immortal soulis unbreakably chained to a particular transient form.At the outset I should acknowledge that – forreasons which will become obvious – there aremany gaps in my data relating to the Aghoris, andshould explicitly state that I have not personallywitnessed many of the secret performances withwhich they are most closely associated. What needsto be kept firmly in mind then is that at various pointsthe account relates, not so much to what theseascetics actually do, as to what they say they do andwhat other people believe them to do.My ethnography is from the city of Benares,3oneof the most important centres of Hindu pilgrimage inIndia. Benares is sacred to Siva, the Great Ascetic,the Lord of the Cremation Ground and the Con-queror of Death; and the cornerstone of its religiousidentity is its association with death and its tran-scendence. All who die here automatically attain‘liberation’ or ‘salvation’ (mukti, moks:a) – an induce-ment which attracts many elderly and terminally-sick people to move to the city. Each year thousandsof corpses of those who have been unfortunate orundeserving enough to expire elsewhere are broughtto Benares for cremation on one of the two principalburninggha ̄t:s; while vast numbers of pious pilgrimscome to immerse the ashes of a deceased relative inthe Ganges or to make offerings to the ancestors.Death in Benares is big business, which – as I haveoutlined elsewhere (Parry, 1980) – involves an elab-orate division of labour between a number of differ-ent kinds of caste specialists variously associated withthe disposal of the corpse, the fate of the soul and thepurification of the mourners.Sacrificial Death and the Regeneration of LifeManikarnikagha ̄t:is the best patronised of the city’stwo cremation grounds. It was here that at thebeginning of the time Lord Visnu sat for 50000years performing the austerities by which he createdthe world, and here that the corpse of the cosmoswill burn at the end of time. But these events occurnot only at the start and finish of each cosmic cycle.They also belong to an eternal present which iscontinually reactualised on thegha ̄t:in the uninter-rupted sequence of cremations performed there.A recurrent theme in Hindu religious thought isthe homology which is held to exist between bodyand cosmos. Both are governed by the same laws, areconstituted out of the same five elements and every-thing that exists in the one must also exist in theother (cf. Goudriaan, 1979:57). Hence all the godsand the whole of space are present within the humanbody – a notion which is explicitly elaborated in theGaruda Purana(part 15), an eschatological text towhich the Benares sacred specialists continuallyrefer. The homology is also one of the basic prin-ciples underlying the architectural theory of theHindu temple, which is constructed on the plan ofa cosmic man (Beck, 1976); while many forms ofworship involve a ‘cosmicisation’ of the body of theworshipper (Gupta, 1979). A case in point is pro-vided by the rituals described in theKalika Purana.The worshipper begins by symbolically effecting hisown death which is identified with the death of theworld; and in subsequently re-creating his body hereconstitutes the universe. It is of some significancefor what follows that the sacred space within whichall this occurs represents ‘a stylised cremationground’ (Kinsley, 1977:102).Body and cosmos are thus equated; and this –combined with our last example – would seem toimply a further equivalence between cremationwhich destroys the microcosm of the physical bodyand the general conflagration which destroys themacrocosm atpralaya, the time of cosmic dissol-ution. (Indeed certain of the texts classify an individ-ual death asnityapralaya– a regularly-enactedRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:19ampage 266Sacrificial Death and the Necrophagous Ascetic266"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"doomsday (Biardeau, 1971:18, 76)). But just as theworld’s annihilation by fire and flood is a necessaryprelude to its re-creation, so the deceased is cre-mated and his ashes immersed in water in order thathe may be restored to life. Since the body is thecosmos the last rites become the symbolic equivalentof the destructionand rejuvenationof the universe.Cremation is cosmogony; and an individual death isassimilated to the process of cosmic regeneration.Popular thought certainly presupposes some intrin-sic association between cremation and the scene oforiginal creation, for one of the reasons given for thebitter opposition to a Municipal plan to relocate theburninggha ̄t:away from the centre of the city wasthat it is not possible to sever its connection with theplace of the prolonged austerities (tapas) by whichVisnu engendered the world.Now such austerities generate heat, which is inmany contexts represented as the source of life andfertility. Thus Agni (the god of fire) is represented asthe ‘cause of sexual union’ (O’Flaherty, 1973:90).Through the heat of his austerities the ascetic ac-quires a super-abundant sexual potency, and a cre-ative power by which he may rival or even terrorisethe gods; through the cremation pyre the sevenstorm-gods are born (O’Flaherty, 1973:109); andthrough bathing in the tank of Lolark Kund in Ben-ares, fecundity is conferred on barren women – thetank being sacred to the sun, the source of heat.Consistent with this, Visnu is described as burningwith the fire of thetapasby which he created thecosmos at Manikarnikagha ̄t:. By entering the pyrehere the deceased – as it were – refuels the fires ofcreation at the very spot where creation began.Indeed I have heard cremation described as a kindoftapas,and certain of the texts clearly represent it assuch (Knipe, 1975:132; cf. Kaelber, 1976, who putsit in terms of Agni impartingtapasto the corpse).Another way of developing the same argumentwould be to note that cremation is a sacrifice,4andthat the essence of the textual conception of thesacrifice is that it is a cosmogonic act. Thus – toinvoke a different account of the origins of theuniverse – every sacrifice may be said to replicatethe primal act of Prajapati who produced creation bythe sacrificial dismemberment of his own body. AsHeesterman (1959:245–6) puts it: ‘The sacrificemay be described as a periodical quickening ritualby which the universe is recreated . . . the pivotalplace is taken up by the sacrificer; like his prototypePrajapati he incorporates the universe and performsthe cosmic drama of disintegration and reintegra-tion’.Anysacrifice then is, as Eliade (1965:11)affirms, a ‘repetition of the act of creation’ andmaintains or repairs the cosmic order (Zaehner,1962:245–6; Malamoud, 1975; Biardeau, 1976:22;Herrenschmidt, 1978 and 1979). It therefore repre-sents a renewal of time.What, then, is the evidence thatcremationis asacrifice (and hence an act of cosmic regeneration)?Here we might start by observing that the term forcremation in Sanskrit and in the Sanskritised Hindi ofmy more literate informants isantyes:t:i, or ‘last sacri-fice’; and that one of the manuals of ritual practiceregularly used as a guide to the mortuary rites (theS ́raddha Parijat) explicitly equates cremation with afire sacrifice. Or, to cite a different authority (thoughnot one which my informants ever invoked), theS ́atapatha Brahmanarepresents the sacrifical firealtar ritual as symbolic re-enactment of the story ofPrajapati, and then goes on to lay down preciselythe same rules for handling the corpse of adeceased sacrificer as for treating the sacrificialaltar which represents the body of the god (Levin,1930).The parallels between cremation and thesacrificial procedure are, as Das points out, almostprecise.Thus the site of cremation is prepared in exactly thesame way as in fire-sacrifice, i.e. the prescriptive use ofritually pure wood, the purification of the site, itsconsecration with holy water, and the establishmentof Agni with the proper use ofmantras. . . The deadbody is prepared in the same manner as the victim of asacrifice and is attributed with divinity. Just as thevictim of a sacrifice is exhorted not to take any revengefor the pains which the sacrifice has inflicted on him(Hubert & Mauss, 1964) so the mourners pray to thepretato spare them from his anger at the burns hehas suffered in the fire (Garuda Purana). (Das,1977:122–3)The corpse is given water to drink, is lustrated,anointed with ghee and enclosed in sacred space byRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:19ampage 267Jonathan Parry267"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"being circumambulated with fire – which is preciselywhat Hubert and Mauss (1964:31) describe ashappening to the sacrificial victim. Further, thesame set of ten substances (known asdasang) whichare offered in the pyre are also used for the firesacrifice (havan); while according to the standardmanual of mortuary practice – thePreta Manjari(p.4) – the wood used for the pyre should be that which‘pertains to a sacrifice’ (ya ̄gyik).All this poses a puzzle. On the face of it therewould seem to be a flat contradiction between ourreceived wisdom that the corpse is pre-eminentlypolluting and dangerous, and the notion that it is afit sacrificial offering to the gods. The situation iscomplex and the evidence is hard to interpret andoften appears contradictory. Much of my data wouldcertainly support the view that the corpse is contam-inating (and indeed the enormous symbolic power ofthe association between corpses and the Aghoriascetic rests on this fact). But this is far from thewhole story, for in certain respects the dead bodyappears to be treated as an object of great purity, evenas a deity. It is said to be Siva, is greeted withsalutations appropriate to Siva (cries of ‘Har, Har,Maha ̄dev’), and continual play is made on the phoneticsimilarity between Siva ands ́ava(‘corpse’). It must beguarded against pollution, may not be touched by theimpure, is wrapped in freshly-laundered cloth, iscircumambulated with the auspicious right hand to-wards it and the pyre is ignited by the chief mourneronly after he has passed through an elaborate series ofpurifications (cf. Stevenson, 1920:144 –8). He offersthe fire with his right hand; and at this time his sacredthread hangs over his left shoulder towards the right-hand side of his body, as is the rule when offerings aremade to the gods (whereas it hangs from right to leftwhen the offering is to the ancestors or to an unin-corporated ghost). Or again, in the custom of certainregional communities represented in Benares, thecorpse of a woman who has died in childbirth orduring her monthly course must undergo specialpurificatory rites before she is fit for the pyre, as ifonly those in a state of purity are eligible for crema-tion (cf. Stevenson, 1920:151; Kane, 1953:231;Pandey, 1969:270–1).I cannot confidently claim to be able to provide adefinitive explanation for this apparent contradic-tion. I believe, however, that the most revealingplace to start is with the definition of death as theinstant at which thepra ̄n, or ‘vital breath’ leaves thebody. Now according to the theological dogma ex-pounded by many of my informants, this occurs –not at the cessation of physiological functioning – butat the rite ofkapa ̄lkriya ̄, which is performed mid-waythrough the cremation, and at which the chiefmourner releases the ‘vital breath’ from the charredcorpse of the deceased by cracking open his skullwith a stave. Before this stage it is commonly said tobe completely inappropriate to use the termpretameaning ‘a disembodied ghost’.The corollary which is often derived from this isthat it is precisely at the moment of breakingthe skull that death pollution begins. Accordingly,thes ́ra ̄ddhaceremonies which mark the end of theyear of mourning are celebrated on the anniversaryof the cremation rather than on the anniversary ofthe actual death. That on this view impurity does notemanate from the corpse itself is neatly illustrated bythe case of those who have died a ‘bad’ death andwhose corpses are not burnt but immersed in theGanges. In such an instance, it is often claimed, nodeath pollution is incurred until after theputla ̄vidha ̄nritual at which the deceased’s body is re-created inthe form of an effigy, into which his soul is invoked,and which is then cremated. Since this rite may bedelayed until several months after the disposal of theactual body, and since there is no impurity in theinterval, it is clear that death pollution springs fromthe act of cremation rather than from the corpse orits physiological demise. It is, in the Benares idiom, aconsequence of ‘the sin of burning the body hairs ofthe deceased’. Hence as Pullu Maharaj explained, thechief mourner remains in a state of great puritybefore igniting the pyre, ‘because he is performingamaha ̄yugya– a great sacrifice. It is we who pollutehim by our touch and not he us.’ After cremation,however, he is defiled ‘for he has burnt the flesh’.What this definition of the point of death impliesis that before the cremation the corpse is not a corpsebut ananimateoblation to the fire. As another in-formant spontaneously put it: ‘he does not die but iskilled. He dies on the pyre.’ Cremation, he went on,is violence (hatya ̄) and death pollution (sutaka) theconsequence of that violence.5On such a theoryRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:19ampage 268Sacrificial Death and the Necrophagous Ascetic268"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"cremation becomes a sacrifice in the real sense of theterm: it is a ritual slaughter which makes of the chiefmourner a homicide, parricide or even slayer of thegods. It is hardly to be wondered at, then, that hissubsequent purifications – like that of any sacrificer –resemble the expiation of a criminal (Hubert &Mauss, 1964:33). It should not be thought, however,that the victim is a reluctant one for – as we shall see– a crucial aspect of the ‘good’ death is that it is avoluntary offering of the self of the gods. The corpseis thus not only alive but also a willing victim, andhence a being of extraordinary sacredness.6I hasten to emphasise that all this refers only to asomewhat esoteric level of theological discourse, andthat at another level it is of course universally ac-knowledged that a man is dead once the physicalmanifestations of life are extinguished. Reasoningfrom this starting point, other informants held thatdeath pollution begins at the moment of physio-logical arrest, and that the corpse itself is a sourceof severe impurity. Those best versed in the texts,however, tended to steer a middle course betweenthese two theories by distinguishing the case of theAgnihotri (by whom sacrificial fires are continuouslymaintained) from that of the ordinary householder.While for the former there is no death pollutionbefore cremation, for the latter it begins when res-piration ceases (cf. Abbott, 1932:177, 192, 505;Pandey, 1969:269).What is common to both theories, then, is theview that death pollution starts when the body ceasesto be animated by its ‘vital breath’. The disparityarises over the point at which this happens. On theview that it occurs during the cremation, the decea-sed’s body represents a pure oblation to the gods;while on the view that the ‘vital breath’ departs atphysiological arrest it is merely an impure carcass.7Given that the good death is a sacrifice and sacri-fice is an act of regeneration, it is only to be expectedthat the beliefs and practices associated with crema-tion are pervaded by the symbolism of embryology.According to one well-known text which deals withsacrifice (theS ́atapatha Brahmana), there are threekinds of birth: that which is had from one’s parents,from sacrifice and from cremation (Le ́vi, 1898:106–7; Levin, 1930). Indeed the ritual techniques in-volved in both of the latter might be seen as a branchof obstetrics. Having dispersed his own body in thesacrifice, the sacrificer reverts to an embryonic stateand is then reborn (cf. Heesterman, 1959; Kaelber,1978); while at death – as I have often been told –the body is to be taken to the cremation ground headfirst because that is the way a baby is born; while thecorpse of a man should be laid face down on the pyreand the corpse of a woman face up, for this is theposition in which the two sexes enter the world.During the fifth month of pregnancy the vital breathenters the embryo through the suture at the top ofthe skull and it is from here that it is released duringcremation. Throughout pregnancy the baby is sus-tained by the digestive fire which resides in itsmother’s belly, and at death it returns to the firefrom which it came and is thus reborn (cf. Knipe,1975:1). At both parturitions an untouchable spe-cialist acts the indispensible role of midwife – cuttingthe umbilical cord at birth and providing the sacredfire and superintending the pyre at death.At other points the symbolism of the maternityward is replaced by that of the bridal chamber. Thefuneral procession of an old person is described as asecond marriage party and is accompanied by eroticdancing; while a husband and wife who die within afew hours of each other are placed on a single pyre inwhat is explicitly represented as a position of copula-tion. In some texts the corpse is described as rising assmoke from the pyre, turning into clouds, rain andthen vegetables, which when eaten are transformedinto semen (O’Flaherty, 1973:41–2; 1976:28). Thedestruction of the corpse is thus converted into thesource of future life.The connection between death and sexuality is atheme which is constantly reiterated in both textualand popular traditions. In myth, for example, deathenters the world as a result of sexual increase(O’Flaherty, 1976:28, 212) and childbirth is givento women as a consequence of the god Indra’s brah-manicide; in folk dream-analysis a naked woman or abride is a presentiment of impending death; and inethno-medicine the loss of semen results in disease,old age and death, while its retention confers vitalityand even immortality (cf. Briggs, 1938:324, Car-stairs, 1957:84 –5, 195–6; Eliade, 1969:248–9). Ifdeath regenerates life, it is equally clear that in turnthe regeneration of life causes death.Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:19ampage 269Jonathan Parry269"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"It is this endless cycle which the ascetic seeks toevade. As a consequence he is not cremated. Thebodies of small children, and of victims of certaindiseases like leprosy and smallpox, are also im-mersed in the Ganges rather than burnt. Except inthe case of the ascetic, however, an effigy of thedeceased should later be burnt; and this also appliesto one who has died a violent or accidental death(whose body will normally have been cremated).Unless this substitute corpse is offered to the firethe deceased will indefinitely remain as a marginalghost (preta). In all cases, then, a real or surrogatecremation is a prerequisite for the proper re-creationof the departed.While piecemeal explanations of each individualcategory have often been suggested, the crucial pointabout the list of exceptional cases given in the previ-ous paragraph is – as Das (1977:123) has pointed out– that it constitutes a single set. It consists of thosewho are not fit sacrificial objects (e.g. the leper),those who have already been offered to the gods (e.g.the renouncer who has performed his own mortuaryrituals at the time of his initiation and who subse-quently exists on earth as a marginal ghost), andthose whose death cannot be represented as an actof self-sacrifice (e.g., children and victims of suddenor violent death).This last case ties in with the notion that the‘good’ death is one to which the individual voluntar-ily submits him- or herself: one of the prime exem-plars of such a death being thesatı ̄-strı ̄, or ‘true wife’who mounts her husband’s funeral pyre. In the idealcase the dying man – like the sacrificer before thesacrifice (Kaelber, 1978) – forgoes all food for somedays before death, and consumes only Ganges waterandcharan-amrit(the mixture in which the image of adeity has been bathed), in order to weaken his bodyso that the ‘vital breath’ may leave it more easily; andin order – as I would see it – to make himself aworthy sacrificial object free of foul faecal matter. (Asimilar interpretation may be placed on the bathingand occasional tonsuring of the corpse prior tocremation.) Having previously predicted the timeof his going and set all his affairs in order, he gathershis sons about him and – by an effort of concentratedwill – abandons life. He is not said to die, but torelinquish his body.In the case of a man of great spiritual force akind of spontaneous combustion cracks open hisskull to release the vital breath; while the vital breathof one who dies a bad death emerges through his anusin the form of excrement, through his mouth asvomit, or through one of his other orifices. Such anevacuation is a sure sign of damnation to come, anotion which is perhaps not unconnected with theidea that it is best to die on an empty stomach. Animage of the way in which the soul might ideallyemerge was provided by the case of an old house-holder, whose extraordinary spiritual developmenthad gained him a circle of devoted disciples, andwhose subsequent mortuary rituals I attended. Hiscopybook death was said to have been consummatedon his funeral pyre when his burning corpse succes-sively manifested itself to a privileged few in theforms of the celebrated religious leaders Sai Baba,Mehar Baba and Rama Krishna Paramhamsa, as theterrifying god Bhairava (Lord Siva’skotva ̄lor ‘police-chief’ in Benares) and finally as Siva himself. Arounded protuberance was seen to move up thespine of the corpse, burst through the skull, soarinto the air and split into three parts. One fell inBenares, another went north to the abode of Siva inthe Himalayas and nobody knows what happened tothe third.The best death occurs in Benares, or failing that inanother place of pilgrimage. But in any event deathshould occur on purified ground and in the open airrather than in a bed and under or on a roof. Onewould hope to die to the sound of chanting of thenames of god, for one’s dying thoughts are often saidto determine one’s subsequent fate, even to theextent of redeeming the most abject of sinners.There are not only places but also times to die well– ‘the fortnight of the ancestors’ (pitri-paksha) forexample, or during the period ofuttara ̄yan:a(the sixmonths of the year that start with the winter sol-stice); while five of the twenty-seven lunar mansions(naks:atras) of the Hindu almanac are from this point ofview inauspicious and require special rituals of expi-ation. But such inconvenience is unlikely to affect theparagon, whose spiritual force gives him a degree ofmastery over the time of his own death.By contrast with ‘good’ death, the ‘bad’ death isone for which the deceased cannot be said to haveRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:19ampage 270Sacrificial Death and the Necrophagous Ascetic270"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"prepared himself. It is said that ‘he did not die his owndeath’. The paradigmatic case is death by violence oras a result of some sudden accident; the underlyingnotion being that the victim has been forced torelinquish life prematurely with the result that hisembittered ghost is liable to return to afflict thesurvivors unless the appropriate propitiatory ritualsare scrupulously observed. Whether these have beensuccessful can only be judged by their results, for theghost that is yet to be satisfied will return to haunt thedreams of the mourners or to vent his malevolence inother more destructive ways. As a consequence, baddeath in the family tends to be cumulative, the victimof one causing another.The most common expression for what I havecalled ‘bad death’ isaka ̄l mrityu, literally ‘untimelydeath’ (though some of the resonance of this expres-sion might be better captured by glossing it as ‘un-controlled death’ – by contrast with the controlledrelease of life which is the ideal). Strictly speaking, itis not the age of the victim but the manner of dyingthat is diagnostic of anaka ̄l mrityu, and the death of anold person may be ‘untimely’ if it was caused byleprosy, violence or a sudden accident. The expres-sionalp mrityu(meaning ‘death in youth’) is howeveroften used as a synonym foraka ̄l mrityu– such a deathbeing almostipso factobad. The good death occursafter a full and complete life – the lifespan appropri-ate to our degenerate age being one hundred andtwenty-five, and this a mere fraction of that offormer epochs. The fact that few attain even thismodest target is a consequence of the sins of this andformer lives; and the greater the burden of sin, thegreater the shortfall. Those who die before the age offorty are certainly destined for hell; while the still-born infant is probably some reprobate expiating hiscrimes by a succession of seven such births. There isalso, however, the notion that the sins of the fathermay be visited on the son, and that the attenuation ofthis life may be a consequence of the wickedness ofthose with whom the individual is most closelyassociated. The quality of life thus determines itsduration. But it also determines the quality ofdeath. A group of Funeral Priests who – with somerancour – were regaling me with the story of theseizure of their hereditary rights by one of their richand powerful colleagues, clinched their evidence ofhis iniquity with the gleeful recollection that he haddied vomiting excrement. As for his son, their pre-sent employer, ‘he will reap; . . . leprosy is comingout on him. He will rot as no one in our caste hasever rotted before.’Although I cannot deal here with the extremelyelaborate sequence of post-cremation rituals, thereare two aspects of these rituals on which I would liketo comment briefly. At death (deha ̄nt, ‘the end of thebody’) the soul becomes a disembodied ghost orpreta, a marginal state dangerous both to itself andto the survivors. The purpose of the rituals of thefirst ten days is to reconstruct a physical form for thisethereal spirit – though this new form is of a less‘gross’ kind than the one the deceased had formerlyinhabited. Each day apin:d:a– a ball of rice or flour –is offered in the name of the deceased, each of whichreconstitutes a specific limb of his body. By the tenthday the body is complete, and on the eleventh life isbreathed into it and it is fed. On the next day a ritualis performed which enables the deceased to rejoin hisancestors. The wandering ghost (preta) becomes anincorporated ancestor (pitr:). A ball of rice represent-ing the departed is cut into three by the chiefmourner and is merged with three other rice ballswhich represent the deceased’s father, father’s fatherand father’s father’s father. The soul then sets out onits journey to ‘the abode of the ancestors’ (pitr:lok)where it arrives on the anniversary of its death,having endured many torments on the way – tor-ments which the mourners seek to mitigate by therituals they perform on its behalf. In order to crossover into ‘the kingdom of the dead’ (yamlok) at theend of its journey, the sould must negotiate theterrifying Vaitarnı ̄river which is invariably repre-sented as flowing with blood, excrement and otherfoul substances.The first point that I want to make is that in anumber of ways the symbolism of this whole phase ofthe mortuary rituals continues the theme of death asa parturition. The wordpin:d:ais used not only for therice or flour balls out of which the deceased’s body isreconstructed, but also for an actual embryo (cf.O’Flaherty, 1980); and the body is completed in aten-day period paralleling the ten (lunar) monthperiod of gestation (cf. Knipe, 1977). What’smore, there is a striking correspondence betweenRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:19ampage 271Jonathan Parry271"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"the image of crossing the Vaitarnı ̄river and the birthpassage of the child out of the womb, the latter alsobeing explicitly represented as negotiating a river ofblood and pollution. What we seem to have here is acase of ritual over-kill; the deceased is reborn out ofthe fire and then born all over again in the subsequentrituals.It is perhaps also worth noting that, in relation tothe twelfth-day rituals, both the textual commentar-ies and the more knowledgeable ritual specialists inBenares make a rather different kind of link betweendeath and regeneration. If the chief mourner’s wife isbarren, then in order to conceive a son, she shouldconsume the rice ball used in the ritual to representher husband’s father’s father (cf. Kane, 1953:346–7,480). Thepin:d:aidentified with the ancestor thus hasthe quality of semen and may beget a newpin:d:a-embryo (cf. O’Flaherty, 1980). Though the notionis clearly inconsistent with the theory of reincarnationpostulated by the doctrine ofkarma, the idea is that thegreat-grandfather comes back as his own great-grand-son; and I would add that even those who deny theefficacy of any such procedure often assert an identityof character between the two.My second point relates to the regime ofmourning and its striking similarity to the code ofthe ascetic. The chief mourner must not shave, usesoap or oil his hair, wear shoes or a shirt; throughoutthe mourning he must wear a single garment, mustsleep on the ground, avoid ‘hot’ food and abstainfrom sex – all of which recalls the conduct pre-scribed for the renouncer. Each year tens of thou-sands of pilgrim-mourners go to the holy city of Gayain order to make offerings there which will ensurethe final salvation of their deceased parents. Many ofthem wear the ochre-coloured garments of theascetic and it was several times explained to methat this is a symbol of their temporary assumptionof the renouncer’s role. Dumont (1971) and Das(1977:126) have both remarked on this parallel,and Das interprets it in terms of the liminality ofboth statuses. Her point is unexceptionable but, Ibelieve, insufficient; for what she fails to note – butwhat some of my informants explicitly said – is that itis by taking on the role of the ascetic and performingausterities (tapasya) that the chief mourner acquiresthe power to re-create a body for the deceased.I have thus returned to my starting point: thecreative power of asceticism, by means of whichVisnu engendered the cosmos. Austerities produceheat, the source of life – the corpse being subjectedto the heat of the pyre that the departed might bereborn. Cremation is thus an act of creation, even acosmic renewal. The paradox is that such austeritieshave the odour of an opportunism repudiated by the‘true’ renouncer, in that they are oriented towards aregeneration of life. For the latter the value of such agoal is dubious, since the world is suffering and thecorollary of rebirth is the relentless recurrence ofdeath. The real aim of renunciation is rather anescape from this endless cycle, and it is this – I willsuggest – that makes sense of the baroque excesswith which the Aghori is associated.The Necrophagous Ascetic and theTranscendence of TimeBefore the creation was a void. According to themyth of Visnu’s cosmogony recorded in the best-known eulogy of Benares’ sanctity, theKas ́i Khanda(Chapter 26), all that originally existed was Brahma,which cannot be apprehended by the mind or de-scribed by the speech, and which is without form,name, colour or any physical attribute. Creationproceeded by differentiation from this primal es-sence, duality emerging from non-duality. Much ofthe endeavour of the world-renouncer may be seenas an attempt to recapture the original state of non-differentiation and to re-establish the unity of oppos-ites which existed before the world began.The discipline of yoga is – as Eliade (1969; 1976)has shown – directed at precisely this goal. By hisphysical postures the yogi subjugates his body andrenders it immobile; by concentrating on a singleobject he frees his mind from the flux of events andarrests mental process; and by slowing down andeventually stopping his breath ‘he stops the activitiesof the senses and severs the connection between themind and external sensory objects’ (Gupta,1979:168). Sexual intercourse may be convertedinto a discipline in which the semen is immobilisedby the practice ofcoitus reservatus, or its normaldirection of flow reversed by reabsorbing it intothe penis after ejaculation. By thus controlling hisRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 272Sacrificial Death and the Necrophagous Ascetic272"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"body he acquires magical powers (siddhis) by whichhe may defy nature and control the world. But aboveall, the yogi’s immobilisation of mind, body, breathand semen represents an attempt to return to whatEliade describes as a ‘primordial motionless Unity’;and to attainsama ̄dhi, a timeless state of non-dualityin which there is neither birth nor death nor anyexperience of differentiation.This suspension of time and conquest of death isalso, the aim of Aghori asceticism. The theologicalpremise on which their practice is founded wouldappear to be a classical monism. Every soul is identi-cal with the Absolute Being; all category distinctionsare a product of illusion (ma ̄ya ̄), and behind allpolarities there is an ultimate unity. But whatispeculiar to the Aghoris is a very literal working-outof this monistic doctrine through a discipline whichinsists on a concrete experience of the identity ofopposites, and on a material realisation of the unitybetween them. It is a matter of a kind of externalisedfulfilment of what is more orthodoxly interpreted asa purely internal quest.Although there are many similarities of practice,and perhaps also a direct historical connection, be-tween the Aghoris and the skull-carrying Kapalikasof certain late Sanskrit texts, they themselves tracethe foundation of their order to an ascetic called Kina(‘rancour’) Ram, whom they claim as an incarnation(avata ̄r) of Siva, and who is supposed to have died (orrather ‘takensama ̄dhi’) in the second half of theeighteenth century when he was nearly one hundredand fifty years old. Thea ̄s ́rama(or ‘monastic refuge’)Kina Ram founded in Benares (which is also the siteof his tomb) is one of the most important centres ofthe sect – though only one or two ascetics actuallylive there. Each of the succeedingmahants(‘abbots’)of thisa ̄s ́ramais supposed to be anavata ̄rof (Siva’savata ̄r) Kina Ram; the present incumbent beingreckoned as the twelfth in the line.There are probably no more than fifteen Aghoriascetics permanently or semi-permanently residentin Benares and its immediate environs,8but othersfrom elsewhere congregate at Kina Ram’sa ̄s ́ramaduring the festivals ofLola ̄rk ChhathandGuru-Pur-nı ̄ma ̄. The evidence suggests that at the end of thelast century their numbers were several timesgreater – (Barrow, 1893:215, gives an estimate ofbetween one and two hundred) – though it is veryunlikely that they were ever a numerically significantelement in the ascetic population of the city. Theirhold on the popular imagination is, however, out ofall proportion to their numbers, and some Aghorisacquire a substantial following of lay devotees. Re-cruitment to the sect is theoretically open to bothsexes and to all castes. In practice, however, all theascetics I knew, or knew of, were male and of cleancaste origin (though some of their devotees werefemale).The Aghoris, wrote Sherring (1872:269), are ‘aflagrantly indecent and abominable set of beggarswho have rendered themselves notorious for thedisgusting vileness of their habits’. Indeed the ‘left-hand’ discipline (va ̄m panthi sa ̄dhana ̄) they embracewas hardly likely to commend itself to the Englishmissionary. The Aghori performs austerities at, andprobably lives on, the cremation ground – in somecases in a rough shack, into the mud-walls of whichare set human skulls (Morinis, 1979:258). He maygo naked or clothe himself in a shroud taken from acorpse, wear a necklace of bones around his neck andhis hair in matted locks. His eyes are conventionallydescribed as burning-red, like live coals; his wholedemeanour is awesome, and in speech he is brusque,churlish and foul-mouthed.Rumour persistently associates the Aghoris withhuman sacrifice, and there is said to have been anotorious case in the recent past just across theriver from Benares. What is certain, however, isthat during the British raj more than one Aghoriwas executed for the crime (Barrow, 1893:208);and only recently theGuardiannewspaper (Thursday,6 March 1980) reported the death in police custodyof an old ascetic who was living on a south Indiancremation ground and who was suspected of thesacrifice of five children whose blood he collectedin bottles for the performance of rituals by which hesought to attain immortality. The article goes on tocite a recent (unspecified) survey which claimed thatthere are still probably a hundred human sacrificesoffered each year in India in order to avert epidem-ics, ensure the fertility of crops or women, or confersupernatural powers on the sacrificer.As part of his discipline the Aghori may performthe rite ofs ́ava-sa ̄dhana ̄, in which he seats himself onRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 273Jonathan Parry273"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"the torso of a corpse to worship. By means of thisworship he is able to gain an absolute control overthe deceased’s spirit, through which he communi-cates with other ghostly beings. The Aghori sleepsover a model bier (made from the remnants of a realone); smears his body with ash from the pyres, cookshis food on wood pilfered from them and consumesit out of the human skull which is his constantcompanion and alms-bowl, and which he is supposedto have acquired by some crude surgery on a putridand bloated corpse fished out of the river. My in-formant Fakkar (meaning ‘indigent’/‘carefree’)Baba, however, shamefacedly admits to havingobtained his from a hospital morgue, though heclaims to have taken precautions to ensure that itwas a skull of the right type (see below). It belonged,he says, to a young Srivastava (Trader) who died ofsnake-bite. The provenance of Lal Baba’s skull isreputedly more immaculate. Several of my friendsat Manikarnikagha ̄trecall the day when he wadedout into the river to retrieve the corpse to which itbelonged, and one of them claims to have unwit-tingly lent him the knife with which he performedthe operation. Before eating I have seen Lal Babaoffer the food it contains to a dog, thus converting itinto the ‘polluted leavings’ (ju ̄t:h:a ̄) of the most de-based of animals, and one which is also – like theideal Aghori – a scavenger living off the carrion ofthe cremation ground. The ‘true’ Aghori is entirelyindifferent to what he consumes, drinks not onlyliquor but urine, and eats not only meat but excre-ment, vomit and the putrid flesh of corpses.While I myself have been present when an Aghoridrank what was said to be the urine of a dog, andswallowed what was undoubtedly ash from a crema-tion pyre, I cannot personally testify to their necro-phagy. All I can say with complete assurance is thatthey readily own to the practice; that as far as my layinformants are concerned the matter is not in ques-tion, and that several of them claim to have seen anAghori eating corpse flesh. One highly reveredascetic has hung a large portrait of himself in theleprosy hospital which he founded, in which he isshown sitting cross-legged on a corpse, a bottle ofliquor in one hand while in the other is a morsel offlesh which he is raising to his lips. Apart from itsvery existence, the interesting thing about thepainting is that the corpse which he is devouringappears to be his own (which would conform withthe theology of monism I describe below). What isalso relevant here is that another of my asceticinformants insisted that the crucial point about thecorpse on which the Aghori sits to worship is that it isidentical to his own.Starting with theDabistan, a seventeenth-centuryPersian source (cited by Barrow, 1893 and Crooke,1928), the historical records treat necrophagy as anindisputable fact and provide several supposedly eye-witness accounts of the practice – though some ofthese are far from credible. The narrator ofTherevelation of an orderly(a semifictional work publishedin Benares in 1848) claims, for example, that: ‘I oncesaw a wretch of this fraternity eating the head of aputrid corpse, and as I passed he howled and pointedto me; and then scooped out the eyes and ate thembefore me’. Another nineteenth-century British ac-count claims that ‘near Benares they are not un-usually seen floating down the river on a corpse,and feeding upon its flesh’ (Moor quoted in Oman,1903:166); while according to a third, the drunkenAghori ‘will seize hold of corpses that drift to thebanks of the river and bite off bits of its flesh . . .’(Barrow, 1893:206). Or again, Tod (1839:84)reports that ‘one of the Deora chiefs told methat . . . when conveying the body of his brother tobe burnt, one of these monsters crossed the path ofthe funeral procession, and begged to have thecorpse, saying that it ‘‘would make excellent ‘chatni’,or condiment’’’.While such reports would certainly do little toallay the doubts expressed by Arens (1979) about thenature of our existing evidence for anthropophagy,what is perhaps more serious witness to its occur-rence is provided by the series of prosecutions whichfollowed the special legislation passed by the Britishto ban – as Crooke (1928) phrased it – ‘the habit ofcannibalism’. One Aghori, for example, who wastried in Ghazipur in 1862was found carrying the remains of a putrid corpsealong a road. He was throwing the brains from theskull on to the ground and the stench of the corpsegreatly distracted the people. Here and there he placedthe corpse on shop boards and on the ground.

(Barrow, 1893)The defendant later admitted that ‘he ate corpseswhenever he ́found them’ (Barrow, 1893:209). Con-victions were also obtained in subsequent prosecu-tions brought before the courts in Rohtak in 1882,and in Dehra Dun and Berhampore in 1884. In one ofthese cases the accused testified that ‘he frequentlyate human flesh when hungry’ (Barrow, 1893:210);while the newspaper report of a further incidentasserts that it forms ‘the staple of their food’ (TheTribune(Lahore), 29th November 1898, cited inOman, 1903:165).Despite the impression which such accounts maycreate, I am convinced that if necrophagy is indeedpractised by any of the Aghoris I encountered, it hasnothing whatever to do with the requirements of abalanced diet (as Harris 1977, has somewhat im-plausibly claimed for the Aztecs); but is an irregular– perhaps even a once-off – affair, performed in aritualised manner at night during certain phases ofthe moon (associated with Siva). (In view of Arens’caution, it is perhaps as well to retain an open mindon whether necrophagy ever really occurred in anybut freak instances. In this context it may be worthpointing out that even the admissions of the asceticsthemselves are not beyond suspicion, for – quiteapart from the possibility of police duress – thehallmark of an ideal Aghori is that he consumes theflesh of corpses, and any acknowledged failure to doso is a confession of inadequacy. On balance, how-ever, I think that the probability must remain that atleast some Aghoris have always taken this aspect oftheir discipline seriously.) Details of the precise ritualprocedure surrounding such an event are supposed tobe secret; and there is a considerable discrepancybetween the accounts I was given. Some said thatthe consumption of flesh should ideally be precededby an act of intercourse on the cremation ground;others that having eaten of the flesh the ascetic shouldcremate the remains of the corpse and smear his bodywith the ashes. But almost everybody agrees that aftereating the real Aghori will use his powers to restorethe deceased to life (cf. Barrow, 1893:221; Balfour,1897:345–6), and that the flesh he consumes shouldbe that of a person who has died a bad death.This association recurs in the notion that the skullwhich the Aghori carries should have belonged to thevictim of an ‘untimely death’, as should the corpseon which he sits to meditate (cf. Morinis, 1979:258–9). The preference is not just a question of thepractical consideration that, since such corpses areimmersed, their remains are the ones most likely tobe available. It is also a matter of the power thatresides in such skulls, which is said to render eventhe most virulent of poisons innocuous. That of a Teli(Oil-presser) and of a Mahajan (Trader) who has dieda bad death is especially prized. Oil-pressers, it isexplained, are a proverbially stupid caste and theirskulls are therefore easy to control; while Traderstend to be sharp and cunning and their skulls areparticularly powerful. With the propermantras(sacred formulae) an Aghori can get his skull tofetch and carry for him, or cause it to fight withanother. It is as if life resides in the skull itself, onlywaiting to be activated by one who knows the properincantations. It is because the vital breath of a personwho has died a bad death has not been released fromhis cranium on the cremation pyre that his skullremains a repository of potential power.Like other sects with a close affinity to Tantrism,the Aghoris perform (or at least claim to perform)the secret rite ofcakra-pu ̄ja ̄involving the ritual use ofthe so-called ‘five Ms’ (pancan ̄maka ̄ra)–ma ̄ns(meat),machhlı ̄(fish),madya(liquor)mudra ̄(in this contextparched grain or kidney beans) andmaithuna(sexualintercourse). A group of male adepts, accompaniedby one or more female partners, sit in a circle. Thewoman is worshipped as a manifestation of the god-dess and is offered the food and drink which issubsequently consumed by the males who feed eachother. The first four Ms all posses aphrodisiac qual-ities and thus lead towards the fifth – in which theadept and his partner incarnate Siva and his consortunite incoitus reservatus. As far as my subsequentargument is concerned, the crucial point here isthat the female partner should ideally be a prostituteor a woman of one of the lowest castes; and sheshould also be menstruating at the time and thusdoubly polluted. But what is also significant is thatthe sexual intercourse which is supposed to occur is acalculated repudiation of procreation. (By contrastthe duty to sire offspring was frequently representedRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 275Jonathan Parry275"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"by my high-caste householder informants as the onlylegitimate pretext for coitus.) Not only is the semenwithheld, but the act takes place at a time when thefemale partner is infertile. Moreover, she is prefer-ably a prostitute: the one class of women who have a‘professional hostility’ to fertility and who providethe perfect ‘symbol ofbarreneroticism’ (Shulman’s,1980:261–2, apt phraseology; my emphasis). Con-sistent with the discussion of Aghori aims whichfollows, the act of ritual copulation thus reveals acertain disdain for the regeneration of life, andidentifies the male adept with Siva locked in aunion with his opposed aspect which is both withoutend and without issue. It is a sexual pairing rid of itsnormal consequences – progeny and death (the latterbeing commonly used in popular speech as a meta-phor for ejaculation, and being caused – as we haveseen – by a failure to retain the semen).This liaison between the Aghori and the prostituterecurs in several other contexts. The prostitutes ofthe city not only visit the burninggha ̄t:sto worshipSiva there in his form of Lord of the CremationGround (Smas ́an-Na ̄th) but each year on the festivalofLola ̄rk Chhaththey used to come to sing and danceat the tomb of Kina Ram (though the practice wasabandoned in the late ’fifties after a serious disturb-ance among the university students). Moreover, it issaid that the bed of a prostitute is equivalent to acremation ground in that it is an equally properplace for an Aghori to perform hissa ̄dhana ̄(ritualpractice).By his various observances the Aghori acquiressiddhis, or supernatural powers, which give himmastery over the phenomenal world and the abilityto read thoughts. If he is sufficiently accomplished hecan cure the sick, raise the dead and control malevo-lent ghosts. He can expand or contract his body toany size or weight, fly through the air, appear in twoplaces at once, conjure up the dead and leave hisbody and enter into another. All this, of course, isexactly what one might predict from the Aghori’sdealings with corpses and bodily emissions, for – asDouglas (1966) points out – that which is anomalousand marginal is not only the focus of pollution anddanger, but also the source of extraordinary power.Whilesiddhismay, of course, be won by asceticswho follow quite different kinds of regime, it iswidely believed that they are acquired more quicklyand more fully by those who pursue the path of theAghori. This path, however, is more difficult anddangerous than that which is followed by otherorders; and one whose discipline is inadequate,who is overtaken by fear during his austerities, orwho fails to retain his semen duringcakra-pu ̄ja ̄,paysthe penalty of madness and death (cf. Carstairs,1957:232). He then becomes anAughar-masa ̄n, themost recalcitrant and difficult to exorcise of malevo-lent ghosts.The association between madness and the Aghoriis not, however, an entirely straightforward one. Thegenuine Aghori, it is acknowledged, is – almost bydefinition – likely to seem demented to ordinarymortals, and is apt to talk in a way which they cannotcomprehend. But this is merely evidence of hisdivine nature and of the fact that he has succeededin homologising himself with Siva, who is himselfsomewhat touched, and with Lord Bhairava – one ofwhose manifestations in Benares is asUnmat(‘mad’)Bhairava. Moreover complete lucidity is not the bestpolicy for one who shuns the world and does notwish to be endlessly importuned for spiritualguidance. But while there may be an element ofboth divine and calculated madness in an authenticascetic, it is also recognised that some Aghoris aresimply insane in the medical sense. Their affliction,however, is generally attributed to a failure of nerveor an insufficiently fastidious attention to ritual detailduring the performance of such dangerously power-ful rites, rather than to any notion that their attrac-tion to these practices suggests that they wereunbalanced already.By virtue of his magical powers, the Aghori whohas – in the local idiom – ‘arrived’ (pahunche hue), islikely to attract a large lay following who bring theirpragmatic problems to him for solution. Baba Bhag-van Ram, for instance, has an extensive circle ofcommitted devotees. Most of them are of highcaste, and many are members of the professionalmiddle-class. (Amongst the inner circle of disciplesare, for example, a retired Collector and a retiredPolice Inspector, a post-doctoral research fellow andan administrator from the university, a College Lec-turer, a student now studying in north America, twolawyers, an engineer, a Customs and Excise officer, aRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 276Sacrificial Death and the Necrophagous Ascetic276"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"factory manager, a public works contractor, and awell-to-do shopkeeper). Two other Aghoris I knewalso had a significant middle-class following. Even inthe presence of an ascetic other than their acknow-ledgedguru, the humility of such devotees – whowould in other contexts brook no trifling with theirdignity – is really remarkable. When Pagila (‘mad’)Baba wilfully defaecated on the string-cot on whichhe was reclining, a Rajput police officer and a Brah-man businessman undertook the cleaning up.Although motives are hard to be confident about,for what it is worth I record my strong impressionthat what attracts many of these people to theAghori’s following are thesiddhiswhich he is believedto have obtained and which he may be induced to useon their behalf in an insecure and competitive world.To my knowledge several of them joined BhagvanRam’s entourage at times of grave personal crisis –the Police Inspector when he was under investigationfor corruption, the contractor when his businessstarted to fail, the Customs and Excise Officerwhen the prospect of providing a suitable dowryfor his daughters became an immediate problem.Not of course that this is an aspect of the matter towhich they themselves would publicly call attention.As at least some of these middle-class devotees wereinclined to present it, the initial appeal was ratherthe egalitarian social ethic which Baba Bhagvan Rampreaches, and about which I shall say more later. As Iwould somewhat cynically interpret it, however, hisconsiderable success amongst such people is at leastin part attributable to the fact that this message is onewhich they can identify as ‘progressive’ and‘modern’ and which they can casuistically use tolegitimise a more shamefaced and surreptitious con-cern to tap the source of a fabulous supernaturalpower.The paradox of the situation, however, is that inorder to gain and maintain a reputation as an asceticworthy of the name, the laity require miracles asevidence of his attainments; yet the brash display ofsuch powers is regarded with equivocation for ittestifies to an incomplete spiritual development.While proof that he has taken the first step, itdemonstrates that he has gone no further, for theone who has really ‘arrived’ is the one who scorns toindulge the laity with such trifles, who is indifferentto reputation, and who pursues his own salvationwith a complete disdain for the world. In order toattain his goal ofsama ̄dhi, a double renunciation isnecessary: first a renunciation of the world and thenof the powers that are thereby acquired (cf. Eliade,1969:89; 1976:106–7).The man-in-the-world, however, remains thirstyfor miracles and his compromise is the ascetic who isseen to work wonders – as it were, under thecounter and in spite of himself – while denying hiscapacity to do so. It is not uncommon, in my experi-ence, for one ascetic to be disparaged by the follow-ers of another on the grounds that he is a mereperformer of supernatural tricks. But at the sametime the follower feels obliged to justify the claims hemakes for his ownguruby reference to a personalexperience of the marvels he can accomplish. Did henot witness, or even himself benefit from, this orthat miraculous cure? Was he not actually with hisguruin Benares when the latter was unmistakablysighted in Allahabad? The fact that the ascetic himselfdisclaims such reports merely confirms his spiritualauthenticity.The curse of an Aghori is particularly terrible andvirtually irrevocable. The food of the accursed mayturn to excrement as he raises it to his lips, or his heirmay die. When a filthy Aghori dressed in the rottingskin of a fresh-water porpoise was, some generationsago, refused admission to the Maharaja of Benares’palace during the performance of a magnificentyagya, the sacrificial offerings became immediatelyinfested with maggots and the sacrifice had to beabandoned. As a result of this incident, the Maha-raja’s line has continually failed to produce heirs, andhas been forced to perpetuate itself by adoption;while the curse also stipulated that any Aghori whohenceforth accepted food from the palace would beafflicted by a fistula in the anus (bhagandar). Whenthe latemahantof Kina Ram’sa ̄s ́ramawas at lastinduced to revoke the curse and eat from the royalkitchen, the Maharani immediately conceived a son –but themahanthimself succumbed to the foretolddisorder.For the development of my theme the story isparticularly instructive in two ways. The first is thatit draws our attention to the fact that the curse of anAghori, and – as we shall see – his blessing too, is asRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 277Jonathan Parry277"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"often as not concerned with reproduction and fertil-ity. But what is also significant is that the exclusion ofthe ascetic from the Maharaja’syagyaappears to bemerely a transposition of the well-known mytho-logical incident in which Siva is excluded from thesacrifice of his father-in-law, Daksa, on the pretextthat he is a naked, skull-carrying Kapalika (O’Flah-erty, 1976:278) – the sectarian precursor of theAghori. But Siva is essential to the sacrifice if theevil it unleashes is to be mastered (Biardeau,1976:96). Denied of his share, he spoils the wholeevent and precipitates a disaster of cosmic propor-tions. Though the scale of our story is admittedlymore modest, it is not difficult to see that the Aghoriis merely playing the role which was written for Siva– as well he might, for we shall find that he aspires tobe Siva.The blessing of an Aghori is as beneficent as hiscurse is awesome. By it he may confer inordinateriches, restore the mad, cure the incurable or bestowfertility on the barren. In order to conceive a child,both Hindu and Muslim couples go in large numbersto Kina Ram’sa ̄s ́rama, where they visit his tomb,bathe in the tank of Krimi Kund (‘the tank ofworms’) and take ash from the sacred fire which isfuelled by wood brought from the cremation pyresand which is a form of the goddess Hinglaj Devi. Thetank is the one beside which Kina Ram performed hisausterities – thus again making a direct link betweentapasand the powers of creation. The same proced-ure should ideally be repeated on five consecutiveSundays or five consecutive Tuesdays – days of theweek which are special not only to Kina Ram but alsoto the god Bhairava. An identical procedure will curechildren of the wasting disease ofsukhand:irogwhichis caused by a barren woman touching or casting hershadow on the child immediately after she has bathedat the end of her period. She will then conceive, butthe child will start to ‘dry up’ (sukhna ̄) and witheraway.An Aghori’s blessing is characteristically given byviolently manhandling and abusing its recipient.Bhim Baba, for example, used to live on the verandahof the City Post Office, stark naked, morosely silent,and generally surrounded by a crowd of onlookersand devotees. Every so often, as if infuriated, hewould lumber to his feet (for he was massively fat)seize a small earthenware pot and hurl it with a roarinto the crowd. The fortunate target of his missilecould leave assured that his problem was about to besolved or his aspirations met (cf. Morinis, 1979:244; Barrow, 1893:226). It is said that on festivaloccasions Kina Ram would throw his urine on thecrowds by way of blessing. Indeed the bodily emis-sions of an Aghori are charged with a special potencyand have miraculous medicinal qualities. The sister ofone of Bhagvan Ram’s university-educated devotees,for example, was said to have been cured of a graveillness after her brother had obtained for her a phialof hisguru’s urine. A lay follower may be initiated bytheguruby placing a drop of his semen on thedisciple’s tongue; while at the initiation of an asceticthe preceptor fills a skull with his urine which is thenused to moisten the novitiate’s head before it istonsured (Barrow, 1893:241).Now my informants continually stress that as aresult of hissa ̄dhana ̄an Aghori does not die. Herealises the state of non-duality I referred to earlier;he ‘takessama ̄dhi’, and enters into a perpetual cata-leptic condition of suspended animation of deepmeditation. His body is arranged (if necessary bybreaking the spine) in a meditational posture(known aspadma ̄s ́an), sitting cross-legged with hisupturned palms resting on his knees. He is thenplaced in a box which – in Benares – is buried inthe grounds of Kina Ram’sa ̄s ́rama(and which iseverywhere oriented towards the north). Unlikethe householder or ascetics of most other orders hisskull is not smashed in order to release the ‘vitalbreath’. A small shrine containing the phallicemblem of Siva is erected over the site of thegrave, the emblem transmitting to the worshipperthe power emanating from the ascetic’s subterraneanmeditation.By enteringsama ̄dhi(the term refers to his tomb aswell as to his condition within it) – which he isrepresented as doing by conscious desire at a timeof his choosing – the ascetic unequivocally escapesthe normal consequences of death: the severance ofthe connection between body and soul, the corrup-tion of the body and the transmigration of the soul.Provided that he has ‘taken’sama ̄dhiwhile still alive(jı ̄vit-sama ̄dhi), rather than being ‘given’ it afterdeath, his body is immune to putrescence andRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 278Sacrificial Death and the Necrophagous Ascetic278"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"decay although it remains entombed for thousands ofyears. It is still the occasional habitation of his soul,which wanders the threelokas(of heaven, earth andthe netherworld) assuming any bodily form itchooses and changing from one to another at will.The real ideological stress is here, rather than on theincorruption of the particular body he inhabitedbefore he tooksama ̄dhi. Endless stories neverthelesstestify to a conviction that the body of the modelascetic is perfectly and perpetually preserved in itstomb; and it is widely believed that this body is attimes animated by his peripatetic soul which may bebrought back to its former shell in an instant by thefervent prayers of the devotee.Asama ̄dhi(in the sense of tomb) which is reani-mated by the presence of the soul is described as aja ̄grit-sama ̄dhi(‘awakenedsama ̄dhi). Baba BhagvanRam’s disciples credit him with thus ‘awakening’ theoccupants of every one of the fiftysama ̄dhiswithin theprecincts of Kina Ram’sa ̄s ́ramasince he took over itseffective management; and this makes it possible toinduce them to take a more direct hand in the affairs ofmen. As for himself, Bhagvan Ram denies the appeal ofheaven, where – as he wryly informed me – ‘all thecelestial nymphs (apsaras) are now old ladies’. Hisintention is rather to spend eternity ‘watching andwaiting’ here on earth where he is within easy reach ofordinary mortals. It is out of compassion for thesufferings of humanity that such an ascetic denieshimself the final bliss of complete dissolution intoBrahma, for once he is finally liberated ‘who willgive the sermons?’.What sense, then, can we make of the ethnography Ihave provided? One preliminary observation here isthat Aghori ideology, if not always their practice,insists that members of the order do not solicitalms. This relates to the familiar South Asian contra-diction that, while the ascetic is enjoined to remaincompletely independent of the material and socialorder, he must necessarily depend on the gifts of thehouseholder in order to support himself, and cantherefore never entirely escape from the lay world.Aghori practice may be seen as one radical solution tothis dilemma. His loincloth is a shroud, his fuel thecharred wood of the pyres, his food human refuse. Byscavenging from the dead (who have no further usefor what he takes), the Aghori escapes the clutches ofthe living, and in theory at least realises the asceticideal of complete autonomy.We may also note that the Aghori’s vigil on thecremation ground may be represented as an unblink-ing meditation on the classic Hindu themes of thetransience of existence and the inevitability of mortalsuffering. ‘Surrounded by death in the place of death,those aspects of reality that end in the fires of thecremation ground become distasteful . . . attachmentto the world and the ego is cut and union with Siva,the conqueror of death, is sought’ (Kinsley,1977:100). Like ascetics of other orders, the Aghoriaspires to die to the phenomenal world, to undergothe ‘Death that conquers death’ (Kinsley, 1977), andto exist on earth as an exemplar of the living dead.But what makes him different from others is that hepushes this symbolism to its logical limits.The theological line which the Aghoris themselvesmost forcefully stress, however, is the notion thateverything in creation partakes ofparma ̄tma ̄, theSupreme Being, and that therefore all category dis-tinctions belong merely to the world of superficialappearances, and there is no essential differencebetween the divine and the human, or between thepure and the polluted. As Lal Baba represented hisown spiritual quest to me, it is to become like thatideal Aghori, the sun, whose rays illuminate every-thing indiscriminately and yet remain undefiled bythe excrement they touch.The doctrine that the essence of all things is thesame may clearly be taken to imply a radical devalu-ation of the caste hierarchy, since from this point ofview there is no fundamental difference between theUntouchable and the Brahman. What is less obvious,however, is whether this teaching is one which relatesonly – as Dumont’s model (1960, 1970) would sug-gest – to the ascetic (caste is irrelevant forhimbut notfor the world at large), or whether the Aghori’sdevaluation of the social order is to be interpreted asa message forallmen. My Aghori informants them-selves were not altogether unequivocal on the matter– sometimes denying to caste any relevance whatso-ever, while at others presenting equality as a matter ofthe ultimatereligioustruth of the enlightened ratherthan as the appropriate goal of social policy. This lackof clarity is perhaps only to be expected, since forRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 279Jonathan Parry279"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"them the central concern is with dissolving the barrierbetween god and man (or more precisely betweenSiva and the individual ascetic himself), rather thanwith tearing down that which divides men from eachother.It is, however, clear that thesocialimplications ofAghori doctrine are far from absent from the teach-ings of Baba Bhagvan Ram, their most illustriousrepresentative in Benares, who has derived from itsreligious truth a this-worldly ethic of equality andcommunity service – though I concede the possibil-ity that this may be a modern reworking of therenouncer’s message. Thea ̄s ́ramaBhagvan Ramfounded just across the river from Benares includesa hospice for lepers, a primary school, dispensary,post office and printing press. Amongst his circle offollowers inter-caste marriage is positively encour-aged. But what might also be said is that within theegalitarian order which he would have his disciplesrealise, a position of unquestioned privilege is none-theless preserved for theguru. He drives about in ajeep, and while he sleeps over a grave, he does so in awell-appointed room under an electric fan. Even histeaching is not without its streak of ambivalence.While caste may be dismissed as a conspiracy of thepowerful, the vow by which his male devotees shouldoffer their daughters in marriage leaves considerabledoubt about the equality of the sexes within mar-riage, and the doctrine ofkarmais not in question.Lepers are paying the price of past wickedness. (Iregret that I neglected to ask whether the same mightnot also be held to apply to the Untouchables.) Whatis at issue, he told me, is rather the right of others touse this fact as justification for their exclusion fromsociety.9If, however obliquely, Aghori doctrine posesquestions about the ultimate legitimacy of the socialorder, there is a rather different way in which theirpractice reinforces this message of doubt. In ortho-dox caste society, polluting contacts between castesmust be eliminated in order to preserve the bound-aries of the group, for which – as Douglas (1966)argues – the boundaries of the body often serve as ametaphor. The Aghori’s inversion of the same sym-bols of body margins implies exactly the oppositemessage. With the destruction of boundariesentailed by the consumption of flesh, excrementand so on, goes an affirmation of the irrelevance ofcaste boundaries. Coming at the issue in a moregeneral way suggested by Turner (1969), we mightalso note the relationship which exists between limi-nal states, the suspension of the hierarchical struc-ture of everyday life, and a stress on a vision of anunhierarchised and undifferentiated humanity. Bycontrast with that of the initiand in tribal society,the Aghori’s liminality is permanent – and it is also ofa somewhat extreme character. It is hardly surpris-ing, then, that he should represent something of theequality which is generally associated with thoseliminal to the routinely ordered structure.Perhaps the most striking aspect of the data,however, is the remarkable similarity between thecharacter assumed by the Aghori and the person ofSiva. Indeed the description of Siva given by hisdisapproving father-in-law perfectly fits the stereo-type of the Aghori:He roams about in dreadful cemeteries, attended byhosts of goblins and spirits, like a mad man, naked,with dishevelled hair, laughing, weeping, bathed inashes of funeral piles, wearing a garland of skulls andornaments of human bones, insane, beloved of theinsane, the lord of beings whose nature is essentiallydarkness. (Briggs, 1938:153)The epithetaughar:, by which the Aghori is widelyknown and which implies an uncouth carefreeness, isone of the names of the god. Like Siva, who ingestedthe poison that emerged from the Churning of theOceans and thereby allowed creation to proceed,the Aghori is a swallower of poison who liberatesthe blocked-up fertility of women. Like his proto-type he is addicted to narcotics, is master of evilspirits, is touched with madness and his most salientcharacteristic is his moodiness. He isar:bhangi– onewho follows his whims with truculent intransigence.He adorns his body with the ornaments of Siva, playsSiva’s part as spoiler of the sacrifice when deniedadmission to it, is greeted in a way appropriate to thegod with cries ofBom, BomorHar Har Maha ̄dev, andindeed claims and is acknowledged to be Siva.

The skull he carriesassociates him with Siva’s manifestation as the terri-fying god Bhairava who – to atone for the sin ofchopping off Brahma’s fifth head – was condemnedto wander the earth ‘as an Aghori’ with a skull stuckfast to his hand. Dogs, which like the Aghori scav-enge off the cremation ground, are his familiars – asthey are of Bhairava in whose temples they wanderfreely. The special days for visiting these temples arethe same as those for visiting Kina Ram’sa ̄s ́rama; thegod too blesses his worshippers in the form of a(token) beating delivered by his priests, and in ritualintercourse the Aghori’s female partner is oftenidentified as his consort, Bhairavi. In short, as Lor-enzen (1972:80) has noted, the ascetic homologiseshimself with the god and acquires some of his divinepowers and attributes. Above all, like Siva – theGreat Ascetic and Destroyer of the Universe whoseemblem is the erect phallus and whose sexual trans-ports shake the cosmos – he transcends duality byuniting opposites within his own person, and therebyacquires Siva’s role asMaha ̄mritunja, the ‘Conquerorof Death’, who amongst the gods is the only one whosurvives the dissolution of the cosmos and who istruly indestructible (avina ̄s ́ı ̄).This, it seems to me, is the crux of the matter. Thetheme of inversion and the coincidence of oppositesruns throughout the material I have presented. Theascetic becomes the consort of the prostitute, themenstruating prostitute becomes the goddess, beat-ing a blessing, the cremation ground a place of wor-ship, a skull the food-bowl and excrement and putridflesh food, and pollution becomes indistinguishablefrom purity. Duality is abolished, polarities are re-combined, and the Aghori thus recaptures the prim-ordial state of non-differentiation. He passes out ofthe world of creation and destruction and into anexistence which is beyond time. He attains that stateof unity with Brahma which characterised the atem-poral and undifferentiated void which existed beforethe world began. So while I have argued in the firstsection of the paper that the mortuary rites of thehouseholder represent a re-creation of the deceased,a renewal of time and a regeneration of the cosmos, Iam arguing here that by embracing death and pollu-tion, by systematically combining opposites, theAghori aims to suspend time, to get off the round-about and to enter an eternal state ofsama ̄dhiin whichdeath has no menace.NOTES1Although I try here to make some sense of the path ofAghori asceticism by contrasting it with that of thehouseholder, it is of course clear that much of theirpractice might also be usefully seen in opposition tothe discipline of other ascetic orders. Such an analysisis, however, beyond the scope of the present paper.2Cf. Bharati’s observation (1976:17) that the uniquecontribution of Tantrism lies not so much in anyphilosophical novelty as in its ritual methods.3Fieldwork in Benares was carried out between Sep-tember 1976 and November 1977 (supported by theSocial Science Research Council) and in August 1978(supported by the London School of Economics andPolitical Science). I am deeply obligated to VirendraSingh for his language instruction, and to him and OmPrakash Sharma for their research assistance.4On the conception of death as a sacrifice see Biardeau(1971:76 and 1976:38); Das (1976 and 1977:120 – 6); Levin (1930); Malamoud (1975); Pandey(1969:241, 253) and Knipe (1975:132– 4).5I should note, however, that while the breaking of theskull is generally seen as a release of life from the body,most of my informants shied away from the explicitconclusion that it therefore amounts to an act ofviolence against the deceased.6In this sense, then, the deceased is himself the sacrifi-cer; which would seem to contradict the implicationthat, by taking upon himself ‘the sin of burning thebody hairs’, the chief mourner assumes this role. Infact, however, there is no incompatibility between thetwo, for in the Indian theory of sacrifice – as in manyothers – the sacrificer’s offering is his own bodyhomologised with that of the victim. Or, to put itmore simply, the chief mourner is symbolicallyequated with the deceased.7The notion that the sacrificer is the real victim of thesacrifice (see note 6) perhaps suggests another way oflooking at the ambiguity surrounding the ritual state ofthe corpse (i.e. whether it is pure or polluted). Accord-ing to the classical theory, the sacrificer has acquired –Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 281Jonathan Parry281"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"through the initiatory rite ofdı ̄ksa ̄– a sacrificial bodysufficiently august to be offered to the gods in sacrifice,while his profane body remains behind in the safe-keeping of the presiding priests (Malamoud, 1976:161, 193). The problem with cremation, however, isthat it is impossible to disguise the fact that it is not onlythis sacred entity which is dispatched by the fire, butalso the sacrificer’s profane and mortal being. Mytentative suggestion, then, is that it might be possibleto see the ambiguity over the condition of deceased as areflection of the difficulty of retaining, in this instance,a clear conceptual distinction between the two bodiesof the sacrificer. As representative of his sacrificialbody, the victim is pure; but as his patently profaneand incipiently putrescent corpse it is also impure.8I personally encountered twelve, but with only eightof them did I have any but the most fleeting contact.Although some Aghoris spend a significant amount oftime on pilgrimage (in particular to Pryag, Pasupati-nath in Nepal and Kamakhya in Assam), most appearto have a home base, and none that I came across wasrigorously peripatetic.9I encountered a very similar ambivalence in the case ofanother Aghori whose public pronouncements con-tinually stress the brotherhood of all men and themeaningless character of the social hierarchy. It wasclear that he regarded himself as a member of a smallspiritual elite karmically qualified for the attainmentofsama ̄dhi.What is also striking is that both of these asceticsnot only repudiate caste but also the divisions betweenHindus and others; and both are prepared to appro-priate Christian symbols to make this point. BhagvanRam’s leprosy hospice is surmounted by a ChristianCross; while Sadhak Basudeb showed me a pictorialautobiography he had made for the instruction of hisdevotees which contains a drawing in which he isreceiving the stigmata from Christ who appeared tohim during his wanderings in the Himalayas. Thiselement of religious syncretism is also apparent atthe shrine of Aughar Nath ka Takhiya, which containsseveral Aghorisama ̄dhisand which is said to belongequally to Hindus and Muslims. The influence of adevotionalbhaktiideology is also particularly clear inmuch of the Aghoris’ discourse.REFERENCESAbbot, J. 1932The keys of power: a study of Indian ritual andbelief.

The Tlingit potlatch has,by and large, escaped the attention of anthropologistsconcerned with interpretive theory.The major ethnographers of Tlingit culture haveemphasized the significant role played by the dead inthe potlatch and the native view of the ritual as amemorial (Veniaminov 1886; Swanton 1908;Emmons 1920–45; McClellan 1954; Olson 1967;de Laguna 1972). By incorporating this native modelof the potlatch and by drawing on previous accountsas well as data collected during fieldwork in 1979–80and 1984 (including active participation in severalpotlatches), I have tried to produce a more holisticanalysis of this ritual as it existed in the periodbetween 1830 and 1890, which predated massiveChristianization and other significant socioculturalchanges.I begin with . . . a discussion of the 19th-centuryTlingit funeral, the first stage in the cycle of mortu-ary rituals that culminated in the memorial potlatch.By focusing on the native characterization of theritual as the ‘‘finishing of the dead body,’’ I showthat it resembles other rites of secondary treatmentof the dead analyzed by Hertz (1960). Models of themortuary ritual developed by Van Gennep (1960),Hertz (1960), Huntington and Metcalf (1979), andothers are applied to the potlatch; the transformationof the deceased, the mourners, and their affines isalso discussed. Finally, the symbolism of the variousforms of ritual discourse and exchange is examinedto broaden our understanding of the relationshipsamong the four categories of potlatch participants:the hosts, the guests, and the deceased matrikin ofeach. I conclude the paper with suggestions about theFrom Sergei Kan, ‘‘The 19th-Century Tlingit Potlatch: A New Perspective,’’American Ethnologist, 13, 2 (1996): 191–212.Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 285285"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"possible use of some of the methods and findings ofthis study in analyzing potlatches in other NorthwestCoast societies.[...]Nineteenth-Century Tlingit FuneralThe Tlingit were divided into two matrilineal exog-amous moieties, the Ravens and the Eagles (Wolves),further subdivided into matrilineal clans. Each clanpossessed crests, origin myths, songs, and dances,which presented its sacred history and symbolized itsmembers’ collective identity. Clans also owned names(titles), subsistence areas, and other forms of tangibleand intangible property. Many were not localized butwere represented in villages by their segments (sub-clans), each occupying one or several houses. Eachhouse was identified with a matrilineage, which alsoowned a stock of lands and ceremonial property. Thesociety was ranked, with house heads and their imme-diate matrikin forming the aristocracy. Junior matri-kin of the aristocrats constituted the commoners.Slaves, consisting of some impoverished Tlingit andtheir neighbors captured in warfare, were perceivedas being outside the Tlingit society and were notgranted full personhood (Kan 1982:101–2). Lineagesand clans were ranked, but ranking was inexact andsubject to dispute and reevaluation, ultimately testedin the potlatch.The funeral began with the washing and dressingof the corpse in ceremonial garments depicting thecrests of the lineage and clan of the deceased.2Thebody was placed in the back of the house in a reclin-ing position, knees drawn up and bound, handsplaced on them. The deceased wore gloves ormittens, boots, and (a male?) was provided with aspear. Frequently he also wore a headdress repre-senting his clan or house. Other regalia of the matri-lineal group of the departed were placed near thebody, along with personal possessions. The numberof the deceased’s matrikin affected by the deathdepended on his status and rank. A standard unitinvolved was the subclan. All of its members sus-pended their mundane activities and visited thehouse of the deceased several times throughout thewake. Most strongly affected were the lineage kin ofthe departed, who had to fast, cut their hair, painttheir faces black, and observe other taboos. Thesemourners expressed their sorrow and honored thedeceased by wailing, singing ‘‘crying songs’’ (gaaxdaasheeyı ́), and speaking to and about him. Duringthe wake, the ghost was believed to remain in thehouse, and when it departed to the cemetery, therewas a danger that it would take a beloved relativealong.In the meantime, the paternal/affinal relatives ofthe deceased (members of the opposite moiety) werebusy preparing the funeral pyre, dressing, feeding,and comforting the mourners, and carrying outother practical tasks. The length and elaboratenessof the wake were determined by the rank and statusof the deceased and of his lineage and clan. A com-moner’s wake lasted for 4 days, while that of anaristocrat (aanya ́di) could continue for 8 days.Every evening, affinal/paternal relatives of the de-ceased came into the house to comfort the mournerswith speeches. They received tobacco, food, andsome gifts, tokens of the much larger donations tobe made to them in the potlatch (Shotridge1917:106–8; Olson 1967:59–60). Food and tobaccowere also burned as an offering to the matrilinealancestors of the mourners.The body was taken out through the back of thehouse or the smokehole and cremated. Some per-sonal belongings of the deceased were cremated aswell, while others were subsequently distributedamong his lineage kin. The male ‘‘opposites’’ of thedeparted cremated the body, while the female onescollected the ashes and the bones, and placed them ina temporary container, a box inside a grave house.Following cremation, the matrikin of the deceasedremoved the signs of mourning, cleansed them-selves, and conducted the first in a series of smallfeasts, in which they thanked their ‘‘opposites’’ andfeasted them. Once again, food and tobacco weresent to the matrilineal ancestors of the hosts. Theend of these feasts coincided with the arrival of thespirit of the deceased in the ‘‘village of the dead’’(s’igeeka ́awu aanı ́), but its final separation from theliving did not occur until the memorial potlatch.The terms’igeeka ́awu aani(literally ‘‘village of thebones’ people’’) was applied to the cemetery locatedbehind the village of the living, as well as the distant,noncorporeal dwelling place of the spirits.

Every clan’s cemetery was located behindits houses, so that the ‘‘village of the dead’’ mirroredthat of the living. Boxes with the remains of aristo-crats were also often deposited in the back of mor-tuary poles.3My analysis of the Tlingit funeral (Kan 1982:190–266), influenced by Van Gennep (1960),Hertz (1960), Turner (1967), and Huntington andMetcalf (1979), focuses on the transformation ofthe corporeal and the noncorporeal attributes of thedeceased, the mourners, and the members ofthe opposite moiety involved in the funeral. In thecourse of the mortuary ritual, several elements con-stituting a complete human person in the Tlingitculture were separated from each other. Thedecaying corpse was a source of great danger forthe living matrikin of the deceased. In the nativetheory of personhood (Kan 1982:45–80), a cleardistinction was made between the temporary phys-ical attributes, which I label the ‘‘outside,’’ and themore permanent corporeal and noncorporeal ones,that I refer to as the ‘‘inside.’’4The former includedthe skin and flesh, seen as the surface upon which thesocial identity and emotional state of the personwere reflected. Representations of the social identityalso appeared on ceremonial garments, seen as anadditional layer of the ‘‘outside.’’ Despite the pre-occupation with the perfect state of the ‘‘outside,’’the ‘‘inside,’’ consisting of the bones and severalnoncorporeal entities, was perceived as a more sig-nificant element controlling the ‘‘outside.’’ In con-trast to the ‘‘soft’’ and ‘‘wet’’ flesh, the bones wereconsidered ‘‘solid,’’ ‘‘dry,’’ and ‘‘heavy,’’ and occupiedan intermediate position between the flesh and thespiritual entities.5Cremation may be interpreted as a quick way ofseparating the polluted flesh (no longer controlled bythe ‘‘inside’’) from the pure bones and releasing thenoncorporeal entities of the ‘‘inside.’’6The boneswere ‘‘dressed’’ in blankets and placed inside a‘‘house’’ in the ‘‘village of the dead.’’ The spiritualentities included a ghost that dwelled with the bones,a spirit located in a noncorporeal replica of thehouse of the deceased in the distant ‘‘village of thedead,’’ and another spirit that returned to this worldto be reincarnated in a matrilineal descendant of thedeceased.7Cremation ensured that the spiritremained warm in the afterlife, while the fireplaceinside the house of the living served as their mediumof communication with departed matrikin, whodepended on the food and gifts placed in it by theliving.Despite the pollution emanating from the corpse,the Tlingit displayed it in the most conspicuous partof the house, associated with the house chief(hı ́ts’aatı ́)and the sacred objects representing the lineagecrests(at o ́owu). In the native view, the clothing puton the deceased equipped the spirit for a difficultjourney through the interior forest to the ‘‘village ofthe dead,’’ while the songs performed by themourners ‘‘cleared the underbrush from its path’’(McClellan 1975:373; Kan 1982:207). At the sametime, the display of the corpse was described as‘‘showingrespecttothedeceased’’(Wallis1918:80; Swanton 1908:429). The focus of thewake was on the social identity of the deceased (cf.Hertz 1960:77). The death of each member of amatrilineal group (particularly an aristocrat) causeda social crisis. Hence, the wake involved a collectiveassessment of the social career of the deceased andreiterated his ties with each member of his lineage orclan. The first stage in the transformation of thedeceased into an ancestor (cf. Hertz 1960:79–80),8the wake was a period of the greatest solidarityamong the matrikin of the deceased, united in theircommon grief, and in what they called ‘‘love andrespect’’forthedeceased.Theirmourn-ing attire underscored that unity, while deemphasiz-ing the important distinctions and inequalities amongthe aristocrats and commoners, old and young, menand women. The transformation of the mournersduring the funeral paralleled that of the deceased,consisting of the three stages of the rites of passage(Van Gennep 1960; see also Hertz 1960; Huntingtonand Metcalf 1979; Kan 1982:222–3).9The mourners’ behavior contrasted sharply withthat of their paternal/affinal kin. While the formerwere passive, if not socially dead, the latter wereengaged in handling the polluted corpse, and helpingthe mourners practically and morally. This enabledthe mourners to concentrate on the pure ‘‘inside’’(social persona, spiritual attributes) of the deceased,Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 287Sergei Kan287"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"since their ‘‘opposites’’ dealt with the polluted ‘‘out-side.’’ By the end of the funeral, the mournersreturned to normal, active life and became donors,while their ‘‘opposites’’ turned into the more passiverecipients, a role they continued to play throughoutthe remaining rituals of the mortuary cycle, includ-ing the potlatch.Thus the funeral reaffirmed the two fundamentalprinciples of the Tlingit sociocultural order: matri-lineal unity and solidarity, and the reciprocity be-tween moieties. It began as a dramatic disruption ofnormal social life and ended with its restoration aswell as reaffirmation of basic cultural values, includ-ing the ‘‘love and respect’’ between the living and thedead, and between affines. Finally, it allowed themourners to display their sacred crests and performthe ancestral songs and dances that enhanced thestatus of their matrilineal groups.10Memorial Potlatch as the Secondary Treatmentof the DeadThe funeral and subsequent memorial feasts did notcomplete the mortuary cycle. The remains of thedeceased were not considered ‘‘finished’’ until a newcontainer had been provided for them. This could bea new box, a new or repaired grave house, or amortuary pole. The remains were ‘‘finished’’ by thesame paternal/affinal relatives of the deceased whohad earlier participated in his funeral. At the me-morial potlatch they were remunerated for theirservices, while the matrikin of the deceased rituallyended their mourning. The ceremonial regalia,names, and other attributes of the deceased werebestowed upon his matrilineal descendants. Onlythose on the very bottom of the social hierarchywere not memorialized in a potlatch. The rest ofthe people were either honored in a special potlatchor included in the rites honoring their matrikin ofhigher rank.The liminal nature of the period between thefuneral and the potlatch was clearly expressed bythe notion that the deceased had not yet found apermanent place in the ‘‘village of the dead,’’ whilehis matrikin had not yet been released frommourning taboos, and were still considered indebtedto their ‘‘opposites,’’ who had helped them duringthe funeral. To refuse to give a potlatch was to riskillness and death, and to show a total lack of ‘‘loveand respect’’ for one’s matrilineal ancestors and‘‘opposites.’’By approaching the Tlingit potlatch as a secondarytreatment of the dead, I incorporate the native viewinto the analysis and thus broaden its scope. I alsosuggest that the data indicate a similarity betweenthis ritual and various forms of the secondary treat-ment of the dead found throughout the world (Hertz1960; Bloch 1971; Huntington and Metcalf 1979;Bloch and Parry 1982).11Outline of the memorial potlatchThe hosts’ preparation for the potlatch included anaccumulation of wealth and an observance of variousrules similar to those imposed on persons preparingfor a dangerous task requiring magical power andgood fortune(laxeitl). Brothers-in-law of the hosts(naa ka ́ani)were sent to invite the guests from distantcommunities, while the local guests were invitedsome time before the ceremony by thenaa ka ́aniwho stopped in front of their houses and called outtheir ceremonial names (titles) – hence the Tlingitterm for the potlatch,ku.eex’, from the verbya-.eex’,‘‘to call out,’’ ‘‘to invite.’’12The arrival of the guests was marked by mockbattles and an exchange of dances and songs betweenthe guests standing in their canoes and the hosts onthe beach. Once the guests had landed, they weretaken to the houses of the hosts’ clan, where theystayed through the entire period of feasting andceremonies, which lasted for at least a month. Pre-liminary rites included dancing, singing, and maskedperformances by the two sides, as well as the feastingof the guests by their hosts. The potlatch properusually lasted 4 days. It began with the hosts‘‘mourning their dead [matrikin] for the last time.’’Sad (‘‘heavy’’) songs belonging to the mourners’ clanwere performed, tears were shed, and speeches ofcondolence were delivered by the guests, to whichthe hosts responded with speeches of gratitude. Withthis part of the ritual completed, the mood andbehavior of the participants became less somber.The hosts now performed songs describing theirancestral crests (called ‘‘national songs’’ by the pre-sent informants) and displayed them in the form ofRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 288The Nineteenth-Century Tlingit Potlatch: A New Perspective288"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"ceremonial garments and other regalia. The guestswere feasted several times, while some food was putin the fire for dead members of the hosts’ clan, whowere believed to take part in the potlatch. The gueststold jokes to entertain the hosts and help them forgettheir sorrow. ‘‘Love songs’’(kusixa ́n daasheeyı ́)werealso exchanged between the two sides.The climax of the potlatch was the distributionamong the guests of the gifts contributed by individ-ual hosts. Before making his or her donation, eachhost was given an opportunity to deliver a speech orsing a song illustrating his or her relationship to thedeceased and to thank the guests for their help. Justbefore the distribution of gifts, the hosts namedmembers of their group, many of them youngsters.A small portion of the gifts was burned for thebenefit of the donors’ matrilineal ancestors. Thename of each deceased member of the hosts’ lineageor clan was called out, followed by the name of aparticular guest who was to receive the gift. Thedead received the noncorporeal essence (‘‘inside’’) ofthe gift, and the living its corporeal form (‘‘out-side’’). Having collected their presents and packedthe leftover food, the guests thanked the hostsfor their generosity, and performed a few dancesand songs as a form of gratitude. Often they wouldstage a small return potlatch, distributing amongtheir hosts a portion of the gifts they had justreceived.The Potlatch ParticipantsThe deceasedThe potlatch completed the distribution of the vari-ous attributes of the deceased among the severaldomains of the universe. The bones and the ghostfinally found a permanent home in the cemetery,while the spirit became forever established in thedistant ‘‘village of the dead.’’ Another noncorporealentity, theyaahaı ́, returned to the living to be re-incarnated in a matrilineal descendant of the de-ceased. His ceremonial title(s) or name(s) as wellas festive attire depicting his lineage or clan crestswere bestowed on his successor. The rebirth of thedeceased and the death’s failure to interrupt thecontinuity of the matrilineal group were dramaticallyexpressed by addressing the new owner of the title orthe regalia as if he were the deceased himself (Kan1979–84).In the potlatch, the mourners’/hosts’ attentionbegan to shift from the recently deceased person toother dead members of their matrilineal group,whose names were also invoked and who were also‘‘warmed,’’ ‘‘clothed,’’ and ‘‘fed’’ through the fire.The key value of the unity and solidarity of thematrikin was thus confirmed, since the rite, whichhad begun as a memorial to a single person, becamethe main occasion for remembering, honoring, andhelping the matrilineal ancestors of the mourners/hosts. Every member of the group was given anopportunity to mourn his or her own departedmatrikin.One of the most dramatic and effective forms forexpressing the continuity between the generations oflineage or clan relatives were the ‘‘sad songs’’(tuwu-nukw daasheeyı ́), also called ‘‘heavy songs’’( yaadaalidaasheeyı ́). Some were identical to those performedduring the funeral, but others (the most sacred andvaluable) were reserved for the potlatch. Forexample, one popular ‘‘sad song’’ of a Sitka clan isbelieved to have been composed by a woman of thatgroup, after the canoe containing her baby had beencarried away by the tide. The woman mourns herbeloved child’s death and compares it to the tragicdeaths of several of her clan ancestors, killed whileriding in a canoe in the early 1800s, during the warwiththeRussians(Olson1967:44 –5;Kan1979–84). The image of the canoe carrying deadbodies links the two events. When the descendantsof the song’s author perform it during their potlatch,they lament the deaths of all of their matrikin, boththe recently deceased and those of long ago, includ-ing the unfortunate infant and the brave warriors.Since kinship terms rather than personal names wereused in most songs, and since many deaths resultedfrom the same causes, a mourner could usually findan appropriate song to express his or her sorrowabout the loss of a particular clan relative (cf. deLaguna 1972:632).The participation of the matrilineal ancestors ofthe hosts in the potlatch was emphasized throughoutthe ritual by invocation of their names and referenceto their lives. The custom of inviting them to thepotlatch was believed to have originated in ancientRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 289Sergei Kan289"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"times, when Raven, the culture hero, was shapingthe world into its present form. According toVeniaminov (1886:623– 4), Raven once invited thedead to a feast and tried to feed them. However, theywere able to consume only the food placed into thefire. After his guests had departed, Raven discoveredthat the food in their dishes remained intact. ‘‘This iswhy today the Tlingit have memorial feasts for theirdead relatives in order to feed them, but with onedifference: they throw just a little bit into the fire and[their living guests] eat the rest,’’ concludes Venia-minov (1886:623– 4).The notion that everything given to the guests inthe potlatch belonged to the dead member of thehosts’ lineage/clan explains why the food and giftshave been referred to as ‘‘dying’’ or ‘‘being killed.’’13Once the property had been collected and preparedfor distribution, it could no longer be used by thedonors, since that would bring great misfortuneupon them. As one informant explained, ‘‘Youcan’t touch that food, gifts, and money. They alreadybelong to the dead’’ (Kan 1979–84). The presence ofthe dead accounts also for the taboo on continuingthe potlatch proper into daylight hours.14The asso-ciation between the dead and the nighttime is notsurprising, since animal and superhuman spirits wereactive at night, magic power was more accessible tohumans after dark and, in comparison to this world,day and night in the ‘‘village of the dead’’ werereversed.The potlatch played a number of important rolesin the sociopolitical domain of Tlingit life, includingthe validation of claims to certain rank and status.However, the Tlingit themselves saw it first andforemost as amemorial ritual(de Laguna 1972:612;Kan 1979–84). Having no corporeal ‘‘outside,’’ thedead were invisible, but through various forms ofsymbolic media they were, as one informant put it,‘‘brought back to life.’’ In the performance of the‘‘heavy songs,’’ the living not only described the livesof their matrilineal ancestors but ensured that the‘‘voices of the dead could be heard.’’ This seems to bemore than a metaphor, since a number of informantssaid that they could see their beloved mothers andmaternal uncles among the dancers and could distin-guish their voices among those of the singers (Kan1979–84).The continuity between the living and the deadmatrikin was made manifest in most of the ritualperformances, but especially when the ancestral re-galia and the ‘‘heavy’’ ceremonial names/titles wereused. The garments passed from one generation ofclan members to the next could be interpreted as the‘‘outside’’ layer of the dead appropriated by theirliving descendants. The names were also perceived astangibles placed on the living as clothing. Thus,according to Olson (1933–54, notebook 5:52),‘‘Those to be reincarnated go to a place no oneknows where and when they come back they carry(as a bundle) under their arm that same name whichis therefore given to them.’’ Names were said to begiven ‘‘to the face’’ of the recipient (Johnson1979:6). This notion was reinforced by the practiceof rubbing some of the gifts to be distributed in thepotlatch on the forehead of the recipient of a name.The Tlingit were concerned with preventing theirnames/titles from ‘‘dying out’’ and accomplishedthat by perpetually recycling them among their des-cendants. Each potlatch name/title, as opposed to abirth or a pet name, had a certain prestige and socialvalue and indicated the rank of its holder (Olson1967:48). According to Olson (1933–54, notebook9:65), ‘‘A man who repays his debt may pay only theoriginal amount but usually would pay back more forthe honor of his name. But if the debt is passed on fora generation or more, a larger amount is always paid.Idea is not of interest but of honor of the name’’ [emphasisadded].15The relationship between the living and the deaddramatized in the memorial potlatch was that ofreciprocity. The living provided the dead withfood, warmth, gifts, and, most importantly, loveand remembrance. In return, the dead passed ontheir valuable names and other sacred possessionsand prerogatives, used by the living to maintain andraise their rank, status, and prestige.16Although thiscould not be called ‘‘ancestor worship’’ (contraEmmons 1910), the Tlingit did believe that thedead could not only help but harm the living withillness and death, if the latter did not remember,honor, and help them. As long as the dead wereremembered by their living matrikin and could par-ticipate in their potlatches, they remained immortaland sat close to the fire in their noncorporeal housesRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 290The Nineteenth-Century Tlingit Potlatch: A New Perspective290"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"(Swanton 1908:462). The forgotten ancestors, onthe other hand, moved further and further awayfrom the fire, suffered from hunger and cold, whiletheir ‘‘houses’’ in the cemetery crumbled. Ultim-ately, the continuity of the matrilineal clan, as acultural category, depended upon a human abilitytoremember.The mourners as hostsJust as it is necessary to include the deceased in theanalysis of the potlatch, it is essential to incorporatethe native view of the ritual as the last public expres-sion of the mourners’ grief. Thus, in the 1980spotlatches I witnessed, the hosts were encouragedby guests ‘‘not to hold back their tears’’ and ‘‘let alltheir sorrow out.’’ This was accomplished throughthe mourners’ performance of the four special‘‘crying songs,’’ one of their most treasured posses-sions. This singing was followed by the four pro-longedoosounds made by the mourners, said to‘‘expel sadness from theirtoowu ́[mind/soul,‘‘inside’’].’’ The male mourners also struck thefloor with their staffs four times, ‘‘putting all oftheir grief’’ into that act (Kan 1979–84; Olson1967:61).The Tlingit thought that emotions originated inthetoowu ́and were expressed on the ‘‘outside’’through tears, laughter, words, and facial expres-sions. Grief was perceived as a particularly powerfulemotion, somewhat independent of human will andconsciousness. According to Swanton (1908:437),‘‘It is not through man’s own will, but the way thatRaven made people, that brings forth a new song,when people are called together after one has died.’’The ‘‘crying songs’’ were the most appropriate ex-pression of grief, perceived as something tangible,which could be manipulated and expelled during thepotlatch. Thus, in Olson’s account, the mournersfollowed the singing of the four ‘‘sad songs’’ with theshedding of their coats (in lieu of blankets) andholding them before the fire to ‘‘dry their sorrow’’(1967:62). The ritual was also seen as a way ofstrengthening the mourners’toowu ́. Their moodwas expected to change and no more tears weresupposed to be shed in public after that. In a recentpotlatch, the hosts expressed this change by usingtwo carved representations of their main crest, acertain type of salmon. At the beginning of theritual, the two fish were hung on the wall withtheir heads pointing downward to represent sorrow;after the ceremony of ‘‘pushing away sorrow,’’ theirheads were turned upward, to make them ‘‘lookhappy’’ (Kan 1979–84).In the expression of their sorrow, the hosts wereunified. Throughout the potlatch, this solidarity wasmaintained and repeated in word and action. Thus,all of the hosts remained standing during the pot-latch, occupying the front of the house, its leastconspicuous area, so as to show their deference tothe guests (Kan 1978). Every member of the hosts’group, regardless of rank, could express his or herfeelings (de Laguna 1972:632–3).The hosts were also united in their subsequentperformances aimed at displaying their ancestralregalia and prerogatives. While justified as a showof ‘‘love and respect’’ for their ancestors, they werealso intended to confirm the hosts’ claims to theirsacred possessions and to raise their status. As Olson(1967:59) notes,the potlatch was not a duty but aprivilege. In fact, it was the only major opportunityfor the display of the sacred crests (at o ́owu), theperformance of songs, dances, and myths embodyingthe sacred history, identity, and destiny of the matri-lineal group (itsshago ́on). A generous distribution ofproperty accompanying this display increased thevalue of the crests. Thus, a distribution of $6000,while displaying a headdress representing one of thehosts’ major crests, was described as ‘‘killing $6,000to bring out the headdress’’ (Swanton 1908:442; seealso Oberg 1973:125). In addition to displaying theirold possessions, the hosts could validate their claimsto new ones, including houses and lands. This wassaid to make the property and its owners ‘‘heavier,’’that is, increase their value and status by bringingthem into direct contact with the wealth to bedistributed to the guests. Thus, in a recent potlatch,money placed inside a headdress representing thehosts’ major crest was later rubbed on the faces ofthose who were to be given names (Kan 1979–84).These and numerous other examples indicate thatactions aimed at raising the hosts’ rank and status werejustified as ways of honoring their matrilineal ances-tors.

I suggest that the ‘‘love and respect’’of the living toward the dead served as an ideology,enabling the living to present actions aimed at raisingtheir status as noble and morally correct. While state-ments of grief and love for one’s ancestors, made bysome of the hosts (especially the chief mourners),expressed sincere emotions, other used them as arhetorical device in a struggle for power and prestige.At times the desire for prestige outweighed the mor-tuary/memorial purpose of the potlatch.Nevertheless, it is incorrect to consider competi-tion over rank, status, and prestige to be the onlysignificant purpose of this ritual, as some scholarshavedone(Oberg1973:124–5;Tollefson1976:203–34). On the other hand, it would also bea mistake to restrict the analysis to the native ideology,which emphasized such commemorative aspects ofthe potlatch as ‘‘dignity, sympathy, high respect forall, with the exalted chief and the poor and lowlyunited in sorrow and honor for the ancestors’’ (deLaguna 1972:612). In my opinion, the complexity ofthe potlatch and its centrality in Tlingit culture andsociety resulted from a dialectical relationship be-tween competition and cooperation, between thestruggle for power and prestige on the one hand, andthe ‘‘love and respect’’ for the ancestors on the other.Thus, while united in their grief and pride in theirclan’sshago ́on, the hosts competed with one another,and different categories of persons played unequalroles. For example, if the deceased was a house or aclan chief, several of his successors might competefor his title and position by trying to contribute thelargest amount of wealth to his memorial potlatchand to play the leading role in it. Although most ofthe negotiations and debates between them wouldoccur in private, the amount of wealth eachwould contribute and the order in which these indi-vidual presentations would be made served as a formof public competition. The head of the hosts madethe last and the largest donation. Lower-rankinghosts could also use the wealth they contributes tocompete with clan relatives of a similar rank. Al-though each host was supposed to contribute inaccordance with his or her present rank and status,there always remained some room for competitionand mobility. Such behavior was explained and justi-fied as an effort to emulate the ‘‘illustrious prece-dents set by one’s maternal uncles and grandfathers.However, the abstract standards ofnoblesse obligeorthe legendary examples of dead ancestors were read-ily replaced by the challenging marks set by thepresent acts of fellow chiefs and clanmates’’ (deLaguna 1972:613). Bitter disputes between hostsalso centered on the right to use crests and bestowvaluable names on their immediate matrikin. Thus, ifseveral houses acted as hosts, one of them wouldsometimes try to ‘‘grab’’ a high-ranking name beforeothers had a chance to do so or would refuse torecognize the right of another house to display aparticular crest (Oberg 1973:125; Kan 1979–84).Among the hosts, the superiority of aristocratsover commoners, old over young, and men overwomen was stated by their respective location insidethe house as well as the different tasks assigned tothem. At the same time, the complementarity ofdifferent social categories was also expressed, forexample, in the relationship between male andfemale styles of dancing. On the whole, the potlatchwas dominated by the aristocrats, who acted asguardians of the ceremonial regalia, as song anddance leaders, as key orators, and as contributorsof the largest amounts of wealth. The esoteric lan-guage used in the potlatch and the numerous meta-phorical references to the participants’shago ́onwereused and understood mostly by the aristocrats whowere specially trained for this ceremonial role. Onthe other hand, the cooperation of the entire matri-lineal group of the hosts was necessary for the suc-cess of its potlatch, while the glory of the aristocratsreflected on their lower-ranking kin. Even a smallcontribution made by a poor host or a child waswelcomed, and those with nothing to give werehelped by their matrikin.The opposite side as guestsMuch of the potlatch was focused on the relation-ships between hosts and guests, the latter activatedby the same combination of competition and cooper-ation already discussed. To compensate one’s ‘‘op-posites’’ for the services provided during the funeralwas just as important as the other functions of thepotlatch examined above. This explains why todaythe Tlingit refer to this ritual in English as the ‘‘payoff (party).’’ In the potlatch guests continued to playRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 292The Nineteenth-Century Tlingit Potlatch: A New Perspective292"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"their crucial role as mediators between the hosts andtheir deceased matrikin, since the spiritual essence ofthings given to the guests became the property of thedead. The guests also acted as representatives orimpersonators of their own matrilineal ancestors,whose songs and dances they performed, andwhom they frequently mentioned in their speeches.Finally, the presence of the guests was the prerequis-ite for the validation of the hosts’ claims to theirsacred crests.In Tlingit society, relationships between matrilin-eal groups belonging to the different moieties weredelicate and required a great deal of care to maintainbalanced reciprocity. Feuds and wars between theRavens and the Eagles broke out over minor insultsand injuries. Unlike conflicts between members of asingle moiety, these could not be settled informally,but demanded an elaborate peace-making ceremonybefore normal relations could be restored. Onemajor prerequisite for peace was that the rank ofall the slain members of one moiety should equal thatof the other (de Laguna 1972:592–604).Intermoiety relations in the potlatch must beviewed as a restoration of balance and a transform-ation of potential hostility into peace. This interpret-ation is supported by the use of war symbolism andrhetoric in the initial and sometimes later stagesof the potlatch. Before the guests from anothercommunity could land in front of their hosts’ houses,a mock battle occurred between the hosts on thebeach and the guests standing in their canoes (Olson1967:61–2; Billman 1964:59). The ceremony beganwith the chief host appearing on the beach with abow and arrows and wearing his war costume, andended with his welcoming the guests by walking intothe water towards them and having his junior malerelatives carry them ashore in their canoes.In comparison to the late 19th-century Kwakiutl,the Tlingit potlatch was characterized by relativepeacefulness and a general lack of openly adversarialbehavior. The killing of slaves and drowning ofcopper sheets and other valuables, labeled the ‘‘de-struction of property’’ by anthropologists, was donenot so much to challenge rivals, but rather to offergifts to the hosts’ matrilineal ancestors. At the sametime, the aggressive rhetoric of some Tlingit potlatchspeeches was not unlike that of the Kwakiutl potlatchdescribed by Codere (1950). However, her inter-pretation of this phenomenon as a substitute forwarfare does not seem to apply to the Tlingit, whowaged war against and potlatched with each otherthroughout most of the 19th century. After theAmericans put an end to warfare, the scale of thepotlatch did increase, but that was due to the enrich-ment of the Tlingit from the fur trade and wagelabor. A comparison of Tlingit and Kwakiutl potlatchrhetoric leads me to accept Drucker and Heizer’sintepretation of the Kwakiutl references to war as a‘‘verbalization of conflict,’’ rather than a survivalfrom an earlier era dominated by fighting(1967:125–9).17The next issue to be discussed concerns the iden-tity of potlatch guests. While existing evidence sup-ports Rosman and Rubel’s argument that the guestswere divided into two competing groups (1971:51–3), they were not necessarily the only groups linkedto the hosts through marriage. Swanton’s (1908:435)data, the evidence used by Rosman and Rubel, doesnot show that the hosts’ clan (the ChilkatGaanax.-a ́di) had affinal ties only with two of the subclansinvited to the potlatch (the Chilkat and the SitkaKaagwaantaan). All of the existing data indicatethat a Tlingit matrilineal group intermarried withmore than two other groups (Olson 1967:7; Tollef-son 1976:209–10; Kan 1979–84; and so forth).18Ifthis is the case, how then can we explain the dualdivision of the guests? First, the structure of theTlingit house encouraged this; guests occupied thetwo sides, where they sat facing each other (Kan1978). Second, out-of-town guests were alwaystreated with somewhat greater deference than localones. Since any major potlatch required the presenceof the former, the division of the guests seemsnatural. If only local guests attended, they weredivided along clan and lineage lines. The point isthat it was the opposition itself and not the identity ofthe groups that mattered (cf. McClellan 1954:86).Competition between the two parties was expressedin dancing and eating contests, as well as in otherperformances, adding excitement to the ritual andunderscoring the unity of the hosts.The hosts carefully watched their guests to pre-vent competition from turning into serious conflict.The most effective way of restoring peace was for theRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 293Sergei Kan293"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"chief host to appeal to the memory of his predecessorwhose ceremonial attire he was wearing and whosecrest(s) he was displaying. These objects were called‘‘masterless things’’ (ls’aatı ́a ́t), which resembles theterm for widow,ls’aatı ́shaa (a woman without amaster) (de Laguna 1972:614). This suggests that theviolence between the guests threatened to turn thehosts into ‘‘widows,’’ that is, to deprive them ofpotential spouses.In addition to this dual division, the guests werealso differentiated according to rank, age, gender, andthe degree of relatedness to the chief hosts and thedeceased. The guests’ seating arrangement wasthe hosts’ own statement of the current hierarchywithin and between the kin groups of their ‘‘oppos-ites.’’ The ranking of guests was reconfirmed by theorder of the distribution and the size of the gifts theyreceived. In most cases, guests accepted the hosts’evaluation of their rank and status, but occasionally aguest showed displeasure and even attempted toleave. This called for a quick reaction from thehosts, who offered the offended person a differentseat or increased the size of the gift. Thus, the pot-latch became the main context in which members ofthe two moieties negotiated their positions in thesocial hierarchy, doing it not through open confron-tation or argument, but by couching their actions inthe rhetoric of ‘‘love and respect’’ for each other andfor the ancestors.Although the rank of a guest and the degree ofcloseness of his or her paternal/affinal relationshipwith the host were the main determinants of thenature and the size of the gift, the hosts’ rhetoricemphasized that the feelings of ‘‘love and respect’’between the donor(s) and the recipient were thedetermining factors. The main guests were paid es-pecially generously for the services they had providedduring the funeral and subsequent memorial rites,including the ‘‘finishing of the corpse.’’ Of course,high-ranking persons and the close paternal/affinalkin of the lineage of the deceased were usuallyselected for those honorable tasks. Once again, thedead served as a vehicle for potlatch participants tojustify their actions, lifting them above the level ofmundane politics and personal likes and dislikes.The special position of the hosts’ close paternal/affinal relatives was emphasized not only by theirplaces in the house and the size of gifts received,but also by assigning to them the prestigious task ofserving as the hosts’naa ka ́ani. The latter wereusually the brothers-in-law of the deceased and ofthe chief hosts, who performed the most delicatetasks of inviting the guests, escorting them to theirseats, and counting and distributing the wealthamassed by the hosts. The most remarkable mani-festation of this special relationship between closepaternal/affinal relatives was the assistance providedto the hosts by their ‘‘fathers’’ and siblings-in-law.Swanton (1909:438) reported that a woman whosehusband was preparing a major potlatch in the early1900s obtained $2000 from her clan relatives inanother community, thereby increasing her hus-band’s contribution by 50 percent (cf. de Laguna1972:640–1). The wife of the chief host could alsorefuse the money and gifts given to her with thewords, ‘‘I give myself up for my husband’’ or ‘‘I giveit [return the money and gifts] for the face of myhusband’’ (McClellan 1954:84). According toMcClellan (1954:84), only high-ranking womenattempted this maneuver, which increased theirown and their husbands’ prestige. In currentpotlatches, financial help given to the hosts bytheir paternal/affinal kin is quite substantial andthe practice itself seems more prevalent than inthe 19th century. An individual host may receivemoney from up to two dozen guests who wish tohonor and show their ‘‘love and respect’’ to him. Theamount received constitutes up to 30 percent, if notmore, of the total monetary donation made by such ahost. Of course, the guests making such contribu-tions usually expect a generous return when themoney is distributed.19Forms of ExchangeThe reciprocity between hosts and guests involved,in addition to tangibles, a flow of words, bodilymovements, food, and gifts. The hosts dominatedthis exchange, since they had to restore the balancein their relationship with their ‘‘opposites,’’threatened by the hosts’ indebtedness to them.Food and gifts flowed mainly from hosts to guests.On the other hand, guests played a greater role in theceremonial oratory, since their role was to comfortRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 294The Nineteenth-Century Tlingit Potlatch: A New Perspective294"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"the hosts and help them forget their sorrow, to whichthe hosts responded with words of gratitude.The oratory of condolence and gratitudeThe potlatch oratory of condolence and gratitudewas a complex genre, made into a true art form bythe Tlingit.

Guests’speeches were thus supposed to ‘‘smooth out,’’‘‘strengthen,’’ and ‘‘heal’’ the mourners’ ‘‘inside’’(toowu ́).The structure of each speech was invariable, be-ginning with a ‘‘genealogical catalogue’’ (Dauen-hauer 1975:186), which reaffirmed the speaker’sties with the different categories of the hosts andreminded them of the culturally appropriate emo-tions that characterized specific paternal/affinal re-lationships (for example, ‘‘love and pity’’ of fatherstoward their children). The next step was a presen-tation of an episode, usually from the myths of thespeaker’s clan, which involved a human being or ananimal in mortal danger and his miraculous deliver-ance, thanks to a human being or a superhumanhelper. The hosts’ sorrow was linked to the protag-onist’s suffering, the guests’ love and compassion tothe actions of the mythical helper. The oppositionbetween thegriefand theabsence of griefwas meta-phorized and repeated by a series of oppositionsinvolving physical conditions frequently experiencedby the Tlingit, such as hunger/eating, darkness/light, wet/dry, war/peace, and so on. The speakercould dramatize the healing effect of his wordsby using a crest of his clan to ‘‘save’’ the story’sprotagonist. For example, if the frog was his crest,he could say that the frog had swallowed up themourners’ sorrow. He could also strengthen themessage by invoking his own matrilineal ancestors,saying that they were the ones helping the hosts. Thereferences to the speaker’s own matrilineal ancestorsalso reminded the hosts that their guests had previ-ously suffered similar losses and hence could betterunderstand their feelings. A condolence speechended with a repetition of the opening genealogicalcatalogue.The hosts interrupted the condolence speecheswith their own exclamations of agreement and ap-proval, and later thanked the guests and reiteratedthe message of their speeches in their own state-ments. The structure of the latter was the same asthat of the guests. The words of the guests were saidto ‘‘have healed’’ the mourners, ‘‘covered them withwarm blankets,’’ and ‘‘brought them good fortune’’(laxeitl). The metaphors of the condolence oratorylinked the past and the present, denying death thepower to disrupt the process of social reproduction(Kan 1983:53–6).At the same time, potlatch oratory allowed theparticipants to invoke their ancestral history, crests,and other sacred possessions. Thus, as with otherforms of symbolic action involved in this ritual, itdelivered messages of ‘‘love and respect’’ betweenrelatives, as well as competition and the desire toincrease their rank and prestige. This multivocalitycharacterizes the other types of ritual exchange dis-cussed below.The ‘‘love songs’’The solemnity of the condolence oratory and espe-cially the ‘‘crying songs’’ contrasted sharply with themood of the ‘‘love songs’’ (kusixan daasheeyı ́), alsocalled ‘‘songs about the children of the clan’’ (naaya ́tx’i daa sheey’i). These were sung by the hosts, afterthe completion of the sad portion of the potlatch,when the hosts began to entertain the guests and toexpress their gratitude. A Tlingit ‘‘love song’’ ad-dresses the children of the singers’ clan, that is, thosemembers of the opposite moiety whose fathersare their clan relatives. Thus, if the hosts weremembers of the Kaagwaantaan clan, they wouldsing about the ‘‘children of the Kaagwaantaan.’’(They could also mention the children of otherclans of their moiety.)To address a Tlingit as a ‘‘child’’ of his or herfather’s clan was meant to flatter and please him orher. The category of a clan’s ‘‘children’’ included thesingers’ actual or potential spouses. Thus the ‘‘love’’referred to in these songs included the feelings offathers toward children as well as the love betweenmen and women. As Dauenhauer points out,Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 295Sergei Kan295"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"The term ‘‘love’’ is used here also to mean respect.Love songs may be to a person of the opposite sex, butthey may be in a deeper sense directed to one’s ownfamily [paternal kin], regardless of sex. Although thesong may function on different emotional levels, thepattern will be structurally the same. (Dauenhauer1975:153)Many ‘‘love songs’’ were composed by persons ex-pressing their feelings toward spouses and sweet-hearts, but the latter were never mentioned byname: the plural form of the word ‘‘child’’ wasinstead used. Thus, a particular ‘‘child’’ of the com-poser’s clan was inseparable from his or her ownclan, and love and social identity were linked to-gether. As Dauenhauer (1975:153) puts it, personalemotion was expressed to a specific individual by aspecific individual, but the relationship was con-trolled by the marriage rules.The clan identity of the addressees remained un-known until the latter responded by joyfully dancingin a special style. This acknowledged their paternalancestry and returned the ‘‘love and respect’’ to thesingers. The guests also responded with a few ‘‘lovesongs’’ of their own, prompting the hosts to react in asimilar manner.‘‘Love songs’’ underscored the cultural emphasison ‘‘love’’ between ‘‘opposites,’’ seen as being re-sponsible for sexual and social reproduction. Theystressed the lighter side of intermoiety relations,contrasting sharply with the war rhetoric exchangedearlier between hosts and guests.20‘‘Love songs’’were more than a simple relief from the solemnityof much of the potlatch, although the importance ofparticipants’ enjoyment should not be underesti-mated. The use of images that alluded to heterosex-ual love in a ritual marking the end of mourning isnot surprising. This was, after all, a celebration oflife’s victory over death, a common theme of mortu-ary rites throughout the world (cf. Huntington andMetcalf 1979; Bloch and Parry 1982).Feasting and the distribution of giftsThe feelings and attitudes of the hosts to the guestswere also expressed through the distribution of foodand gifts, the climax of the potlatch. The spectacularnature of the distribution of huge amounts of fish,meat, fish oil, berries, animal skins, blankets, and soforth, has been the subject of a number of analyses(for example, Benedict 1934; Suttles 1960). How-ever, ‘‘this powerful quantitative impression’’ of thewealth has ‘‘obscured for many scholars the trad-itional . . . regard for both the quantity and thesymbolic significance of each item’’ (Goldman1975:134).21The Tlingit themselves referred to the feeding ofguests and showering them with furs (or blankets) asgiving them physical strength (latseen) and warmingthem by covering them up (Olson 1967:19). Theseimages were appropriate, since the hosts were, infact, reciprocating the guests’ earlier efforts to‘‘warm’’ their ‘‘inside’’ and to ‘‘give it strength.’’Thus, the spiritual comfort was exchanged for thephysical comfort and strength. Feeding the guestswas an effective way of demonstrating one’s feelingstoward them, since gifts of food were a standardform of exchange between affines. Gifts bestowedon a person by his or her paternal/affinal kin outsidethe potlatch were also referred to as ‘‘blankets’’(McClellan 1975:638). The special nature of thesegifts as expressions of the hosts’ ‘‘love and respect’’for the guests was emphasized by physical contact.As mentioned above, gifts were rubbed on thedonors’ foreheads or wrapped around them, thusabsorbing part of the donors’ selves. This quality ofthe potlatch gift was well understood by Mauss(1967:10; cf. Walens 1981:80).Feeding the guests and giving them gifts was alsoan expression of the hosts’ generosity. No objectgiven could be refused, since its spiritual essencebelonged to the dead. To refuse meant to ‘‘closethe door to the land of the dead’’ (Olson 1967:66),that is, to disrupt the reciprocity between the livingand their ancestors. Thus, food and gifts linked thefour categories of the potlatch participants: thehosts, the guests, and the deceased matrikin ofeach. To this day, the favorite food of the hosts’deceased clansmen is served in the potlatch. Someof it, specially marked as belonging to the dead, isput in dishes calledgan kas’ı ́x’i(orx’aan kas’ı ́x’i) (firedish) and given to close paternal/affinal relatives ofthe deceased hosts. The donor announces theirnames as well as those of the guests who receivedthe dishes. In the past some of this food was burned,Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 296The Nineteenth-Century Tlingit Potlatch: A New Perspective296"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"but today all of it is consumed by the recipients (Kan1979–84; Worl 1984).The symbolism of the animal skins and furs, aswell as the blankets that replaced them as primarypotlatch gifts by the end of last century, also pointedto a special relationship between the living and thedead. The act of giving them was called to ‘‘dress theguests’’ (Emmons 1920–45, Shukoff’s Account:9) orto ‘‘put on something,’’ and it elicited statements ofgratitude from the guests, who thanked the hosts for‘‘warming’’ them (Olson 1967:65).22It is possiblethat originally furs and blankets were actually placedon the guests, as is still done by the Koyukon Atha-bascans (distant relatives of the Tlingit), in theirmemorial rites. Among them, the guests who repre-sent the dead are dressed by the mourners/hosts onthe last day of the potlatch and their departure isdescribed as the dead leaving their relatives forever(Carlo 1978:67).The potlatch gifts and food had other meaningsappropriated by the hosts in their efforts to raisetheir rank, status, and prestige. In Tlingit society,presenting a person with a gift was not necessarily anact of ‘‘love and respect.’’ It could also be a request fora larger return gift as well as a way of placing therecipient in an inferior position vis-a`-vis the donor (cf.Oberg 1973:99).23Challenged by their hosts’ gener-osity, the guests tried to match or exceed it in theirown potlatch, in which the former acted as guests.Another message carried by potlatch gifts was thedonors’ success in subsistence activities, which re-flected their skills and magical power. Thus,according to one of Emmons’ informants, a chiefhost might sometimes boast of his hunting achieve-ments and the wealth that they had brought him(1920– 45, Shukoff’s Account:8–9).The hosts tried to create the impression of anendless supply of food, including forcing on theguests more than they could consume. The latterwere expected to overeat and vomit, and then weregiven additional gifts for their ‘‘suffering.’’ If nobodyvomited, it spoke badly about the hosts and theirfood (1920 – 45, Shukoff’s Account: 8–9).24Finally,the practice of providing the guests with extra foodto take home served as a reminder of the hosts’generosity and power long after the end of theceremony.Similar to potlatches in neighboring coastal soci-eties, the Tlingit potlatch involved several types ofgifts, some of them reserved for the aristocracy (cf.Goldman 1975:136–7). Along the entire NorthwestCoast, slaves and copper sheets (‘‘coppers,’’ Tlingittinna) were the most valuable, their symbolism simi-lar but not identical to that of other ritual prestations.Both slaves and coppers were brought from the‘‘outside,’’ the former through warfare with theneighbors to the south, the latter through tradewith the interior Athabascans and later with Euro-peans (Keithahn 1963b). Their acquisition and distri-bution were controlled by the aristocracy. Neitherslaves nor coppers were used for utilitarian purposes,since the former were purchased just before thepotlatch and did not do any work (Oberg1973:116) and the latter were reserved exclusivelyfor ceremonial exchanges. Slaves, like other gifts,were placed in physical contact with the hosts’ crests:they were killed with a special club depicting theirmaster’s crest, or held a rope tied to a headdressowned by their master (Olson 1967:63). The freeingof slaves, which increased in the postcontact perioddue to European pressure, was equivalent to killingthem, since both acts made them socially dead (freedslaves had to leave their owner’s community; cf.Goldman 1975:54). The slaves sacrificed in the pot-latch became the servants of the hosts’ matrilinealancestors, while those given away became the guests’property. The spirits of the latter most likely becamethe property of the dead as well.Coppers were the most expensive gifts, theirvalue measured in several slaves. Like aristocrats,they were described as being ‘‘heavy,’’ ‘‘hard,’’ and‘‘shiny.’’ They were the most high-priced gifts ex-changed between the families of a bride and groom.Several myths described coppers as ‘‘everlastingliving things’’ and their origin was associated withthe sun (Swanton 1909:252–62). They often hadtheir owner’s crest depicted on their surface, andeach copper had a central ‘‘T’’ cross segment calledthe ‘‘backbone’’ (Keithahn 1963b:59; Olson 1933–54, notebook 10:34). Coppers were usuallydrowned rather than thrown in the fire and, likehuman bones, were ‘‘heavy,’’ indestructible, andcontained their owner’s spiritual essence (Billman1964:59). Coppers and slaves were the only giftsRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 297Sergei Kan297"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"requiring a return presentation of equal or greatervalue (Olson 1967:66 –7). Ultimately these twocategories of potlatch gifts represented the aristo-crats’ control over life and death, since the lattercould either kill them or give them away, that is,‘‘spare their lives.’’25The discussion of the symbolism of the variousforms of the potlatch exchange shows that songs,dances, and speeches, as well as food and gifts, servedas a code for communication between hosts andguests. The various messages sent repeated the themesof competition and cooperation that, as I have demon-strated, characterized the entire potlatch. These vari-ous forms of symbolic media allowed the participants(particularly hosts) to mask assertions of superiorityand make them appear to be statements about ‘‘loveand respect.’’ At the same time, they served as aes-thetically powerful forms for expressing gratitude andother emotions that strengthened the cooperation andharmony among the participants.ConclusionIn this analysis of the symbolism as well as thesociology of the Tlingit potlatch, I have demon-strated its internal symbolic logic and linked it tovarious symbolic premises in other aspects of theTlingit sociocultural order.The study clearly shows the key role played by thedead in the Tlingit potlatch, both as participants and asa source of sacred values, an ideology used by theliving to explain and justify their behavior.26Thepotlatch periodically imposed order on the flow ofsocial life, and provided temporary agreement amongmembers of society about their relationships and theirrelative positions in a social hierarchy. The ritual wascharacterized by a dialectical relationship betweencompetition and cooperation, which both united anddifferentiated its participants.Beliefs about the dead and the desire to honor andemulate them both encouraged and limited compe-tition, and reconciled such contradictory ideologicalprinciples as matrilineal solidarity and social hier-archy, and cooperation between affines and inter-moiety competition. It also prevented conflictsgenerated by the social praxis from underminingthe fundamental cultural values and structural prin-ciples. The ability of the potlatch to serve as the keylink between the ‘‘thought-of’’ and the ‘‘lived-in’’sociocultural order explains its centrality in 19th-century Tlingit life, as well as its survival into thepresent, despite years of criticism from missionariesand government officials and significant changes inthe native culture and society.The potlatch could not have played this centralrole in Tlingit life if it did not have a strong emo-tional effect on its participants. Although the dataavailable on the 19th-century potlatch is insufficientfor a detailed analysis of this aspect of the ritual,some existing accounts and information derivedfrom current potlatches indicate that such powerfulemotions as grief, joy, love, and so forth were asignificant part of the participants’ experience. Justas competition and cooperation existed in a dialect-ical relationship, so did positive and negative emo-tions. By wearing the regalia of their ancestors,performing their songs and dances, and giving andconsuming objects created through hard work, theactors experienced fundamental cultural values aspersonally held orientations.I suggest that the analysis presented here could beapplied to other Northwest Coast potlatches andceremonies, and that the role of the dead in themhas, so far, been neglected or underestimated. Aconsiderable amount of data on the Kwakiutl, Tsim-shian, Haida, Bella Coola, and other potlatches couldbe used to generate more holistic interpretations.27Much work remains to be done and we are fortunatethat, despite the loss of some of their ‘‘religious’’aspects, present-day Northwest Coast potlatches are‘‘alive and well,’’ still linking the living and the deadthrough various forms of ceremonial exchange andstrong emotional bonds (cf. Holm 1977; Kenyon1977; Blackman 1977; Stearns 1977; Miller 1984;Seguin 1985).NOTES1The category ‘‘potlatch’’ is a creation of Europeans(including anthropologists). As Goldman points out ina discussion of Kwakiutl ceremonialism (1975: 131),‘‘There never were, at least in precontact days, suchevents as ‘potlatches.’ Rather, there were specificRobben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 298The Nineteenth-Century Tlingit Potlatch: A New Perspective298"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"ritual occasions commemorating marriage, death,the construction of a house, investiture of an heir,’’and so forth. However, since many Northwest Coastceremonies did share basic features, and because theIndians themselves have incorporated the term ‘‘pot-latch’’ into their vocabulary, I will use it in this paper.2For a detailed reconstruction of the 19th-centuryTlingit funeral see Kan (1982:156–266). The bestaccounts of this ritual are by Emmons (1920– 45,ch. 6:14 –25), Olson (1967:58–66), and de Laguna(1972:531– 47), although all of them focus on thefunerals of aristocratic males. However, for the pur-pose of my study, these are the most important rites,since they were the most elaborate and served as themodel for those of the rest of the population. Thisexplains the use of the male pronoun in my paper.3The origin and evolution of Tlingit mortuary architec-ture is a complex issue that has not been fully resolvedyet. See Keithahn (1963a), de Laguna (1972:539–45),and Kan (1982:184 –7, 1985).4A structural analysis of the Tlingit model of the world(Kan 1978; 1982:163–71) revealed the centrality ofthe ‘‘inside’’/‘‘outside’’ opposition. The ‘‘inside’’ wasusually positively marked and associated with theTlingit people, the village, the warmth of the fire,dryness, abundance of food, and so forth. The ‘‘out-side’’ was associated with the non-Tlingit, the danger-ous domains of the forest and the sea, cold, wetness,famine, and so on. The Tlingit had to venture into the‘‘outside’’ to obtain wealth and superhuman power,but preferred to return to the safety of the ‘‘inside.’’5‘‘Heaviness’’ was also associated with aristocraticstatus, moral righteousness, and sacredness (Kan1982:48–51, 98–115).6There is some evidence that the person’s ‘‘inside’’(spiritual attributes and bones) was provided by mater-nal ancestors, while the ‘‘outside’’ (for example, facialfeatures) by the maternal as well as the paternal ones.7The data on Tlingit beliefs about noncorporealattributes of the human being is sketchy and contra-dictory. In addition to the three major spiritual entitiesalready mentioned, there were others, such as thebreath, the toowu ́(mind, feelings, thoughts), and aspirit that reincarnated in a matrilineal descendant ofthe deceased (Kan 1982:59–71); see also de Laguna(1972:758–71) and Emmons (1920– 45: ch. 6).8According to Emmons (1916:17), the most importantpainting on the face of the deceased was the crest of hismoiety. This suggests that in death the Tlingit roseabove lineage and clan identity, and returned to primaryaffiliation with the moiety. This paralleled the journey9of the spirit of the deceased back in space (toward theinterior) and in time (retracing the route followed bythe ancestors said to have migrated from the interiordown to the coast).9The mourners’ behavior was also believed to affecttheir future. If they followed all the rules, they were tobecome wealthy and live longer. This was the ‘‘posi-tive aspect of liminality’’ discussed by Turner (1967).10Cf. Hertz 1960; Huntington and Metcalf 1979:93–118; and Weiner 1976:85–6 on the emphasis on ‘‘lifevalues’’ in death-related rituals.11The Tlingit treatment of the remains of the deadbears a special resemblance to those of such northernAthabascan groups as the Carrier (Jenness 1943:534)and the Kutchin (Hardisty 1866:319), who wereprobably their distant relatives.12This sketch of the Tlingit potlatch is based on Swan-ton (1908:434 – 43), Olson (1967:58–69), McClel-lan (1954), de Laguna (1972:606–51), and Kan(1979–84, 1982:268–79).13Goldman (1975:245) presented linguistic evidencefrom Kwakiutl suggesting a similar concept: the verbyaxwede(to give away property) is related toyaq(tolie down, dead body), andyaqwe(to be beaten, to liedead).14If it could not be completed before sunrise, theparticipants had to sing a special song that asked theRaven to allow them to go on.15Several recent symbolic analyses of Tsimshian andKwakiutl cultures suggested that the people weregiven to eternal names, rather than the other wayaround, because ‘‘the name is an institution or thesoul of a corporation that exists forever’’ (Miller1984:29; cf. Goldman 1975:37; Walens 1981:65;Halpin 1984; Seguin 1984:114 –15).16Goldman came to a similar conclusion in his analysisof the relationship between the living and the dead inKwakiutl culture (1975:197).17McClellan was the first to note the ‘‘strong stress onsymbolized warfare’’ in the Tlingit potlatch(1954:96).18In the case of the ChilkatGaanax.a ́di, their spouseswere selected from the Chilkat Dakl’ aweidı ́andother clans and subclans, both local and nonlocal.19I do not know yet whether this practice became morepopular in this century, with the strengthening of tieswithin the nuclear family, or whether my predeces-sors simply failed to report it fully. In any case, thisreversal of the flow of the potlatch wealth is aninteresting new dimension of the Tlingit potlatchthat has not received sufficient attention.Robben / Death, Mourning and BurialFinal Proof25.9.20044:20ampage 299Sergei Kan299"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"20This explains why ‘‘love songs’’ were used during theceremonies that reestablished peace between groupsbelonging to the opposite moieties.21The work of Goldman (1975), Walens (1981), andSeguin (1984, 1985) has finally addressed the issue ofthe symbolism of the potlatch gifts.22Cf. the guests’ use of pieces of blankets and clothreceived at potlatches to make clothing.23Cf. Walens’ interpretation of the Kwakiutl foodgiver as superordinate and the food receiver as sub-ordinate (1981:80ff.).24Walens’ analysis of the symbolism of vomiting in Kwa-kiutl culture might be applicable to the Tlingit potlatch(1981:16–17). According to him, vomit, like fire, doesnot destroy, but transubstantiates, and is thus a para-digm of transformation and rebirth. If the Tlingitguests, like the Kwakiutl, vomited into the fire, thefood thus returned could immediately reach the dead.25The data on coppers from other Northwest Coastcultures is more extensive than the Tlingit material.Goldman (1975 passim) suggests that Kwakiutlcoppers were associated with blood, salmon, sun,and fire. Coppers had the shape of a human torso andwere carried like children. They died and werereborn like human beings. The most honorable wayto kill a copper was to dismember it (Walens1981:148–9). Goldman calls it an ‘‘overloaded andhence elusive symbol,’’ which synthesized all formsand realms of life (1975:225). The most remarkablewas an association between coppers and bones of thedead chief of the host group, mentioned in severalaccounts of the Kwakiutl (Drucker and Heizer1967:137), Tsimshian (Garfield 1939:238), andBella Coola (McIlwraith 1948:252) potlatches.26Cf. Weiner’s (1976:56) discussion of the role of thedead in the Trobriand system of ceremonial exchange.27Many aspects of the potlatch that continue to puzzleanthropologists might be understood if their symbol-ism was examined within the context of the broadersociocultural order. Thus, the famous destruction ofwealth in the late 19th-century Kwakiutl potlatchmight have had its roots in an effort to supply theancestors with food and gifts (cf. Piddocke1965:257; Wike 1952).REFERENCESAdams, John W., 1973 The Gitksan Potlatch: PopulationFlux, Resource Ownership and Reciprocity. Toronto:Holt, Rinehart & Winston.Adams, John W., and Alice B.

These goals may be contradictory, sometimesonly quasi-intentional; they can include makingpolicy, justifying actions taken, claiming authorityand disputing the authority claims of others, andcreating or manipulating the cultural categorieswithin which all of those activities are pursued.Politics is not restricted to the actions of politicalleaders but can be engaged in by anyone, althoughsuch actors often seek to present their goals as insome sensepublicones.1That is, some of the work ofpolitics consists of making claims that create an issueas a ‘‘public’’ issue. Political actors pursue theiractivities in arenas both large and small, public andprivate; the overlap and interference of the arenasshape what goes on in any one of them. Becausehuman activity nearly always has affective and mean-ingful dimensions and takes place through complexsymbolic processes, I also view politics as a realm ofcontinual struggles over meanings, or signification.Therefore, I stress those aspects in my discussion,and I find dead bodies a particularly good vehicle fordoing so.Politics happens in contexts. Because the contextof postsocialist politics is unusually momentous, Ipreface my discussion with a brief sketch of what Ithink it is. I start with the assumption that for the lasttwo decades or so, we have been both creating andliving through an epochal shift in the global economy.Among its elements is a change in the operation ofcapitalism, responding to a global recession evidentas of the early 1970s. A large literature, beyond mypurposes here, has arisen around this transform-ation. Sometimes called a change to ‘‘flexible spe-cialization,’’2it has produced a massive shift in thetectonic plates of the world economy; one sign ofthat was the 1989 collapse of Communist Party rulein Eastern Europe, and soon thereafter in the SovietFrom Katherine Verdery, ‘‘Dead Bodies Animate the Study of Politics,’’ inThe Political Lives of Dead Bodies: Reburial and Postsocialist Change(NewYork: Columbia University Press, 1999).Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:21am page 303303"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Union. I have suggested elsewhere how I think thathappened, underscoring processes internal to theSoviet system that connected it more fully withinternational capital flows and, as a result, alteredboth the form of socialist political economies andtheir place in global capitalism.3Although I am not alone in seeing the postsocialisttransformation in such earthshaking terms, my viewis far from universal. Some observers find increasingevidence that as the dust from 1989 settles, persist-ent continuities with the socialist order are at least asstriking as disruptions of it. The centralized economyand socialist property rights, in particular, haveproved highly resistant to change. Nevertheless,much of what set socialism most clearly apart fromother forms of political economy was wholly com-promised after 1989: the Communist Party’s relativemonopoly over the formal political sphere, thedegree of central control over the budget and overeconomic redistribution, the mechanisms that sus-tained socialist property as the dominant form, andthe illusion of the party-state’s omnipotence(brought into question by Poland’s Solidarity in1980 but smashed altogether in 1989). Even ifsome of these features continue in postsocialist soci-eties, they no longer index the distinctive cluster ofinstitutions that was ‘‘actually existing socialism.’’Moreover, the context in which those featuresoperate has changed. The various barriers that so-cialism had fumblingly erected no longer insulate itfrom the ‘‘outside.’’ Global capitalism exerts itspressure particularly against the institutions bywhich socialism defined itself as noncapitalist, suchas party and state forms, property arrangements, andopenness to market forces. Although the results ofoutside pressure will not necessarily be ‘‘transitionsto capitalism,’’ the context in which we should assesspostsocialism’s emerging forms is – far more thanbefore – the international one of global capital flows.When I speak of a shift in the world’s ‘‘tectonicplates,’’ then, I do not mean that a plate called‘‘socialism’’ has buckled before one called ‘‘capital-ism’’; I mean, rather, that an alteration in the entiresystem of plate movements compels us to reconsiderthe dynamics in any one part of it. For the postso-cialist part, those dynamics affect the full gamut ofpoliticoeconomic and sociocultural life.Where do dead bodies figure in this? I believe theyoffer us some purchase on the cultural dimension, inthe anthropological sense, of postsocialist politics.(By this I do not mean the so-called concept ofpolitical culture, as underspecified as it is over-used.4) They help us to see political transformationas something more than a technical process – ofintroducing democratic procedures and methods ofelectioneering, of forming political parties and non-governmental organizations, and so on. The ‘‘some-thing more’’ includes meanings, feelings, the sacred,ideas of morality, the nonrational – all ingredients of‘‘legitimacy’’ or ‘‘regime consolidation’’ (that dryphrase), yet far broader than what analysesemploying those terms usually provide. Throughdead bodies, I hope to show how we might thinkabout politics, both as strategies and maneuveringand also as activity occurring within cultural systems.Hinted at in my wording is a view similar to MaxWeber’s: that the pursuit of meaning is at the heart ofhuman activity, and that social analysis aims to under-stand meanings rather than to explain causes. In hiswork, Weber described some overarching processeshe believed characteristic of modernity, such as ra-tionalization, secularization, and the ‘‘disenchant-ment’’ of the world. In hands other than his,however, such concepts have tended to desiccatehow politics is treated. I prefer, in examining post-socialist politics, to speak instead of itsenchantment,so as to enliven politics with a richer sense of what itmight consist of.5In speaking of enchantment or enlivening, I havetwo related things in mind. The first is an analyticone: I hope to show how we might animate the studyofpolitics in general, energizing it with somethingmore than the opinion polls, surveys, analyses of‘‘democratization indices,’’ and game-theoretic for-mulations that dominate so much of the field ofcomparative politics.6Where else, I ask, might welook for ‘‘politics,’’ in perhaps unexpected places thatarrest the imagination? The second sense is a descrip-tive one, concerning the specific forms that politicalaction is taking in the postsocialist world. Do we findthere the ritual murders, pyramid schemes, andimages of zombies and clandestinely circulatingbody parts described, for example, by Jean andJohn Comaroff in their work on postapartheidRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:21am page 304Dead Bodies Animate the Study of Politics304"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"South Africa?7Perhaps not, but we do find UFOmovements in Armenia, invocations of the devil as asource of wealth in Transylvania, and radio-basedmass hypnotism in Russia.8My two senses of en-chantment (the analytic and the descriptive) areinterconnected: we more easily broaden our concep-tion of ‘‘the political’’ in the face of empirical sur-prises like those.The analytic and descriptive senses are also, how-ever, importantly distinct. In trying to animate orenchant the study of politics, I am not saying thatsecular socialism dried out a politics that must nowbe reinfused with meaning (or even ‘‘reborn,’’ assome would have it9). To the contrary: communistparties strove continually, as Jowitt has argued, toestablish their sacrality and charisma.10Rather, I amprotesting that perhaps from too much rationalchoice theory, our standard conception of ‘‘the pol-itical’’ has become narrow and flat. Therefore, Ipropose turning things around: instead of seeingnationalism, for instance, in the usual way – as amatter of territorial borders, state-making, ‘‘con-structionism,’’ or resource competition – I see it aspart of kinship, spirits, ancestor worship, and thecirculation of cultural treasures. Rather than speak oflegitimacy, I speak of reordering the meaningfuluniverse. I present the politics of corpses as beingless about legitimating new governments (though itcan be that, too) than about cosmologies and prac-tices relating the living and the dead. And I see therewriting of history that is obviously central to dead-body politics as part of a larger process wherebyfundamental changes are occurring in conceptionsof time itself. These are the kinds of things I meanwhen I speak of analytically enlivening or enchantingpolitics.11Investigating the political lives of dead bodies,then, enriches our sense of the political while pro-viding a window onto its specific forms in the trans-formation of socialism. The rest of this book offerssome examples of how such an analysis might pro-ceed. A number of themes contribute to the en-livened sense of politics that I am advocating, andmost of this chapter is devoted to discussing them.Before I continue, however, I believe I must raise adifficult question, albeit with only tentative answers:Why dead bodies? What is it about a corpse thatseems to invite its use in politics, especially inmoments of major transformation?Why Dead Bodies?To ask this question exposes one to a flourishingliterature on ‘‘the body,’’ much of it inspired byfeminist theory and philosophy,12as well as poten-tially to poststructuralist theories about language and‘‘floating signifiers.’’ I will not take up the challengeof this literature here but will limit myself instead tosome observations about bodies as symbolic vehiclesthat I think illuminate their presence in postsocialistpolitics.13Bones and corpses, coffins and cremation urns,are material objects. Most of the time, they areindisputablythere, as our senses of sight, touch, andsmell can confirm. As such, a body’s materiality canbe critical to its symbolic efficacy: unlike notionssuch as ‘‘patriotism’’ or ‘‘civil society,’’ for instance, acorpse can be moved around, displayed, and stra-tegically located in specific places. Bodies have theadvantage of concreteness that nonetheless tran-scends time, making past immediately present.Their ‘‘thereness’’ undergirded the founding andcontinuity of medieval monasteries, providing tan-gible evidence of a monastery’s property right todonated lands.14That is, their corporeality makesthem important means oflocalizinga claim (some-thing they still do today, as I suggest in chapter 3).They state unequivocally, as Peter Brown notes, ‘‘Hiclocus est.’’15This quality also grounded their value asrelics.The example of relics, however, immediatelycomplicates arguments based on the body’s materi-ality: if one added together all the relics of St. Francisof Assisi, for instance, one would get rather morethan the material remains of one dead man. So it isnot a relic’s actual derivation from a specific bodythat makes it effective but people’s belief in thatderivation. In short, the significance of corpses hasless to do with their concreteness than with howpeople think about them. A dead body is meaningfulnot in itself but through culturally established rela-tions to death and through the way a specific deadperson’s importance is (variously) construed.16Therefore, I turn to the properties of corpses thatRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:21am page 305Katherine Verdery305"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"make them, in Le ́vi-Strauss’s words, ‘‘good to think’’as symbols.Bodies – especially those of political leaders –have served in many times and places worldwide assymbols of political order. Literature in both histori-ography and anthropology is rife with instances of aking’s death calling into question the survival of thepolity. More generally, political transformation isoften symbolized through manipulating bodies (cut-ting off the head of the king, removing communistleaders from mausoleums). We, too, exhibit thisconception, in idioms such as ‘‘the body politic.’’A body’s symbolic effectiveness does not dependon its standing for one particular thing, however, foramong the most important properties of bodies,especially dead ones, is their ambiguity, multivocal-ity, or polysemy. Remains are concrete, yet protean;they do not have a single meaning but are open tomany different readings. Because corpses suggest thelived lives of complex human beings, they can beevaluated from many angles and assigned perhapscontradictory virtues, vices, and intentions. Whilealive, these bodies produced complex behaviors sub-ject to much debate that produces further ambiguity.As with all human beings, one’s assessment of themdepends on one’s disposition, the context one placesthem in (brave or cowardly compared with whom,for instance), the selection one makes from theirbehaviors in order to outline their ‘‘story,’’ and soon. Dead people come with a curriculum vitae orre ́sume ́– several possible re ́sume ́s, depending onwhich aspect of their life is being considered. Theylend themselves to analogy withother people’sre ́-sume ́s. That is, they encourage identification withtheir life story, from several possible vantage points.Their complexity makes it fairly easy to discerndifferent sets of emphasis, extract different stories,and thus rewrite history. Dead bodies have anothergreat advantage as symbols: they don’t talk much ontheir own (though they did once). Words can be putinto their mouths – often quite ambiguous words –or their own actual words can be ambiguated byquoting them out of context. It is thus easier torewrite history with dead people than with otherkinds of symbols that are speechless.Yet because they have a single name and a singlebody, they present the illusion of havingonly onesignificance. Fortifying that illusion is their material-ity, which implies their having a single meaning thatis solidly ‘‘grounded,’’ even though in fact they haveno such single meaning. Different people can invokecorpses as symbols, thinking those corpses mean thesame thing to all present, whereas in fact they maymean different things to each. All that is shared iseveryone’srecognitionof this dead person as somehowimportant. In other words, what gives a dead bodysymbolic effectiveness in politics is precisely its am-biguity, its capacity to evoke a variety of understand-ings.17Let me give an example.On June 16, 1989, a quarter of a million Hungar-ians assembled in downtown Budapest for the re-burial of Imre Nagy, Hungary’s communist primeminister at the time of the 1956 revolution.18For hisattempts to reform socialism he had been hanged in1958, along with four members of his government,and buried with them in unmarked graves, withoutcoffins, facedown. From the Hungarian point ofview, this is a pretty ignominious end.19Yet nowhe and those executed with him were reburied,faceup in coffins, with full honors and with tens ofthousands in attendance. Anyone watching Hungar-ian television on that June 16 would have seen ahuge, solemn festivity, carefully orchestrated, withmany foreign dignitaries as well as three CommunistParty leaders standing near the coffins (the Com-munist Party of Hungary had not yet itself become acorpse). The occasion definitely looked official (infact it was organized privately), and it rewrote thehistory – given only one official meaning for fortyyears – of Nagy’s relation to the Hungarian people.20Although the media presented a unified image ofhim, there was no consensus on what Nagy’s re-buried corpse in fact meant. Susan Gal, analyzingthe political rhetoric around the event, finds fivedistinct clusters of imagery, some of it associatedwith specific political parties or groups:21(1) nation-alist images emphasizing national unity around a heroof the nation (nationalist parties soon found thesevery handy); (2) religious images (which could becombined with the nationalist ones) emphasizingrebirth, reconciliation, and forgiveness, and present-ing Nagy as a martyr rather than a hero; (3) variousimages of him as a communist, as the first reformcommunist, and as a true man of the people, hisRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:21am page 306Dead Bodies Animate the Study of Politics306"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"reburial symbolizing the triumph of a humane social-ist option and the death of a cruel Stalinist one; (4)generational images, presenting him as the symbol ofthe younger generation whose life chances had beenlost with his execution (this group would soonbecome the Party of Young Democrats); and (5)images associated with the ideas of truth, conscience,and rehabilitation, so that his reburial signifiedclearing one’s name and telling the story of one’spersecution – an opportunity to rewrite one’s per-sonal history. (That some people presented com-munist Prime Minister Nagy as ananti-communisthero shows just how complex his significances couldbe.)Perhaps attendance at Nagy’s funeral was so large,then, because he brought together diverse segmentsof the population, all resonating differently to vari-ous aspects of his life. And perhaps so many politicalformations were able to participate because all couldlegitimate a claim of some kind through him, eventhough the claims themselves varied greatly.22This,it seems to me, is the mark of a good politicalsymbol: it has legitimating effects not because every-one agrees on its meaning but because it compelsinterestdespite(because of?) divergent views of whatit means.Aside from their evident materiality and theirsurfeit of ambiguity, dead bodies have an additionaladvantage as symbols: they evoke the awe, uncer-tainty, and fear associated with ‘‘cosmic’’ concerns,such as the meaning of life and death.23For humanbeings, death is the quintessential cosmic issue, onethat brings us all face to face with ultimate questionsabout what it means to be – and to stop being –human, about where we have come from and wherewe are going. For this reason, corpses lend them-selves particularly well to politics in times of majorupheaval, such as the postsocialist period. The re-vised status of religious institutions in postsocialistEastern Europe reinforces that connection, for reli-gions have long specialized in dealing with ultimatequestions. Moreover, religions monopolize the prac-tices associated with death, including both formalnotions of burial and the ‘‘folk superstitions’’ that allthe major faiths so skillfully integrated into theirrituals. Except in the socialist period, East Europeansover two millennia have associated death with reli-gious practices. A religious reburial nourishes thedead person both with these religious associationsand with the rejection of ‘‘atheist’’ communism.Politics around a reburied corpse thus benefitsfrom the aura of sanctity the corpse is presumed tobear, and from the implicit suggestion that a reburial(re)sacralizes the political order represented bythose who carry it out.Their sacred associations contribute to anotherquality of dead bodies as symbols: their connectionwith affect, a significant problem for social analysis.Anthropologists have long asked, Wherein lies theefficacy of symbols? How do they engage emo-tions?24The same question troubles other socialsciences as well: Why do some things and not otherswork emotionally in the political realm? It is askedparticularly about symbols used to evoke nationalidentifications; Benedict Anderson, for instance, in-quires why national meanings command such deepemotional responses and why people are ‘‘ready todie for these inventions.’’25The link of dead bodiesto the sacred and the cosmic – to the feelings of awearoused by contact with death – seems clearly part oftheir symbolic efficacy.One might imagine that another affective dimen-sion to corpses is their being not just any old symbol:unlike a tomato can or a dead bird, they were oncehuman beings with lives that are to be valued. Theyare heavy symbols because people cared about themwhen they were alive, and identify with them. Thisexplanation works best for contemporary deaths,such as the Yugoslav ones I discuss in chapter 3.Many political corpses, however, were known andloved in life by only a small circle of people; or – likeSerbia’s Prince Lazar or Romania’s bishop InochentieMicu (whose case I examine in the next chapter) –they lived so long ago that any feelings they arousecan have nothing to do with them as loved individ-uals. Therefore I find it insufficient to explain theiremotional efficacy merely by their having beenhuman beings.Perhaps more to the point is their ineluctable self-referentiality as symbols: because all people havebodies, any manipulation of a corpse directly enablesone’s identification with it through one’s own body,thereby tapping into one’s reservoirs of feeling. Inaddition (or as a result), such manipulations mayRobben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:21am page 307Katherine Verdery307"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"mobilize preexisting affect by evoking one’s ownpersonal losses or one’s identification with specificaspects of the dead person’s biography. This possibil-ity increases wherever national ideologies emphasizeideas about suffering and victimhood, as do nearly allin Eastern Europe.26These kinds of emotionaleffects are likely enhanced when death’s ‘‘ultimatequestions,’’ fear, awe, and personal identifications areexperienced in public settings – for example, massreburials like those of Imre Nagy or the Yugoslavskeletons from World War II.Finally, I believe the strong affective dimension ofdead-body politics also stems from ideas about kin-ship and proper burial. Kinship notions are powerfulorganizers of feeling in all human societies; othersocial forms (such as national ideologies) that harnesskinship idioms profit from their power. Ideas aboutproper burial often tie kinship to cosmic questionsconcerning order in the universe, as well. I willfurther elaborate on this suggestion later in thischapter and in chapter 3.Dead bodies, I have argued, have properties thatmake them particularly effective political symbols.They are thus excellent means for accumulatingsomething essential to political transformation: sym-bolic capital.27(Given the shortage of investmentcapital in postsocialist countries and the difficulties ofeconomic reform, perhaps the symbolic variety takeson special significance!) The fall of communistparties devalued much of what had served as politicalor symbolic capital, opening a wide field for compe-tition in which success depends on finding and accu-mulating new capital resources. Dead bodies, inshort, can be a site of political profit. In saying this,I am partly talking about the process of establishingpolitical legitimacy, but by emphasizing symboliccapital I mean to keep at the forefront of my discus-sion the symbolic elements of that process.NOTES1 My thanks to Fay Cook and Laura Stoker for twostimulating conversations about ‘‘politics.’’2 See, e.g., Harvey 1989.3 See Verdery 1996: ch. 1. I will not take up here themany questions my phrasing points to – such aswhether there is such a thing as ‘‘capitalism,’’whether ‘‘socialist’’ systems were a form of statecapitalism or something sui generis, etc.4 Nor do I mean the concept of ‘‘framing,’’ with whichsome political scientists think to bring in culture byshowing how politicians package something so it sells(e.g., Snowet al. 1986; Snow and Benford 1992).I borrow my phrasing from Doug McAdam,whom I thank for his assistance with this paragraph.5 I am indebted to conversations with Fay Cook, LynnHunt, and Kirstie McClure that helped me to see thisas my goal.6 For a similar critique, see Karl 1990.

One might too easily read ‘‘enchant’’ toimply fairy tales and magic; although in postsocialismwe indeed find some of that, I have in mind somethinga bit more down-to-earth.12 See, e.g., Butler 1990, 1993; Bynum 1995a, 1995b;Scarry 1985.13 My thanks to Istva ́nRe ́v, Laura Stoker, and Dorotheavon Mu ̈cke for stimulating my thoughts on this ques-tion.Jean and John Comaroff (personal communication)offer a different answer to the ‘‘Why dead bodies?’’question from the one I present here. They suggestthat changes in the global economy have made thebody(as rawlabor power)the onlysalablecommoditythat everyone has, and that advances in the process ofits commodification (the sale of organs and sexualservices, the marketing of smiles, etc.) place it at theforefront of capitalist development.14 Istva ́nRe ́v employs this argument in his discussion ofthe ‘‘Why dead bodies’’ question (the work is inprogress under the titleCovering History). I am grate-ful to him for sharing it with me.15 Brown 1981:86.16 This is not to say that such ‘‘construals’’ are uncon-strained. Efforts to grapple with the problem of whatimpedes the complete invention of pasts includethose of Michel-Rolph Trouillot in his bookSilencingthe Past(1995) and (quite differently) of Milan Kun-dera, inThe Book of Laughter and Forgetting(1980).Robben / Death, Mourning and Burial Final Proof 25.9.2004 4:21am page 308Dead Bodies Animate the Study of Politics308"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Both see checks on invention as coming from thematerialityof certain objects and processes.

I claim onlythat corpses are particularly effective in politics be-cause they embody the properties unusually well.18 My account draws on those of Gal 1989, 1998; Re ́v1995; and Bruszt and Stark 1992.19 Barber (1988:49) observes, however, that peoplemay bury a corpse facedown when they fear it isdangerous; this posture will make the corpse burrowfurther into the earth rather than emerge from hisgrave.20 The initiative for Nagy’s reburial did not come fromofficial circles, but from the Hungarian diaspora(who had organized an anniversary in Paris the yearbefore) and from the families of Nagy and othershanged with him or purged later. The families hadrepeatedly sought official permission but were putoff. At length the Hungarian government agreed to asmall family burial, then (under pressure) to a non-official public funeral; from that point on, the gov-ernment had nothing to do with the arrangements.By the time of the funeral, however, the Party lead-ership was so divided and its position in society socompromised that they asked to be included! Theinitiating families at first refused, then finally agreedthat three officials could attend as private persons;they would be excluded from the private familyburial that followed the public gathering. For thosewho would see Nagy’s reburial as a political effort tobuild legitimacy for the communist regime, I notethat it should, rather, be seen as crucial to the Party’sdownfall (see Re ́v 1995:24; Bruszt and Stark1992:40).21 Gal 1989:8–9.22 For a book-length study of comparable funeral polit-ics in South Africa, see Garrey Dennie’s fascinatingdissertation (Dennie 1996).23 These cosmic associations contribute to the well-known ethnological fact that death rituals are theslowest of all practices to change (Barber 1988:48;Brown 1981:24; Kligman 1988). Their stability, inturn, makes them good instruments for nationalistswho – as sometimes happens with new regimes –want to reaffirm a connection with or return to‘‘older’’ national ‘‘traditions.’’ Claims of that kindhave been rampant in building anticommunist iden-tities since 1989.
