At one point a dog started to bark inthe distance and I observed that it seemed a fact of experience that the dog wasoutside, separate and at a distance from myself.Francis said to me, “Shut your eyes and place your hands on the carpet.” Iplaced my hands on the carpet and he asked, “Now where does that sensation takeplace?” That was all he said.At that moment it suddenly became clear that the sensation of the carpet wasinside me, that is, inside this perceiving consciousness, appearing in exactlythe same place as my thoughts and bodily sensations.On opening my eyes the carpet appeared to be outside again. However, I reasonedthat the carpet was only one thing. As a sensation it seemed to be inside but asa visual perception it seemed to be outside. Well, which was it? It couldn’t beboth.In this way I explored and experimented with my experience, always with the samequestion in mind, “What is the real nature of this experience?” I didn’t want arational response, couched in the non-dual terms that had become so familiarover two decades of seeking. I wanted direct experience.I would sit for hours refusing the conventional labels that thinkingsuperimposes on experience, allowing experience to reveal itself as it is. Astime went on it became more and more obvious that all experience takes placeinside consciousness, that is, inside myself, whatever that is.In due course I came to see in an experiential way that if there is nothingoutside experience there can be nothing inside, for inside and outside are twosides of the same coin. One cannot stand without the other. Experiencing simplyremains, neither inside nor outside, and the totality of this experiencing ispermeated with, inseparable from and ultimately made out of consciousness, ourself. In fact, it is misleading to have three words, experiencing, consciousnessand our self, for that which is always one.Nothing extraordinary happened except the falling away of the concepts withwhich we normally describe our experience and with which we artificiallyfragment experience into a perceiving subject on the inside and a perceivedobject, other or world on the outside.Over a period of time there were many revelations about the nature ofexperience, each one seeming to penetrate more deeply to its core and, as aresult, the old belief systems with which experience had been shrouded for solong were slowly dismantled.During this time the fabric of the separate inside self became clear and with itthe so-called separate outside world. The separate self was revealed as a denseand intricate network of resisting, fearing, avoiding, seeking andconceptualising. In other words, it became clear that the separate self is notin fact an entity but rather an activity that appears in consciousness.And as a natural corollary to this understanding, it became clear that all weknow of an outside world is sensing and perceiving which, although seeming totake place outside, in fact takes place within consciousness, in exactly thesame place as the resisting and seeking that characterise the separate self. Inboth cases, whether I looked inside or outside, it became clear that there isonly the seamless intimacy of pure experiencing itself.In other words, it was clearly seen that consciousness pervades all experienceequally. No part of experience is any closer to or further from consciousnessthan any other part. In fact, there are no parts to experience. It is oneseamless, intimate whole permeated by and ultimately made out of consciousness.All that changed was that a centre or location where thinking, sensing,perceiving, feeling, loving, acting etc. takes place was no longer imagined. Thecontinual reference to a personal self fell away and with it the imaginarydistance, objectivity and otherness of the world dissolved. Only experiencingremains... direct, intimate, vibrant and friendly.The title of my first book, The Transparency of Things came to me as a way oftrying to indicate that all our so-called objective experience—the body, world,things and others—is made out of the same transparent, open, empty, luminoussubstance as the consciousness in which they appear.The current title, Presence, goes a step further. There are no ‘things’ there inthe first place to be transparent or otherwise. There is simply aware presence,ever-present, knowing, being and loving itself, sometimes resting, as it were,in the knowing of its own being and sometimes simultaneously knowing, being andloving itself in and as every minute gesture of the apparent mind, body andworld.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]As far as trying to share or communicate this experiential understanding, it islegitimate and in most cases necessary to have the freedom, sensitivity andflexibility to begin at any point along the apparent paths of understanding orlove, depending on the perspective of the question, and to explore the nature ofexperience from there, taking the presumption that is concealed in the questionas a starting point.Most of what is said in this book has been prompted by a question, becausewithout a question there is little impulse to formulate what cannot truly beformulated. As such, what is said here will, in most cases, start from theunderlying presumption in the question and go from there to as direct aformulation of the nature of experience as is possible in the givencircumstance.However, it may not go there in one leap. It may involve an apparent process intime in which we move slowly, intimately and carefully from our presumptions,whether they be in the form of beliefs or feelings, to our direct experience.How long we take and how directly we go depends on the nature of the resistanceof the dualising mind that is being engaged in this conversation. We may gostraight from there to the reality of our experience in the shortest and mostdirect way, or we may proceed slowly and even not quite complete the fullexploration, leaving that to be completed by the one who is asking the question.In this way, the reality of our experience is refracted into as manyformulations as there are questions, none of them being absolutely true but eachone tailored with love and understanding to the presumptions that are concealedand expressed in the question.So our conversations are like a dance, intimately, subtly and lovingly followingthe dualising mind in all its abstract, convoluted and erroneous beliefs,dancing with it for as long as it wishes to dance; never trying to replace oneconcept with another that is deemed to be absolutely true, but all the timeusing concepts to dissolve the hardened shell of abstract thinking in which ourexperience seems to have been imprisoned, thereby leaving the raw reality ofexperience naked, as it were, shining in and by itself.In this way, we avoid the pitfall of responding to all questions with the sameabsolute truth (as if the absolute truth could be accurately expressed by anyformulation) which, although seemingly unassailable, may simply be one morerefuge for the sense of a separate self—the refuge of non-dual perfectionism.Above all, this freedom from the new convention of non-dual perfectionism leavesit abundantly clear that the reality of experience cannot be adequatelyformulated by the mind and the little imperfections in every phrase are repeatedreminders of this.In fact, words are the least part of what is being communicated here. However,being confined to this written form they may temporarily assume more importancethan they deserve. Rather, it is the experiential understanding from which thewords come that is their true import, and this leaves open the possibility of awide variety of expressions and formulations, including even those that may seemto condone the apparently independent existence of objects, entities, things andthe world, if needs be.Any teaching that mechanically asserts and reasserts the same absolute truth asa blanket answer to all questions is, at best, dogmatic and, at worst, dubious.The true non-dual understanding is like an explosion—it cannot be contained inany form. It is always uprooting any attempt of the mind to catch it, tie itdown, package or control it. This explosion may or may not be fierce. It mayjust as well be a gentle almost imperceptible dissolving.My hope is that these words will be like drinking a delicious old wine. We takesmall sips with long pauses in between and the wine percolates into the mind andbody, pervading and dissolving them as it goes. Such are the words of theteaching. It is the after-taste that truly matters. Long after the words havegone, the silence from which they originate and with which they are saturatedresonate in the mind and body, drawing them into itself."},{"pageContent":"The Primacy of PresenceExperience is all that is known or could be known. So let us start here. Whereelse could we start? What is the reality of this current experience?There are these words and all the other apparent objects of the mind, body andworld, that is, thoughts, feelings, sensations and perceptions. And there is‘something’ present which is seeing these words and experiencing whatever elseis being experienced in this moment. This ‘something’ is experiencing thetingling sensation we call our feet; it is hearing the sound of rain; it isknowing our thoughts.Whatever it is that is experiencing the current amalgam of thoughts, sensationsand perceptions is undoubtedly present and is therefore sometimes referred to as‘being’, and undoubtedly knowing, experiencing or aware and is thereforesometimes referred to as ‘consciousness’ or ‘awareness’. Above all, it is whatwe know and experience our self to be and therefore it is known as ‘I’.Every experience is, as it were, lit up and simultaneously known by our self,this aware presence. Without it no experience is possible. Our self is theknowing or experiencing aspect in every experience. It is also the being orexistence aspect of all experience—the ‘amness’ of the self and the ‘isness’ ofall seeming things.Experiences are changing all the time but experiencing is present throughoutthese changes. Would it be possible to experience the absence of thisexperiencing? No! In order to claim legitimately that experiencing was absent,its absence would have to be experienced and, by definition, experiencing wouldtherefore be present.Would it be possible to experience the beginning or end of experiencing? If weclaim that experiencing begins or ends, something must be present thereexperiencing its beginning or ending. If we stay close to experiencing, which isalways now, we see that it is only abstract thought that claims that it beginsand ends. It is, in fact, ever-present.Does experiencing change when the particular characteristics of experienceschange? No! It is present consistently throughout all changes. Therefore,experiencing itself cannot be made out of something that changes, such as athought, sensation or perception.Everything that is known or experienced is known by or through our self, awarepresence. In time, this presence is understood to be the only substance presentin experiencing.Our self, presence, is the most intimate fact of experience. It pervades allexperience. It is what we refer to as ‘I’. It is what we intimately knowourselves to be or, more simply, it is the knowing of being. Our being is notknown by something or someone other than itself. It is known by itself. The ‘I’that I am is also that ‘I’ that knows that I am. However, ‘I’ does not knowitself as something, as an object. It is the knowing of itself. It knows itselfsimply by being itself.Presence, consciousness, awareness, our own being, is the primal and essentialingredient of experience. It is that which makes all experience possible andknowable. In time we discover that this presence is the only ingredient ofexperience. As such it is not an ingredient, something that experience is madeof, but rather it simply is experience, all alone.Is our self, our own being, ever not present? Prior to the arising of thought,there is no experience of time, in which our self is either present or not. Evenduring the appearance of thought there is no experience of time but only theappearance of time. However, even now our self is not present in the presentmoment. It is the present; not ‘now’ a moment in time but eternally, timelesslyever-present now.Would it be possible to experience the absence of our self? What would know orexperience such an absence? That one would have to be both present and aware. Inother words it would be our self, aware presence. Would it be possible to havean experience without our self? Is any part of experience not utterly permeatedwith that which knows it? Do we know of anything that exists apart, separate orindependent from our self? No!All apparently objective qualities of sight, sound, touch, taste and smell areknown or experienced by our self and, therefore, although undeniably present,our self itself cannot have any objective qualities. All objective qualities areknown by our self, but our self is not made out of an object.All experience is pervaded by experiencing or knowing. This knowingness ispresent throughout all thoughts, feelings, sensations and perceptionsirrespective of their particular characteristics. Presence, our self, is thistransparent unchanging knowingness in all experience.If we remove all that is perceivable from the perceived all that remains is ourself. That one, which is the intimacy of our being, is eternally presentthroughout all experience, lending its own reality to all things. In fact, theapparent reality of all things, all experience, belongs to our self alone. Allthat we love in objects, others and the world is their reality, and theirreality is our reality. We love our self alone. It is not a personal self, a me,that loves this being. It loves its own impersonal being. All experience is onlythat.Our self has no objective qualities so how do we know that it is limited,located or personal? It cannot be known, seen or felt objectively, so how do weknow that it resides in the body or mind? We do not.The mind, body and world are constantly changing in our experience and are oftennot present. However, our self is ever-present throughout all experience. It isthe experiencing element that runs throughout all experience. It can never beknown as an object because it is the knower of all apparent objects.However, it never ceases to know itself. Nothing new needs to be added toexperience to become aware that our self is always being and knowing itselfalone, not ‘always’ in time but eternally now. Knowing or experiencing is itsnature. Knowing or experiencing is not what it does. It is what it is.Therefore, it is by definition always knowing itself.As knowing is its nature, simply being itself is the knowing of itself. And asit is ever-present, it is always knowing itself. In fact, it knows nothing otherthan itself.The appearances of the mind, body and world are known by it but our self doesnot need any of them in order to know or be itself. It knows itself without theneed of any light other than its own. In fact, there is no light other thanitself.Our self needs the mind, body and world like the screen needs the film. In otherwords, it doesn’t! However, unlike the screen that is simply present, relativelyspeaking, our self is a knowing or aware presence. Just by being itself it knowsitself. It knows itself in all experience. It never ceases to experience itself.Whatever is known or experienced in every experience is its knowing orexperiencing of itself and this absolute intimacy of itself with all apparentobjects and others is known as love. In other words, experience is not just madeof awareness and presence but also of love. These three are one.All we have ever longed for resides in simply abiding as this aware presenceknowingly."},{"pageContent":"Knowledge and Love are OneIn this investigation into the nature of experience we simply take our standknowingly our true self of aware presence, irrespective of the particularcharacteristics of experience. We remain knowingly what we always already are.We always are only this presence but sometimes fail to notice that this is so.What is it that fails to notice this? Our self cannot fail to know itself justas the sun cannot fail to illumine itself. It is only a thought that imaginesthat our self is not known and that something else— like a body, mind orworld—is known. With this thought alone, our self seems to contract inside thebody and mind and objects, others and the world seem to be projected outside. Asa result, intimacy is veiled, love is lost and seeking begins.However, all this is only for thought. Our self only knows the intimacy of itsown being and all experience is that. The apparent veiling of our self and thecorresponding disappearance of peace, happiness and love is always for thought,that is, always for the imaginary inside self, but never for the real and onlyself there is.First we notice our self, then we stand knowingly as that self, then we see thatthere is only our self. And what is it that sees this? Our self. In other words,our own being abides in its eternal nature of peace, happiness and love and nolonger loses itself to the apparent objects of the body, mind and world.The more our self is noticed, the more its qualities are revealed in ourexperience. The mind, body and world, which once seemed to veil it, are now seento shine with its light. We give to our self the attention we used to give tothe world and the objects that once seemed to limit or obscure it are now seenonly to reveal or express it.Just as in a physical object, at a relative level, all we see is reflectedlight, so in reality all that is experienced is made of our self, awarepresence. The only difference is that the sun’s light is seen by something otherthan itself whilst it is our self that experiences itself in all experience. Itis not known by any other light.Nothing objective can touch, change, affect, move, alter, destroy or manipulateour self, aware presence, in any way, just as the image in the mirror cannotaffect the mirror. Our self is intimately one with all experience just as themirror is one with the image when it appears and yet we are entirely independentof all appearances just as the mirror is independent of the image.In fact, we are not ‘intimately one with’ experience for there are not twothings there in the first place—our self and experience—to be intimate with eachother. There is just pure seamless intimacy— no inside self and no outsideobject, world or other.To begin with, as we take our stand knowingly as aware presence, the mind, bodyand world recede into the background. When the presence and primacy of our selfhas been established, objects come close again, closer than close. They dissolveinto our self and reveal themselves as none other than the shape that our selfis taking from moment to moment.In fact, to know an apparent object of the mind, body or world, that apparentobject has to dissolve into our self, awareness. That is the way an object isknown, by dissolving in awareness. To know anything its apparent ‘thingness’must dissolve in awareness and become pure knowing.However, it is not that an object that was once real in its own right dissolvesinto awareness but rather that the object is understood to be only the knowingof the object—it was never anything other than that in our experience in thefirst place—and the only substance present in knowing is awareness, our self. Soit is the apparent ‘objectness’ of an object—its ‘outside-ness’, its‘not-me-ness’, its ‘something-ness’—that dissolves.This dissolution is known as the experience of love. It is the dissolution ofall the apparent boundaries that seem to keep an object, other, person or world,at a distance or separate. Love and knowledge are, in fact, one and the same."},{"pageContent":"The Innocence of ExperienceWhatever it is that is seeing these words is the substance of these words.Whatever it is that is seeing the carpet is the substance of the carpet.Whatever it is that is feeling the chair is the substance of the chair.Conventional wisdom suggests that whatever it is that knows any experience isdistinct from the existence of whatever it is that is known. It postulates aseparate ‘I’ that knows and a separate object, other or world that is known.In reality, there is no separate, inside ‘I’ and no separate, outside object,other or world. There is no experience of a world, person, object or other assuch, that is, as an entity in its own right independent and separate from ourself, awareness. This separation of the knowing subject from the existence ofobject, is a concept made only of the thought that thinks it.In reality our self, awareness, and the existence or being of an apparent objector other are not two. They are seamlessly one. The knowing of a tree and theexistence of the tree are made out of the same stuff. This understanding is acommon experience. In fact, it is not an experience. It is all that is everexperienced. It is experience itself. Experience is not a collection of objectsknown by an inside self. ‘Experience’ is just another name for our self,awareness. All seeming things are only our own infinite being.In the experience of an apparent object, other or world, the dualising mind(which is the thought that seems to separate the knowing subject from the knownobject) is not, by definition, present. The mind appears as a thought after theevent to which it refers. Take any experience. By the time thought has risen toname it, the experienced that is being named has vanished. Therefore, thoughtcan never touch experience itself, although it is made out of it. Experienceitself is always pristine, free, untouchable, unknowable by thought, pureintimacy, vibrant, alive.The world that thought imagines is not the real world of experience but anabstraction that masquerades as the real thing. The real nature of experiencecan never be found by the mind and yet it is all that is ever known. This andevery experience is shining with that reality alone.Thought misinterprets this seamless intimacy of experience and creates a knower,owner or ‘haver’ of the experience—the separate, inside self—and a known, ownedor ‘had’ object of experience—the object, other or outside world. This utterintimacy of the knower and the known is a well-known and familiar experience. Itis what is referred to as peace, happiness, love and beauty. In fact, it is allthat is ever happening but it seems to be veiled by dualising thought.Peace, happiness and love are simply the names we give to the dissolution of theapparent distinction between the knower and the known, between the subject andthe object. We all know this from our relationships. Love is the dissolution ofeverything we conceive and perceive our self and the other to be. It is anexperience of the absolute oneness of our shared identity. In fact, our identityis not shared. There are not two entities there in the first place to share it.It is, I am, all alone.When we say, “I fell in love,” we literally mean that we fell out of theconceptual straitjacket in which we had previously resided, into love. In fact,we never fall out of anything because we were never truly located as a separateinside self or entity in something, such as a body, in the first place. Theseparate entity is simply the prisoner of thought.When we fall in love, or indeed when we love, we simply recognise our self to beand to have always been this transparent presence in which there is no room foran object, other or person. Of course, when the dualising mind re-emerges fromthis non subject-object experience of love, in which it was not present, itrecreates the apparently loving subject and the apparently loved object andsays, “I love you.” However, the apparent ‘I’ and the apparent ‘you’ arefabrications of the mind, made only of the thought that thinks them.With this appearance of two apparent things (a knowing subject and a knownobject) our natural identity of ever-present, transparent, infinite presence isveiled and with it the innocence and intimacy of all experience, which is knownas peace, happiness or love, is lost. We seem instead to become a separate,limited, inside self, searching in a world that is now believed and felt to beoutside, separate and ‘other,’ that is, searching in the realm of situations,objects and relationships for the peace, happiness and love that have been lost.At some point our search collapses and we turn round, as it were, and looktowards this one who is in search. However, it is never found. All that is foundis the only self there ever is, aware presence, the simple knowing of our ownbeing, unqualified by any of the limitations that thinking seeminglysuperimposes upon it.And what is it that recognises this aware presence? Only that which is aware andpresent could do so. In that simple recognition, aware presence or awarenessknows itself and, by the same token, is realised to be always, only knowingitself.When we return to our self in this way, the apparent entities of the person andthe world dissolve, leaving only the innocence and intimacy of experience, whichis known as peace, happiness or love.If we now take our stand as this love and look again at the apparent objects ofthe mind, body and world, we find that there is no substance present there otherthan the love that we intimately know ourselves to be, that is, that knowsitself to be. We drop out of the world as a separate entity and re-enter it aslove, this utter innocence and intimacy of experience.The experience of beauty is the same. It is the collapse of the apparentseparation between the object or world and our self, or rather the recognitionthat there has, in fact, never been any such separation. When we walk out into alandscape and are melted by its beauty, this is what is happening. Thinkingcomes to an end and our own being tastes itself as it is. That is the experienceof beauty. It is never an object that is beautiful. It is rather that allobjects shine with the light of our own being.Likewise, ‘understanding’ is the name that is given to this realisation when itis revealed through the dissolution of a line of reasoning and ‘love’ is thename we give to it when it is revealed through the dissolution of feeling oremotion. In other words, all these words refer to the death of the separate,inside self and with it the dissolution of its corollary, the outside object,other or world.Peace, happiness, love, beauty, understanding all refer to the same transparent,ever-present, infinite reality of experience."},{"pageContent":"The Pure ‘I’ of AwarenessAwareness is our primary, ever-present experience. Before we know anything else,we know ‘I am’. And what is it that is aware of ‘I am’? Only that which is bothpresent and aware could be aware of anything. In other words, it is thispresence of awareness that I am, that knows itself. That is our most ordinaryand intimate experience. It is never not known.The idea that there is a mind independent of thinking, a body independent ofsensing or a world independent of perceiving, is a belief. The mind itself islimited so it can never know whether or not such a belief is true. The mind,body and world are never experienced as they are normally conceived to be. Ouronly experience of them is thinking, sensing and perceiving. Thinking, sensingand perceiving are modes of knowing or experiencing and the only substancepresent in knowing or experiencing is our self, awareness.Awareness is simultaneously their substance and their knowing, the being of themand the knowing of them. The pure light of our own self, awareness, takes theshape of thinking and, as a result, seems to become a mind; that takes the shapeof sensing and seems to become a body; and that takes the shape of perceivingand seems to become an object, other or world.In fact, it is not sensing and perceiving that make up the body and world. It isthought that superimposes ‘body’ and ‘world’ on the pure intimacy of sensing andperceiving. In fact, we cannot even say that ‘sensing’ and ‘perceiving’ make upthe body and world. Even ‘sensing’ and ‘perceiving’ are subtle superimpositionson experience. Experience itself is too intimate and seamless ever to become amental object (sensing and perceiving) or a physical one (body and world) knownby a separate subject. All these labels are for the separate self that thinkingimagines us to be, never for our true and only self that always is and knowsonly itself.However, this projection of an outside world always remains within our selfalthough such is its nature that it seems to take place outside. As a result ofthis apparent division of experience into an inside and an outside, our self,awareness, is imagined to remain on the inside as a separate, limited, located‘me’ and everything that seems to be on the other side, the outside, becomes an‘object’, ‘other’, ‘world’, ‘not me’.At first, awareness seems to become the pure subject of experience, the witness,which knows or experiences the object—the mind, body and world. Witnessing canbe seen, therefore, as a subtle superimposition that is conferred upon awarenessby the primary division of experience into two, into a subject and an object.With a further act of imagination, this witnessing awareness is believed toreside inside the body and with this belief another, denser superimposition isconferred upon awareness by thinking.First, the pure ‘I’ of awareness, which pervades all experience intimately andequally, is subtly contracted into the witnessing ‘I,’ which is conceived at adistance and separate from the mind, body and world. This witnessing ‘I’ is thenfurther reduced in the imagination into the thinker, apparently located in amind. That is, it is conceived as ‘I’ the thinker, ‘I’ the mind. Finally it isimagined that the mind is located inside the body and with this belief awarenessis imagined to reside inside, in fact to become the body, that is, ‘I’ thefeeler, ‘I’ the doer.That is, the pure ‘I’ of awareness is seemingly reduced into ‘I’ the witness andthen further reduced into ‘I’ the separate inside self. And everything that isleft over, with which awareness has not been identified, is conceived as the‘object’, ‘other’ or ‘world’.In this way the intimacy and seamlessness of experiencing is divided into twoapparent things—an experiencer and an experienced, a subject and an object. Thesubject becomes a witness, then a mind, then a body. The object becomes theworld and all others. Awareness seems to become located, limited and personaland the ‘object’, ‘other’ or ‘world’ seem, simultaneously, to become separate,outside and distant.This separation between the knower and the known, the experiencer and theexperienced, the thinker and the thought, the feeler and the felt, the doer andthe deed, never actually occurs. It is imagined with the thought that thinks it.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]What is sometimes known as self-enquiry simply proceeds in the oppositedirection. It starts with the apparent separate self that we think and feelourselves to be and simply stays with it. In staying with our self, it isgradually, in most cases, relieved of all the progressive layers ofsuperimposition with which the mind has seemingly wrapped it.To begin with, the separate self that thinking imagines us to be is realised asthe witness of the separate self. That is, even when we think and feel that weare a separate self inside a mind and body, we are in fact always only thewitness of the mind and body. Now we simply stand as that knowingly, whereasbefore we stood as that without realising it. We mistook ourselves for aseparate, inside self.As we remain as this witnessing self, it loses its sense of limitation andlocality for all limits and locations are witnessed by our self. That is, itloses its ‘witnessing-from-a-distance’ quality. The witnessing self and thewitnessed objects of the body, mind and world dissolve into each other and onlyone single seamless substance remains. What we call that substance no longermatters because there is nothing left to compare it with.In other words, the witness cannot stand alone. If we truly take our stand aswitnessing presence of awareness and look at the objects of the mind, body andworld, we do not find any distance or separation between our self, thiswitnessing presence, and the objects of the mind, body or world that itwitnesses. In fact, we do not find two entities there, a witnessing awarenessand a body, mind or world. We find only the seamlessness of experiencing utterlyone with or pervaded by the intimacy of our own being. That is, it only findsitself.Awareness now no longer knows itself as the witness of all seeming things. Itknows itself as their substance. But it is not the substance of something. Ouronly knowledge of an object, other or world is made of knowing orexperiencing—in other words, we only know knowing, we only experienceexperiencing—and the only substance present in knowing or experiencing is ourself, awareness. There is just our self knowing itself.Experience is seamless, made out of our own pure self alone. It is only thinkingthat superimposes successive layers of limitation on our self. However,awareness does not become pure as a result of this process of returning to ourself. The process is only for the mind just as the apparent limitation of ourself is for the mind alone. Our self is always only ever pure aware presence,seemingly limited, obscured or sullied by imagination alone.In other words, we do not cease to be a separate self and become the witness andlikewise we do not cease to be the witness and become pure awareness. It is onlythinking which seemingly reduces pure awareness to these apparently successivestages of limitation and localisation. And it is only for thinking that theselayers of ignorance, or the ignoring of the true nature of experience, areremoved. For our self, awareness, no such thing ever happens.Awareness is always only ever knowing, being and loving itself. It simply nowstands revealed as it is, to itself. It is always the same self.So, as we proceed back along this projected path, in the opposite direction fromwhich it arose, it is understood that our only knowledge of the mind, body andworld is thinking, sensing and perceiving. And if we look more closely at thenature of thinking, sensing and perceiving, we find that there is no substancepresent there other than our self, awareness.The mind, body and world do not become awareness as a result of this. They havealways only ever been what they eternally are. However, now they are known andfelt as such. They are reclaimed.As William Blake said, “When the doors of perception are cleansed everythingwill appear as it truly is, infinite.”Aware presence realises itself as the totality. Only Presence truly is."},{"pageContent":"Awareness and its Apparent ObjectsQ: You comment that awareness is observing appearances as though there are twothings, one, awareness and, two, appearances. Does not this admit an element ofduality albeit one that is subtler than is conventionally the case?The suggestion that there are two apparent things, one, awareness and, two,appearances or objects is said to one who believes him or herself to be aseparate self, located in and as the body, looking out at a world of objectsthat are considered to be separate from and independent of themselves,awareness.In this case, the terms in which the question is expressed (that is, the beliefin a separate entity, object or world that have independent existence) aregranted provisional credibility in order that we may proceed from what seem tobe the facts of experience. In this way an attempt is made to really connectwith the questioner’s felt experience rather than take refuge in what may seemto some like an ivory tower of non-dual perfectionism.So, we start with the conventional formulation that I, inside the body, amlooking out at an objective and independent world of objects. This is a positionof dualism, that is, I, the body (the subject), am experiencing the world andothers (the object). From here our attention is drawn to the fact that the body(sensations and perceptions) and the mind (thoughts and images) are, in fact,experienced in exactly the same way as the world (perceptions). In other words,it is seen clearly that the body/mind is not the subject of experience and theworld the object, but rather the body, mind and world are all objects ofexperience.We then ask what it is that knows or experiences the body/mind/ world. Whateverit is, is what we call ‘I’. ,And what is this ‘I’? It is obviously not thebody/mind because at this stage the body/mind is understood to be experiencedrather than the experiencer.What then can we say about this knowing or experiencing ‘I’? It cannot have anyobjective qualities because any such qualities would, by definition, beappearances or objects and therefore known or experienced. However, this ‘I’ isundeniably present and aware. For this reason it is sometimes referred to asaware presence, awareness or simply presence.At this stage the awareness that I am is said to be ‘nothing’, ‘empty’ or ‘void’because it has no observable qualities. I am transparent, colourless presence. Iam nothing conceivable or perceivable. I am present and aware but amnot-a-thing, nothing.From this point of view awareness is sometimes described as the witness of theappearances of the mind, body and world. I, awareness, know all appearances butam not made out of anything that appears. This position is still dualistic forthere is still a subject (my self, awareness) and an object (thebody/mind/world). It is, as it were, a halfway stage. It is one step closer to atruer formulation of the nature of experience than was the previous one in whichthe body/mind was considered to be the subject of experience and the world wasconsidered the object. However, upon closer exploration, this idea of thewitness is also seen to be a limitation, superimposed on awareness by a mindthat still believes in the separate existence of objects.It is valuable to make this distinction between awareness (the knowing orexperiencing subject) and the appearances of the mind, body and world for tworeasons:One, is that it establishes that there is something in our experience that isnot an object and yet is undeniably present and aware. In other words, itestablishes the presence of awareness and that this is what we are. And two, itestablishes not just the presence but the primacy of awareness. That is, itestablishes that for any object of the body, mind or world to come into apparentexistence, our self, awareness, must be present first, so to speak, as itsbackground.It establishes that first and foremost we stand as objectless, transparentpresence or awareness that illumines and knows all appearances of the body, mindand world. That is our ever-present experience whether it is recognised or not.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]Now we can go further than this. If we explore this awareness that we intimatelyknow ourselves to be, that is, that knows itself to be, we discover that thereis nothing in our experience to suggest that it is limited, located, personal,time or space-bound, caused by or dependent upon anything other than itself.Now what is it that could know that awareness is not limited, located etc? Onlythat which knows or is aware, and is at the same time present, could know thisor indeed anything else. In other words, only that which is aware and presentcould know awareness. Therefore, it is awareness alone that knows itself to beunlimited, unlocated, independent, uncaused. This recognition of our ownimpersonal, unlimited, ever-present being is sometimes called awakening orenlightenment. It is the most simple, obvious and intimate fact of experiencebut usually overlooked as a result of imagining our self to be something otherthan awareness, such as a thought, feeling or sensation.Now we can look again at the relationship between awareness and the apparentobjects of the body/mind/world that appear to it. How close are the body, mindand world to this witnessing presence of awareness? How close is the world tothe knowing or experiencing of it? If we look simply and directly at ourexperience we find that, whenever an object appears, there is no distancebetween our self, awareness, and that apparent object. They are, so to speak,touching one another.Now we can go further again. What is our experience of the border between them,the interface where they meet or touch? If there was such an interface, it wouldbe a place where our self ended and the object began. However, we find no suchinterface in experience. There is no place where we end and our experience ofthe world begins. There is no border there. Therefore, we can now reformulateour experience in a way that is closer to our actual experience. We can say thatobjects do not just appear to this awareness but rather that they appear withinit.At this stage awareness is conceived more like a vast space in which all theobjects of the body, mind and world appear and disappear. Previously weconsidered our self to witness all appearances from a distance but now thisdistance has collapsed and everything is experienced as being intimate. It is nolonger just our thoughts and feelings that are experienced inside our self butalso sensations and perceptions. However, this is still a position of dualism, aposition in which this vast knowing space is the subject and the body, mind andworld are objects that appear within it, rather like objects appear in a room,relatively speaking.So, we again go deeply into the experience of the objects of the body, mind andworld and see if we can find in them a substance that is other than theawareness that knows them or in which they appear. It is an exploration in whichwe come to see clearly that the body, mind and world are made of thoughts,sensations and perceptions; thoughts, sensations and perceptions are understoodto be made of thinking, sensing and perceiving; and the only substance presentin thinking, sensing and perceiving is understood to be our self, awareness.In other words, there is nothing present in our experience of an object, otheror world other than the knowing of it and knowing is only made of awareness, ourself. In fact, we don’t know our knowing of an object; we just know knowing.However, even in this formulation there is still a reference to a body, mind andworld, albeit one known by and simultaneously made out of awareness. It is stilla position in which the body, mind and world don’t just appear within awarenessbut as awareness. That is, they are known to be made out of that which knowsthem. They are experienced as being made out of our self, awareness.However, in this formulation we are still starting with objects, even if weconcede that they are made out of awareness. But if we look closely we find thatawareness, rather than objects, is our primary experience. So now, if we startfrom actual experience, that is from awareness, we find that it is awarenessthat takes the shape, as it were, of the mind, body and world. Awareness takesthe shape of thinking and appears as the mind. It takes the shape of sensing andappears as the body. It takes the shape of perceiving and appears as the world,but never for a moment does it actually become anything other than itself.At this stage we not only know but feel that presence or awareness is all thereis. That is, it knows itself as the totality of experience. This could beformulated as, ‘I, awareness, am everything’, or simply ‘Awareness iseverything’. At the same time, we recognise that this has, in fact, always beenthe case although it seemed previously not to be known.So, we have moved from a position in which we thought and felt that I amsomething (a mind and body) to a position in which we recognised our true natureas aware presence and which we expressed as ‘I am nothing, not-a-thing’. Then wecome to the experiential understanding that I am not just the witness, theknower or experiencer of all things, but am also simultaneously their substance.In other words we come to feel that I am everything.However, even this is not quite right, although it may be a truer formulation ofour actual experience than the ones we previously suggested, for what is this‘everything’ that is being referred to? We have, by this stage, already realisedthat there are no objects, others, selves, entities or world that are everactually experienced, as such. So it does not now make sense to say thatawareness is the totality of all non-existent things. There simply are no thingsfor awareness to be the witness, substance or totality of.How could we express this? We cannot! Language collapses here becauseunderstanding has literally burst out of the conceptual framework that it isdesigned to contain. However it is still legitimate to try! Instead of sayingthat awareness is everything, we could say just that awareness is. But eventhen, what is this awareness that is being conceptualised as being present? Toconceptualise awareness as such is to make implicit reference to something elsethat is not awareness. It is to ascribe to awareness a name or form in contrastto other names and forms and, as such, to suggest a limitation. So, we couldjust say, ‘is ‘ or ‘am’. However, such a word on its own is meaningless. Wordscan go no further. We fall silent.If we were at a meeting now rather than writing and reading, there wouldprobably be a long period of silence. In fact, as the meeting went on we maynotice a subtle shift from experiencing periods of silence that punctuate theconversation, to experiencing periods of conversation that punctuate thesilence. And in time it may be seen clearly that the words, whether spoken orwritten, do not, in fact, punctuate or interrupt silence but rather that thissilence is ever-present and the words are simply a modulation of it.In other words, we may discover that true silence is not simply an absence ofsound and thought but rather the presence of awareness that pervades and yet isprior to both sound or thought and their absence. Even that is not quite rightbecause in experience there is nothing prior. ‘Prior’ requires time and time isonly in thought. Experience is eternally now.However, such are the limitations of language and if we are to speak about thesematters we have to be willing to accommodate them. So we find ourselves againusing the same terms that have evolved to describe the abstract and conceptualconventions of dualistic thought. We find ourselves again speaking or writingabout that which cannot be truly spoken about and which, at the same time, isthe one thing that truly deserves our words because it is all that truly is.So, to summarise, we move from the formulation, ‘I am something’ to ‘I amnothing’; from ‘I am nothing’ to ‘I am everything’; from ‘I am everything’ to ‘Iam’ or ‘Awareness is’; from there to simple ‘I’ and from ‘I’ to... we truly fallsilent here.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]What has just been described above could be seen as a series of stages in theprogressive unfolding of understanding from the belief that experience consistsof a succession of objects—the body, mind and world—to the understanding thatexperience is only awareness eternally knowing and being itself alone. However,it would be a mistake to think that an entity passes through these apparentstages or even that experience itself undergoes a series of transformations.Such a position would only be the case if our initial assumption of the separateand independent reality of entities, objects, others and the world were true.Rather, having arrived at the understanding that there is only awareness orpresence, it becomes simultaneously clear that this has, in fact, always beenthe case, even if it was not noticed. So, looking now from this new perspectiveof presence, we see that what was an apparent unfolding of understanding fromthe point of view of the separate self was, in fact, an apparent dissolution ofignorance from the point of view of the mind.In other words, instead of starting with the apparent reality of entities,objects, selves, others and the world, and looking towards awareness, we nowtake our stand knowingly as awareness and see how the mind, arising withinawareness, has built up a series of abstract and conceptual beliefs that conferapparent reality, solidity and independence on objects, others, the world etc.As we abide knowingly as awareness, that is, as it stands knowingly as itself,un-seemingly-veiled by the abstract concepts of the dualising mind, we discoverthat it is not a void, an emptiness. It is not ‘nothing’. It is only referred toas ‘nothing’ at times, in contrast to the belief in the reality of ‘things’.From that point of view it is nothing, not-a-thing, in contrast to ‘something’.However, from the point of view of experience, it is fullness itself—full ofitself alone. This fullness is known as love for there is no room there for anyother. In other words, we could say that love is the substance of all seemingthings and, once it has become clear that there are no real things, as such, wecould simply say that love is.The movement in understanding from ‘I am something’ to ‘I am nothing’ could becalled the path of wisdom or discrimination. The movement in understanding from‘I am nothing’ through ‘I am everything’ to simply ‘I’, could be called the pathof love."},{"pageContent":"The Imaginary Centre of PerceptionThere is no distance between the body, mind and world and our self, awarepresence, in which they appear.The sound of the wind or the image of the moon is as close and intimate to ourself, aware presence, as the tingling of our face, the sensation of our breathor our most private thought or feeling.No experience of the body, mind or world appears with a ‘me’ label attached toit. The thought ‘this is me’, or ‘this is not me’, is added to the experience ofsensing and perceiving as an afterthought. It is not intrinsic in experienceitself.Take the sensation of your hands. Without reference to thinking, is there anyknowledge that this sensation is ‘me’? Does it come with a ‘me’ label attachedto it? Does the sound of the wind come with a ‘not me’ label attached to it? Arethey not both just raw experience, raw sensation and perception, not even ‘hand’or ‘wind’ let alone ‘me’ or ‘not me’?It is with the thought ‘I am this, I am not that,’ that the seamless intimacy ofexperience is apparently divided into ‘me’ and ‘not me,’ into ‘I’ and ‘other.’However, even that thought is as impersonal as the sound of the wind. And thesound of the wind is as intimate as that thought.Even the thought, ‘I am this sensation, the body, but not that perception, thewind’, is just a thought that bears no relation to our actual experience. It hasno actual power to divide the seamlessness of experience. It seems to do so butthat doesn’t make it actually so.It is, in fact, impossible to divide the seamlessness of experience. The thoughtthat our self, this aware presence that is seeing these words, is located in andlimited to a separate body, is itself simply a thought that appears in unlimitedpresence, just like the sound of the wind.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]Is there actually an experience of a border between what is considered to be theinside of our self and what we consider to be the outside?The skin, which seems to house our self, awareness, is in fact simply anothersensation or perception that itself appears in awareness, along with all othersensations and perceptions.It is not the body that contains awareness and separates it from the world, butrather our true body, awareness, that contains the body, mind and world.See clearly that the breath takes place in this vast open space of awareness,not in an imagined, confined body. The breath and the body are both sensations.One sensation does not appear in another sensation but rather both appear withinawareness, in the same place that the wind appears. That ‘place’ is theplaceless place of awareness.It is only a concept that says the breath is ‘me’ and ‘mine’ and takes place onthe inside, and the wind is ‘not me’ and ‘not mine’ and takes place on theoutside.The border between the ‘me’ and the ‘not me’ is imagined with the thought thatthinks it. Without this concept there is no ‘me’, no ‘not me’, no inside and nooutside. The limited physical body is simply one more appearance withinawareness.Is there any experience of a centre or a location from which any experience isknown? Where is the sound of the wind being heard? Where is the sensation of thebreath being felt? Where is the sight of the moon being seen?And if the answer is ‘here’ or ‘there’, see clearly that this so-called locationis, in fact, not a location at all. It is simply another sensation or perceptionthat is experienced in exactly the same ‘place’ as the sound of the wind, thesensation of the breath or the sight of the moon.The sound of the wind, the sensation of the breath, the sight of the moon andthe apparent location in which they are supposedly taking place, do not in facttake place in any place. The sound, the sensation, the perception and theapparent location all take place in placeless awareness.Is there an experience of a centre or a location from which or in which ourthoughts are being perceived?Is there any actual experience of a ‘me’, an entity, that is doing the thinking?Or is thinking just appearing in awareness like the sound of the wind, thesensation of the breath and the sight of the moon?And if there seems to be a ‘me’ entity present, a centre of experience, is therea place from which that experience is being perceived or is that experienceitself also not simply appearing in unlocated awareness?See clearly that thoughts, images, feelings, bodily sensations, sounds, sights,textures, tastes, smells are all appearing effortlessly in placeless awareness.In order to resist what is present and seek what is not present we must firstimagine ourselves to be a separate, limited centre of perception, located in andas the body. We must first take up a position from which to have a resistance.With this thought alone the separate inside self is imagined. The apparentlyseparate self is that imagined position.However, see if there is, in the seamlessness of experience, a separating linethat divides it into a ‘me’ on one side of the line and a ‘not me’ on the otherside.If we think that we find such a line, is this apparent dividing line not itselfsimply another thought, image, sensation or perception, appearing in awareness?In other words, it is not truly a dividing line but only a thought or image ofsuch.And if we do not find a real dividing line that separates experience into twofields, a ‘me’ field and a ‘not me’ field, then stay with the seamless intimacyof the current experience and see if it is possible to find a point, a centre, asingle location where you, ‘I’, is located, a place from which the totality ofexperience is known or perceived.See that if we find such a centre or location for our self, the experiencer,this centre is itself simply a seamless ‘part’ of this current experience. Infact, there are no parts to experience. Experience is pure seamless intimacy.See that such a centre is appearing like every other thought, image, sensationor perception, in our own intimate, impersonal, borderless awareness.See that the ‘me’ is itself an expression of the seamless totality but that ithas no independent reality of its own. It is itself the shape that this seamlesstotality takes from time to time, but it never actually divides anything fromanything.See if anything truly changes if we stand up and move around. In fact, there isno entity that stands up and moves around. No one came into this room and no onesat down. That is just an interpretation of thought.Awareness is the only substance present and it never gets up or moves around.There is just sensing and perceiving and they are utterly, intimately one withour self, awareness.It is thinking alone which abstracts parts, objects, entities, selves and othersfrom the intimate seamlessness of experience and constructs an image of a personmoving around in space and time, being born, growing old and dying. However, theperson, space, time, birth and death are for thought not for experience.In reality there are just new sensations and perceptions arising in and asplaceless Presence, although even that is not completely true.It is only a thought that says this experience is new. Experience is tooutterly, intimately itself to be able to step back and say such a thing aboutitself. Only a thought compares the present with an imaginary past, therebycreating the old and, therefore, the new.Every thought image, sensation and perception is fresh and now. The labels ‘old’and the ‘past’ are thoughts that appear now. And because there is no ‘old’ andno ‘past’ there is no ‘new’, no present moment and no future.Experience itself knows nothing of the past or the future, the old or the new.It only knows the timeless intimacy of the now.Only an imaginary object could be old or new. Experience itself is always fresh,intimate, vibrant and alive. It is always now and here, not ‘now’ in time or‘here’ in space but rather ever-present and dimensionless.Experience itself cannot step away from itself as a separate subject, in orderto know itself as a separate object. Objects are for thinking, not for our self.Even to talk of sensations is too much. That is just a stepping-stone in thedeconstruction of our experience. In reality, sensations and perceptions areonly sensations and perceptions from the point of view of thinking. In fact,thought is only thought from the point of view of thinking. Experience, that is,our self, knows no such things.Our self is too intimately seamless, one with all experiencing, to know itselfas ‘something’ such as a mind, body, other or world. It just knows the intimacyof itself.This absence of otherness, object-ness, self-ness is love itself. It is what weare and all we know.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]All such thinking truly dies if we go to the heart of experience. In fact,thinking cannot go to the heart of experience. It can only go to an imaginarypast or future. It can never touch the present. It is always too late.The separate entity we imagine ourselves to be cannot reside in the present. Itcan only make its home in the imaginary past or future. It can only reside intime and space but never in the eternal and infinite presence of the here andnow. It simply dies when it tries to go there and that death is love.The fact that experience may be peaceful or agitated, pleasant or unpleasant,changes nothing. The particular characteristics of experience do not implicatethe seamlessness of experience. They do not make it more difficult to see thatthere is no separating line, nor a perceiving centre, in our experience. Theirparticular character doesn’t in any way effect the fact that our experience isalways one seamless intimate totality without separate parts, objects, entities,selves or others.In fact, ‘peaceful’ or ‘agitated,’ ‘pleasant’ or ‘unpleasant,’ are again onlyinterpretations, superimposed by the mind onto experience itself, which is as itis, neither peaceful nor agitated. And in order to interpret experience in thisway, thinking has to first abstract a separate entity from the seamlessness ofexperience and imagine, as a result, a limited, located point of view from whichexperience is evaluated or judged as such.Experience itself does not know agitation. Only the mind knows agitation and theagitation it knows belongs to its own activity alone.See clearly that experience is like a seamless piece of cloth with no separateparts, entities, places, times, objects or selves anywhere to be found—just ourself, awareness, seemingly taking the shape of this and this and this... andsometimes not taking any shape at all... colourless, silent, luminous, knowingitself, being itself and loving itself."},{"pageContent":"The Imaginary Birth of the Self and the WorldThere is no separate entity that experiences and there is no object, person,mind, body, world or other that is experienced.The mind, body, world, people, places, objects and entities are all abstractconceptions that are superimposed by thinking onto experience itself.There is only experiencing from moment to moment and this experiencing is oneever-present seamless whole.From time to time this ever-present seamless totality, out of its infinitecreativity and freedom, takes the shape of thinking, which goes something likethis: “I, the seamless totality, am not the seamless totality. I am this littlefragment, this little cluster of bodily sensations, and everything else that isnot this fragment, is not me.”With this thought the apparently separate inside self and the apparentlyseparate outside world, including all ‘others’, are simultaneously born.From this moment onwards the world becomes the known, the experienced, and ‘I’,which has apparently contracted into a tiny location somewhere behind the eyesor in the chest area, becomes the knower, the experiencer, the thinker, thefeeler, the chooser, the doer.The ever-present seamless intimacy of pure experiencing gives birth to twoapparent things, a subject and an object. Experiencing seems to become theexperiencer and the experienced. However, this separation never actually takesplace. It is a virtual birth.If, as a result of this imaginary separation, objects are considered to be real,aware presence will be conceived as their witness. However, if we take our standas this witness and go deeply into the experience of the apparent object, otheror world, we do not find anything objective there. We find only knowing, onlyaware presence. That is, aware presence finds or knows itself.As objects lose their apparent object-ness in clear seeing, so aware presenceloses its apparent witness-ness and stands revealed as pure awareness alone,pure presence.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]Presence is so utterly and intimately one with every appearance, it says ‘Yes’so unreservedly to every experience, that it is also known as love.Love is the name we give to experience when it is relieved of the conceptualsuperimposition of ‘otherness’. It knows and loves itself alone. Love isprecisely the experience that there is nobody or nothing else present inexperience that could love or be loved. We never love a person or an object.Love is the dissolution of the ‘I’ that loves and the ‘other’ that is loved. Itis the collapse of relatedness and the dawn of intimacy.In love the ‘I’ that I am, the ‘you’ that you are and the ‘it’ that it is, arerecognised as modulations of the same being. In love all is dissolved in that,revealed as that.This ever-present seamless totality knows itself, is itself and loves itselfsimultaneously in every appearance of the mind, body and world. And when thereis no expression, it simply abides in and as itself, the transparent peace ofour true nature.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]It is only a thought that apparently divides the seamless totality of experienceinto an experiencer and an experienced. There are no personal entities orindependent objects anywhere to be found in actual experience.‘Me’ and ‘the world’ are co-created in imagination. They always appear togetherand disappear together in that which never appears or disappears.They are two sides of the same coin. The coin is the forgetting of the seamlessintimacy of experience. Its two faces are ‘me’ and the ‘object’ or ‘other’.However, whatever the appearance of the coin, it is only made of aware presence,our self, which is that in which the current experience appears and also thatout of which it is made.This division of experience into a perceiver and a perceived, a knower and aknown, a lover and a loved, is like a mirage. It never actually happens.Both the experiencer and the experienced are made of experiencing andexperiencing itself is made out of our self, aware presence. In fact,experiencing is not ‘made out of’ aware presence. It is that. There is onlythat.The idea that there is something other than aware presence is simply a belief.This ‘something’ that is considered to be other than aware presence is utterlynon-existent. It is never found in experience. It is only found in imagination.What could or need be done to something that is non-existent? What could or needbe done to that which is ever present?Every part of experience is utterly saturated with this presence. No part of itis any closer or further away from presence than any other part. No part ofexperience is more or less permeated with this presence than any other part. Infact, there are no parts in experience.‘Presence’, ‘experience’, ‘I’ and ‘love’ are all synonyms for the seamlessnot-two-ness of what is.From time to time thought seems to condense presence, as it were, into a bodilysensation and presence seems, as a result, to become located in time and space.However, this seeming limitation of presence, is only an idea, a thought. It isimagined.As a result of this imagining, ‘I’, aware presence, seems to become ‘me’, abody. And everything ‘I’ seem not to be, becomes ‘you’, the other, object orworld. Thus the apparent self and the apparent world are born of thisforgetting.However, this birth never actually takes place. There is no ‘me’, ‘you’, other,object, world, as such. There is only presence."},{"pageContent":"We Were Not BornConventional thinking tells us that our self, aware presence, is born into aready-made world that is independent and separate from it. What evidence do wehave for this? What evidence do we have that the awareness that is seeing thesewords appears in the world or that it appears in a mind or a body?The first experience that we have on waking in the morning appears to our self,awareness. Awareness is already present in order to experience that firstexperience in the morning. Likewise at birth, awareness is already present toexperience whatever our first experience is.Have we ever had the experience of awareness appearing? Of course, we have theconcept that awareness appears at birth or that it appears first thing in themorning, but is that an experience?In order to claim legitimately that something appears, awareness must be presentprior to that appearance, in order to claim the appearance of that thing as anactual experience.So what about the appearance of awareness itself? If we claim that such anappearance actually occurred as an experience, something would have to have beenpresent to experience that appearance. That ‘something’ would have to have beenpresent and aware, but that is precisely what awareness is, that which ispresent and aware.It is impossible to experience the appearance of awareness. We are thatawareness to which such an appearance would occur.We have no experience of a beginning to the awareness that is seeing thesewords. We have no experience of its birth. We have no experience that we,awareness, are born.Likewise, in order to claim legitimately that awareness dies, something wouldhave to be present to experience its disappearance. Have we ever experienced thedisappearance of awareness?If we think the answer is, ‘Yes’, then what is it that is present and aware toexperience the apparent disappearance of awareness? Whatever that is must beaware and present. It must be awareness.When we are born or when we wake in the morning, we have the experience of theappearance of objects. When we die and when we fall asleep at night, we have theexperience of the disappearance of objects. However, we have no experience thatwe, awareness, appear, are born, disappear or die.That is, awareness has no experience of its own appearance, beginning, birth,duration, disappearance or death. All such are ideas superimposed by the mindupon awareness. However, this superimposition never actually happens. It is onlyimagined.So, our experience is that awareness is ever-present—that is, awareness’ ownexperience of itself is that it is ever-present—and that the objects of theapparent body, mind and world come and go within it.However, even ‘coming and going’ is a concept. The only substance present in anyexperience is awareness and awareness does not come and go. ‘Coming and going’is imagined by the mind and superimposed on the ever-presence of awareness.Nothing truly comes and goes. From where would it come and to where would it go?And what would ‘it’ be? What would it be made out of that is not alreadypresent, here, now, as this awareness?Nothing ever comes in or out of existence. Awareness eternally is and that isthe substance of all seeming things.So, in reality there is no waking up in the morning, no falling asleep, no birthand no death, and no entity who passes through any of these apparent states.All these times, places, events, entities and occurrences are only thought andthey all ‘take place’ in the placeless timeless, dimensionless presence ofawareness.All experience is only the ever-present now. Nothing but that is known. Soexperience cannot be new because it is never old. It can never even be ‘now’because it is never ‘then’.The mind simply cannot go to the ‘place’ of experiencing. When this is seenclearly the mind dissolves and that dissolution is love.The appearances of the mind, body and world are made out of perceptions. Howlong does a perception last? How long does an image of the world last? How longdoes a bodily sensation last? A moment? No! Nothing lasts in time for there isno time present for anything to last in.It is awareness, in which these perceptions appear, that is substantial and‘lasting’. Perceptions themselves are fleeting and insubstantial.However, awareness is not everlasting in time. It is ever-present, eternallynow. Time seems to last in it but even that is not true, because there is noduration in awareness. Time is imagined with the thought that thinks it.Likewise space.How could time take place in that which is timeless? How could space exist inthat which is without dimensions?Even the appearance of an apparently solid, durable object is made only out offleeting and insubstantial perceptions strung together conceptually to producethe semblance of a solid, lasting object.However, objects do not, in fact, even last fleetingly. How could somethingappear even fleetingly within that which has no dimension or duration? There isno ‘lasting’ in experience. Experience is eternally now.An object is made out of the same ‘stuff’ that thinking and feeling are made outof. It is made out of experiencing and the only substance present in ourexperience, that is, in its own experience, is awareness.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]This does not disprove the possibility of the world being made out of somethingother than experiencing; it just shows that we have no such evidence of such aworld.However, in order to discover what such a world might be we first have to divestit of all that is imparted to it by the mind and the senses.Divested of all the sense perceptions that the mind imparts to the world, allthat remains of the world would be formless presence or being. Anything elsewould be perceived and therefore would belong to the perceiving faculties ratherthan to the world as it truly is.All seeming things, divested of the names and forms that our thinking andperceiving faculties superimpose onto them, stand revealed as infinite presence,that is, pure being without boundaries, borders, limits, location or dimensions.That is, all seeming things are infinite and eternal.And is not pure being or presence, without limit and location, our self? Forthere cannot be two infinite presences, because if there were two suchpresences, each would have to be limited. And if they were limited, they wouldnot be pure presence, but would rather be an apparent object.And for whom would that object be? Only for awareness. In other words, awarenesswould be their witness and their substance.In other words, whichever way we look at it—whether we see the world as simplymade of perceiving or whether we grant the world some reality independent ofperceiving—it comes to the same thing. There is only being, and the awarepresence that we intimately know our self to be—that knows itself to be—isidentical to that.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]What evidence is there that the world exists in-between two perceptions of it?What evidence do we have that the world exists when it is not being perceived orthat the body exists when it is not being experienced?In fact, even when the apparent world is being perceived, in other words, evenwhen perceptions are seemingly present, the world does not ‘exist’ as such, asit is conceived to be, that is, it does not ‘stand out’ on its own, independentof consciousness. How much less so when it is not being perceived? Out of whatwould it be made at such a time? In what form would it exist?Of course, thinking tells us that the world and the body continue to exist whenthey are not being experienced but we have no experience of such a world orbody. And indeed, it is only thinking that tells us that the world and the bodyexist, as such, when they are apparently being perceived or sensed.Experience itself knows no such thing. It is too intimately itself to be able tostep out of itself as a knowing subject and, as a result, to know an object,other or world. Experience itself knows only pure, seamless, intimate,unnameable experiencing.In other words, the apparent absence and presence of the world and the body, assuch, are superimpositions upon awareness. The world and the body borrow theirseeming substance and apparent continuity, their seeming reality, fromawareness.It is not our experience that awareness is a fleeting, insubstantial appearancewithin the ever-present reality of the world. It is our experience that theworld is a fleeting, insubstantial appearance ‘upon’ or ‘within’ theever-present reality of awareness.However, even that is not quite true. It is only said in reference to the deepbelief in the reality of objects. In fact, there is nothing ‘upon’ or ‘within’awareness. What would such a ‘thing’ be?Nor is anything ‘fleeting’. Only thinking knows apparent fleetingness.Experience knows nothing of time. It is too full of itself alone to know itselfas something. It only knows itself, dimensionless and timeless.To imagine awareness as a dimensionless but nevertheless space-like container isjust a stage to enable us to see that there is no outside, that everything isintimate, close, ‘one with’.From this point of view experience is conceived as objects appearing inawareness. However, our only knowledge of objects is the experience of sensingand perceiving which in turn is made out of awareness alone.Sensing and perceiving, however, do not appear in awareness. They are awareness.And what is it that knows awareness? Only itself. In other words, experience isonly awareness knowing itself.However, even to know experience as ‘sensing and perceiving’ requires anabstraction. It requires a thought that could separate out a knowing subjectfrom the whole and thereby seem to know an object.Experience itself is far too intimate for that. It only knows its own seamlessintimacy. It only knows love. In other words, experience, love and our self areone.Here the idea of awareness being a vast container of all experience hasdissolved in favour of a more accurate, but not completely accurate formulation:nothing appears ‘in’ awareness. There is only awareness knowing and being itselfeternally.Again the mind may try to take another step towards the heart of experience butfinds that it simply cannot go there. It takes one more step and... effortlesslydissolves.Right there, experience stands shining as it is."},{"pageContent":"Love is the Fabric of ExperienceWe all know that ‘I am’, and the ‘I’ that ‘I am’ is also aware that I am.In other words, our self, presence, is both present and aware. This awarepresence that I am knows its own being. However, presence doesn’t know its beingin an objective way, as the mind seems to know an object, but rather it is theknowing of itself.It is simultaneously the knowing of its own being and the presence of knowing orawareness.Have we, that is, has presence ever experienced or could presence everexperience the absence of itself, the absence of presence? What would be presentto know this absence?We, that is, presence, cannot know its own absence, because it would have to bepresent in that knowing, as that knowing. Therefore, there is never anexperience of the absence of presence.Into what could Presence disappear? Into that which is nonexistent? How couldthat which is disappear into or become that which is not? What would become ofits presence? It would have to ‘go’ somewhere.And from what would presence appear in the first place? If presence was notpresent, what would there be? Non-existence? But non-existence cannot be.Therefore, non-existence is non-existent. In fact, non-existence is only aconcept. Only Presence eternally is.And if presence is ever-present and everything is that presence, can anythingdisappear? No thing ever ceases to be because no thing ever comes intoexistence.The substance or being of every apparent object is only presence and presenceeternally is.There is only one substance, substantial, immutable, unmysterious, never notknown, never not experienced, never not being itself, never not present.It is this one substance that seemingly takes the shape of all appearanceswithout ever being or becoming anything other than itself.However, from the point of view of itself, which is the only real point of view,this presence never takes the shape of anything. Water is too close to itself toknow itself as ocean or wave. ‘Ocean’ and ‘wave’ are for thought. For water,there is only water.Whatever is known is presence knowing itself. Whatever is, is presence knowingitself, being itself and loving itself. Presence cannot cease to know or beitself.Even in profound ignorance, presence is knowing and being only itself. That is,it is loving itself. Therefore, there is no real ignorance.There is no forgetting, no remembering, no losing or finding. Presence is neverbound and never liberated. Forgetting, remembering, losing and finding,ignorance and liberation, are for thinking, not for presence.Presence is never veiled from itself. And therefore there is no real unveilingof reality. There is no self-realisation for presence because all that is realin any experience is already our true self of aware presence. The unreal isnever experienced.There is no enlightenment for presence, because our self, aware presence, isalready and eternally the light of knowing that illumines all seeming things.And anything that may seem to obscure this light is only made out of the lightof knowing. It is that in which, through which and as which all seeming thingsare known.There is no awakening for presence because presence is always already awake initself.There is no death for presence for presence is all there is and that which isnever ceases to be.How can this be known if it is not known? By seeing clearly that it is alwaysknown. It can never not be known.That which is not known is not knowable. Such a ‘thing’ is an idea only. Andthat which is known is always known.So any movement or progress is always from knowing to knowing, which is nomovement or progress at all. Movement and progress are for the mind, not forpresence.Right here these words and whatever else is being experienced in this moment areknown, but there is no other substance to this experience other than itsknowing. That is, its being or its substance, is its knowing of itself.There is no knower of this experience and nothing that is known. There is justthe knowing of it, which is simultaneously identical to being it. And thisidentity of knowing and being is known as love.Love is the fabric of all experience."},{"pageContent":"Everything is Folded Back into PresenceThis book is about knowing, being and loving what truly ‘is’, not what ‘seems tobe’. An effort is always needed to love what ‘seems to be’ and an effort isalways needed not to love what truly ‘is’.The subtle effort not to love what truly ‘is’, is known as the ‘separate self’.And that which is not loved is known as the ‘outside world.’The ‘separate self’ and the ‘outside world,’ as they are normally conceived tobe as separate entities in their own right, are two inseparable faces of thesame unlovingness.What we call the outside world is simply the absence of love. In love theseparate outside world, including all apparent others and objects, and theseparate inside self dissolve leaving only the seamless intimacy of pureexperiencing.There is no relationship in experience. A relationship would require at leasttwo entities or objects. In the absence of these apparent entities or objectsthere is love.Love is the collapse of all boundaries and separation that seemed to keepentities and objects apart and related.In other words, the death of the separate self and love are synonymous. This iswhy love and death are often closely associated in art and literature.The ‘separate self’ and the ‘outside world’ appear, as such, when love andunderstanding are ignored or seemingly veiled by the arising of dualisticthinking. They are made only of the apparent forgetting of presence.However, this ignorance of love is also ultimately an act of love itself.Therefore there is no true forgetting, no true ignorance.One of the hardest things for the apparently separate self to understand is thatthere is no real ignorance. In fact, it cannot be seen by the separate selfbecause that apparent self is the denial of this very understanding.Only when the apparently separate self and the apparently outside world aredissolved in love and understanding does it become clear that they never existedin their own right to begin with.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]It is never possible to love a person or an object. Love is defined precisely byits unconditional quality. How could an intermittent object be the giver or thereceiver of something that is ever-present?Love is the name we give to the experience of ‘being one with’ or, moreaccurately, simply ‘being one’ or ‘knowing no other’.Even if we accept provisionally that objects exist in their own right, no twoobjects can appear at the same time. The mind may conceptually split experienceinto a multiplicity of objects known by a subject but in reality there is onlyever one experience or object present at a time.Therefore, one object has no relationship to another object. How can an objecthave a relationship with a non-existent object?Every apparent object has a relationship only with the awareness in which itappears. Awareness is the knowing element in all experience.And how close is the knowing element in any experience to the experience itself?Closer than close! They are one and the same thing. What else is present inexperience other than the knowing of it?When an object is seemingly present it is utterly intimate with, inseparablefrom and one with the awareness that knows it. This inseparable intimacy isknown as love. So to be an object, to know an object and to love an object areidentical.Therefore, we cannot even say that an object has a relationship with awareness.Experience is too intimate to admit of two entities between which there might berelationship.Love is the dissolution of illusion of relatedness.To know an object (if we provisionally concede that awareness can ‘know’ anobject), awareness ‘becomes’ that apparent object and in ‘becoming’ that seemingobject, it is known as love. It is the utter intimacy of giving its entiresubstance to all appearances.However, awareness doesn’t know and love an appearance as something other thanitself. If we go deeply into the experience of whatever is known or loved wefind no substance there other than awareness itself. Therefore, awarenessdoesn’t just know and love an object, it is that object, and being that apparentobject or other is the experience of knowing and loving.For anything or anyone to be known or loved its apparent ‘something-ness’ or‘someone-ness’ must dissolve.At this point it doesn’t make sense to talk of an object or other because‘object-ness’ and ‘otherness’ have collapsed into awareness. And with thecollapse of the apparent object, the witness-like or container-like aspect ofawareness collapses with it.So, we cannot say that awareness knows, loves or is anything other than itself.Every experience is simply the experience of awareness knowing, loving, beingitself.Love is never a relationship. In fact, it is the collapse of relationship. It isthe natural condition of all experience.If we forget this, the ‘separate self’ and the ‘outside world’ come intoapparent existence as separate entities and objects. As soon as awareness isremembered, everything is folded back into it.Presence reclaims the world, takes it back into itself."},{"pageContent":"All We Ever Long ForQ: You sometimes describe the end of seeking as the experience of love orhappiness but calling it that sometimes sets up another seeking pattern, anotheridea about what form this moment should take.Love and happiness seem to come and go like everything else. Thinking that loveor happiness should be present in difficult or unhappy moments just makes mewant to change the current situation and long for something else—in other wordsit is just more seeking.I write this because the desire to love and be loved has been such a trap for mein the past. For years I believed it was that love I was looking for and part ofme still wants it. In fact I’m sitting here crying about this now.Love, peace and happiness are simply the words that are used to describe thedissolution of all resistance and seeking, the collapse of separation andotherness, that is, the taste of our true nature, its taste of itself. They arenon-objective in the sense that they do not have any objective qualities. Assuch, they are not experiences of the mind or body although they impact on them.Seeking and resistance veil our true nature, aware presence, and therefore veilthe love, peace and happiness that is inherent within it or rather that is it.As a result of forgetting our true nature of aware presence and imaginingourselves instead to be a separate inside self, we set out in the world lookingfor love in relationships, peace in situations and happiness in objects.This seeking is, by definition, uncomfortable—it is the activity of sufferingwhich defines the separate inside self. In fact, there is no separate seekingself. The apparently separate self is the activity of resisting/seeking.When the relationship, situation or object is found, the seeking comestemporarily to an end and in this dissolution our true nature shines, that is,aware presence tastes itself, as it were, for a brief moment (actually it is atimeless moment, because the mind is not present there).That timeless moment is what is known as love, peace or happiness. It is alsoknown as beauty and understanding. That is our true nature knowing itself as itis, un-apparently modified by the sense of an inside self.When the mind rises up again, it misinterprets this non-objective experience oflove, peace or happiness, during which it was not present, and attributes it tothe relationship, situation or object.With this re-appearance of subject/object thinking, love, peace and happinessare again veiled and thinking sets out again in search of a new relationship,situation or object, hoping to re-enact the experience of love, peace orhappiness that it mistakenly believes was produced by them.However, it is not the relationship, situation or object that produces the love,peace and happiness. It is the cessation of the resisting/seeking thought whichenables the underlying love, peace and happiness that is inherent in our truenature of present awareness to shine. That is, the cessation ofresisting/seeking allows our true nature to know or taste itself as it is,un-apparently-veiled by the activity of resisting/seeking.Therefore, love, peace and happiness are not something that come and go any morethan our self, aware presence, comes and goes. However, they are sometimesseemingly veiled.So, it is inevitable that if we consider ourselves to be a separate inside self,the search for love, peace and happiness in the realm of relationships,situations or objects will be unavoidable. In fact, the separate self is thesearch for love, peace and happiness.However, sooner or later we have to see that what we long for is not to be foundin the realm of objects. It is simply the knowing of our own being.Allow your focus on relationships, events and objects to relax. See that yourself, your own being, is present quietly shining in the background of allexperience. That is peace itself. That is the abode of love and happiness.Don’t think of love, peace and happiness as experiences of the body and mind.They are transparent. Even in the midst of difficult or unpleasant circumstancesthis aware presence that you are is quietly shining in the background.Become acquainted with it. It is what we most simply and intimately are. It isall we ever truly long for. It is that alone which is sought in allrelationships.That one is free of the sense of distance or otherness and hence is known aslove; it is imperturbable and hence known as peace; it is free of the sense oflack and therefore known as happiness.But most simply it is known as ‘I’. Be that. Make friends with it. Live with it.Love it. Rest there.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]The love you describe is not love. It is a state of the mind or body, howeversubtle. True love does not arise, it does not come and go and it cannot be foundin the world. It cannot be found at one moment and lost at another. It hasnothing to do with relationships or others. In fact, love is precisely thedissolution of all otherness or relatedness.Every appearance of the mind, body and world is constantly changing. What is itin your experience that does not change? There is one ‘thing’ alone in yourexperience that does not change. That is you. That is the love you seek.You will never find it because you already and always are it. Not ‘always’ intime but eternally now. Therefore, seeking it is the very denial of itspresence. In seeking it, you compel it to seem as if hidden or lost.It is your self, aware presence, that does not change. You are that for whichyou long and your longing is this very presence of love itself, thinly veiled bythe belief that it is absent, that it is an object that can be lost and found.In other words, the love you seek is present right here in your longing.However, your longing for it as an object in the future, however subtle, veilsits presence in you, as you.“Lord, Thou are the love with which I long for Thee.”Let every direction toward which your longing flows, dissolve in thisunderstanding and the love that is at its heart will remain.Whatever is not present right now is not worthy of the name ‘love’ and islikewise not worthy of our desire. Forget it. Whatever is not present now, evenif it is one day found, will, by definition, one day disappear.Why go for something temporary? It can never fulfil you. Let go of everythingthat can be let go of, everything—and anything that appears can be let goof—including all your, my and everyone else’s ideas about love.In fact, as soon as we look for what is present, it is gone. We cannot focus onor even think about what is truly present. We can only think about an object,about the past, about the future. In other words, we can only think of athought.Thought can never know or find the one thing that it almost constantly seeks. Itcan only dissolve in it. Thinking dies as it turns towards love, like a moth ina flame.Ironically the one thing that is sought in all intimate relationships is thisdeath of the sense of one’s self as a separate entity. This longing for love inintimacy is the longing for this death and, if one shares this love with anapparent other in an intimate relationship, that apparent other shines as abeacon of love and light in one’s life. However, that is not necessary. Thislight and love are shining in all things.The true object of all desire is only this death.Let the mind dissolve in the understanding that it simply cannot go to the placeof love and yet, like a fish in the ocean searching for water, it is alreadyswimming in it.Let everything pass by. Remember William Blake: “He who binds himself to a joydoes the winged life destroy.”The ‘winged life’ is love itself. It is apparently destroyed by our looking forit as an object, by ‘binding’ our self to an object, which means to the past orthe future.Let go, let go, let go. Let your tears be the river into which everything youknow is offered up, all your longing, everything.Someone once asked Mother Meera if it was okay to offer everything to God orwhether only positive things should be offered and she replied, “A child offersits mother a snail, a stick or a stone; the mother doesn’t care what is offered;she is just happy to have been remembered.”Offer everything. The love you seek is all that will remain behind."},{"pageContent":"The Many Names of GodQ: I like the metaphor, in The Transparency of Things, of the paper on whichwords are written. When my attention is turned towards the paper on which thewords are written, I become aware of it, whereas I was not before, although thepaper was always there and the words could not exist without it. However, now Isee the words and the paper together. Likewise, the things in the world cannotexist without that which is, the ground of all things.Yes. In fact, when the paper on which the words are written is pointed out, webecome aware, not of the paper, but of the fact that we are always aware of thepaper.Previously, we thought we were aware of the words alone and unaware of thepaper. Now we see that we are, in fact, aware of the paper all along.However, when we first notice the paper there is a tendency to think that wesuddenly become aware of the words and the paper. This is true but only halftrue!There are, in fact, no words as such, that is, existing in their own right,independent of the paper, entitled to their own label ‘words’, as opposed to‘paper’. There is, in fact, only the paper that takes the shape of or iscoloured by the words without ever becoming anything other than itself.The name ‘word’ is, in fact, just another name for the paper when the paperseems to have become something other than itself.Likewise, ‘person’, ‘other’ or ‘world’, are names that thinking gives toawareness when it imagines that experience is something other than awareness. Asa result of this imagining, the ‘person,’ ‘other’ or ‘world,’ seem to becomeobjects that are distinct from awareness (just as the words are conceived to bedistinct from the paper) and awareness seems to become a limited, locatedsubject.Moreover, it seems that the experience of objects precludes the experience ofawareness, that is, awareness’ knowing and being itself, just as in seeing thewords we are, to begin with, seemingly unaware of the paper.However, just as an examination of the words shows that the paper is always seenand that the words are made only of paper, so a close exploration of theexperience of all apparent objects of the mind, body and world reveals that theyare all made only of awareness.So, if all apparent objects of the mind, body and world are made only ofawareness, it no longer makes sense to speak of objects of the mind, body andworld, for there is no substance there other than awareness. In other words, weno longer start with objects and trace our way back to awareness but rather itis seen that there is, in reality, only awareness and that objects as such are apartial or distorted view of awareness.From the point of view of awareness, which is the only real point of view (andwhich is, of course, not really a point of view), there are no objects. Wecannot even say there is experience, as such, for to do so we must first stepback from or out of experience and look at it from a ‘point of view’. That pointof view is the imaginary inside self. In the absence of this point of view,there is just pure, unnameable, seamless intimacy.The object, other or world only comes into apparent existence when we take upthe imaginary point of view of the subject. However, the point of view of thesubject, the separate inside self, is an imaginary point of view and, therefore,the objects that it apparently knows or sees are equally imaginary.In other words, it is the mind that seems to know objects. Awareness only knowsitself.First we think that there are only objects, that is, only the body, mind andworld. Then we realise there is only our knowing of objects but not theexperience of actual objects themselves. However, if there is only the knowingof objects we cannot say that we know objects, as such, but rather that we onlyknow knowing. And what is it that knows knowing? Only knowing! Knowing is onlyawareness. Therefore all that is known is awareness knowing itself.Starting now with awareness we can say that all apparent objects of the mind,body and world are the names and forms that thinking superimposes onto awarenessitself.If we now abide as awareness, all apparent objects of the mind, body and worlddissolve and are revealed as awareness alone.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]However, if awareness seems not to be present, in other words, if we have,through thinking, seemingly lost our self in objects, then we may trace our wayback, as it were, to the presence of awareness.Seeing oneself as the witness of all apparent objects of the mind, body andworld is the first stage of this tracing back of experience to its source.However, if we truly take our stand as the witness and contemplate experiencefrom there, the subtle suggestion of a distinction between the witness and thewitnessed is seen to be non-existent and, as a result, dissolves into pureexperiencing. In fact, it does not dissolve into anything. It is simply seen tobe only pure, seamless, ever-present experiencing, whose nature is onlyawareness.Therefore, the names we give to the objects of the body, mind and world are, infact, just other names for awareness when it seems to become something otherthan itself. They are the many names of God.However, these names are not just a sign of ignorance. They are a sign ofignorance only if they seem to veil awareness and the peace and happiness thatare inherent in it. Once it is seen clearly that awareness is never veiled andthat there is nothing other than awareness, these very same names are understoodand felt to indicate, express and celebrate the very same awareness they onceseemed to obscure.Hence our tradition of Christian names in which the one self is denoted by manynames. My first teacher told a story in which one of his close students namedhis son Narayan. He did this because in India Narayan is one of the names of Godand every time he spoke or heard the name of his son he wanted to be reminded ofGod.Likewise, whenever we hear our name being called, it is God in us that is beingaddressed. And when we answer ‘Yes,’ it is God in us that is responding, ‘I amhere and I am you!’"},{"pageContent":"Is the World Within?Q: What is meant by “the world is within?”The phrase, “The world is within,” is said to one who believes that the world isoutside of him or herself. And in order to believe that the world is outside onemust first consider him or herself to be an individual entity that lives insidethe body.In other words, this is said to the one who believes in duality, that is, in theexistence of a separate inside self—the subject ‘I’—and a separate outsideobject, other or world.However, if we look towards our self, towards this ‘I’ that knows or experiencesthe world and which is imagined to be located inside the body, we do not findany objective qualities there. However, what we find is undoubtedly present andknowing or aware. That is, we find aware presence or awareness.And what is it that finds or recognises this awareness? Whatever it is, is bothaware and present. That is, this awareness knows itself.Having seen clearly that awareness cannot be found as an object, it becomesclear that it cannot be located either in or as the body, for only somethingwith objective qualities could be located inside another object, just as a tableis located, relatively speaking, inside a room.Likewise, something that has no objective qualities cannot be limited for alimit is, by definition, an objective quality.So instead of thinking, “I, the body/mind, experience the world”, we realisethat “I, this unlocated, unlimited presence of awareness, experience thebody/mind/world”.Now, if we look closely at the experience of the body/mind/world we find that itis made only of sensations, thoughts and perceptions and that all sensations,thoughts and perceptions are inseparable from awareness.We have already seen from our own intimate, direct experience that there is noboundary to awareness and we therefore have no experience of anything outsideit.At this point it becomes clear that our only experience of the world, that is,the current perception, appears within awareness and hence the saying, “Theworld is within”. At this stage the phrase, “The world is within”, is true andreplaces the less true belief that the world is outside.However, although it is true in relation to the previous position in which theworld was considered to be outside, it is found, on looking more deeply at ourexperience, to be untrue.Although the world may be felt to appear within us, there is still a distinctionbetween the world made of perceptions and the awareness in which it appears. Inother words, there is still a subtle duality.However, if we go deeply into the actual experience of these perceptions, wefind no substance there other than perceiving, and if we go deeply intoperceiving we find only awareness itself. That is, it finds or knows onlyitself. At this stage the phrase, “The world is within you”, is seen to beuntrue and may be abandoned.It becomes clear that it was a mistake to start with the world and to think ofit arising within awareness. We only started there because of the initialpresumption that the world is outside and we wanted to engage that presumptionon its own terms.In reality, there is nothing else in the experience of the world other thanawareness itself and there is no inside or outside of awareness. Nothing arisesinside or outside awareness nor is there anything present in awareness otherthan itself which could rise up within it.So we start with awareness which is our primary and, in reality, our onlyexperience and see that it is this awareness that takes the shape of perceivingand, as a result, seems to become a world, but never actually becomes anythingother than itself, just as a computer screen seems to take the shape of numerousdocuments and images but in reality always remains simply the screen.And what is it that experiences awareness seemingly taking the shape of allexperience? Only awareness!That is, it is awareness that is always, only ever knowing and being itself, andall seeming objects, others and the world are simply modulations of this knowingpresence.At this stage, having previously seen that the world is not experienced outsideour self, it is similarly understood that the world is not experienced insideour self either but rather that there is just awareness knowing and beingitself, with no inside, outside, object, world, other or self ever actuallyfound or experienced as such.There is just awareness knowing and being itself, seamlessly intimately one withall experience. And because there is no possibility of any ‘two-ness’ or‘not-awareness-ness’, there is no possibility of the presence of an entity orself to feel a sense of lack, need, separation or otherness.For this reason experience is not just awareness knowing and being itself butalso loving itself. That is, experience itself knows only complete intimacy,not-other-ness.All the apparent objects of the mind, body and world are made out of theintimacy of awareness, out of love.It is for this reason that William Blake said, “Eternity is in love with theproductions of time”.However, even to say that experience is only awareness knowing, being and lovingitself is not quite accurate and, as the mind searches for a word or a phrasethat would adequately express the nature of experience, it dissolves in theimpossibility of the task. It is like a candle that naturally burns itself out."},{"pageContent":"The Shadow of the Separate SelfQ: I understand in theory that I am consciousness but in my actual experience Ifeel that what I am is specifically connected to this body. I feel that I amlimited, located and separate.The ‘I-am-only-the-body’ feeling is the root cause of all suffering. Thisfeeling thrives on inadvertence. It cannot stand being clearly seen. It is likea shadow that vanishes when a light is shone on it. In this case clear seeing isthe light.First, see clearly that you are the aware presence in which these words andwhatever else is being experienced in this moment are appearing.Now see clearly that all we know of the body is a sensation or cluster ofsensations and, if our eyes are open, a visual perception appearing in thispresence.At least for the time being, separate out this presence from the sensation. Seeclearly that sensations flow through presence in the same way that the sound ofthe car that just went by flowed through it.In both cases presence remains intact, unchanged in any way by the appearanceand disappearance of the sensation or the perception that appeared in it.Presence is therefore entirely independent of the sensations and perceptionsthat appear in it, although the sensations and perceptions are entirelydependent on it.However, after the sensation of the body and the perception of the sound, athought appears that says, “‘I,’ this presence, am the sensation of the body butam not the perception of the sound.”This is, in fact, not true of our experience because the sensation to which thethought refers has already vanished and yet presence is still present to witnessthis new thought. In other words, this new thought identifies presence withsomething that is no longer present, that is, with a fleeting sensation.How can presence be a sensation, if it remains after the very sensation withwhich it is supposedly identified, has vanished?In this way, the belief in being a separate entity that is exclusivelyassociated with the body is created as an afterthought, that is, after the factof sensing or perceiving. It is not present during the sensing and theperceiving itself.It is thought alone that collates one series of sensations and perceptions—thebody—and identifies them exclusively with our self, aware presence, therebycreating an apparent ‘I’, and that collates another series of perceptions andout of them imagines an apparent object, other or outside world.It is with this thought alone that an imaginary line is drawn through theseamless intimacy of experience, thereby dividing one part of it fromanother—‘I’ the body and ‘not I’ the object, other or world.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]We normally think that the skin is the container of all bodily sensations.However, bodily sensations are not housed within the contour of the skin. Theskin is, in fact, simply another sensation and one sensation does not appearwithin another sensation. All sensations appear in our self, aware presence.We normally consider that ‘I’ am the envelope in which all bodily sensations arehoused. However, this ‘me’ is an imaginary contour, made out of thought, whichis drawn around a cluster of sensations.Everything inside this imaginary contour is considered to be ‘me’ and everythingoutside it becomes ‘not me’, which is simply another name for objects, othersand the world.How can ‘I’ be this contour, this thought? ‘I’ am not a thought or a sensation.‘I’ am that to which or in which thoughts and sensations appear.The separate inside self and the separate outside object, other or world are twosides of the same coin. The coin is ignorance—the ignoring of the true nature ofexperience.It is with this thought alone that our self, aware presence, is apparentlyidentified with and limited to a cluster of sensations.Presence appears, as a result, to assume the qualities of the body. That is, itseems to become limited, located and separate. In this way the separate ‘me’ isseemingly born. However, this contour is nonexistent as an actual experience. Itis made only out of thought.Try to find this contour as an actual experience. Where is the line in ouractual experience between this bodily sensation and that perception of theworld? Is it made out of anything other than the thought that thinks it? Andeven if we do find something that seems to be a good candidate for such adividing line, is it not itself simply another appearance within presence?Once this investigation of experience has been carried out, the belief that weare a body is irreparably damaged if not immediately destroyed. However, thefeeling of being a body is more pernicious and lingers in spite of ourunderstanding to the contrary.However, if we keep returning to this exploration of our actual experience, itbecomes more and more obvious that we are aware presence itself and that thispresence is not identified with a body and has no inherent limitation orlocation.Nothing else remains to be done once this exploration has brought about thisunderstanding. We simply remain as this aware presence and the mind, body andworld are gradually and effortlessly realigned with it, although we maycooperate with this realignment.In fact, we have always only been that even when we believed and felt ourselvesto be otherwise. However, now we abide there knowingly.If it seems that this is forgotten, we just return to this exploration andre-establish the truth of the matter for ourselves, in our own experientialunderstanding. This naturally and spontaneously returns us to abiding knowinglyas presence.As time goes on, deeper and deeper layers of experience are subjected to andcolonised by this experiential understanding and become as it were permeated andsaturated by the peace, happiness and love that are inherent in presence.In fact, all experience is always only permeated and saturated with presencewhether we know it or not, but now it is known and felt as such."},{"pageContent":"The Amness of Self is the Isness of ThingsThe sensation of the wind on our face is one single sensation. However, thinkingconceptualises it as two. Thinking fragments this single sensation into twoapparent objects, the wind and the face. In fact, it is one. We could call thisnew sensation ‘windface.’The division of ‘windface’ into wind and face is a conceptual division thatseemingly divides experience into a face, ‘me’, and the wind, ‘not me’, As aresult the ‘person’ and the ‘world’ seem to become two distinct and independententities or objects.In this way the seamless intimacy of experience is fragmented into two apparentparts—an inside self and an outside object, other or world—which are imagined tobe joined together by an act of knowing, feeling or perceiving. Hence we say, “Iknow such and such”, “I feel the wind”, “I love you” and “I see the tree”.However, in the seeing of a tree for instance, there is no seer and there is noseen. There is no inside ‘I’ that sees and there is no outside ‘tree’ that isseen.The ‘I’ and the ‘tree’ are concepts superimposed by thinking onto the reality ofthe experience, which in this case could simply be called ‘seeing’.It is thinking alone that divides the seamless intimacy of experiencing into asubject and an object, into an ‘I’ that sees and a ‘tree’ that is seen. However,awareness, or ‘I,’ and the reality of the tree are not two separate experiences.They are one.‘I’ and ‘tree’ are one experience in the same way that the wind and the face areone experience. There is never a subject or an object of experience. There isalways only seamless intimate experiencing. Or we could say that the apparent‘I’ and the apparent tree share the same reality, are the same reality. It isonly a concept, an idea, which apparently divides them.However, this division between the seer and the seen, between the experiencerand the experienced, never actually happens. Separation is an illusion. It isnever actually experienced.In other words, I don’t see a tree. In the experience of seeing, I am the tree.I am its reality. The only substance present in our experience of the tree isseeing and seeing or, more generally, experiencing, is awareness, our self.The awareness that is seeing and the reality of that which is seen are not twoseparate things. They are one and the same.We should say, “I am tree-ing”. That is, “‘I’, awareness, is treeing”. Theamness of ‘I’ and the isness of ‘tree’ share their being.The amness of self is the isness of things.The apparent mind, body and world is ‘I’ mind/body/world-ing.All the great religions are founded upon this realisation. For instance inChristianity the saying, “I and my father are one”, means precisely this. Itmeans that ‘I’, the awareness that is seeing these words or experiencingwhatever is being experienced in this moment, is one with whatever is beingexperienced, that is, it is one with the reality of the universe.The Sufis say, “There is only God”. The Hindus say, “The Atman (the apparentlyindividual self) and Brahman (the ultimate reality of the universe) are one. TheBuddhists say, “Nirvana and samsara are one”.This is not an extraordinary experience, known only by a few enlightened sages.It is the direct, intimate, immediate experience of each of us, although it maynot have been noticed.In fact, the knowing of this unity between ‘I’ and the ‘world’, is a veryfamiliar experience. It is known as beauty. When we are struck by the beauty ofan object or landscape, all that keeps us at a distance or separate from thatobject dissolves and in that timeless moment, timeless because the mind is notpresent there, we realise our identity with the apparent object.The experience of beauty is the dissolution of the apparent ‘objectness’ of theobject and the ‘subjectness’ of our self, leaving only the seamless intimacy ofexperiencing.Of course, when the mind returns it recreates the separate inside self and theseparate outside object, other or world and we think and feel, as a result, that‘I’ see the ‘landscape’. Thinking now attributes beauty to the landscape and inthat moment beauty is downgraded from a revelation of the eternal nature thatpervades all seeming things into a relative quality of the mind that belongs tosome objects and not others.In that moment, time and distance or ‘otherness’, which is another name forspace, are created and the true experience of beauty is again veiled.When the same dissolution between ‘I’ and an apparent other is known, the verysame experience is known as love. Happiness, peace, humour and intelligence areall names that are given to the experience of this direct recognition of theseamless intimacy of experience. In fact, all the names of the mind, body andworld refer ultimately to this one reality.It is for this reason that love, happiness and peace are said to beunconditional, absolute. They depend on nothing. They are interwoven into thefabric of all experience.Once the ‘I’ and the object, other or world have been conceptually separatedfrom the seamless intimacy of experience, love, happiness, peace, beauty etc.,which are inherent in all experience, seem to become veiled and, as a result,the seemingly inside self embarks on a search for them in the apparently outsideworld.The resolution of the search, which is known as peace, happiness or love, alwaysinvolves the recognition that experience is not divided into two parts—‘I’ and‘other’, ‘me’ and the ‘world’—whether or not it is actually formulated in theseterms. Likewise, suffering always involves the forgetting or ignoring of thissimple, primordial fact of experience.Happiness is simply the unveiling of this ignorance. It is not a new experience.It does not come and go. It cannot be given or withdrawn. It can only appear tobe forgotten and remembered or recognised. It is like the keys under the papers.They seemed to be lost but are, in fact, always there.In the experience of peace and happiness the inside self and the outside worlddissolve. In the experience of love, the one who loves and the one that is loveddissolve.In fact, our only experience of the world and all others is made only ofknowing, so we could say that in the experience of peace and happiness, theapparent otherness or outsideness of the world is dissolved in our experientialunderstanding that there is always only knowingness or awareness. That is peace,happiness, love and beauty.However, it is only the mind that thinks that peace, happiness and love seem tobe lost and seem to be found.Presence never loses itself."},{"pageContent":"Reality is Not MysteriousQ: It seems that reality is completely mysterious, beyond the grasp of the mind.Is there anything the mind can do to approach it?The fact that the mind is asking this question already betrays the belief in themind’s ability to do something to approach the truth. So, even if the responseis that there is nothing to be done, this would simply add a layer of beliefthat there is nothing to do, on top of the deeper feeling that there issomething to do. However, the problem lies in the first statement, that realityis mysterious.Reality is not mysterious. It is present, here, shining in this currentexperience. It is substantial, intimate and immediate.Implicit in the idea that reality is mysterious is that it is somehow not beingexperienced now. It is considered that what is being experienced now are words,chairs, walls, fields, trees, sky, bodies, thoughts etc., and that reality isconcealed behind this current experience and is veiled by it.It is considered that the mind cannot know reality but that it can know things.It is considered that chairs, walls, fields, trees and sky are known by the mindbut that reality is beyond that and unknown. However, the mind knows nothing. Itis known. Words, chairs, walls, fields, trees and sky are not known by the mind.Our only knowledge of them is the mind.The mind in the broadest sense is simply this current thought, image, sensationor perception. It is the mind itself that postulates something called a ‘tree,’which exists independently and which is perceived by the mind.However, we have no experience of a tree outside the mind. In fact, we don’teven have the experience of a tree within mind. The so-called ‘tree’ is, infact, just one brush stroke in the total field of seemingly objectiveperceptions. We never experience the brush stroke by itself. There is only thetotality of the canvas from moment to moment, with no separate parts.The concept of an ‘individual tree’ is, of course, experienced, but that towhich the concept refers, the so-called ‘tree,’ is never experienced, as such.This does not invalidate the concept of a tree. However, it invalidates thebelief that there is something in our actual experience that corresponds to theconcept.So, we come to see clearly that the ‘tree’ is simply the concept of the tree.The concept of a tree is an abstraction. It is an idea that is supposed tocorrespond to a part of the current objective experience, a visual perception,and yet even that perception of the tree is never experienced, as such. Thereare always other elements in the field of vision.However, even to say there are other elements is also an abstraction. There areno elements. There are no parts to the current experience. There is only theseamless totality from moment to moment.Now, if we allow this totality to present itself just as it is, we find that itis not made of separate thoughts, sensations and perceptions. It is one seamlessexperience of thought/sensation/perception.And if we look closely at our experience we see that this kaleidoscopic objectis, in fact, no object at all. It is, in fact, only made ofthinking/sensing/perceiving.And if we look closely again and ask ourselves what is the relationship ofthinking/sensing/perceiving to our self, the aware presence that illumines andknows it, we find that there is no part of the experience that is not saturatedand permeated with our self.Even that is not quite right, for there is no ‘part,’ no ‘thing,’ to besaturated or permeated. It is not like a sponge saturated with water. That isjust a manner of speaking.Rather, there is only this aware presence taking the shape of experiencing, thatis, taking the shape of thinking/sensing/perceiving, seemingly metamorphosinginto a body, a mind and a world, without ever being or becoming anything otherthan itself.Even that is not quite right. Our self, awareness, does not take any shapes. Itis always only itself. All these different statements are attempts to break downthe straightjacket in which thinking has imprisoned experience in an attempt toreveal the reality of experience itself in an experiential way.As such, each statement is, in a sense, more refined or closer to a trueexpression of reality than the one it replaces, but ultimately none are true.They are all simply evocations of reality.All that is ever experienced is awareness. And it is awareness that isexperiencing awareness.There is nothing mysterious about that. The mystery is always for thought, neverfor our self. It is thought that has postulated the separate existence ofobjects, made out of something other than our self, called matter.This thought veils the true nature of experience that we now believe to bemysterious and not known. However, for our self, aware presence, there is nomystery. Reality is all that is ever known.Reality is staring itself in the face. It is waving in the tree-tops, singing inthe birds, glowing in the sky, babbling in your thoughts, rumbling in thetraffic, crying in the child. It is calling out to itself in every minute nuanceof every experience, ‘My love, my love, my love!’So, in reality, it is the trees, sky, thoughts, traffic, etc. that aremysterious. In fact, they are so mysterious that no one has ever seen, heard,touched, tasted or smelt them, as such. It is objects—the body, mind andworld—that are truly mysterious, so mysterious, in fact, that they are nowhereto be found.Reality is the only thing that is not mysterious. It is so well and intimatelyknown! And as reality, awareness, presence, our own being, is all there is,nothing is mysterious.However, that of course does not mean that it can be known or framed by themind. For the mind that believes its own abstract conceptions of reality to betrue, that believes in the reality of cars, people, houses, chairs etc., realityitself seems abstract, conceptual and mysterious.What is real for awareness is abstract and utterly mysterious for the mind andwhat is seemingly real for the mind is utterly nonexistent for awareness.However, the mind’s point of view is only legitimate from its own point of view!In fact, it is simply the arrogance of thought that thinks reality ismysterious. It is the mind saying, “I know things but I do not know reality”.But the mind knows nothing. It is known. And in the knowing of whatever isknown, awareness is knowing itself, being itself and loving itself,simultaneously.There is only reality knowing, being and loving itself eternally.Nothing else truly is."},{"pageContent":"Awareness Always Knows ItselfQ: Is it true that we cannot be aware of awareness?It depends what is meant by ‘we’. If by ‘we’ is meant the mind or the person,the answer is ‘No, we cannot be aware of awareness’. However, the mind and theperson are not entities that can be aware of anything.Whatever it is that is aware of anything, such as a mind or a person, is what isreferred to by the word ‘awareness’. It is obviously awareness that is aware. Sothe question could be rephrased, ‘Is it true that awareness is not aware ofitself’?The suggestion that awareness is not aware of itself is an expression offundamental ignorance.Inherent in the statement that awareness is not aware of itself is anacknowledgement of the presence of awareness. The statement acknowledges thatawareness is present but suggests that it is not experienced or known, that is,that it is not experiencing or knowing itself.However, if awareness is not experienced, how can we legitimately claim that itis present? We cannot legitimately assert the presence of something that is notexperienced. What knowledge of its presence would we have outside our experienceof it?The claim that awareness is present comes from direct experience. Simply askyourself the question, “Am I aware?” The answer, “Yes”, comes from theexperience of awareness knowing itself.If this were not the case we would be able to deny its presence. Ask yourselfthe question, “Can I legitimately deny the presence of awareness in this moment?Can I deny my own being”? No! Awareness is required to hear the very questionabout its own presence. I can never experience my own non-existence. In otherwords, non-existence is always a concept, never an experience.However, let us take it further. Let us assume for the time being that, as thequestion suggests, awareness is not aware of itself. There is obviously someexperience taking place in this moment, for instance the sight of these wordsand whatever other thoughts, images, sensations and perceptions that are beingperceived. There is something that is being experienced, whatever the particularcharacter of that ‘something’.We do not need to know what that ‘something’ is. In fact, we do not know whatanything truly is. But we know that there is experience.Now, if we claim that we are not experiencing awareness, that is, that we arenot experiencing or knowing our own being, but that we are experiencingsomething—these words or whatever—then, by definition, these words (and whateverelse is being experienced) cannot themselves be awareness, which we claim is notbeing experienced.So, in effect we are claiming that awareness is present but is not beingexperienced and that these words are also present and that they are beingexperienced.In short, we are saying that in this current experience there are two things,that is, awareness and these words. However, is this current experience one ortwo experiences? Experience and awareness are one.When the witnessed object is thus seen to be no object at all, its apparentreality vanishes, leaving awareness, its real reality, the witness, alone.However, the witness cannot stand alone. It, by definition, requires thewitnessed.So, with this experiential understanding, the subtle superimposition of‘witnessing’ onto awareness, dissolves, and awareness is left all alone, as iteternally is.It is for this reason that it is sometimes said that awareness is the witnessand substance of all seeming things. If we still believe in the apparent realityof things, awareness is conceived as their witness. But when the apparentreality of things collapses, witnessing collapses with it and only substance isleft. However, it is not the substance of something. It is just substance, justreality.Each time we explore our experience in this way we are, whether we realise it ornot, clearing part of the jungle of dualistic thinking. Our old beliefs cannotstand the light of this understanding. They simply collapse as a result of beingclearly seen for what they are, that is, they collapse because they are seen tohave no experiential basis.And with the collapse of these beliefs comes the exposure of all the feelingsthat relied on them for their existence. There is no experiential or conceptualsupport for these feelings any more. The beliefs upon which the feelings havefed for so long have dissolved, and as a result the feelings too, in time,dissolve. They die of exposure to the light of understanding.This has a profound effect on the quality of the appearances. The filter ofdualistic thinking and feeling which we superimposed onto sensations andperceptions, that is, onto the body and world, is withdrawn, and as a result thebody and world, which in fact have always only ever been what they truly are,are now actually felt as such.And just as our previous experience of the world perfectly conformed to thebeliefs and feelings that we entertained about it, simply because it was, as itwere, projected through them, so our new experience also perfectly reflects thisnew experiential understanding.In short, the world becomes friendly, intimate, vibrant, loving. And as therealignment of thoughts, feelings and perceptions with our experientialunderstanding continues and deepens, the world becomes more and moretransparent.So, it is not that we do not experience awareness. It is rather that we, thatis, awareness itself, only experiences awareness. It experiences nothing otherthan itself.In fact, it would be more accurate to say that we do not experience an object,world, body or mind, as such.Experience is always only this present awareness and its ever-present knowing ofitself in and as the seamless intimacy of this, and all experience is its lovingitself.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]If we look deeply into our experience we find that, far from awareness beingunknown and objects being known, it is awareness that is, in fact, all that isever known, and that which we previously considered to be known, that is, theworld, others and objects, are in fact never known, as they are normallyconceived.That which knows is awareness and all it ever knows is itself. It is notpossible for awareness to know or experience anything other than itself.Awareness not only knows itself, but always and only knows itself, throughoutand in between the three states of waking, dreaming and sleeping. In fact thethree states of waking, dreaming and sleeping are like modulations of onesubstance, like an eddy or a current within the ocean of awareness.It is sometimes said that the experience of awareness knowing itself is anon-objective experience. However, this is a half-truth spoken to those whodeeply believe in the real existence of objects.To say that awareness is non-objective suggests that there is something elsethat is objective. It is to suggest that objects are real in themselves.However, there are no objects as such and no subject.There is no subjective experiencer and there is no object that is experienced.There is only experiencing from moment to moment and the substance of thisexperiencing is only awareness.The mind, body and world are projected within awareness and made only out ofawareness, and yet they are projected in such a way as to seem to be bothseparate from and made out of something other than awareness.Awareness not only creates whatever it imagines—it also has a veiling power bywhich the true nature of its creation is concealed and projected in such a waythat it seems to be other than itself. The tool through which it seeminglycreates and veils is what we call ‘mind’.However, the mind is only a mind from the illusory point of view of a mind.There is no such thing in reality.This veiling power is sometimes called ignorance, because it is the apparentignoring of awareness. Awareness, as it were, veils, ignores or forgets itselfby taking the shape of the thought that imagines it is absent.However, even this shape is only an expression of awareness knowing and beingitself. Therefore, awareness is never truly veiled and therefore there is notrue ignorance. However, the illusion of ignorance is very powerful.It is this veiling, ignoring or forgetting which allows the mind, body and worldto appear as outside, separate and other, that is, which allows them to appearreal in their own right, that is, independent of awareness. In this way theyseem to appropriate the reality which properly belongs to awareness alone.This veiling, ignoring or forgetting is synonymous with the apparent birth ofthe separate self and separate world. It is also known as suffering orunhappiness. It is the veiling of the happiness which is inherent in the simpleknowing of our own being.However, just as our self, awareness, has this veiling, ignoring or forgettingpower, it also has a revealing or remembering power, with which it comes to knowagain, to re-cognise or to remember its own nature. In fact, ‘mind’, ‘body’ and‘world’ are simply the names that the mind gives to awareness when it seems notto be known.However, it is not that at one time awareness is veiled by objects and atanother time knows itself. It is rather that from the point of view ofawareness, which is the only real point of view, awareness is always knowingitself—it is the ever-present knowing of itself—and from the point of view ofthinking, awareness is sometimes known and sometimes unknown. So, this apparentforgetting or unknowing of awareness is for the mind, not for awareness.In the presence of apparent objects awareness knows itself as each of theseapparent objects. That is, it knows itself taking the shape of experience frommoment to moment. However, in doing so it never knows anything other thanitself. It only knows ‘something other’ from the point of view of thinking.When each of these apparent objects disappears, it disappears or merges intoawareness. In fact, it was never anything other than awareness in the firstplace. At this point awareness simply continues to know itself as it alwaysdoes. This is known as the experience of love, peace, happiness, beauty orunderstanding. These are some of the many names given to awareness when it knowsitself unmediated through the apparent veil of objectivity.Experience is one ever-present, homogeneous, substantial, self-knowing,self-luminous, self-loving presence. It is always only ever itself, and alwaysonly ever knows itself."},{"pageContent":"There is No Real IgnoranceQ: What is the cause of ignorance?In this question, there is a presumption, as in all questions about a cause,that there are at least two things, one, a cause and, two, its effect,ignorance.In other words duality—and the diversity and multiplicity that are implicit init—is inherent in the question about cause, in the question, ‘Why?’Duality, as we have seen, only exists as an idea in the mind. It has no realexistence outside the thought that thinks it. The belief that duality is real iswhat is referred to as ignorance. By ‘ignorance’ is meant the ignoring orapparent veiling of the true nature of reality.Therefore, the question ‘why’ or the question as to the cause of ignorance,presumes the very ignorance about which it asks and which is found, uponinvestigation, to be non-existent.So, to the question, ‘What is the cause of ignorance?’ we can only answer, ‘Thevery question about ignorance itself.’ Ignorance is created and given seemingexistence with the thought that thinks it. It has no other cause.However, all thoughts are known. All that is known is knowledge. Knowledge ismade of knowing. And knowing is made of our self, aware presence.Therefore, even the thought about ignorance is, in fact, made only of our self,aware presence, and is therefore not really ignorance at all.Therefore, we cannot even say that ignorance is created by the thought thatthinks it because the ignorance that is referred to is at all times utterlynon-existent.Even if we provisionally accept that ignorance is real, it is still not possibleto find a cause for it.In such a case, the cause for ignorance cannot be ignorance itself becauseignorance is the effect for which we are seeking a cause. Therefore, the causefor ignorance in such a case must be free of ignorance, that is, true knowledge.However, in this apparent ignorance for which we are seeking a cause, trueknowledge is, by definition, not present, because ignorance is defined as thelack of true knowledge. How then could true knowledge give rise to somethingthat is not itself, not made out of itself? An effect must contain the causewithin it, as bread contains flour. How, therefore, could reality give rise tounreality?At the absolute level there is only aware presence and the nature of awarepresence is to be and to be aware. Aware presence cannot ‘not be’ and it cannot‘not be aware’.Awareness and being are ever-present. All there is, is aware presence and it isitself and is aware of itself eternally. Awareness cannot be ignorant of itself.Therefore, ignorance at this level is also a concept. It is equivalent tosaying, while watching a film, that the screen is not present and, as a result,asking, “What is the cause of the absence of the screen?” Even if the image isone of blackness, nothingness, it is still made of the screen. Therefore,ignorance is never an experience. It is simply an idea.It is for this reason that advaita does not really answer the ‘Why?’ question.It is not an avoidance of the issue. It is the dissolution of the issue inunderstanding.All answers about the cause for ignorance that acknowledge the existence ofignorance may pacify the mind temporarily but they do not take us beyond themind. Such provisional answers generate beliefs and these beliefs in time turninto a religion, in this case an advaita religion.However, understanding destroys these false beliefs once and for all and withtheir destruction the mind’s armoury is slowly dismantled until all that is leftis open unknowing. When we know that it is not possible to know anythingobjective with absolute certainty, we cease to look for knowledge in the wrongplace and, as a result, the only thing that is truly known shines in allexperience."},{"pageContent":"Nothing Ever DisappearsNothing ever disappears. How could something that is, become ‘is not’? How couldexistence become non-existence? Where would the substance of existence go if itwere to disappear? Where would its isness, its being, its presence, go? Intowhat would it vanish?What is it that disappears when an image on the screen disappears? The substanceof the image is the screen and the screen does not disappear. It simply takesthe shape of the next image.This may seem hard to understand only because we believe that when a so-calledobject is present, it is present as an independent object. We think that thememory of the apple is imaginary but that when the actual apple is present it isreal as an object.It is true that the memory of the apple is only an image in the mind. However,we fail to notice that when we see the actual apple it is, in fact, also only animage. All we know of the apple, in that case, is seeing. And when we touch theapple, we only know touching; when we taste it we only know tasting; when wesmell it we only know smelling.We never experience the actual apple as it is conceived, that is, as an objectin its own right with its own independent and separate existence.Therefore, there is no difference in our actual experience between the substanceof the apple that appears in memory and the substance of the actual apple thatappears in ‘real time’, Our only knowledge of both is made out of mind—out ofseeing, tasting, touching and smelling—and the substance of mind is onlyawareness.That which is truly present as the so-called apple is, in fact, only awarenessitself. There is no other substance in experience other than awareness and thatnever disappears. That is our ever-present experience whether it is realised ornot.How could awareness experience its own absence or disappearance? It is our owndirect, intimate, immediate experience that this ever-present always-herenessthat we are, is the sole substance of all experience. In fact, the apple, theobject or indeed the world, as such, are simply the apparent forgetting of thissimple fact of experience.However, this forgetting takes place in the mind alone. Presence never trulyforgets itself.If we take our stand in the mind, then the peace and happiness that are inherentin our self, aware presence, seem to be obscured.Who is the one that takes its stand in the mind? The mind! Only thinkingimagines that imaginary one! The imaginary inside self is only real from its ownimaginary point of view.Presence is only seemingly veiled by this imagination but is never actuallyveiled. It is the ever-present knowing of itself alone."},{"pageContent":"Pure Unclouded AwarenessQ: Our nature is pure unclouded awareness. Love is not a definable thing. It isbeyond the realm of our habitual thoughts-feelings-actions. However, ourthoughts-feelings-actions originate within this awareness. How would you definein a quick simple statement, the core essence of this teaching and the way toget there?The essence of this teaching is precisely the pure unclouded awareness that youcite.Without a question, there is no teaching. There is only this pure uncloudedawareness, knowing-being-loving itself. However, it is not owned or known bysomeone.A question is like a bucket that is dipped into this ocean of pure uncloudedawareness. What comes out is intimately and uniquely tailored to the shape ofthe bucket.When the answer is heard it resonates with the same pure unclouded awareness inthe apparent hearer. That is, aware presence recognises itself.At this stage the bucket dissolves and only pure unclouded awareness, remains.There is no teacher who answers and no student who hears. Nor is there anyformulated teaching or fixed point of view or attitude from which the responsescome.It is precisely because the water is fluid and transparent and has no form orcolour of its own that it is able to flow into each bucket and, as it were, takeup its unique shape.This is how that teaching works at the level of words—pure silence ‘flows’ intothe question, acclimatises itself to it and finally dissolves the question intoitself.The teaching is not the words that are framed in response to a question. Thewords are just the packaging. The teaching is that from which the words come.The only reason pure unclouded awareness takes the form of a response in wordsis to dance with the form that it took in the question.In fact, a true question that arises in the heart compels this pure uncloudedawareness to appear in a form that will correspond with it. That is why asincere desire for a friend or a teacher will always compel this pure uncloudedawareness to appear in human form.Pure unclouded awareness is simply responding to its own desire, and in thissense the human teacher is a devotee of pure unclouded awareness every bit asmuch as the apparent student or friend.The dance that ensues may be long or short but in the end both the thoughts thatmake up the question and the thoughts that make up the response dissolve in thetrue answer, which is their source and substance.In this dissolution the teacher and the student lose their apparent separatenessand find themselves as one in love or friendship.What is the way to get there? Stand up and try to take a step towards yourself.In which direction do you turn? Try to take a step away from yourself. In whichdirection do you go?The standing up, the trying to take a step, the search for a direction, therealisation there is none, the encounter with a teaching or teacher and thesilence that remains are all part of ‘the way to get there’.When the ‘there’ dissolves, the ‘here’ is revealed. When the ‘here’ dissolves,our self, aware presence, stands alone."},{"pageContent":"The Burnt RopeQ: I have heard it said that there is sometimes an initial awakening followed bya process of stabilsation. What is this referring to?There is no personal, separate entity anywhere in the universe at any time. So,there is no question of a separate person awakening and even less of thisimaginary ‘me’ becoming stabilised in this realisation.However, although awareness is always only knowing itself, there is a timelessmoment when awareness recognises itself knowingly. And there is also asubsequent process in time whereby the old patterns of thinking and feeling aregradually realigned with this self-recognition.There is a moment when it becomes obvious that we are this presence of awarenessand that this presence is without limitation, was not born, cannot die and nevermoves, changes or is affected by any appearance, irrespective of the characterof that appearance.With this experiential understanding it becomes obvious that there never hasbeen a separate inside self, located in the body experiencing an outside world.And by the same token, when we discover that the apparent subject within thebody is a pseudo subject, so we discover that the apparent object, other orworld outside the body is a pseudo object.In other words, when we discover that there is no subject we simultaneouslydiscover that there are no objects.This clear seeing of what we are is instantaneous—in fact, it is timeless—andonce it is our own experience it cannot be taken away. However, it is usuallyfollowed by an apparent process in time where the residues of ignorance, thatis, the residues of ignoring what we truly are and believing ourselves insteadto be a separate, limited self, which have deeply conditioned the body and themind, in most cases for decades, unwind slowly in the light of thisunderstanding.Ignorance, at the level of the mind, consists in the belief that our self, awarepresence, is located somewhere in the body, for instance behind the eyes. Oncethis core idea about our identity has taken root, most subsequent thoughts aboutourselves contain this belief at their origin.Once this belief has been uprooted by clear seeing, the foundation of allsubsequent psychological thoughts, which were previously founded upon it, nolonger have any credibility.Such thoughts may still appear from time to time, simply out of habit orinertia, and initially may look identical to those that were present when thebelief in a separate entity was still active.However, they are very different. Their heart has been removed. In this case thethoughts that seem to betray a belief in the separate entity are simply habitsof the mind. They are empty. There is no self in them. There is only the carcassleft.In time this habit of thinking on behalf of a separate entity shows up lessfrequently because it is no longer substantiated by the belief that such anentity is real.A similar process takes place with our feelings at the level of the body,although it may seem to take longer for this understanding to infiltrate thebody because ignorance is more deeply rooted there.For years the body is considered to house the separate self. At an early age wecome to think and feel that this cluster of sensations called the body is ‘me’or that ‘I’ am located somewhere inside it. Through lack of clear seeing wereally think and feel that there is experiential evidence for the existence of aseparate self inside the body.In fact, the body even adopts various postures, attitudes and behavioural habitsthat are consistent with the belief and feeling that ‘I’ am somewhere inside it.These attitudes are enshrined at the muscular and even skeletal level. Forinstance, an attitude of fear and resistance may cause us to stand in a stoopedor defensive posture, which will, over time, shape our muscles and bones.The clear seeing that there is no separate self residing in the body isinstantaneous but that doesn’t mean that the contractions in the body thatdeveloped as a result of this belief vanish instantaneously. They do not!There is an apparent process in time during which these residues of ignorance atthe level of the body are gradually dissolved. And just as the body onceexpressed the belief in our identity as a separate entity, so it now begins torealign itself with the new understanding and feeling of our self as unlimited,unlocated presence. And in time our activities and relationships naturally andeffortlessly begin to express this new experiential understanding.So there is an unfolding that takes place in the mind and the body after thisself-recognition has taken place. However, this unfolding is not an unfolding ofa separate self towards freedom or liberation. It comes from freedom anddissolves the residues of the sense of being a separate self, in the mind andthe body.How does this realignment take place? What do we do if we burn the toast whenmaking breakfast? We just open the window! In time the residues of smoke and thesmell of burning are naturally and effortlessly dissipated into the surroundingtransparent air.It is the same here. We simply abide knowingly as this open, empty transparentpresence and welcome these residues of feeling, moving and acting on behalf of aseparate inside self without any agenda. We offer the density of the separateself to the openness and transparency of presence and allow them to be infusedwith its substance.As the mind and body become more transparent they naturally and effortlesslybegin to express the love, freedom and intelligence that are inherent in ourtrue nature of impersonal, unlimited presence.Enjoyment, enthusiasm, creativity, friendship and humour are just some of itsexpressions.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]In India they liken the situation to a rope that has been burned in a fire.Although the rope still retains its shape and appearance, if it is touched, itdisintegrates. It is empty. It has no substance. Its inside has been burned out.In this case the belief in the separate self is the inside, the substance of therope. Understanding is the fire. The shell is the habit of thinking and feelingthat remains for some time.These habits of thinking and feeling and, of course, the activities andbehaviour that spring from them, have been laid down over a period of many yearsor decades. They are the conditioning that forms the reservoir of tendenciesthat go into the make-up of our character.Not all of this conditioning is dependent on the belief in and feeling of beinga separate entity. However, many of those aspects that are dependent on it mayhave been laid down very early in our lives and, as such, are embedded deepwithin the structure of the body and mind.It takes time for these deeply ingrained habits of thinking, feeling, reacting,relating and behaving to percolate up into the light of awareness.After this self-recognition has taken place we no longer have a vested interestin keeping these aspects of our character concealed. We no longer resist themand therefore they tend to manifest for a time more than they used to. However,it would be a misinterpretation to think that such behaviour is a display ofignorance. It is simply the surfacing and discarding of the residues ofignorance at the level of the body and mind.Conversely, it would be a misunderstanding to condone any old obnoxiousbehaviour with a mantra of, ‘It all happens to no-one’. That is pseudonon-duality.It is for each one to see whether these habits of feeling, acting and relatingon behalf of a separate, inside self betray the belief in a separate entity orwhether they are simply old residues that are working their way out of thesystem. Neither of these possibilities is a problem.The only problem would be to appropriate the ‘It all happens to no-one’ mantrathereby using the non-dual teaching as a defence mechanism to perpetuate thesense of separation."},{"pageContent":"The True RevolutionAll experiencing is utterly intimately pervaded by our own self, aware presence.However, when we imagine that only one little part of it, this little body part,is pervaded by myself but not all the rest we find ourselves with a problem.What are we going to call the other part, the part that is not pervaded bymyself, the ‘not me’ part?If we now call this body part ‘me’ what are we going to call the ‘not me’? Andwhat could this other part be made of. It is no longer thought or, moreimportantly, felt to be pervaded by the intimacy of our own being so it must bemade out of something else. ‘Matter’ is the name we give to this ‘somethingelse’. It is the name we give to everything that is ‘not me’.Our self is pervaded by alive, aware presence, and so this substance called‘matter’ is conceived as not being pervaded by the intelligence or love that areinherent in our self. It is conceived as dead, inert, separate from and otherthan love and intelligence.However, no one has ever found this stuff called matter. Over a hundred yearsago the painter Paul Cézanne, said, “A time is coming when a single carrotfreshly observed will trigger a revolution”.Has this time come and what is the revolution Cézanne was suggesting? How longwill it be before a scientist stands up and admits that this stuff called matterhas never been found and, more importantly, could never be found because thereis nothing that is not utterly intimately pervaded by awareness? In fact, thereare simply no things, as such.This is the revolution Cézanne was suggesting and was trying to draw attentionto in his work. If its implications are considered it will revolutionise everyaspect of our lives: intimate relationships, commerce, ecology, business,employment, education, politics... everything.However, let us be sure that what we are saying is experiential, not just a newnon-dual philosophy.Close your eyes and place your hand on your chair. Our only knowledge of thechair is this new sensation. In fact in this new sensation we do not experiencea hand and a chair. There is hand/chair. It is only thinking that abstracts andconceptualises a hand and a chair from the intimacy and seamlessness of puresensing.Now what is this new experience made of? The mind says that the hand is made offlesh and bone and that the chair is made of an inert substance called ‘matter’,but in experience all we know is sensing. Now what is sensing made of? Is thereany dead inert material there or is sensing intimately utterly pervaded byknowing, by awareness?Open your eyes and look at the wall in front of you. Our only knowledge of thewall is seeing. There is nothing there other than seeing. Now how far doesseeing take place from our self? Does it take place ten metres from our self oris it utterly, intimately one with our self?What in our actual experience is the seeing made of? Is there any substancepresent in seeing other than the intimacy of our own being? Is it solid, denseand inert or is it made only of knowing or awareness?Now imagine the moon. Do we have any knowledge of the moon other than seeing?And how far away is that seeing? Millions of miles or right here in thedimensionless intimacy of our own being?Try to find anything that is at a distance from or separate from our self, notour self as body because that body is only made out of sensing, seeing, hearing,tasting, touching etc., but our self this aware presence.See clearly that the mind, the body and the world are never actually found assuch, that is, as they are imagined to be. All we know is experiencing andexperiencing is utterly intimately one with and made out of our self, awareness.The mind, the body and the world are illusions as they are normally conceived tobe. However, that does not mean that experience is an illusion. Experience isreal and its reality is the awareness that we intimately know ourself to be,that is, that intimately knows itself to be."},{"pageContent":"Conceptualising ConsciousnessFrom Consciousness’ own point of view, if it can be said to have a point ofview, it is too close to itself, too completely itself, to know itself as anykind of object.To know anything as an apparent object, there has to be a subject located at adistance from it and therefore, by definition, something other than it.To know an apparent object or other, we have to separate our self out from theseamless totality as an experiencing subject, a centre or location within theseamless totality, from which all seeming objects, others, events etc. are knownor experienced.This is the way we normally think that the objects of the mind, body and worldare known. That is, they are apparently known in relationship.However, for consciousness which is all there is, there is no other ‘one’ thatcan stand back and look at experience. It is neither the subject nor the objectof its own experience. This does not mean that it is unknown. It is unknown inthe way we normally think that knowing takes place, that is, it is not known inrelationship.However, consciousness is knowing. That’s what the word consciousness means: thepresence of that which is conscious, aware, knowing—the knowing of being or thebeing of knowing.However, consciousness doesn’t know itself as something. It is the knowing ofitself. It is knowing in identity, not in relationship.Consciousness’ way of knowing itself is to be itself and its being itself is soutterly intimate, seamless and complete that there is no room there for an‘other’.The only way consciousness can seem to know something that is ‘other thanitself’ is to take the shape of thinking and, as such, imagine itself to be alimited, located entity, a centre of knowledge, experience or perception,thereby giving rise to the possibility of other limited, located entities.In other words, thinking first imagines that consciousness is limited to andlocated within the body and then, as a natural corollary to this belief, itimagines an outside world, object or other that is separate and distant fromthis imaginary subject.It is with this imagining that the world, others and objects seem to come intoexistence as separate individual objects with a reality of their own. Theappearance of an apparent object is the natural and inevitable outcome of thebelief that consciousness is the subject.And it is with this imagining of consciousness as a separate entity, that itsown fullness, imperturbability, innocence and intimacy are seemingly veiled and,as a result, that a sense of lack, incompleteness, of having appeared andtherefore of the possibility of disappearing, of disease, of loss, etc., arise.For by imagining consciousness as an entity, thinking imagines it to be lessthan completeness, less than totality, less than fullness. In short,consciousness seems to become mortal, limited and located in time and space.In thinking of consciousness in this way, an imaginary relationship is set upbetween ‘I’—the apparently limited consciousness that the mind imagines the real‘I’ of consciousness to be—and all others, objects and the world.As such, the mind sets consciousness apart from the totality—it imagines it as alimited, located separate entity—and takes a position of “‘I,’ this imaginedentity, do not like this”, “‘I’ want that”, ‘‘I’ feel a lack”, “’I’ am sick”.All these ideas are inevitable corollaries to the belief in being a separateself and the ultimate cure for them is simply to go to the reality of experienceand, as a result, cease believing oneself to be such.In fact, one doesn’t need to stop believing it. Rather, the belief simply fallsaway when it is seen to be untrue, leaving Consciousness as it is, alone.However, at this point we cannot really say it is ‘alone’ or ‘one’, for bothneed the reference ‘other’ or ‘two’ to have any meaning.Even to call it consciousness is too much. It was only necessary toconceptualise consciousness in the first place as an antidote to the concept ofobjects, entities, others and the world. In the absence of these, the concept ofconsciousness is redundant.There is only the seamless totality of experiencing, too utterly intimatelyitself even to know itself as any kind of an object.In this state, which is simply the natural state of being, what we callconsciousness and what we call experiencing are identical.It is only when the mind arises and seemingly fragments the seamless intimacy ofexperience into an apparent multiplicity and diversity of objects thatconsciousness is conceptualised as the subject.At first it seems to become a subtle, unlocated, limited and witnessingconsciousness but, as the conceptualising process intensifies and the reality ofexperience is correspondingly veiled, this witnessing consciousness is furthercondensed in the imagination into an apparent mind and a body.Prior to the arising of mind, consciousness is too completely full of itself forthe dualising mind even to get a purchase—there is simply nothing for it to gethold of. And when the mind does arise it has to manufacture an object in orderto legitimise its own existence.However, even when the mind is seemingly present, consciousness doesn’t actuallyknow itself as an object. An object is only an object from the point of view ofthe mind. From consciousness’ ‘point of view’ it only knows itself. It cannotand does not know anything other than itself. And strange as it may sound, thatis all that is ever experienced including this very experience right now.Water only knows itself as water. It is the mind that says ocean, wave, river,tears, rain, cloud or puddle. Water knows nothing of such things. At the sametime it is the substance of all such things but, in being so, is still only everwater and only knows itself as water.Love is one of the names we give to this recognition. It is simply not to knowan other.Beauty is another of its names. It is not to know an object.Happiness is another. It is the absence of lack or fear of there ever even beingthe possibility of lack, due to consciousness’ total saturation of itself initself, eternally.Peace is another of its names because there is nothing other than itself thatcould come in ‘from anywhere’ and disturb it from being itself."},{"pageContent":"Presence Finds Only ItselfQ: I read somewhere that you say the experience of a separate self and theoutside world are two sides of the same coin, that they are inseparable. Iunderstand that there is no separate self but the outside world seems very real.Objects, people, places seem very real.‘Seems’ is the operative word. It is necessary to distinguish between what‘seems to be’ and ‘what is’.Your description of the world as being ‘outside’ implies that there is somethinginside. That ‘something inside’ is the separate self, the counterpart to theseparate world outside.In this case the separate self has not been seen to be truly nonexistent andtherefore the world, as such, has not been seen to be similarly non-existent.The separate self and the outside world are the inside and the outside ofignorance, the ignoring of reality.They are both illusions superimposed onto the reality of experience.Without the labelling by thought, we have no way of knowing what anything trulyis. In fact, even with the labelling of thought we do not know what anythingreally is but we think we do!Without thought there is no experience of an inside or an outside, a ‘me’ or an‘other’. Without thought, there is no ‘here’ or ‘there’, no ‘now’ or ‘then’, no‘this’ and ‘that’.Without thought, there is just the utter intimacy of experiencing, so completelyfull of itself as to permit no other, no time, no lack and no need.It is thought alone that seemingly divides experiencing into the realms of themind, the body and the world.These are the three realms of apparently objective experience, in which thereality of experience is seemingly veiled from itself by dualising thought.However, the mind, the body and the world are only illusory as apparent objects,as seemingly ‘other’. There is a reality to the experience of the mind, body andworld, but the only substance to that reality is aware presence, just as when welook at an image on the screen, we do not really see trees, fields, hills andthe sky. We always see only the screen. The screen is their reality.And what is it that knows the reality? It knows and simultaneously is itself.The reality of experience could not be known by anything other than what isreal.Q: But I can touch this table. I am seeing this chair.You do not touch the table and you do not see a chair. There is no you, no tableand no chair.‘You’, ‘table’ and ‘chair’ are simply concepts superimposed by the mind uponseamless, objectless, ever-present experiencing.If this is not clear, we could take an intermediary step and say that there isonly sensing, touching and seeing, as long as we understand that this is onlyprovisionally true.The only substance present in ‘you’, the body, is made out of sensing. The onlysubstance present in the ‘table’ and the ‘chair’ is perceiving or seeing.In other words, it becomes clear that all we know of the body, table or chair isexperiencing. The objects themselves are never actually found.What we thought was an object, body or world is seen to be made only ofexperiencing. The mind superimposes the ‘experienced’ and the ‘experiencer’ ontopure experiencing. And if we look at experiencing itself all we find there isaware presence. And what is it that ‘finds’ or recognises presence? Only itself.That is, we could say that mind appears to fragment and diversify presence intothinking, sensing and perceiving and then further fragments thinking, sensingand perceiving into an apparent multiplicity and diversity of physical objectsthat are apparently known by a separate self.However, the separate self is not just a belief. It is also a feeling. It is notjust the concept of being an entity. It is the feeling that ‘I’ am this bodyand/or ‘I’ am in this body.And with the feeling that I am inside this body comes the feeling thateverything I am not, is outside this body. That is to say, that the world isoutside me.‘I am in the body’ and ‘the world is outside and separate from me’ are not twodifferent feelings. It is one feeling, one line drawn through the seamlessintimacy of experience, that separates the ‘me’ from the ‘not me’.It is impossible to have the ‘me’ without the ‘not me’, and it is impossible tohave the ‘not me’ without the ‘me’.One belief/feeling apparently separates the oneness of experience into two, into‘me’ and ‘other’. One belief/feeling apparently separates experiencing into anexperiencer and an experienced.The mind seemingly separates presence into someone that knows, ‘I,’ andsomething that is known, the ‘world’. Unhappiness, which is simply the veilingof ever-present underlying happiness, is the result of this artificialseparation.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]Imagine going to an Imax cinema where we are given a special pair ofthree-dimensional glasses. Without the glasses the image appears in twodimensions on the screen as normal, but when we put on the glasses it seems asif the film is taking place all around us in the entire space of the cinema, andthat we are situated within the three dimensional image, under the sea with thefish or on the plain with the lions.If we take off our glasses at some point we will see all the children in thecinema (and some of the adults!) stretching out their hands trying to catch thefish. But they grab only empty space.It is exactly the same with the world. When we try to catch it, to hold it, tosee what it is made of, we find only the empty space of presence.We are like children grabbing at the fish, thinking that the fish are real andtrying to touch them. But when we look clearly at our experience, we findnothing objective there and, by the same token, nothing subjective.Presence, as it were, puts on the mind, which as a result, appears to project aworld outside of itself. But the mind is itself made out of the presence fromwhich it seems to be separated.The world is separate from presence in the same way that the sky is separatefrom space, that is, in no way at all.Thinking seems to objectify, divide and fragment the seamless intimacy ofexperience, creating an apparent multiplicity and diversity of thoughts,objects, selves, others and the world.Thinking creates the appearance of time out of timeless presence and thisappearance is called the dream state.Thinking creates the appearance of space and objects out of spaceless presenceand this appearance is called the body and the world, that is, the waking state.But when we ‘stretch out our hand’, as it were, and try to find time, thought,space, a body, an object or a world, we find only presence.Presence finds only itself."},{"pageContent":"The Fabric of IdentityQ: I understand that the separate entity is simply a belief but I still feellocated in the body.The conviction that we are a separate and independent entity has two aspects. Itis composed of a belief and a feeling.The belief in separation is really the tip of the iceberg. Most of the apparentseparate ‘I’ is made of feelings that have one essential feeling at theirorigin: that ‘I’, this unlimited aware presence that is seeing these words, islocated in the body and/or as the body.The actual experience of the body comprises a cluster of sensations plus visualperceptions, strung together by a concept that weaves them into the apparentlycomplex organism that we think of as our body.However, no such organism is ever experienced as such. The sensations areexperienced. The visual perceptions are experienced. The concept of the body isexperienced. But the body to which the concept refers is never experienced, assuch.In fact, even that statement is only relatively true. It is true in relation tothe previous belief that we truly experience a body. However, in the face of adeeper exploration of experience, this statement itself will be found to belimited and only relatively true.The actual experience of the body is very simple. Close your eyes for a momentand see that it is experienced simply as an amorphous cluster of sensations.All unhappiness has, at its origin, the exclusive association of our self, awarepresence, with this cluster of sensations.In fact, in most cases we no longer even realise that these two have been mixedup. Presence and bodily sensations have been mixed up together for so long intoan amalgam of identity that many of us now feel simply that ‘I’ is the body,period.This apparent mixture of our self, aware presence, and a cluster of sensationsrequires one thing only for its survival. Obscurity! As long as it remainsobscure, unseen, the feeling of separation and the unhappiness that is itsinevitable corollary are inevitable.All that is needed is to look at it clearly with no agenda. We do not look at itin order to get rid of it. We simply look at it out of interest. What is thisseparate inside self that thinking imagines us to be? The exclusive mixture ofour self, aware presence, and the body cannot stand this passive anddisinterested contemplation.The feeling of being a body is like salad dressing. As long as it is constantlyagitated it appears to be one homogeneous substance, but as soon as it is leftalone, the oil and the vinegar separate naturally.The single ‘I-am-the-body’ entity is, in fact, not single. It is made ofpresence plus the body. The disinterested contemplation of the ‘I-am-the-body’entity is the settling of the salad dressing, the discrimination betweenpresence and the body object.See clearly that, when our eyes are closed, the so-called body is simply acluster of amorphous sensations appearing in unlimited aware presence. Thesesensations are not identical to presence. They appear in it. When our eyes areopen, a perception is added to this appearance that seems to substantiate thesolidity and depth of the body. If we now touch the chair with our hand, atactile sensation is added to the mix.Each of these sensations and perceptions is woven together by the mind into afabric that seems to be solid and permanent. However, our actual experience isthat each of these sensations and perceptions is fleeting and insubstantial.It is the aware presence in which they appear that gives them apparent substanceand continuity. They borrow their apparent permanence from presence, fromawareness.We think that the body is solid, lasting and substantial and that awareness isfleeting, impermanent and insubstantial. Our actual experience is the opposite.It is consciousness that is ever-present and substantial whereas the body is anever-changing flow of fleeting, impermanent and insubstantial sensations andperceptions.The identity that we attribute to the body in fact belongs to awareness.The ‘I am’ that is inherent in awareness is bestowed by thinking on a cluster ofsensations and becomes, ‘I am the body’.In fact, the ‘I am’ never becomes anything, it just seems to become a body. Andas an inevitable and simultaneous corollary to this self-contraction, everythingthat the body is not, becomes everything that ‘I am not’, that is, the world.The mind creates a veil of apparent objectivity that is spun within awarenessand made only out of awareness and yet which seems to limit and locate our self,awareness.As a result, awareness seems to take up residence inside the body and the worldseems to become distant and other.In our passive and disinterested contemplation, the ‘I am’ and the body separatelike oil and vinegar. It is not that the ‘I’ returns to awareness. It is ratherthat it is relieved of the superimposition of thinking and stands revealed as itis.The ‘I’ is relieved of its ‘insideness’ and ‘meness’ and the world is relievedof its ‘outsideness’, its ‘not-meness’. Inside and outside, me and not me,collapse and only our self, awareness, remains."},{"pageContent":"Utterly Intimately OneAt a certain point we no longer think or feel that we are an individual entityexisting and moving about in time and space amongst other entities.Time, space, the separate entity and its counterpart, the world, are allsuperimpositions upon our real nature.We think and feel that we are a limited, separate entity only because we haveforgotten our real nature.As soon as we remember or recognise our true nature, time, space, the separateentity, things, objects, others and the world all collapse back into the sourcefrom which they seemingly arise.In fact, they never really collapse because they never truly arose to beginwith. Rather, they are seen for what they are, the ever-present reality ofbeing, insubstantial as appearance, real as being.Imagine that we are watching a car chase on a screen and that the chase is beingfilmed from inside one of the cars. Even in ordinary life, when watching such afilm, our body can become quite animated and disturbed as we feel that we aretravelling inside the car, hurtling through space, narrowly missing other cars,buildings and people.At the end of the chase we become aware of the tensions in our body that havebeen created as a result of identifying ourselves with the point of view of thecamera. Long after the chase is over, indeed sometimes long after the film isover, these residues of feeling in the body may remain.However, at a certain moment in the film, and this moment is always available,it becomes obvious that we are not in the car moving at terrific speed, narrowlymissing other objects.It becomes clear that the fate of the car is not our fate. In fact, it becomesclear that there are no cars, no people, no road and no buildings. There is justthe screen.Once we realise this we realise simultaneously that it has always been the case.It was only our forgetting of this obvious and always available fact ofexperience, that precipitated the feeling that we were located inside a car,moving at great speed, in danger at every moment.We realise that all this commotion is simply a play on the screen, not inourselves.And simultaneously we realise that what is considered to be time, space andcausality for the characters in the movie is, for the screen, simply its ownever-presence.Does the screen ever become animated by the movement and the story of the film?Does the screen move when the cars move? Does the screen get excited ordisappointed? Does it appear or disappear? Does it change or move as the imagechanges and moves?The screen gains or loses nothing by the outcome of the film. It is not animatedby the images nor does it share their apparent qualities. At the same time it isthe very substance of the image.Likewise, it is the forgetting of the true nature of our self that precipitatesthe thought and feeling of being a separate entity moving around in a separateand outside world.Like the screen, our self, awareness, is already all it could ever be. It standsto gain or lose nothing by the appearance of the body, mind and world, whatevertheir condition. At the same time it is their very substance.Just as the screen seems to take the shape of the image in the film, soawareness seems to become limited by the body and the mind. However, none of theapparent qualities of the body and the mind pertain to awareness. At the sametime, once we have conceded a level of relative reality to the body and themind, we can say they are made out of nothing other than awareness.What is it then that changes and moves? The screen does not change and movebecause it is the one ever-present background and substance of the movie. Nor dothe cars change and move because they are non-existent as such.It is only an image that moves and changes. However, without thinking, even thisimage would not move and change, because change and movement require memory andmemory is simply a current thought.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]As soon as we forget our true identity as awareness and become exclusivelyidentified with a part of the totality of whatever is appearing, separateentities and the world are simultaneously born and, with them, their firstoffspring, time and space.The intimacy of experience is fragmented into a subject and an object, into a‘me’ and an ‘other’, into a person and a world, and time and space aresimultaneously created to house all these apparent entities.The forgetting of our true identity and the apparent reality of the individualand the world are the same event.From this moment onwards the individual that we imagine ourselves to be and theworld seem to acquire a reality of their own. We forget that their reality isonly the reality of awareness, just as we forget in the film that the reality ofthe cars, people, buildings and chase are always and only the screen.However, awareness is never truly obscured just as the screen is never obscured.It is only obscured by our believing it to be so. And our believing it to be so,makes it seem so.At every moment, the knowledge that awareness is the sole background andsubstance of experience is available, just as the knowledge that, in fact, weare watching only the screen is always available.Nothing needs to be done to effect this change other than the clear seeing thatit is always already the case. However, whatever it is that needs to be done toeffect this clear seeing, needs to be done. What ‘needs to be done’ is calledthe search for happiness and it is inherent in the belief that we are a separateentity travelling in time and space.As soon as we notice the screen, we cease to feel that we are located in the cartravelling at great speed and in constant danger.Similarly, as soon as we reclaim our true identity as awareness, which simplymeans to notice what we always already only ever are, we cease to think and feelthat we are a separate entity that was born and will die, that travels throughthe waking state, that enters a dream state and then falls asleep.We no longer feel that we are an entity that is doing, choosing, feeling,thinking, becoming, suffering, enjoying, achieving, sensing, perceiving, growingold, dying etc., etc. Above all, we no longer think and feel that we are anentity that is located in time and space, moving through life from beginning toend.We realise instead that we are this ever-present, substantial, homogeneous,unmoving, unchanging presence. We think and feel that we are present, or rather,presence itself, not located in time and space, but rather here and now. Not‘here’ a place and ‘now’ a time, but rather this dimensionless ever-presence.It becomes clear that mind and matter are not the essential ingredients ofexperience. Likewise, that time and space are not the ultimate container inwhich our lives take place. Mind, matter, time and space are all part of theimage. But the image is made out of awareness. Awareness is the truedimensionless container of all our experience.We could say that entities, objects, people, events move through us but eventhis is not true. There are no entities, objects, people, events, just as thereis no car tearing across the screen.There is only the screen appearing as the cars, buildings, houses and people.Likewise there is only our self, aware presence, immobile and unmovable,unchanging and unchangeable, made out of nothing but itself, taking the shape ofall that appears without ever being or becoming anything other than what iteternally is.In fact, experience doesn’t take place in awareness. Experience is awareness.Awareness is the substance of itself alone. It is its own content.Our self, awareness, never goes anywhere or does anything. This becomes the feltand lived reality of our lives. It is pure peace. Awareness stands silent andimmobile, unmoving, unchanging. We are the presence from which every objectderives its apparent existence.As the dervish, who has been turning around and around, suddenly feels still andsilent and sees clearly that it is rather the world and all others that areturning around him, so we feel that we are one solid block of silent awareness,shining in its own light as every minute detail and gesture of life andexperience.Everything is intimately one with our self. Everything is intimately our self.No event is greater or smaller than any other event. Nothing is more or lesssignificant than anything else. Nothing is more or less intimate than anythingelse. Greatness and smallness, significance and insignificance, are for themind, not for awareness.For awareness, a falling leaf is no greater or smaller an event than anearthquake, just as a falling leaf or an earthquake in a film is of no greateror lesser importance to the screen. Neither is of any importance to the screen.That does not mean there will not be an appropriate response to each event,perhaps a smile in one case, perhaps intense action in another. However, bothare equally the shape that awareness takes. Both reveal awareness in equalmeasure.When we wake up in the world as a person, we truly fall asleep. When we forgetour self, the peace, happiness and freedom that are inherent within our self,are seemingly veiled. We seem, as a result, to become a person who enjoys andsuffers, and the world seems to acquire its own reality and becomes an abode ofpleasure and pain.Likewise, when we return to our self, which we have never in reality for amoment left, when we awake to our self, the person and the world fall asleep.They disappear, as such.We stand eternally motionless and silent, watching ourselves taking the shape ofevery minute detail of life, utterly and intimately one, fully giving oursubstance in love to every appearance."},{"pageContent":"We Never Lose a FriendAll apparently objective experience is made of mind, that is, mind in thebroadest sense of the word, to include all thinking, imagining, sensing andperceiving.All we know of objects, others or the world comes through mind, that is throughthinking, imagining, sensing, seeing, hearing, touching, tasting and smelling.All these qualities belong to the mind. We have no evidence or experience ofobjects, others or the world apart from or outside of mind.Nothing objective remains of the current experience if we remove the mind fromit.Where does the mind appear? In awareness. And what is the mind made out of? Theawareness in which it appears. There is nothing else present out of which itcould be made.It is not even quite right to say that the mind appears in awareness, becausethis gives the impression that the mind appears in awareness as a piece offurniture appears in the space of a room.A piece of furniture is something new that is brought into the room from outsideand it is made, relatively speaking, out of something other than the space ofthe room.However, the mind, that is, thoughts, images, sensations and perceptions, is notbrought in from outside. Where is there, in our experience, that is outsideawareness, from where the mind could appear?Prior to the appearance of mind there is only awareness. When the mind(including all thoughts, images, our body, objects, others and the world)appears, the only substance present, out of which it can be made, is awareness.However, if the mind is made out of that which is already present prior to itsappearance, nothing new can be said to have appeared when the mind appears. Howdo we even know the mind appears? Who says so? Only the mind.There is only awareness prior to mind. There is only awareness during theappearance of mind and there is only awareness when the mind subsides.However, that also is only relatively true. We have already seen that time isutterly non-existent as an actual experience. Where then is ‘prior’, ‘during’and ‘after’? In other words, where is the time ‘before’, ‘during’ or ‘after’this current experience? Only in the current thought.Likewise, when the mind changes, for instance when one situation disappears andanother appears, awareness remains present and unchanged throughout.There is only awareness prior to the first situation, during its appearance,during the second situation, after it disappears and so on, throughout allsituations ad infinitum.Again, that is only relatively true—it is said to establish the presence andprimacy of awareness. It is truer than the conventional formulations ofexperience that imply the absolute reality of time and space but, upon furtherinvestigation, it is found to be not completely true.There is ‘always’ only awareness. Not ‘always’ in time but rather ‘ever-presentnow’. There is no other substance present in any situation.If we take our stand in or as the body there seem to be a multiplicity ofobjects, people, places, situations and events. If we take our stand in or asmind there seem to be a multiplicity of ideas and feelings.However, if we take our stand as awareness, which is, in fact, where we alwaysstand whether we know it or not, there is always only one substantial,ever-present, homogeneous, immovable, immutable reality.Nothing comes or goes. Nothing moves or changes. Nothing is ever lost. Awarenessis prior to and within all seeming things.In fact, there are no things nor any place or time, past, present or future, inwhich apparent things can exist. There is only awareness itself.If we take our stand knowingly as awareness then we see clearly that all wecould ever be, become or achieve is already fully present ‘at every moment’. Itis ever-present.All that ever happens is made only of awareness and awareness is ever-present.The question of being, becoming or achieving anything other than awareness isnot a possibility. In fact nothing—no thing—truly ever ‘exists’ or ‘happens’.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]With this understanding the question of purpose or meaning in life loses itsvalidity.In order to conceive of meaning or purpose we must first imagine ourselves to beseparate and independent from awareness. Meaning and purpose are only for thatimagined one. And, of course, that one is only a real entity from its ownimagined point of view.Awareness is already all it could ever be. It cannot become anything else, norcan it cease to be what it always is.However, if we take our stand in or as the mind, there will always be purpose,meaning, becoming and achieving.As a concession to this point of view it could be said that the highest purposeand meaning is to come to this experiential understanding of the seamlessintimacy of life.There are not two things. There is only awareness. There is nothing for it to beor become that it is not already.Experience consists of only one substance and this substance is always fullypresent, fully known. It cannot not be known. It is the knowing of itself alone.It cannot know anything other than itself.Even in ignorance, that is, in the apparent ignoring of the true nature ofexperience, there is nothing other than awareness knowing itself. Therefore,there is no real ignorance.Purpose and meaning always need an other, a future, a process. But awareness isall there is. Things move and change only from the point of view of the mind.And the mind is only real from the point of view of the mind.From the point of view of awareness nothing moves or changes. In fact nothing—nothing—is. “All things seem but cannot be.” There is only awareness, our self,presence.There is no question of doing or not doing, of achieving or not achieving.Awareness is the only substance present in experience. Where could it go? Whatcould it become? Into what could it disappear? Out of what could it arise?In order to speak of coming and going, appearing and disappearing, doing or notdoing, achieving or not achieving, bondage or liberation, we must first imagineourselves to be something other than awareness, that is, we must first imagineourselves to be a body and/or a mind.Nothing moves, nothing changes, nothing is born or dies, nothing appears ordisappears. It is only the mind that claims all these things, but the minditself is made only out of the immovable, changeless, birthless, deathlesspresence of awareness.If we take our stand in or as the mind, we seem to become separate entities,moving, changing, growing, becoming, appearing, disappearing, enjoying,suffering, searching, finding, being born and dying.If we take our stand knowingly as awareness, we know our self as the oneimmutable, substantial reality in all experience, ever-present, consistent,homogeneous, without beginning or end.That which is present when we are face to face with a loved one is only thispresence. Their image, sound, touch, taste or smell is made only of thispresence. When our loved one dies or leaves, this presence remains as it alwaysis, fully present.Whether we remember them or not, that out of which they were made when they werepresent with us is still ‘here’, still staring itself in the face.This presence is the substance of all relationship. In fact, it is the absenceof relationship. There are not two things, two people, to be related to eachother. There is only knowing in identity.There is only presence knowing itself from moment to moment. It is known asLove. We never lose a friend."},{"pageContent":"Abiding Knowingly as PresenceQ: What effect does this understanding have on our everyday lives and in whatway does it contribute to humanity?A very profound effect! If we think and feel that we are a limited, separateentity, this fundamental belief will dictate most of our thoughts, feelings,relationships and activities.If we look at all the problems facing individuals, couples, families,institutions, communities, races and nations, there seem to be innumerablecauses for each problem. On a relative level this may be true but, if we traceback the causes of all psychological conflict and suffering to their essentialorigin, we always end up with the core belief in the existence of a separateentity endowed with freewill, choice, freedom, etc., moving around in a world oftime and space.Just as the belief in and, more importantly, the feeling of being a separateentity in a separate, outside world is the single fundamental cause forpsychological conflict and suffering, so the experiential understanding of thetrue nature of our identity is its remedy.Prior to this understanding most of our thinking, feeling, acting and relatingrevolves around the central belief that what we are is a limited, personalconsciousness born into a body, evolving through time and space and destined fordeath.A life based on such a belief is one of an almost constant search for peace,happiness and love, punctuated by moments of rest and fulfilment. After thesemoments of brief respite, the old habits of thinking, feeling, acting andrelating on behalf of a separate entity reappear and the apparent entity isagain propelled into a search for objects that will supposedly fulfil the senseof lack and allay the sense of fear that are inherent within it.However, with the clear seeing or understanding that the awareness we knowourselves to be is impersonal, unlimited and ever-present and is not only thewitness but also simultaneously the substance of all experience, the belief inbeing a separate entity and all its attendant thoughts, feelings and activitiesslowly, in most cases, die down.As a result of this, the agitation at the level of the mind, and the tensions inthe body that depended for their existence on the belief that what we are is alimited separate entity, dissipate.All the other thoughts, feelings and activities that were characteristic of aparticular body and mind tend to continue. However, now that the body and themind are no longer labouring under the dominion of a demanding, fearful entity,their energies are liberated and made available to express, share, communicateand celebrate the love and intelligence that are inherent in this newunderstanding.How this sharing takes place will vary enormously from one body/mind to anotherbut the essential communication will always be the same: loving, friendly,creative, enjoyable, enthusiastic.All psychological problems rely on the apparent presence of the separate entity,so when this entity is seen to be non-existent all our psychological problemsevaporate. There may still be practical problems but these will be dealt with asbest as is possible given the prevailing circumstances and will not generatesuffering.Now that we are no longer serving the dictates of an imaginary and tyrannicalentity, we may well find that we have a great deal of time and energy on ourhands—the separate entity is a voracious, insatiable master!If we make a deep exploration of our true nature we find that peace, happinessand love are inherent in it. In fact, they are not qualities that are inherentin it. Rather, they are the names we give to awareness when it recognisesitself. For this reason, thoughts, feelings and activities that come directlyfrom this experiential understanding, unmediated by an imagined separate entity,tend to express these qualities.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]Even if we are simply open to the possibility that awareness is not limited,located and personal, we can explore and experiment with this possibility in ourlives.Go deeply into your experience and establish yourself in the experientialunderstanding that you are this aware presence, and see from there that is noevidence that this presence is either limited, located or personal.If there is no evidence that presence is limited, located, personal or temporal,we cannot be sure that the one we are speaking to over the phone, across thecheckout counter, in our intimate partner or in our friends is not the samepresence that is truly our own self.We cannot know with the mind whether this is true or not, because the mind hasno knowledge of that in which it appears.However, we can know it in experience. Having lived for so many years under thepresumption that awareness is limited and located, try living the oppositepossibility. Treat all others and animals as this very presence that youintimately know yourself to be. Allow all your activities and relationships toflow from this understanding.And having understood that there are no objects—that our only knowledge ofobjects is perceiving and that perceiving is made out of awareness—treat allapparent objects also as this very presence that you are.In other words treat everything as yourself and see how the universe responds.After all, the universe appears in conformity with our beliefs.If we are truly concerned about peace in the world, the highest service we canrender that world and our fellow beings is to investigate and explore thereality of our experience, to stand knowingly as that reality and to live a lifethat flows from that experiential understanding, that is, to live a life thatflows from love and understanding.In time, if we truly take our stand as presence, the belief in the reality of aperson, object, other or world gradually, rapidly or, in rare cases,instantaneously, dissolves. We find ourselves spontaneously, effortlessly andpeacefully at the heart of experience and the activities of the mind and bodynaturally express this stance.If we stand knowingly as presence we see presence everywhere. That is, itexperiences only itself. In fact, it is always only experiencing itself but itis now no longer apparently obscured by the convolutions of the dualising mind.Everything that comes from this experiential understanding delivers it, whetheror not it is couched in correct non-dual terms and whether or not it even triesto express it in words."},{"pageContent":"Presence Breathes Out the WorldPresence never moves, does or becomes anything other than itself. If we take ourstand as aware presence, knowingly, we truly feel that we do nothing and gonowhere. All doing and going are for the mind alone.For presence, which simply means in our actual experience, there is no time,just timeless presence in the same placeless place, the ever-present timelessnow. But it is not aloof, remote, static, because it gives itself intimately andutterly to every appearance of the mind, the body and the world.A character in a film may grow up, get a job, have a family, travel the world,grow old and die, but the screen doesn’t do any of these things. The screen isthe entire substance of the character’s life, and yet at the same time it alwaysremains itself without moving, doing or becoming anything.When we take our stand as presence we know ourselves as the reality of allexperience, the ‘I’ in all seeming people and the ‘it’ of all seeming things.We do not think or feel that we are a person thinking, feeling, doing, choosingetc., going towards the truth or away from it. We have taken our stand aspresence and understand and feel that the mind, including all thinking, sensingand perceiving, proceeds from and unfolds within our self.It is like breathing in and out. As presence breathes out, as it were, itcreates the appearance of mind within itself, made only out of itself, and themind contains or, rather is, all images, thoughts, sensations and perceptions.As presence breathes in, it folds the appearance of mind back up within itself.At no stage does presence ever forget that it is itself. It never goes out ofitself. It never truly confers its own reality upon an object, and yet it is itsown reality that gives apparent existence—apparentstanding-out-as-an-object-ness—to all seeming things.The apparent forgetting of presence is only as real as the actor who seeminglyforgets himself in order to play the role of Hamlet.Presence remains itself, abiding in and as itself. It is ever-present, at homewithin itself, as itself.The particular character of each perception no longer has the power to deceivethe mind into thinking that presence is anything other than itself, andtherefore no longer has the power to veil the peace and happiness that areinherent within it.The mind can no longer be persuaded into thinking that presence is an object,entity or world. In fact, it cannot be persuaded that anything is an object ofany kind. Nothing can take Presence away from itself. Where would it go? Wherecould it go?Nothing need be resisted or feared any longer because it is seen clearly thatnothing could ever have or indeed did ever have the power to rob presence ofitself. The fear of being diminished or of disappearing, and the need or desireto be aggrandised in any way, dissolve. The natural condition of peace,happiness and freedom is revealed.It is seen that nothing can threaten or harm presence, so the subtle rejectionof the current situation that characterises the separate entity disappears, andwith the disappearance of the ‘No’ we find a ‘Yes’ within ourselves that isintimately, unreservedly present at the heart of all experience.This ‘Yes’ is love."},{"pageContent":"DevotionQ: Is there a place for bhakti or devotion in this approach?To be truly devoted means to give our whole self to the object of our devotionat all times. Therefore, the only object worthy or even available for suchdevotion or love must be something that is always present, for we cannot giveourselves completely to something that is intermittent.Therefore, there are no true objects of devotion because all objects areintermittent. Only awareness is ever-present and, therefore, only awarenessmerits true devotion. And what could give awareness this devotion? Obviously anintermittent object such as a body or a mind cannot render devotion to somethingthat is present when it is not. Therefore, only awareness is able to impart thisdevotion to itself.So, it is only awareness that can be truly loved and it is only awareness thatcan truly love. However, awareness does not love and is not loved. It is love.So, the highest form of love or devotion is simply to abide as awareness,knowingly. Any other sort of devotion would be the devotion of an imaginedentity towards an imagined object.However, the imagined entity that looks for a direction in which to turn and forsomething to turn towards, does not realise that the ‘attention’ it is ‘using’for this purpose is already the consciousness that it seeks. It is like acurrent of water searching the ocean for water.“Lord, Thou art the love with which I love Thee.”Every object or direction which appears as a possible recipient of the mind’sdevotion is an object that it has created within itself and cannot therefore bethe true object of its devotion. Any object is simply more mind.As the mind searches for a direction in which to turn, it is, without knowing itto begin with, tracing itself back to its source.Finally, having explored all directions, it comes to a dead end. It comes to theknowledge that there is no known direction in which it can turn nor is there anobject worthy of true devotion. In short, the mind cannot know what devotion is.With this understanding the mind falls silent, which means it dissolves, andwhat is revealed is devotion.Devotion is what we are, not something we do.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]The investigation within the mind for the true object of devotion is sometimesknown as self-enquiry. It is a concession to the mind that thinks it has thecapacity to direct its attention at will towards an object.However, this is not a process of the mind going towards its source, although itmay appear to be so to begin with. It is rather, the dissolution of the apparentmind in its source. How could a mind go towards awareness? In what directionwould it go?Only something that is not the source could dissolve in its source, so the ideaof the dissolution of the mind in its source is part and parcel of the mind’sbelief that it is something other than its source. In other words, the idea of asource from which something emerges is a dualistic idea which itself ‘dissolves’upon understanding that there is no independent entity, mind or object.It is rather the source itself, awareness, which gradually reclaims the mind.In taking the shape of mind, awareness appears to become something other thanitself. It appears to become separate, other and outside. At the end of everyperception, awareness folds the mind back up within itself and, as a result,ceases the apparent veiling of itself with its own creativity.However, even that formulation is not quite right: the mind has no othersubstance other than awareness, so there is nothing there to be dissolved.When an image that seems to veil the screen fades, leaving only the screen inview, does the image really dissolve?The image is only made of screen and the screen does not dissolve. However, byseeming to become something other than itself (the landscape), the screen seemsto become hidden and the subsequent fading of the image seems to reveal thescreen.Likewise, the mind is an appearance within awareness, made only of awareness,but has the capacity to appear to veil the awareness out of which it is made.In self-enquiry the mind fades like the image on the screen, leaving only thebackground of awareness in plain view.It is not the mind that undertakes this process, any more than it is the imagein the landscape that is responsible for its own dissolution. The mind doesnothing. The mind is not an independent entity with the capacity to do or not todo anything.In fact, it was always only awareness that was in plain view, simultaneously thebackground and the foreground."},{"pageContent":"The Arch ImpersonatorThe ‘I’ thought is like a filler that the mind comes to rest upon when it is notoccupied with creative, loving, enquiring or practical thoughts.As soon as these creative, loving, enquiring or practical thoughts are finished,the mind creates a pseudo self, a pseudo doer, a thinker, a feeler, who claimsthe credit for the previous activities.This imagined separate self becomes the default position for the mind, like thescreen saver on the computer screen, which is there to obscure the apparentdullness of the blank screen when no other documents are open. The screen isconsidered to be dull only from the point of view of the images, because it isthe complete absence of everything that it knows, that is, the complete absenceof objects.However, the screen in itself is not an absence. It is presence. In fact, it isthe sole substance of the apparent images. It is an absence only from the pointof view of the mind.Likewise, from the point of view of the mind, which knows only apparent objects,awareness is a boring nothingness. It does not know and cannot know thatawareness is, in fact, its own substance. To avoid this apparent nothingness ofawareness, the mind creates a pseudo presence, a pseudo identity, the separateinside self, which impersonates the true presence of awareness.This pseudo self gives the mind something to be busy with in between otherthoughts, images, sensations and perceptions. This pseudo self seems to becomethe background of our experience, apparently always present, running between andwithin all other perceptions. It is the arch impersonator.As our exploration of the nature of experience deepens, it becomes more and moreobvious that the pseudo self is not the permanent background of experience butthat it is rather one of the innumerable changing faces of experience itself. Itis seen clearly that the screen saver is not the background and substance of allthe documents, but is simply another document or image.At this stage the apparently inside self is understood to be an object ratherthan the subject of experience and, as a result, it ceases to be the defaultposition of the mind, in between all other thoughts and images. It is understoodto be simply another thought or image.The screen saver, which was created to prevent the apparent dullness of thescreen ever having to be experienced, is removed and as a result the screenitself becomes visible.This is the moment of awareness recognising its own being and no longer seemingto veil itself with the mind. It is the cessation of ignorance, the cessation ofawareness’ apparent ignoring of itself.This timeless moment is the recognition that awareness is not a blank emptiness,not a nothingness as the mind had previously conceived it to be, but rather thefullness out of which the apparent fullness of the mind is made.In fact, from this perspective it is the separate inside self that is trulyempty, a nothingness, a non-existent thing.The default position now becomes the screen itself, not the screen saver. Thatis, our default position becomes awareness itself, rather than the separateself. And it becomes more and more natural for the mind simply to come to restin its own source rather than manufacture a separate inside self in between itsactivities of thinking, sensing and perceiving."},{"pageContent":"The Apparent Forgetting of Our Own BeingQ: The question of choice and personal doership in this exploration ofexperience arises frequently. I’m struggling with the conflict between myself asthe doer versus the non-doer.Our apparently objective experience comprises thoughts, images, sensations andperceptions.Only one object can appear at a time, so it would be more accurate to say thatat any moment there is one thought/image/sensation/ perception present. Seeclearly that there is only ever one appearance present at a time, just as thereis only ever one image present on a TV screen at a time.It is thinking alone that splits the current experience into a multiplicity ofobjects, such as words, hands, table, walls, sky, etc, just as it is thinkingthat imagines the single TV screen to comprise houses, people, cars, the streetetc. However, in our actual experience there is only ever ‘one thing’ appearingat any moment. Later it will be seen that, in fact, there isn’t even one ‘thing’present; there is only presence, present to itself.This ‘one thing’ that seems to be present is a seamless whole just as the imageon the screen is a seamless whole. It is only thinking that draws imaginarylines around parts of the image to create an apparent multiplicity and diversityof objects.Now take the current appearance, this current experience, and see that theentire appearance is permeated with the awareness that knows it, just as theentire image on the screen is permeated by the screen on which it appears.In other words, see that awareness does not permeate one part of the currentappearance any more than another part, just as the screen does not permeate onepart of the image that appears on it any more than another part.Everything is equally permeated by and saturated with awareness. In fact, thereare no separate parts in experience, any of which could be more or lesspermeated by awareness. There is just one seamless whole, just as there is onlyone seamless, indivisible image on the screen.No apparent part of experience is any closer to or further away from awarenessthan another. In fact, there are no parts to experience that could be at varyingdistances from awareness.When anything appears it is so utterly and intimately one with the awarenessthat knows it that there is not the slightest room for any distance orseparation from it. In fact, there is not even an object, other or world, assuch, there to begin with that could subsequently be divided in parts.It is thought that rises up and imagines that awareness does not equally andintimately pervade all experience. This thought veils the presence of awarenessand, as a result, divides experience into two parts—one part, the body and mind,that is considered to be permeated by awareness and becomes, as a result, theseparate inside self, and another that is considered not to be pervaded byawareness and becomes, as a result, the separate outside object or world.With this thought the reality of awareness is no longer felt and understood tobe the essence of all experience—both our self and the world—but is consideredto be the reality of only our self.Thought now imagines that this separate inside self, which is an illusorythought-and-feeling-made self, is autonomous. It becomes the knower, feeler,perceiver and doer.It is this imaginary self that now has to invent a reality that belongs to theworld. In other words, the separate existence of the world, that has its ownindependent reality apart from awareness, is only considered true and real fromthe imaginary point of view of the separate inside self.In other words, objective reality is created by the subjective self.And having created an apparently real world (by forgetting the true and onlyreality of awareness), it is thought again that divides up this world of its ownmaking into an apparent multiplicity and diversity of parts, one of them beingthe separate inside self.Having imagined a separate inside self and a separate outside world of objectsand others, thought then locates this separate inside self at the centre ofexperience and positions all apparent objects and others at varying distancesfrom it, some close and others far.Hence time, space, objects and causality are all apparently created in thought.However, it is a thought alone that first imagines a world made of parts andthen decrees that some parts are permeated by awareness and others are not.It is as if the screen were to say, if it could speak, that some parts of theimage are one with the screen and others are not. But what exactly would thoseparts of the image that do not appear on the screen appear on?And what exactly would those parts be made out of if they were separate from thescreen? What other substance is present there, in the image, apart from thescreen, out of which such a separate part could be made?That part of the seamless totality of experience that thought considers to bepermeated by awareness is called ‘me,’ and that part of the totality that isconsidered by thought not to be permeated by awareness is called ‘not me.’That part of the totality that is considered to be ‘me’ is the thinking, feelingand sensing part, that is, the mind and body. And that part of the totality thatis considered to be ‘not me’ is the perceived part, that is, objects, others andthe world.It is as if the screen were to think that it, the screen, is only present in onelittle part of the image that is appearing on it, just one little person, butnot all the rest, not the others, the trees, the fields, the sky, the cars, thebuildings... etc.In other words, the apparently separate entity and the apparently separate worldare simultaneously co-created in thought by an imaginary division of theseamless intimacy of experience.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]Now what relation does all this have to the question about ‘the conflict betweenme as the doer vs. the non-doer’?The doer and, while we are talking about it, the thinker, the feeler, thechooser, the lover, the decider, the enjoyer, the sufferer etc., etc., isconsidered to be this little separate entity that thought has artificiallycreated within, and divided from, the totality.This doer is not an entity. It has no separate reality of its own. It is simplythe thought that has exclusively associated our self, awareness, with a littlecluster of sensations.However, our experience is one seamless whole. It is not comprised of separateparts, one part acting on another, one part giving and the other receiving, oneloving and the other loved, one part dictating and the other part dictated to.So, ‘the conflict between me as the doer versus the non-doer’ is an artificialone. It can never be resolved at the level on which it appears because theentities around which it revolves are non-existent. There are no selves,entities, parts, objects or others, as such, anywhere to be found in experience.There is simply experiencing—thinking, sensing and perceiving—whose entiresubstance is made out of the awareness that knows it.And when there is no thinking, sensing and perceiving, the essence ofexperiencing remains as it always is, awareness simply being/knowing/lovingitself.In other words, thinking, sensing and perceiving appears in awareness as acurrent appears in the ocean, a modulation, as it were, of its own substance.However, from the point of view of the separate inside self, experiencingcomprises many things—people, cars, buildings, houses, trees etc.—but from thepoint of view of awareness, which is, in fact, just the point of view of our ownexperience, there is just ‘one thing’.And what is that ‘one thing?’ It is itself! Awareness doesn’t see or knowobjects, others, the world, as such. It sees or knows only the pure, nameless,intimacy of experiencing. That is, it knows itself alone.Only an imaginary inside self knows an imaginary outside object, other or world.Awareness knows no such thing.To know an object is to seemingly not know awareness and to know awareness, thatis, in awareness’ knowing of itself, no object is known.It is only thinking that apparently knows objects, others, the world. However,thought’s point of view is an imaginary one. Thought only has a legitimate pointof view from its own illusory point of view. It is like one part of the image onthe screen having a point of view.Therefore, there is only one legitimate point of view, which is not a point ofview, because it is not viewing the whole from any particular vantage point. Itis the whole already. Being itself is the way it knows itself. It doesn’t knowitself in subject-object relationship.In fact, it doesn’t know itself in relationship. It knows itself in love, whichis the collapse or absence of all separation and relatedness.So, how is it possible for thinking to imagine its illusory point of view? Itfirst has to deny or forget the existence of awareness. Or, to be more accurate,thinking rises up and seems to obscure the awareness in which it appears, justas the three-dimensional image seems to veil the two-dimensional screen.The moment thinking does this, the reality of experience, awarenesssimultaneously being, knowing and loving itself, is seemingly forgotten and, asa result, an imaginary reality made out of something other than awareness,called ‘matter,’ can be imagined.‘Objects’, ‘others’ and the ‘world’ are simply the names and forms that thinkinggives to the apparent forgetting of our own being, awareness.And conversely, as soon as awareness remembers or recognises itself, so tospeak, by ceasing to arise as the dualising thought that appears to obscure itsown reality from itself, the apparent objectivity or otherness of the world andthe apparent subjectivity of the self collapse, and experience is known for whatit truly is, pure awareness alone. It recognises itself.That recognition is the experience of peace, happiness, beauty or love."},{"pageContent":"The Natural State of Openness and TransparencyQ: I am noticing now that there seems to be an egoic backlash happening since‘seeing’ happened—lots of emotional pain coming up, things hurting that haven’thurt for a long time, lots of anger, fear, everything uncomfortable. It feelslike there is a wrestling match going on inside. How is that possible?That is a very good sign! This egoic backlash that you describe is to beexpected (in some cases) and welcomed.Imagine a deep, dark well in whose depths a number of creatures live in a stateof slumber. At noon every day, when the sun is directly above the well, thesecreatures wake briefly and rise to the surface towards the light. As the sunpasses, darkness again fills the well and the creatures return to their previousslumber at the bottom.The sun, in this metaphor, is our self, aware presence. The well is the apparentperson and the creatures are all the dark, uncomfortable feelings that youdescribe.Under normal circumstances, much of our thinking and activity is undertaken inorder to avoid having to feel these dark, difficult feelings. However, as webegin to take our stand as aware presence, these habitual strategies of denialand avoidance are revealed. Hence your description of emotional pain that beenburied for a long time, coming to the surface.As we take our stand as aware presence we find that we no longer have any agendawith the mind, body or world. For this reason these dark feelings are now freeto surface unsuppressed and to be fully felt.These feelings are the old residues of ignorance at the level of the body. Theyare habits of feeling that result from our old identification with the body,that is, from taking ourselves to be a limited entity. Although it takes amoment to see that we are the clear space of aware presence, it takes time forthe body and the mind to become realigned with this experiential understanding.If we subscribe to these feelings we immediately seem to become an apparentperson again. However, we should not resist them with will power or discipline.In fact, these feelings want us to get busy with them, avoiding them, gettingrid of them, suppressing them or attending to them in one way or another,because it is precisely this activity of avoidance that keeps them alive.There is only one thing these feelings cannot stand and that is being clearlyseen for what they are.Having understood this, there is no need to be moved by them. Welcome themlovingly into yourself. Allow them to arise, to display themselves fully, torecount their old story and to vanish in their own time. Remain knowingly yourself, aware presence, throughout.These feelings rely on our having an agenda with them. Every time they are metwith our welcoming openness, as opposed to our resistance, we rob them of theirpower. That is, we rob them of their apparent power to veil our being, awarepresence. In time their ferocity will diminish because they are based on an oldstory that is no longer believed—the old story of a separate self.However, it is important to be sure that there is no agenda with them, that weare not welcoming them in order to get rid of them. The feelings you describethrive on this kind of subtle agenda.Once it has been clearly seen that the separate self around whom these feelingsrevolve is utterly non-existent, their heart has, as it were, been removed. Onlywaves of innocuous bodily sensations remain.In due course, those feelings that were dependent for their existence upon thebelief in a separate self will die down. They die of clear seeing and neglect.Once the mind and body are no longer presided over by the apparent separateself, they gradually return to their natural state of openness, transparency,sensitivity, availability and love."},{"pageContent":"Our True SecurityQ: In exploring our direct experience, I often wonder how much we can trust it.When one sees a mirage in a desert, if not aware of such a phenomenon, one wouldconsider it to be real. Similarly, are we not limited by the human senses andconsciousness in our discovery of truth? I know that is all we have but wonderto what extent we can use it and base our conclusions on it.You are quite right to suggest that nothing that appears within the mind, thebody or the world can be completely trusted or relied upon. However,consciousness and being are absolutely certain.It is helpful to understand clearly why this is so, by going through the processfrom which we derive this understanding, because such an understanding wouldprevent us from ever putting our trust in the wrong place again.You give the example of the mirage in the desert. Another example is the dreamstate. During a dream, our experience seems to have the same reality as that ofour waking state. However, upon waking we discover that its apparent reality wasillusory.How then, as you imply, do we know that the current experience of the mind, bodyand world are not also illusory? We don’t! So what then can we be absolutelycertain of?In order to answer this question we have to first understand what it is thatqualifies an experience as being illusory. How do we know that the water in thedesert or the buildings in the dream are not real? It is the fact that when wego towards these objects or experiences and try to find them or touch them, theyare not there. They have disappeared. The substance out of which we thought theywere made (‘mind’ in the case of the dream and ‘matter’ in the case of thewater) is not present.In fact, even if we go towards the apparent reality of ‘mind’ and ‘matter’ inthe waking state, we do not find them.If ‘disappearance’ is the criterion by which we qualify something as beingunreal, then presence without disappearance must be the criteria by which wequalify something as being real.Whatever it is that is truly present and therefore real, in any experience,cannot disappear, because that into which it would disappear (which must also bepresent in every experience in order for the experience to disappear into it)would be more real than it.Therefore, everything that appears and disappears must have a background or asupport on which to appear, which is at the same time more real than andinseparable from every appearance. For instance, the screen doesn’t disappearwhen the image disappears and in that sense it is more real than the image.Likewise, whatever it is that is real in every experience cannot change, in thesense that water is ‘more real’ than its changing forms of ice or steam. Asimple look at our experience tells us this. The reality of experience isever-present, although the apparently changing forms of experience are alwaysdisappearing.Likewise, whatever is real in any experience cannot appear or be born becausethat from which it would appear or be born (which must also be present andinseparable from it at the time of its birth) would be more real than it, in thesense that gold is ‘more real’ than an ornament.Similarly, whatever is real in our experience must know or illumine itself, forif it was known or illumined by something other than itself, that ‘something’(which would have to be present at the same time as the experience that wasknown or illumined) would be more real than itself.Therefore, whatever is truly real and present in our experience must be withoutappearance or disappearance. It must be changeless, that is, it must beever-present. It must know itself and be its own cause.So, we can now simplify our question and ask, is there anything in ourexperience that is ever-present, changeless, self-illuminating, self-knowing andself-causing?And the answer is yes, our own being, aware presence or consciousness. Our selfis the reality that runs unchanging throughout all experience.Only this ever-present, changeless and aware self can be absolutely trustworthy.An intermittent object cannot, by definition, be worthy of absolute trust,because on what would we place our trust when it was absent?Trust or hold onto that self or aware presence alone. However, what could holdonto that? Obviously an intermittent object, such as a personal self, cannothold onto the ever-present reality of our experience. So, an apparent separateself cannot hold onto aware presence.Aware presence alone can ‘hold onto’ itself. It is all that is present ‘there’throughout its own ever-presence. However, it is already itself, so there is noneed for it to make an effort to hold onto itself. Aware presence cannot loseitself. It cannot ‘not be’ itself.Therefore, in order to know that element of our experience that is worthy oftrust, all that is needed is to abide as the aware presence that we alwaysalready are.This simple knowing of our own being is the irreducible and indestructiblereality of our experience.That is the only certainty, our true security."},{"pageContent":"The Recognition of BeingQ: Is thinking a barrier to the realization of one’s true nature?It is not necessary to be without thought, because what we are is present bothwhen thoughts are appearing and when they are not. Think of thoughts just as youthink of the changing weather—they make no difference to your self at all. Justlet them float by while you remain your self.Changing or getting rid of thoughts makes no difference to our self, just as thechanging weather makes no difference to you sitting peacefully on the sofa. Ourself, aware presence, is always sitting peacefully on its sofa!Is the self that is to be known different from the self that knows? No! All thatis required for the self to be known is the presence of the one self that wealready and always are. This self is prior to thought. It knows thought. It isknowing or experiencing these words. No alteration of the mind, just as noalteration in the weather, could make any difference to knowing or being ourself.However, one does not need to think in order to be or know oneself. At bestthinking can take thinking to its own end. Thinking can explore and discoverthat not only it has no knowledge of the fundamental reality of experience butalso that it cannot have any such knowledge. ‘I know that I know nothing’ is thebest that thought can do!However, in order to come to this understanding (if this understanding is reallytrue of us and has not simply been adopted as just one more belief), we mustfirst taste the non-objective and timeless experience of our self knowing itsown being.In other words, the line of thinking that culminates in the end of the seekingthought comes from the experience of our true nature. It does not go towards it.With this understanding the seeking thought comes naturally and effortlessly toan end, not as a result of discipline, effort, suppression, denial or belief,but rather through understanding. There is simply nowhere else for it to go. Itjust lies down quietly.So, again, it is the timeless, non-objective experience of the simple knowing ofour own being—its knowing of itself—that dissolves thought, not thought thatleads to the knowing of our own being.However, whether or not this cessation of thought takes place, see clearly thatyou are the knowing or experiencing presence that runs unchanging throughout allappearances of the mind, body and world.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]Q: I’ve been operating according to the idea that it is almost impossible to letgo of mental patterns that operate unconsciously and that I have to know such apattern of thinking first in order to let go of it and abide in my true nature.Leave all those mental habits and patterns alone. The self that is apparentlyoperating, that seems to know these patterns and that would ‘let go of them’ isitself simply one such pattern.These patterns of thinking and feeling have taken their shape, over the years,from the belief that we are a separate self, without our making any particulareffort. In just the same way, as our experiential conviction that we are not alimited, located self deepens, so our thoughts, feelings and subsequentbehaviour will slowly, effortlessly and naturally realign themselves with thisnew understanding.In order to know our self we do not need to know the mind. No other knowledgethan the knowledge that is present right now in this very moment is required toknow our self.What does it mean to know our self? We are our self, so we are too close to ourself to be able to know our self as an object. Our simply being our self is asclose to knowing our self as we will ever come. We cannot get closer than that.In fact, being our self is the knowing of our self, but it is not the knowing ofour self as an object.To say ‘I am’, (in other words to assert that we are present), we must know that‘I am’. Being and knowing are, in fact, one single non-objective experience. Butwe do not step outside of our self in order to know our own being. We simply areour self. That being of our self is the knowing of our self. This being/knowingis shining in all experience.This experiential understanding dissolves the idea that our self is not presenthere and now and that it is not known here and now.And when our desire to know or find ourselves as an object is withdrawn, wediscover that our own self was and is present all along, shining quietly in thebackground, as it were, of all experience. As this becomes obvious we discoverthat it is not just the background but also the foreground. In other words, itis not just the witness but simultaneously the substance of all experience.Completely relax the desire to find yourself as an object or to change yourexperience in any way. Relax into this present knowing of your own being. Seethat it is intimate, familiar and loving. See clearly that it is never not withyou. It is shining here in this experience, knowing and loving its own being. Itruns throughout all experience, closer than close, intimately one with allexperience but untouched by it.As this intimate oneness, it is known as love. In its untouchable-ness it isknown as peace and in its fullness it is known as happiness. In its openness andwillingness to give itself to any possible shape (including the apparent veilingof its own being), it is known as freedom and, as the substance of all things,it is known as beauty.However, more simply it is known just as ‘I’ or ‘this’."},{"pageContent":"Who Is?Q: All these questions about consciousness and the replies given aboutself-enquiry etc., along with everything else, are all just consciousness eitherknowingly or unknowingly expressing itself. It all seems so incredibly circular.Could you comment on this please?It is only circular for the one who believes him or herself to be somethingother than consciousness and that one is a thought-made entity. It is animaginary inside self. Consciousness is always in the same place, the placelessplace of our own being.Everything is made of our self, consciousness. That is easy to check in our ownexperience. Just ask yourself if you have ever experienced or could everexperience anything outside consciousness. Likewise ask yourself if we know orcould know anything other than our knowing of experience. In other words, all weknow, is knowing. And what is knowing made of? Only awareness or consciousness,that is, only our self.And what is it that knows knowing? Only knowing! It knows itself. Therefore itis our simple, direct and intimate experience that all that is ever known isconsciousness knowing and being itself, and because there is not the least traceof separation, distance or otherness in this knowing of our own being, it isalso known as love.All there is, is knowing, being and loving, seamlessly one, and that is ourself. This knowing, being and loving is modulated through thinking, sensing andperceiving and appears as the diversity and multiplicity of names and forms ofthe body, mind and world.Once this seamless oneness of consciousness is apparently divided by thoughtinto separate entities, objects, others and the world, then desires, fears,motives, causes, effects, intentions, progress, achievement, failure etc... thewhole personal endeavour... becomes very real.However, they are only real for the separate inside self that thought imagines,just as the troubles of a character in a film are only real for that imaginarycharacter; they are not real for the screen. They are not even known by thescreen. The screen only knows itself; the characters are only real for theimaginary characters.Likewise consciousness never really knows the separate entities, objects, othersand world that thought imagines. It only knows itself.Consciousness is already everything it could ever be. It is one seamlesshomogenous substance that can never be depleted, added to, changed or moved. Itgains or loses nothing from the entire human adventure.From the point of view of the person there is bondage and liberation, veilingand revealing, knowing and not-knowing, etc. But from the point of view ofconsciousness, there is only knowing, being and loving itself.Imagine going to sleep at night. We lie down, fall asleep, dream that we leavehome, undertake a great adventure that lasts several years and then return. Thenwe wake up, only to find that we have been lying peacefully on our bed allalong. It was a long, strange, circular journey for the one who seemed to betravelling. But for the one lying on the bed, nothing ever happened.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]Q: So much of life would seem to be consciousness knowingly or apparentlyunknowingly doing lots of things, but in these questions and responses we haveconsciousness getting very close to exposing its own unknowingness. Indeed itwould appear to be the desire of some apparent entities (that is, asconsciousness unknowingly) to achieve that very exposure and to become fullyknowing.Yes, consciousness takes the shape of a thought that seems to divide its ownoneness into an inside self and an outside world. It is this entity, made onlyof thought, that goes on the great adventure of seeking. The whole adventure ofbeing a person, the whole human adventure, all takes place in the mind. And whatis mind made of? Consciousness.It is the mind, in the shape of the apparently inside self, that sets off ‘intoa far country’ outside its own kingdom, away from home. It wanders around, asthis apparently inside self in the apparently world, looking for peace insituations, happiness in objects and love in relationships. The whole adventureis created and enacted within the mind.And while the mind is doing its thing, searching, achieving, failing, hoping,fearing, doing, thinking, choosing etc., consciousness, our self, is just lyingpeacefully in its bed. That is, it is just abiding in and as itself.It is true that the mind is ultimately made of consciousness, but it is the mindthat takes the adventure, not consciousness. The screen does not undertake theadventure that is enacted in the fi lm, although the film is made only of thescreen.How does the apparently separate self know what to look for on its adventure? Itknows what to look for because peace, happiness and love are inherent in its ownnature—it never forgets their taste—although they have been veiled by the veryactivity of the seeking self.Sometimes we look back with nostalgia and longing for the happiness and freedomof childhood. But that is just an image. This happiness we long for is not faraway in time. It lies at the heart of all experience. It is the presence ofhappiness itself in this very moment that shines in our experience as thelonging for a happiness that seems to have been lost. Right there in the longingfor happiness is the experience of happiness itself shining through the veil ofthe separate self.Peace, happiness and love are inherent in the simple knowing of our own being.They are the simple knowing of our own being, and because the separate entity isultimately made out of our own being—albeit thinly veiled by the belief andfeeling of separation— this peace, happiness and love shine even in the apparentseparate self. Our own being of aware presence is never truly eclipsed.The search for peace, happiness and love is not initiated by the separate self.Even this search is, in fact, our true self, consciousness, shining in andthrough the apparently separate self. It is the seat of God in us. Sooner orlater, consciousness withdraws the projection of the dualising mind (that is,the projection of the apparently inside self and the apparently outside world)back into itself and, at that moment, it tastes its own nature.Conversations and contemplations such as these are one of the means by which ourself, consciousness, withdraws its projection, as it were, and comes to tasteitself again. They are expressed through the mind and for this reason they canbe tailored to meet the apparently separate self who is also made of mind.However, their true substance is not made of mind—they are made out of thesilence from which they arise—and that is why they sometimes touch the heart ofthe apparently separate self whose true nature is also made out of this silence.Their source is this silent presence and it is this presence behind, between andwithin the words that is recognised. And who recognises this presence? Onlypresence can recognise itself. Not presence ‘there’ recognising presence ‘here.’Just presence, the one presence, recognising itself in itself, by itself, asitself, in the timeless, placeless place of its own being."},{"pageContent":"Is This the Final Understanding?Q: Nisargadatta said: “For you, you appear in the world. For me, the worldappears in me.” This is one of those statements that, if one gets it, it is theend of story. There is nothing further to get.If this is the end of the story for you, I respect that and what is said heremay not be of interest. However, for those who understand from their ownexperience that the world arises in them and yet still wonder what the realityof this world really is, then there is more that can be said about it.The formulation ‘The world arises in me’ is true in relation to the previousbelief that the world arises or appears at a distance from and outside of ourself (and it was probably in that context in which Nisargadatta said it).However, it is not the final understanding.There is still a subtle dualism in this statement between the world that arises,albeit within myself as awareness, and awareness itself, just as, relativelyspeaking, there is a distinction between the objects that appear in a room andthe space of the room in which they appear.Further and deeper contemplation of experience reveals that, in fact, objects donot arise or appear within awareness. Where would such an object arise or appearfrom, out of what would it be made and where would it go when it disappeared?The ‘world’, as we know it, is simply the belief that there is something otherthan awareness. However, if we look for such a world, for something that arisesor appears, we do not find it.Our experience, whether or not it is recognised, is always only of oneever-present, homogeneous, changeless substance, that is both aware and present.This is all we are, all we know and all we love. We, this aware presence, nevermove, change, go anywhere or do anything. We are always in our own place, thisplaceless place of our self.We simply abide as we are and sometimes this abiding seems to be coloured, as itwere, by the taste of tea, the sound of conversation, the image of the streetand cars, San Francisco airport, the grey of the London sky, the texture ofsheets, the image of a dream, the ‘nothingness’ of deep sleep, an email from afriend...In this placeless place, nothing appears or arises inside of awareness. There isno world, others or objects, as such.Our self, awareness, is the sole substance of all (but there is no ‘all’) andevery apparent thing is our own self modulating itself in the form of sights,sounds, tastes, textures, smells etc. but always being only itself.Having seen clearly that there is no world, object or other, as such, we canthen ask what then is our self, awareness, this one substance? However, in orderto give it a name we have to objectify it even slightly. We make it a ‘some’thing and as opposed to ‘another’ thing. We are back in duality.So, when the idea of a separate, independent world collapses, the idea ofawareness collapses with it. If there is no object, there cannot be a subject.If there is a subject, there must be an object. So even in the idea of‘oneness’, duality is implied. ‘Oneness’ is one thing too much.And then we realise how wise the early masters were. They didn’t name thisunderstanding ‘one’ or ‘oneness’. They just went as far as saying that it is‘not two’.The mind simply cannot go further than this. We end in silence. Not a silencethat is an absence of sound but one that is prior to the absence or presence ofsound or, more broadly speaking, prior to and beyond the body, mind and world.And yet, when the body, mind and world appear it is only the form of thissilence that is truly known.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]The concept of our self, ‘I’, awareness, is the first to arise and the last togo. There is good reason for this: it is the only ‘thing’ that is ‘real’ andtherefore the only thing that truly merits conceptualisation.In fact, we realise that all names and words are, in fact, the names ofawareness, names that seem to qualify it. Tea, sounds, street, cars, airport,sky... all these are the names and forms of awareness, just as in a film,people, houses, trees, fields and sky are simply the names and forms that wegive to the screen. They are always only the screen.Awareness has no name but is called by all names.So, in some ways, we are back where we started, pure experiencing. Everything issimple again. Questioning and contemplating the nature of reality has done itsjob. It has come to its own end. We find ourselves back on the streets again, soto speak, deeply at the heart of all experience, as love, free to take the shapeof all experience and yet independent of all experience.That is, we find ourselves as love, freedom and peace itself."},{"pageContent":"The Dissolution of Thought in Its Own SubstanceQ: How does memory work and does it not validate the belief in the continuity ofobjects and the world?Let us imagine that last night we had dinner in a restaurant.

This is followed by a thought (let us call it thought C) thatconnects image B to perception A.

Both must already have taken placefor thought C to appear.So, in order to connect these two non-existent experiences together (perceptionA and image B), thought C imagines ‘a vast container’ in which perception A andimage B, along with innumerable other non-existent objects and events, areconsidered to reside.This vast container is called ‘mind.’ However, we have no experience of a mindother than the thought that thinks it.Once the idea of mind as a vast container is considered to represent somethingthat actually exists, thought can have a field day! It can populate thisimagined container called ‘mind’ with all sorts of imagined experiences such astime, space, memory, objects, people, birth, death, causality etc.Only one thing is missing in this picture that would account for our currentpredicament: having created this imaginary world of time, space, causality etc.in thought, we then have to forget that it is all created simply with thethought that thinks it. In other words, we have to forget that it is imaginedand imagine instead that it is real.So, thought imagines that its very own creation is, in fact, not its very owncreation but rather that it exists independent of its being thought about. Atthat moment imagination seems to become reality and reality itself seems, as aresult, to become lost or veiled.That is, imagination and reality change place. Imagination seems to becomereality and reality is, at best, imagined or, worse still, considerednon-existent.This forgetting of the reality of experience is known as ‘ignorance’. It is theignoring of the direct, immediate and intimate nature of our experience. Thisignoring of reality is synonymous with imagining the separate inside self andthe separate outside world, that is, the subject and the object.Once we have forgotten that time, space, entities, objects, causality etc. etc.are imagined, they seem to become very real and we, the imaginary people thatappear as the result of this forgetting, seem to reap the inevitableconsequences of this forgetting.However, having forgotten that all this is simply a creation of thought, we findourselves bemused by it, because deep in our hearts resides the knowledge of thereality of our experience. That is, there is no true forgetting.The strength of our remembering, that is, the strength of awareness knowing ofits own being, is never really obscured even by the most apparently ignorantthought.This bemusement is the experience we know as suffering or unhappiness. It is aconflict between the deep intuition of happiness that resides at the heart ofall experience and the beliefs that thought has superimposed upon it.Having failed to relieve this unhappiness satisfactorily through all theconventional means that are on offer in the realms of the body, mind and world,some of us eventually turn round and question the very construct of mind itself.What is memory, time, space, the separate self, the world etc? All thesequestions are really the same question and they are all eventually answered bythe same answer.However, that ultimate answer is not just one more construct of thought. It isthe dissolution of thought in its own substance.So, if we trace back your question all the way and refuse to be satisfied withan answer that is yet another construct of thought, the answer is found as thisliving, non-objective ever-presence into which thought dissolves and out ofwhich it is made.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]The dissolution of thought is known as understanding. Understanding does nottake place in thought although it may be formulated by it. Hence, thetransparent experience of understanding is the identical experience to peace,happiness, love or beauty. It is the experience of our true nature tastingitself, un-apparently modified by the dualising mind.When the experience of understanding takes place at the end of a question aboutthe relative nature of things—such as the question ‘What is two plus two?’—theunderstanding that takes place—and which is subsequently formulated as theanswer ‘four’—is, like all understanding, a taste of our true nature, its tasteof itself.However, when the mind reappears again, ignorance is reformulated and seemsagain to veil our true nature. Thus unhappiness is perpetuated.However, if understanding is experienced at the end of a question about our truenature, our self again tastes itself, that is, it tastes its own transparentnature. However, this time, when the mind returns it has been relieved of thebeliefs about our true nature, just as in the previous example the mind had beenrelieved of the uncertainty of the question, ‘What is two plus two?’ Thisdissolution of the ignorance of our true nature is the experience commonly knownas enlightenment.This experience of enlightenment is the end of the belief in the separate selfand thus brings one chapter of our life to a close. However, it is only thebeginning of true self-realisation, which involves the dissolution of the senseof separation in our feelings— that is, in the body—rather than simply in ourbeliefs.The experience of enlightenment is, for many people in contemporary non-dualcircles, the biggest trap. Having discovered that there is no separate self, allthe still prevalent feelings of separation are met with the partialunderstanding that they appear to no-one.Hence by far the larger aspect of separation, the feeling of separation, remainsintact in most cases and any further investigation of our experience iscurtailed by the superficial understanding that all seeking is undertaken by thenon-existent separate self.Hence in our era, the subtlety, depth and richness of the true non-dualunderstanding have been downgraded and adapted to a culture that is satisfiedwith quick fixes and superficial understanding, although many people that oncesubscribed to this superficial understanding are now beginning to realize thattheir search was numbed but not truly ended by this partial understanding.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]Returning now to the dissolution of memory, time, space, the separate self,objects, others, the world etc., we may well still wonder, if all these aresimply constructs of mind, made only of intermittent objects that bear norelation to one another, why there is such consistency to appearances. After allit is this consistency that seems to validate the belief in all these concepts.What appears to be consistency between objects or thoughts is, in fact, a palereflection at the level of the mind of the only true consistency there is, whichis the consistency or, more accurately, the ever-presence of our own being,awareness.In other words, even in the appearance of intermittent thoughts, images,sensations and perceptions, which are not in themselves consistent, awareness,as it were, leaves a trace of itself, a hint of its own reality.In fact, all experience is shining with the ever-presence of awareness.The apparent consistency in time or permanence in space does not belong to therealm of thoughts or objects. It belongs to awareness. The ever-presence ofawareness is translated, in the language of mind, as continuity in time andpermanence in space.Time and space are the mind’s way of conceptualizing the eternal and infinitenature of reality. They are hints of the beloved in the realm of the mind."},{"pageContent":"Does Life Have a Purpose?Q: Does consciousness have a purpose or plan for all this manifestation?The idea of a purpose or plan is for thought, not for consciousness.For the separate inside self that thought imagines, the ultimate purpose of lifeis love, peace and happiness. That is why everyone seeks them, not realisingthat the apparently inside self and its inevitable search veil the very love,peace and happiness for which it is in search.However, love, peace and happiness are inherent in the knowing of our own being.In fact, they are the knowing of being. They are simply other names for ourself.In other words, love, peace and happiness are present as the origin andsubstance of all appearances, so it cannot be said that the purpose ofappearances is to acquire them. They are already present! They are already theentire substance of the thought that seeks them.It is only a thought that rises up and imagines that consciousness is notpresent, and therefore that love, peace and happiness are not present. With thisthought the seamless intimacy of our own being seems to become two things, aninside self and an outside world.From that moment onwards the apparently separate self is condemned to searchingin the apparently outside world for the lost love, peace and happiness, andmakes of this search a great mission, purpose or plan. It then imagines thatthis purpose or plan must be inherent in consciousness. It is not. It is in themind alone. The drama in the film is for the image not for the screen.So, if we think we are a separate inside self, the purpose or plan is to findlove, peace and happiness. That search is not something the separate self does.It is what it is.However, as soon as it becomes clear that we are not a separate inside self, itis simultaneously realised that the ultimate achievement of the apparent self’spurpose or plan is already present prior to and during all appearances, as theirorigin and substance. It is not achieved as a result of the mind’s projects. Itis revealed when the mind’s projects are dissolved. In fact, it is the mind’sprojects that veil the love, peace and happiness that are being sought.The search for love, peace and happiness veils the very love, peace andhappiness that are being sought. Searching for love, peace and happiness is likelooking for darkness with a torch.At the same time these projects are inevitable as long as we consider ourselvesto be a separate inside self, precisely because this apparent self is the mainproject!In other words, consciousness knows itself as the love, peace and happiness thatis the source and substance of all appearances whilst, for the apparent person,love, peace and happiness are their destiny.That is, for consciousness there is no purpose or plan. For the apparentlyseparate inside self there is a purpose or a plan. In fact, the apparent selfdoesn’t have a plan; it is a plan.The apparently separate inside self is the search for happiness. Our true self,aware presence or consciousness is the happiness it is searching for.How could happiness have a plan? It is already that for which all plans aremade."},{"pageContent":"The Seed of SeparationQ: What about being joy, love and peace, collectively? Will you comment on usall realising ourselves as one knowing presence, and/or how humanity as a wholecan see its self, actually awakening to being one, no one and many?The experience of joy, love and peace is the experiential realisation that thereis no separate inside self and no separate outside objects, others or world.It is the dualising mind that first conceptually divides the seamless intimacyof aware presence into two apparent things—one, the awareness part that isconsidered to reside inside the body and, two, the being or existence part thatis considered to reside outside in the world.This separation of experience into two apparent things gives credibility to theapparent existence of a separate subject inside the body and a separate outsideobject, which are subsequently fragmented into a multiplicity of people, selves,others and the world.The same dualising mind then seeks to alleviate the suffering that is inherentin its own fragmentation of experience and, by so doing, simply perpetuates itsown illusion and the suffering that attends it.This approach does not imply that nothing is done in response to a givensituation in the world. Once the mind is no longer dominated by and in serviceto the belief in separation, it becomes a tool in the hand of love andintelligence.The form in which this love and intelligence is expressed will vary greatlydepending on the particular characteristics of the body and mind through whichthey are expressed.However, whatever their particular characteristics, the activities that comefrom joy, love and peace are replete with their origin. They communicate it. Thescale on which they deliver depends on the power of the body and mind and thecircumstances in which they prevail, but that is not important.In one it may express itself in the work of an artist, in another as a socialactivist, in another as a mother or father looking after their family, inanother a teacher, and so on, in an almost infinite variety of ways.However, joy, love and peace are prior to all these activities, not theirresult. If we make them into a project, we create a future and we commitourselves to an endless cycle of becoming.It is not the separate self or humanity that sees the true self of awarepresence. It is aware presence that sees the apparently separate self orhumanity. In fact, that is not quite true. It is a concession to a belief inindependent objects and selves.Aware presence sees only itself. In order to see an apparently separate self andits counterpart, the apparently separate world, aware presence has first to takethe shape of the mind. The apparently separate inside self and the apparentlyoutside separate world are made out of that mind. They are born of an imaginaryfragmentation of experience into two apparent things or entities.In other words, only the mind sees a mind. Only an apparent self sees anapparent self and an apparent world.This apparent self then tries to relieve the suffering in the world withoutrealising that the suffering that it is trying to relieve is inherent in andcreated by its view of itself as a separate inside entity, amongst many others,in an outside world.However, the separate inside self does not suffer. It is the activity ofsuffering.This separate inside self cannot cure the problem because this imaginary self,with all of its projects, is the problem. However, the separate inside self isonly a problem from its own imaginary point of view.Without this separate inside self, there is no world, no humanity, no others, asthey are normally conceived to be, to save. In fact, there is no problem. And,ironically, it is this understanding that is truly humane and compassionate,that truly helps the world.Of course, the separate self is often offended when he or she hears this,because his or her own imaginary identity is being exposed. We may even feelfrustration or anger when we hear this.But this frustration is a gift from our true self of aware presence to itself,because it reveals the seed of separation. It is this seed that flourishes asall the various forms of suffering.Likewise it is the dissolution of this seed of separation that flourishes as allthe forms of joy, love and peace. It is here that all conflicts, personal orotherwise, are resolved."},{"pageContent":"Offering Everything to PresenceQ: You say, “From time to time old layers of identification with the body andmind reappear. Those that are necessary for the functioning of everyday lifecontinue as and when they are needed. Those that are not functional drop awaynaturally.” Would you please speak of this a bit more?What is normally described as enlightenment is the experiential understandingthat our self is ever-present, unlimited awareness.This realization may seem to come at the end of a long process of preparation orit may seem to come unexpected and unsolicited. In either case, the patterns ofthe body and mind that have been rehearsed, in most cases over many years, donot disappear immediately but continue to appear, out of habit, for some time.However, they are no longer fuelled by the apparently separate inside self thatwas previously at their origin. They are simply old habits running on momentum.They are, as it were, empty. There is no real entity at their source. How longthese habits take to run down varies from case to case.It is a common misunderstanding to think that, after this so-calledenlightenment, everything will be perfect and, as a result, we sometimes loseheart when these old habits appear.Enlightenment is the end of one process, the process of thinking and feelingourselves to be a separate and limited inside self, but the beginning ofanother. It is the beginning of the realignment of the body, mind and world withthis new experiential understanding.If one has been on the path for many years, the body and mind may already bewell aligned with this new understanding and, as a result, very little changewill take place. For another who has stumbled across this without muchpreparation, there may be an explosion at the level of the body and mind, withdramatic effects and experiences. These are the ones we normally hear aboutbecause they make good stories and, in these cases, there is often a relativelylong period of time during which the body and mind are re-orchestrated, as itwere, by the new experiential understanding.However, it is for each of us to see whether such thoughts, feelings andactivities of separation have, at their origin, a belief in separation, orwhether they are simply old habits of the body and mind winding down. However,in neither case is it necessary to have an agenda with them.We should be happy when these residues of ignorance show up. They are our trueself showing itself those areas of the body and mind that have yet to becolonised by its presence.There is no need to make a problem of our problems. We simply get used to beingpresence knowingly. The residues of the separate self can simply be offered topresence.What does offering them to presence mean? It may mean subjecting our belief inseparation, and the feelings and actions that follow from it, to the scrutiny ofreason. Or it may mean simply welcoming these uncomfortable feelings, allowingthem to take their full shape within presence with no agenda for or against.In both cases, what seems from the point of view of the apparently separate selfto be an offering of the body and mind to presence is, in fact, presencepermeating the old residues of ignorance at the level of the body and mind withits inherent nature of peace, freedom and happiness.As the residues of ignorance at the level of the body and mind drop away,responses to situations will arise in the moment, out of the moment itself,unmediated by the sense of separation. Nothing necessary for the functioning ofan ordinary life is lost. All that is lost is the sense of separation, whichacts as a sort of lens through which experience is filtered and with which it ismanipulated to serve the insatiable requirements of a non-existent entity.No longer dulled by the sense of separation, the body and mind return to theirnatural condition—open, sensitive and loving. In response to a situation theybecome instruments of love and understanding in action. Left to themselves,without the need to respond to a particular situation, they quietly get on withlife celebrating their origin at every moment."},{"pageContent":"Love Only Knows ItselfQ: You once responded to a question with the answer, “Because there is love”.When the essential emptiness of the true self is perceived, peace begins topervade one’s life, but it seems that the concept of love fails to do justice tothis experience. Do you think that love has any reality outside of theconceptual arena?The answer, “Because there is love,” was given to the question “How do we knowthat awareness is impersonal”?The implicit understanding in this answer is that the word ‘love’ is used topoint towards the experiential understanding that there is only one awarenessor, more accurately, that there is only awareness.If a number of people were asked if they knew or felt that the awareness that isseeing this very question is unlimited and impersonal, most would answer ‘No.’However, if those same people were asked if they felt or knew that love existed,most, if not all, would answer, ‘Yes.’ In other words, few people doubt theexperience of love but most of us misinterpret it.The mind in fact knows nothing of love, precisely because it is not presentduring the experience. That is why we like it so much!Love could be said to be the dissolution of those boundaries or borders whichseem to separate us one from another, that is, that seem to divide awarenessinto subjects, objects and parts. In other words, it is the dissolution of thedualising mind.When the mind returns and tries to describe this non-objective experience oflove in which it was not present and about which therefore it knows nothing, itmisinterprets the experience.The mind returns saturated, as it were, with the taste of love out of which ithas arisen. It retains the perfume of this non-objective experience.Not knowing where this perfume comes from, the mind manufactures a story toaccount for the new and happy state in which it finds itself. Out of theseamlessness of experience it imagines two entities, in this case a lovingsubject, ‘I’, and a loved object, the other, ‘you’, which are supposedlyconnected together by an activity of loving.As the shine wears off the mind, it seems that the experience of love is lost.Bewildered as a result of this apparently lost love, the separate self goes outagain in search of a relationship that will recover the experience of love, notrealising that it is its own presence—the apparently separate self—and itscounterpart, the separate other, that veils the love for which it is searching.Off the apparently separate self goes again, out into the apparent world ofobjects and others, until it encounters a face that reminds it of the beloved,at which moment the separate self plunges again into non-existence and lovetastes itself anew.So, in answer to your question, ‘Do you think that love has any reality outsideof the conceptual arena?’, I would say that love’s only reality is outside theconceptual arena.Our attempts to conceptualise love (such as I have done here) are feebleattempts, using the abstract symbols of the mind, to point towards the realityof our experience, which is intimately and directly experienced and known byeveryone and yet which is completely beyond the capacity of the mind to know,grasp or understand.In fact, the mind does not even know how to think of love, let alone how todefine it. If we try to think of love, we do not even know where to startlooking—it is closer than close and yet lies in an unknown direction.Love only knows itself."},{"pageContent":"Person, Witness, Substance, PresenceDuring any thought, sensation or perception there is only thinking, sensing orperceiving taking place. When the thought, sensation or perception comes to anend, the mind immediately rises up again and creates a ‘filler’ thought. This‘filler’ thought is the ‘I’ thought. With this thought the apparently separate‘I’ is created and is imagined to have been present during the previous thought,sensation or perception, as its creator and witness.In this way the dualising mind imagines the true and only ‘I’ of aware presenceto be a separate thinker, feeler, chooser, lover, creator, etc. Hence ‘I think,’‘I feel,’ ‘I choose,’ ‘I love.’ etc. etc. With this belief, ‘I,’ aware presence,seems to become ‘I,’ the mind.Likewise, with this ‘filler’ thought the ‘I’ of aware presence is imagined to bea doer and, as a result, seems to become ‘I’ the body. In other words, ‘I theseparate self’ is conceived as a reality.As such, experience now seems to consist of perception A, then ‘I, the separateself’,’ perception B, then ‘I, the separate self’,’ perception C, then ‘I, theseparate self’,’ etc. etc.Each of these ‘I, the separate self’,’ thoughts is considered to be indicativeof a permanent ‘I’ entity which supposedly runs throughout every perception andis considered to remain after the perception has ceased.When the ‘I, the separate self’ thought is seen to be simply a thought thatappears from time to time (in other words, that it is simply another perception)and to make reference to an entity which is, in fact, entirely non-existent,this filler ‘I’ thought loses its foundation (the belief that it refers tosomething real) and dissolves as a result, revealing the aware presence that wasunderneath it all along.In other words instead of perception, ‘I’ thought, perception, ‘I’ thought,perception, ‘I’ thought, there is now perception, presence, perception,presence, perception, presence....As this becomes more our lived experience, the presence that shines betweenperceptions is also understood experientially to run throughout all perceptions.In other words, aware presence is known to be ever-present and to sometimes‘take the shape’ of thinking, sensing or perceiving.So our experience is felt as, ‘I’, presence, taking the shape of the texture ofsheets, the morning light, the warmth of water, the taste of tea, the hum oftraffic, the voices at work, the perceptions of home, the image of a dream, thepeace of deep sleep etc., always changing outwardly, never changing inwardly.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]Q: Is it true that, whilst from the ultimate perspective there is no doer,experiencer or world, the sense of a doer, an experiencer and a world isnaturally experienced and is not a mistake or a problem to be transcended, butrather impartially witnessed and enjoyed?If we know ourselves as the witness of the doer and the experiencer then, bydefinition, we know that we are not a doer or an experiencer. In other words, wecannot legitimately say that we feel that we are the witness and the doer at thesame time.At the moment we know ourselves as the witness, we know, by definition, thatthere is no individual doer or experiencer. There are just thoughts, sensationsand perceptions arising in awareness. The previously imagined doer orexperiencer is understood to be simply a witnessed thought or sensation arising,along with all others, in awareness.And conversely, the moment we consider ourselves to be a doer, a thinker or anexperiencer, we cease to have the experiential understanding that we are thewitness.When we know thoughts, sensations and perceptions to be arising in our self,aware presence, we take our stand as the witness. When we know them to arise asour self we take our stand as their substance.As witness we are transcendent. As substance, immanent. As witness we take ourstand as no-thing. This is the position of wisdom. As substance we take ourstand as everything. This is the position of love.These are the two modes of experience: as witness we are the knowing element inall experience. As substance we are the being element in all experience. Thatis, we simultaneously know the world and are the world.The conjunction of these two reveals the third element of experience, known asenjoyment in relation to the world and as friendship in relation to ‘others’. Inother words, it is known as happiness and love.So, we could say that we first seem to know our self as a doer, that is, a body,and an enjoyer, that is, a mind. As this apparent body and mind, we seem to knowa world.Upon investigation we find that we are not a body or a mind that knows a worldbut rather that we are the witness of the body, mind and world.The ‘I’ that was considered to be a body and mind is now realised to be ‘I’ thewitnessing presence of awareness. It is not that the ‘I’ of the body and mindhas dissolved or disappeared but rather that it is revealed to be and to havealways been the witnessing presence of awareness rather than a body or a mind.In other words, it is relieved of a conceptual limitation.However, this witnessing ‘I’ still seems to be subtly distinct or separate fromthe witnessed body, mind and world. Upon closer investigation, we find that ‘I’is not just the witness but also, simultaneously, the substance out of which thebody, mind and world are made. Again, it is not that the witnessing ‘I’dissolves or disappears but rather that it is relieved of a subtlesuperimposition with which it was seemingly limited and located.However, as we go more deeply into experience, we find that ‘I’ as the substanceof all seeming things still subtly validates the idea of ‘things’ in their ownright, which, upon investigation, are found to be non-existent. At this stagethe idea of ‘I’ as ‘substance’ is relieved of its last trace of superimpositionand remains standing in and as itself, naked and alone.What for the mind seems to be a progression from person to witness to substanceto aware presence, is, for presence itself, no progression at all. Veiling andunveiling are for the mind. Presence is always only itself.In ignorance presence seems to come and go in the world. In wisdom the worldseems to come and go in presence. In love, all is consumed in presence leavingonly pure love itself without any knowledge of objects, bodies, minds, others,selves, entities, things, just pure seamless, nameless, indivisible intimacy."},{"pageContent":"We Do Not Know What Anything IsQ: Is it possible to know what the body, an object or the world really is,independent of the mind?We have arrived at the clear experiential understanding that all that is knownof the apparent body, object or world is sensing and perceiving and that ourself, awareness, is the substance of all sensing and perceiving. Thinking adds alabel to this sensing and perceiving and with that addition, the apparentobject, other or world is created.Such an object is conceived as a thing in its own right. Sensing and perceivingsupplies its form; thinking, its name.Therefore, things, objects, bodies and the world, as they are normally conceivedto be, are simply concepts that we superimpose upon the reality of experience.They are never experienced, as such. However, we can go further than that. Notonly have a body, object or world, as such, never been experienced independentof sensing and perceiving, but they never could be.This brings us to a simple but extraordinary conclusion: the ultimate reality ofall things, indeed reality itself, is not only unknown by the mind but, moreimportantly, unknowable. We truly do not know what anything is. In fact, we donot even know if there are such ‘things’ in the first place, to be known.The mind can only know its own creations. If it imagines that there is somethingwith real and independent existence outside of itself, then that image is simplyone more of its own creations. And if it turns round, as it were, to try to findits own essence, it dissolves.In short, if the mind looks for something outside of itself, it only finds moreof itself. If it looks within itself to find its own essence, it dies like amoth in a flame.Once this is clearly seen, the mind is relieved of an immense bur-den—the burdenof knowing. Such a mind is silent and free. It knows nothing but can expresseverything. It has no fixed positions but can take any position relative to agiven situation. The mind does not and cannot know reality and yet, at the sametime, is its expression.As William Blake said, “All things possible to be believed are an image oftruth.”It is this freedom and creativity that lies at the heart of all true artisticexpression. The mind cannot touch reality and yet it is saturated in it.It is for this reason that Blake also said, “Eternity is in love with theproductions of time.”Likewise, for this reason, there is no end to an artist’s work. If reality werein the mind, there would be an end of art, an end of creativity. There would besomething to find; somewhere at which to arrive; the final statement.But there is not. The ‘productions of time’ flow timelessly from eternity, theever-present now, simultaneously exploring, celebrating and sharing their ownsubstance, a dance of love and beauty that has no purpose other than celebratingitself. All true art is only for art’s sake alone. It has no other purpose ordestination.So, does this mean that reality is unknown or unknowable? No! If that were so,whatever is known or experienced in this and every situation would be somethingother than reality. It simply means that the conceptualising mind has no accessto reality. But reality has access to itself. Reality knows itself.It is the knowing of itself. But it is not a knowing in relationship. It is aknowing in identity. Love is the name that is given to this ‘knowing inidentity’.There is nothing other than reality’s knowing of itself. There is nothing otherthan love. It is also known as ‘this’ and ‘I’."},{"pageContent":"There is Only Pure IntimacyQ: When do objects become solid? I think you will say, “When the perceivingconsciousness contracts and becomes a thinking subject, a separate I-entity.” Inthat case, there is a thinking subject (that which sees) separate from theobject (that which is seen) but not yet solid objects.I would not say, “When the perceiving consciousness contracts and becomes athinking subject, a separate I-entity”, because consciousness never contracts orindeed expands. Nor indeed do objects ever become solid.Rather I would say that objects seem to become real in themselves, that is,become solid, when dualising thought arises and exclusively identifiesconsciousness with a fragment, with a body, and seems as a result to contractconsciousness into a personal, limited ‘I’,You go on to say, “In that case there is a thinking subject (that which sees)separate from the object (that which is seen) but not yet solid objects.”However, the so-called physical objects that seem to result from this separationof experience into a perceiving subject and a perceiving object are, bydefinition, seemingly solid. It is the apparent objectivity that is created bythis act of imagination that confers apparent solidity, otherness, separatenessand ‘not-me-ness’ upon objects.However, objects are never really solid precisely because, in reality, there areno objects. Touch any object now, this book or screen, for instance. A newsensation appears. Is that sensation solid? No! There is only the knowing of thesensation and all knowing is made of consciousness. And how solid isconsciousness?The apparent objectivity and solidity of the world, others and objects is thenatural counterpart of the apparent subjectivity of the personal ‘I’.In other words, the apparently separate subject and the apparently separateobject always appear and dissolve together. It is their appearance, that is, theappearance of dualising thought, which seems to obscure or veil consciousness,resulting in the apparent reality of objectivity and solidity.Likewise, it is the dissolution of dualising thought that restores theexperience of objects as they truly are, that is, as modulations of our ownbeing, consciousness.Consciousness is simply the knowing of being, so this apparent veiling ofconsciousness could be said to be the knowing of something apparently other thanour self, the knowing of something other than being.This ‘something apparently other than being’ is what is known as the separate‘I’ and the separate ‘object, other or world’. So, objects seem to become realand solid at the moment dualising thought seems to veil the knowing of being.Therefore, ‘objectness’ and ‘solidity’ are simply ideas that are superimposed bythought onto the reality of our experience.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]Let us explore this experientially. How does the idea and apparent feeling ofobjectness and solidity arise? There is consciousness, transparent, formless,full only of the knowing of itself—pure knowing and being.This consciousness, having no form, has the capacity to appear as all forms.Consciousness ‘gives itself’ to all apparent forms but loses itself to none ofthem.In order to appear as an apparent form, consciousness takes the shape of what wecall ‘mind’, in the broadest sense of the word. That is, consciousness takes theshape of sensing, perceiving and thinking.This is meant in the same sense as it could be said that a screen takes theshape of the image that appears on it, such as a landscape. The screen doesn’tactually become anything other than itself, such as a landscape, but only seemsto.So, now imagine consciousness taking the shape of sensing and perceiving, justas the ocean takes the shape of a current fl owing within it. Water withinwater.Sensing and perceiving is made only of consciousness and it is consciousnessthat knows itself as such. Sensing and perceiving could be said to be amodulation of our own being, a modulation of consciousness.For our self, that is, for consciousness, being ‘sensing and perceiving’ andknowing ‘sensing and perceiving’ is one single experience, not two.At this stage the entire sensation/perception is known to be made of one singlesubstance, our self, consciousness. That is, consciousness knows itself, as itwere, as sensing/perceiving. ‘Mind’ and ‘matter’ are not yet experiences.Consciousness simply knows itself in and as the intimacy of sensing/perceiving.Consciousness is too intimately, utterly one with itself as sensing/ perceivingto separate itself out and know itself as ‘something’, as a sensation or aperception, that is, as an object.Consciousness is both the existence of the sensation/perception andsimultaneously the knowing of it.Now at a certain point consciousness takes the shape of thinking, which is, asit were, another current within the ocean. It is another modulation ofconsciousness within consciousness.And because thinking is made only of consciousness it has the possibility ofassuming the form of an infinite variety of thoughts. One such thought is thethought that identifies consciousness, which in reality pervades allsensing/perceiving, with just one little part of it, that is, with the littlepart of it called ‘the body’.In other words, this dualising thought splits the seamless intimacy ofsensing/perceiving into two parts—a ‘body’ part and a ‘not-the-body’ part.With this thought consciousness, which in reality is the substance of all ofsensing/perceiving equally, is imagined to pervade only the body part and notthe ‘not-the-body’ part. In other words, the ‘I’ of consciousness, which onceknew itself as the substance of all sensing/perceiving, now seems to know itselfonly as the body.However, consciousness in reality always only knows itself. It never truly knowsanything other than itself. So, to effect the apparent veiling of itself, itfirst has to take the shape of the dualising mind.The dualising mind, however, is made only of consciousness and therefore doesnot truly veil consciousness, any more than the arising of an image on thescreen veils the screen. It only seems to.That is, with this thought, consciousness is identified with the body. However,this identification is apparent only. It never actually happens. It is onlybelieved to have happened. It is imagined. The identification is for thought,not for consciousness. This belief is the ‘separate-I-entity’, the ‘ego’, andits corollary, the ‘world’. It is the ‘forgetting of presence’.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]With this thought we have moved from a position in which consciousness is knownand felt to be the substance of all experience equally, to a position in whichit is believed and felt to be the substance of only the body.So, if consciousness is believed and felt to be the substance of the body—inother words, if ‘I’ am believed and felt to be the body— what is the‘not-the-body’ made of? That is, what are ‘objects’, ‘others’ and the ‘world’made of?As a corollary to the belief that consciousness is located in and as the body, anew belief is created to account for everything that is now considered to be‘other-than-consciousness.’ This new entity is called ‘the world.’ In otherwords, the ‘world’ is a concept that is believed to be ‘everything-I-am-not’.In other words, the ‘separate-I-entity’ and the ‘world’ are two aspects of thesame idea. That idea is the belief that consciousness is veiled or not present.Now this imagined ‘world’ must be made of something. Thought has already splitour experience in two and assigned consciousness to the body, so the world mustbe made of ‘something-other-than-consciousness’. This‘something-other-than-consciousness’ is what we call ‘matter’. This ‘matter’ isconsidered to be solid, inert and dense. It is the opposite of everything weconsider consciousness to be.As a result, when we touch a chair we feel that ‘I’ (this alive being inside thebody) is touching the chair (that dead, inert thing outside the body). That is,the chair is experienced as being solid, dense, inert.However, the experience of the chair is, in fact, the experience of one newsensation/perception. This new sensation/perception is made only ofsensing/perceiving and as we have seen, sensing/ perceiving is made only ofconsciousness. It is a modulation of consciousness.There is nothing solid, dense or inert about sensing/perceiving.Sensing/perceiving is vibrant, alive—alive with the knowingness and beingness ofconsciousness. It is the light of consciousness that makes the experienceknowable. In fact, there is no other substance to the experience of the chairother than the light of consciousness. It is the aliveness of consciousness thatmakes the experience living, vibrant, intimate, real.If we go deeply into the experience of sensing/perceiving that we call the‘chair’, we find this alive, vibrating sensing/perceiving made only of theknowingness and beingness of consciousness. We find nothing dense, solid orinert there.Density, inertia and solidity are simply concepts superimposed onto the realityof our experience by the dualising mind. These concepts dull the living,sensitive, vibrating, intimate quality of all experience, which is naturallyinfused with enjoyment, enthusiasm and love, and reduce it to ‘matter’,‘objects’ and ‘others’.In other words, ‘matter’ and ‘solidity’ are only a seeming reality for thought.They are not a reality for consciousness. For consciousness, which means for ourself, consciousness itself is the reality of all experience.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]Q: However, when I touch a chair I feel a chair and, even if it is not named, itis different from my hand. So that part is not completely clear to me.Without the naming, there is no difference between the hand and the chair—theyare one experience. Even with the naming, they are still one, only they are notknown as such. Naming seems to separate them into two distinct objects.In fact, without naming there is no ‘hand’ or ‘chair’ in the first place thatcould be either the same as or different from one another. There is onlysensing/perceiving. In fact, without naming there isn’t even sensing/perceiving.There is simply the utterly intimate, unnameable reality of experiencing.Does the hand know that it is a hand? Does the chair know that it is a chair?No! It is thinking/naming that says so. So, in the absence of thinking, whereare the hand and the chair? They are nowhere to be found.In fact, even with thinking/naming, the hand and chair are nowhere to be found,as such, in actual experience. They are not present although they are consideredto be so. It is only thinking that makes them seem to be present in their ownright.In the absence of thinking their seeming presence belongs to consciousnessalone. In fact, even when thinking is present, their seeming presence belongsonly to consciousness. Consciousness is all that is ever truly present and allseeming things borrow their apparent existence from it. In fact, it is not thatconsciousness is present. It is rather that consciousness is presence itself.Only consciousness is ever truly present, knowing and being itself eternally,taking the shape of sensing, perceiving and thinking but never being or becominganything other than itself. The presence of all seeming things properly belongsto consciousness alone.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]Place your hand on the chair and see that one new sensation/perception appears.In fact, it is not even a sensation/perception. It is sensing/perceiving—amodulation of consciousness. Water within water.See clearly that both the apparent hand and the apparent chair are experiencedin this one new sensation/perception. But it is only one sensation/perception.As such, is it hand or chair? As hand it is ‘me’; as ‘chair’ it is ‘not me’. Butit cannot be ‘me’ and ‘not me’ simultaneously.See clearly that ‘hand’ and ‘chair’, ‘me’ and ‘not me’ are labels superimposedby thinking onto the reality of our experience. The experience itself,sensing/perceiving, comes with no label attached. In fact, in the absence ofthinking, it is not even sensing/perceiving. It is simply ‘experiencing’.In fact, even to call it ‘experience’ is too much. To call it ‘experience’ wefirst have to step back, as it were, and see it, name it. But experience is tooclose, too immediate, too intimate to be seen or named. It is already and onlythe knowing and being of itself. There is no time present in experience itselfin which to step back and look from a distance, and nowhere we could step backto, from where we might look.The fish does not know when it is in the water. The fish only knows when it isout of the water. In fact, fishes don’t have a word for water!There is just raw, seamless, indivisible, ever-present experiencing. There isonly pure intimacy."},{"pageContent":"The Ever-Present Reality of ExistenceQ: What appears or is born when the body appears and what dies or disappearswhen the body dies?In order to answer this question we first have to know what the body is when itis alive. The only experience we have of the body is the current one so thisvery experience is the only place from which we can answer this question.The current experience of the body is a sensation/perception. Thissensation/perception is made only of sensing/perceiving and sensing/perceivingis a colouring of awareness.There is no substance present in the experience of the sensation/ perceptionthat we call the body other than the presence of awareness. When the body isapparently present, awareness knows and is that appearance simultaneously.The substance, reality and aliveness of the body belongs to awareness alone,just as the substance and reality of the image belongs to the screen.However, we have no experience of the appearance of awareness. Therefore,awareness cannot be said to be an appearance. So what is it that appears? Itmust be something that is not awareness. But how could and what would such a‘thing’ be?It is sometimes said that things appear in awareness as objects appear in aroom, that is, that they seem come from outside and enter. However, there is no‘outside’ of awareness. Nor is there any stuff outside of awareness that such athing could be made of.Nothing comes from outside awareness and enters it. Nor is there any substance‘within’ awareness out of which an object could be made, other than awarenessitself. Awareness is already fully present. No part of awareness comes or goeswhen an object appears. The totality of awareness is ever-present. Therefore,nothing new appears when an object appears. The substance of all apparentobjects is ever-present.Therefore even ‘appearance and disappearance’ is an idea that is superimposedupon the reality of our experience.The substance of all seeming things is the substance out of which this currentappearance, including the appearance of the body, is made. That substance doesnot come and go. In other words, appearance or birth and disappearance or deathare concepts, never experiences.How do we know that something has disappeared? Where is that ‘disappearedsomething’ now? What became of the substance out of which that ‘disappearedsomething’ was made? Where did it go? It must have gone somewhere. But somethingcannot become nothing.And when something appears, from where did the substance out of which itscurrent appearance is made, come from? The appearing object was non-existentbefore it appeared. But how could something appear out of non-existence? Out ofwhat would it be made?Have we ever experienced or could we ever experience this ‘nonexistence’ out ofwhich things are presumed to come into being and into which they are presumed todisappear?It is only memory, which is itself simply the current thought, that imaginesthat something has disappeared, that imagines a past object that was present andis not now.And it is only thought that imagines an object appearing from somewhere. Butwhere could that object reside outside of the thought that thinks it? It isnowhere to be found.The past is made of memory, the future of imagination. Neither have anyexistence outside the thought that thinks them.And that thought is itself the shape that our own timeless aware presence takesin the eternal now—the ever-present reality of what alone is.Therefore, the past and the future, appearance and disappearance, birth anddeath, are not. That which is known in every experience, which is the totalityof the experience, is ever-present. The substance of all seeming thingseternally is.Our own being, aware presence, lends its reality to all seeming things.To love an apparent other is simply to recognise their ever-present reality. Tobe in love is to abide as this ever-present aware presence.All that is ever loved is the reality of experience, which is all there is toexperience, and that reality is the only one present there to know, be and loveitself, eternally.Love knows nothing other than its own ever-presence.Nothing comes and goes. In fact, ‘nothing’ and ‘something’ are not. In thetimeless, placeless now-here-ness between these apparent two, lies presence.Only appearances appear to come and go. Their reality is ever-present.That which truly is, eternally and alone is."},{"pageContent":"Addiction and Non-DualityQ: For a while now I have had some trouble reconciling some of my behaviour withmy understanding of the non-dual teaching. The fruits of this path havedefinitely been self-evident in ways that I cannot describe. However, in a veryhonest and worldly sense, I have also been struggling with an addiction to lustand pornography.I obviously feel very conflicted about this. It seems to me that this addictive,lustful behaviour is certainly not in alignment with the truth that non-dualitypoints to. However, when the impulse arises to watch it, my mind creates aconvincing dialogue that says, “There is no doer. This is a spontaneousoccurrence. Don’t resist this. All is meaningless,” etc.I then act on the impulse and afterwards the mind rationalises the behaviourwith more of this pseudo logic, falsely claiming that it never left awareness.This is, of course, coupled with all sorts of guilt, inadequacy and otherafflictive emotions. Common sense tells me that something is amiss.I have heard many stories of all sorts of so-called sages, holy men andenlightened gurus who rationalise inappropriate sexual behaviour under a veneerof spiritual truth. How do we, as spiritual seekers, avoid this tragic pitfall,especially when we have a deep understanding that this is a path of acceptanceand not avoidance?Your honesty and clarity already point to the freedom in your self that youseek.Addiction of any sort, be it to inappropriate sexual behaviour, alcohol, drugs,smoking or any milder form of behaviour, almost always has its origin in thebelief and, more importantly, the feeling of being a separate, limited, locatedself.The most common form in which this belief and feeling of separation manifests isthe subtle and not-so-subtle rejection of the current situation—that is, the “Idon’t like what is going on” and the “I want something other than what is goingon”.These two attitudes of resistance and seeking—traditionally referred to as fearand desire—are the two faces of the apparently separate self, that is, the‘resistance to what is’ and the ‘search for happiness.’In other words, ‘the apparently separate entity’, ‘resistance to what is’, andthe ‘search for happiness’ via various objects, substances or experiences, aresynonymous.These three states are, in fact, one and the same state and could also be called‘ignorance’ or the ‘ignoring of the true nature of experience’.Therefore, ‘the apparent separate entity’, ‘resistance to what is,’ and ‘thesearch for happiness’ are incompatible with the experiential understanding ofthe non-dual nature of experience.You have seen that clearly and it is that seeing which enables you to avoid thepitfall of pseudo non-duality that you rightly diagnose.So, let us go to the origin of this ‘resistance to what is’ because if we startanywhere else, for instance, if we were to start with a secondary cause, wewould not be going to the root of the problem and, sooner or later, our searchwill reappear, often in a more virulent form. In fact, the term ‘addiction’ isused precisely to describe this more virulent form of the search that has becomechronic and destructive.The origin of ‘resistance to what is’, is the belief that our essential being,awareness, is limited to and located within a body.This imaginary identification of our self with an object, the body, creates theapparently separate self. The real ‘I’ of awareness seems, as a result, tobecome the limited ‘I’ of the imaginary self. That is, we think and feel that weare a body.This apparently separate self, being made out of an intermittent object, is, bydefinition, unstable, always threatened with change, decay and disappearance.Hence the fear of disappearance that resides at its heart and its naturalcorollary, seeking.The fear comes from the feeling that when this intermittent sensation (the formin which the body is appearing in this moment) disappears, ‘I’ will disappearwith it. And the desire or seeking comes from the apparent need to substantiatethis fleeting entity we believe and feel ourselves to be, in order to perpetuateits apparent existence.To begin with this fear and seeking manifest in the most innocuous forms ofbehaviour, the most common of which is unnecessary thinking, the almost constantmental chatter or commentary that most of us are familiar with.This innocuous commentary is the simplest form of the ‘resistance to what is’.It is the repetitive background chatter that ensures that attention is almostalways diverted away from the immediacy, intimacy and simplicity of ‘what is’.This is the primal addiction.‘What is’ is deemed too boring, plain and uneventful to be worthy of attentionand thinking provides an alternative dream world into which to escape from theboredom or discomfort of the moment.One honest look at our thinking will show that the majority of it serves nopractical, intelligent or creative purpose. It is simply a sort of ‘filler’ thatserves to distract attention from the boredom of ‘what is’. The vast majority ofour thoughts about the past and future serve only to legitimise and perpetuatethis type of thinking and the imaginary self that resides at its heart.However, precisely because this type of thinking is deemed innocuous (in thesense that it has no harmful effect on the body or on society) it passes, forthe most part, unnoticed and is indeed encouraged by our culture in general.For this reason, it is the most common and effective form of addiction thatalmost everyone is engaged in, for the most part, unknowingly. And therein liesits efficiency in keeping the sense of separation alive. Hence it is the perfectrefuge for the apparently separate self.As we grow up, this subtle thinking is no longer sufficient to keep the anxiety,dis-ease and discomfort of the sense of separation at bay and we begin to turnto stronger forms of avoidance.These stronger forms of avoidance are the common forms of addiction with whichwe are familiar—excessive working, eating or activity, or addiction to money,alcohol, smoking, drugs, pornography etc. etc.All these forms of addiction are simply strategies of avoidance - avoidance of‘what is’, avoidance of ‘this’, avoidance of ‘now’, They are the familiarrefuges of the sense of a separate self.Society draws a line, based on whether the addictive activity in question is ofimmediate danger to itself, as to the legitimacy of each of these activities,thereby condoning some and condemning others.However, they are, in fact, all simply strategies of avoidance and denial. Infact, each of them is simply a variation of the root avoidance—incessantthinking that revolves around the separate ‘I’ thought.If we go honestly, as you have done, to our experience, we will always find thisthinking and its deeper counterpart in our feelings at the level of the body,underneath or behind all subsequent forms of addiction.It all begins with ‘I, the body’, That is the root of all suffering, which ouraddictions seek to alleviate.If society condemns one form of addiction more than another, for whateverreason, we may be persuaded to change from one addiction to another, but in ourhearts this fire of discomfort, avoidance and rejection, and its inevitablecounterpart in the search for happiness (which is just another name foraddiction), will continue. And we will not truly rest until we have gone to theroot of the matter.To go to the root of the matter means to go to the source of the apparentlyseparate ‘I’, not just the belief in the separate ‘I’ but, more importantly, thefeeling of such.It is only when the whole mechanism of the apparently separate self has beenseen clearly in all its subtlety that we are free of it, that is, that ‘I,’awareness, stands knowingly in and as itself, unapparently-veiled by the beliefand feeling of separation.It is not enough, as you have discovered, to wash a veneer of, “Oh well,everything is equally an expression of awareness and therefore nothing matters”over our beliefs and feelings. This kind of superficial thinking is one of thesafer refuges for the apparently separate self.The sense of separation is a past master at appropriating anything for its ownpurposes of self-validation and justification, and superficial spirituality isone of its less easily detected forms. Hence the new religion of non-duality.However, that is not your case.In your case you have seen clearly and honestly that addiction, in this case topornography, is a symptom of a deeper and subtler malaise—that of the separateself.You have seen that the mind’s attempts to justify this behaviour with convincingand seemingly watertight non-dual arguments are not expressions of trueunderstanding, but rather the mind’s attempts to manipulate and appropriate thenon-dual teaching to validate its own belief systems. This is one of the mainidentities of the spiritual ego in our era.In this respect, your analysis of the pseudo logic of the mind and yourobservation of the process of impulse, action, guilt and justification are spoton. So, what to do?Go to the heart of the matter—the apparently separate self or the apparentveiling of awareness. They are the same thing.Explore it at the level of the mind, that is, the beliefs we have that seem tovalidate the existence of a separate self. Explore your experience and come toyour own conclusion. See that there is absolutely no experiential evidence forsuch a belief.This conviction will initiate a much deeper exploration of the sense ofseparation at the level of feelings, which are the true residence of theapparent self.Without this deeper exploration non-duality remains, in most cases, a beliefand, as a result, the peace and happiness that are inherent in the trueexperiential understanding of non-duality will remain elusive and further boutsof seeking will be inevitable.The good news about addiction to porn, in contrast to alcohol, tobacco anddrugs, is that it is mainly at the level of thoughts and feelings and does nothave a lasting effect on the body which, in the case of drinking, smoking anddrugs, is often irreparable or, at least, lasts long after the impulse toindulge them has been dissolved.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]Having said that, and in order to facilitate the above I would also suggest onesimple practical approach: every time you feel the impulse to watch porn, justpause. Even if, to begin with, it is only for half a minute, put a little spacebetween your self and the fulfilment of the impulse. As time goes on this periodof time can be extended until you find yourself always as this space.However, don’t expect this space to be peaceful to begin with; it probably won’tbe! Most likely, the impulse (which is, in fact, the bare face of the separateself, the separate ‘I’ in its raw form), on finding that it is no longerrelieved or fulfilled, will probably display itself in full force. It willrebel.Be attentive not only to the thoughts that will try to persuade you that yourimpulses are perfectly okay, that you will only do it one more time, that it isall an expression of awareness, that there is nobody there doing it, etc., butmore importantly to all the uncomfortable feelings in the body that rise up,demanding to be acted upon and relieved.See that the thoughts all revolve around a separate self that is, when sought,found to be non-existent. It is necessary in most cases to carry out thisinvestigation at a rational level thoroughly, in order to come to thisconviction.If this conviction has not been reached, the apparently separate ‘I’ will stillbe very much alive in your thoughts and you are unlikely, as a result, to havethe resolve to explore your feelings fully.Relieved of the thoughts which seem to justify the existence of a separateentity, these feelings are exposed for what they are—raw bodily sensations.These bodily sensations are, in fact, neutral. They only acquire their apparentnegativity (and hence their need to be avoided with addictive behaviour) whencoupled with the belief in a separate self and its attendant story.Divested of this belief in separation and the ‘me’ story that attends it, theseinnocuous bodily sensations lose power over us, that is, the power to make usthink, feel or act on their behalf.Being seen clearly is the one thing the apparent self and its entourage ofstrategic activity cannot stand. There may and probably will be tremendousresistance both in your thoughts and in your body to this gentle,non-interventional but firm approach.However, once the mechanism of the separate self, both at the level of the mindand at the level of the body, has been truly seen through, its foundation hasbeen removed, and it is only a matter of time before the patterns of behaviourthat depended upon its apparent existence for their survival, diminish anddisappear.In the end it is not the exploration that facilitates the peace andunderstanding, but rather the peace and understanding which allows theinvestigation and exploration to unfold and, slowly, in most cases, absorbs, asit were, the apparently separate self and all its patterns of thinking, feelingand acting, back into itself.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]As we sit allowing these thoughts and, more importantly, uncomfortable feelingsto arise, it is important not to have any subtle agenda with them, not to ‘dothis’ in order to ‘get rid of them’, That would be more of the same.Just allow the full panoply of thoughts and feelings to display themselves inyour loving and indifferent presence. In time their ferocity will die down,revealing subtler and subtler layers of thinking and feeling on behalf of aseparate entity, until we come to the little, almost innocuous backgroundthinking about which we were speaking earlier.This is the sense of separation, the ‘ego’, in its apparently mildest and leasteasily detectable form. Be very sensitive to this. Be sensitive to the‘avoidance of what is’ in its subtlest forms. It is the sweet, furry baby animalthat later turns into a monster!As time goes on we become more and more sensitive and we see how much of ourthinking and feeling, as well as our activities, are generated for the solepurpose of avoiding ‘what is’, of avoiding the ‘this’ and the ‘now’,It is this open, un-judging, un-avoiding allowing of all things which, in time,restores the ‘I’ to its proper place in the seat of awareness and which, as anatural corollary to the abiding in and as our true self, gently realigns ourthoughts, feelings and activities with the peace and happiness that are inherentin it."},{"pageContent":"Nobody Has, Owns or Chooses AnythingQ: While allowing the body, mind and world to be as they are, different thoughtsarise, some not so savoury and others that might be better left not acted upon.You have said that, once one begins to abide knowingly as presence, responses tosituations will flow naturally from there. Some thoughts will engage the body,others not.Once again the quandary of will and volition plague me. You have said that aresponse to a situation arises out of the situation itself, with no sense ofthere being a personal ‘responder.’ This is obviously not an act of ‘will’, Isthis akin to a stream flowing into a seeming obstruction and ‘naturally’rerouting itself as the terrain dictates? Am I seeing this clearly? Is this yetanother area where we once believed that the separate entity had control but inreality has none?Yes, I like your analogy of a stream flowing into an obstruction. However, it isnot just the stream that is altered by the obstruction. The obstruction is alsoaltered by the steam.However, that is only true if we consider the stream and the obstruction to beseparate. They are, in fact, one indivisible landscape. ‘Separate parts’ areimagined. That indivisible landscape is only made of ‘separate parts’ from thepoint of view of one of the imagined parts. From the point of view of thelandscape itself, there is always only one landscape, simultaneously acting uponitself and being acted upon by itself.In other words, our seemingly objective experience is a single indivisiblewhole, made only of thinking, imagining, sensing and perceiving. ‘Our own’thoughts, feelings and actions are only ‘our own’ from the point of view of theimagined self that thinking considers us to be. In reality, our thoughts,feelings and actions are an inseparable ‘part’ of the indivisible whole.However, in our actual experience, there are no separate parts, entities orobjects.If we admit provisionally the existence of objective reality, it is one singlewhole. In order to consider it to be made of parts, all acting upon one anotherof their own free will, we first have to imagine ourselves to be one suchentity. In other words, objects, entities and parts only seem to exist, as such,from the point of view of the imaginary entity that thinking considers us to be.That apparent entity is simply the forgetting or apparent ignoring of awareness.But awareness never truly forgets itself. It is only seemingly forgotten orveiled from the point of view of thinking.So, going back to the question about the practical implications of thisunderstanding in life: see that your own thoughts and feelings are aninseparable ‘part’ of the totality at every moment. Nobody ‘has,’ ‘owns’ or‘chooses’ these responses. They simply arise along with everything else. Thereis no having, owning or choosing entity there.Your own thoughts and feelings along with the one who seems to ‘have’, ‘own’ or‘choose’ these responses are just brushstrokes in the seamless painting ofexperience. The painting is always one. It is made of brushstrokes only from thepoint of view of a brushstroke. For the canvas it is one.Likewise experience is ever-present and indivisible. Division has first to beimagined, before objects, entities, selves, others and the world can seem realin their own right.As it becomes clear that there is no separate individual doer, chooser, decideretc, so the thoughts and feelings that revolve around this apparent entity andthe attendant habits of behaving and relating will appear less and less.In other words, the thoughts, feelings, actions and relationships that appearwill be in line with our understanding. They will express love and understandingrather than the neurosis and anxiety of an apparently separate entity.There may well be a period during which the old habits of thinking, feeling,acting and relating on behalf of a separate entity still continue to appearafter the belief in such a one no longer appears. This is a transitional time inwhich the old habits are slowly winding down.This could be said to be the transition from a moment of clear seeing orunderstanding, or several such moments, to more stably embodying theimplications of this understanding in all realms of experience.In such a case these thoughts, feelings and actions are not a sign of ignorancebut are simply the residue of ignorance at the level of the mind and body,slowly unwinding, as it were.So the answer to your question, ‘Is this yet another area where we once believedthat the separate entity had control but in reality has none?” is ‘Yes’,However, it is not that the separate entity once seemed to have control and isnow realised to have no control at all, but rather that the separate entity isutterly non-existent. It is simply imagined with the thought that exclusivelyidentifies our self, awareness, with a body.Once this is seen clearly, there is no longer any question as to whether thatnon-existent entity has control, choice, free will etc. or not."},{"pageContent":"Experience’s Experience of ItselfQ: Does consciousness require a body/mind apparatus in order to become aknower/perceiver of the world?Consciousness does not have or require a body/mind, nor does it experience aworld through a body/mind.It is only when thinking artificially and seemingly divides the seamlessexperience of the body/mind/world into the body/mind and the world thatconsciousness, which in fact pervades all experience equally, seems to pervadeonly the body/mind. As a result of this artificial but never-actually-occurringseparation, consciousness seems to become the limited observer, located insidethe body/mind, looking out through the senses at the world.However, the body/mind does not experience the world, but rather consciousnessexperiences the body/mind/world. The body/ mind/world rises as one single,indivisible experience—not consciousness experiencing a world through abody/mind, but rather consciousness experiencing a body/mind/world.That is, a single sensation/thought/perception appears in consciousness andthinking alone conceptualises and abstracts a separate ‘body’, ‘mind’ and‘world’ from the raw data of this singular, seamless experience.In fact, even the slightly more refined concept of a single appearance, thebody/mind/world (or sensation/thought/perception), is a concept that tries toevoke the taste of experience as it is, but refers to something that is neveractually experienced as such. However, it is a valid, provisional statementbecause it relieves us of the belief that consciousness is located inside thebody, looking out at a world. It is a step in the right direction.It is truer than the previous formulation but will, in time, be found to besimply another, slightly more subtle conceptual superimposition upon experienceitself.As we look closer we do not find sensations, thoughts and perceptions, or even asingle sensation/thought/perception, that is, we do not find any object orobjects, in actual experience.We could say, again provisionally, that we find sensing, thinking and perceivingor, more accurately, sensing/thinking/perceiving. Again, another step. What wepreviously conceived as a single, multi-dimensional, physical object—thebody/mind/world—is now conceived as a single, multi-dimensional, subtleobject—sensing/ thinking/perceiving.And as we go further, that is, as we look with more simplicity and honesty atexperience, even the concept of sensing/thinking/ perceiving falls away and wecould say that there is just experiencing, made only of itself. Another step.And what is it that knows or experiences experiencing? Experiencing! There isnothing outside of experiencing with which it could be known. It alone knowsitself alone. However, it doesn’t know itself in the way that dualising thinkingnormally conceives of knowing, that is, in subject-object relationship.For experiencing, knowing itself is simply being itself. For experiencing, toknow and to be are one.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]Now let us go deeply into experiencing. Does it or can it stand back from itselfin order to know ‘something?’ No! Experiencing cannot stand back from itself oroutside itself in order to know itself as an object at a distance. There isno-where and no-thing outside itself. Only an imagined entity could imagine thatit ‘stands back from’ or ‘out of’ experience.Does experiencing, from its own point of view, take place at a certain place?No, all apparent places would be made only of experiencing. Only an imaginedentity, arising within experiencing but imagining itself to be outside of orseparate from experiencing, could imagine a place or location where experiencemight take place.Does experiencing have any knowledge of itself taking place at a certain time?No, all apparent times would be made only of experiencing. Again, only thinkingthat imagines an apparent entity that is apart from experiencing, could conceiveof something other than the ever-present now, in which experience was seeminglytaking place.In fact, experience is too intimately full of itself to know itself as‘something’, to know itself in relationship.Does experiencing have any experience of being made of separate parts, entities,objects or things? No, all of these would only be made of experiencing. Onlyfrom the imaginary point of view of a part, entity, object or thing could such apart, entity, object or thing exist. And only from the imaginary point of viewof one of those parts could one of those parts be the knower or the centre ofexperience.‘Parts’, ‘entities’, ‘objects’ and ‘things’ are names that are superimposed bythinking upon experiencing itself and believed (from the point of view ofthinking alone) to refer to something that is actually experienced.In fact, from the point of view of experience, they are nonexistent.Experiencing is pure seamless intimacy, made of one ever-present substance, madeonly of itself.In experience there is no time or space. It is too utterly intimately itself toadmit of any distance or otherness. This intimacy, this absence of distance orotherness, is known as love.Experience would first have to imagine itself to be made of objects, selves,others, things and, as such, forget its own reality, which it knows, as it were,without knowing it, in order to be able to imagine such a time and place.Does the substance of experience ever appear or disappear? That is, doesexperiencing ever have the experience of its own appearance or disappearance?No! Into what would it disappear and from what would it appear? Such a placewould only be more experiencing. To itself, therefore, experience is birthlessand deathless.Has experiencing ever had or would it be possible for it to have the experienceof the absence of, a change in or a cause for itself? No! All such conceptsrequire a thought that would imagine something other than experience’s ownexperience of itself, which is always only now and this. Only an imagined entitycan seemingly know absence, change or causation.Experiencing itself is ever-present, homogeneous, self-knowing, self-luminous,self-existent, uncaused, unmoving, unchanging. It knows nothing other thanitself.It knows no time or space, no objects or lack of objects, no cause and noeffect, no meaning, purpose or destiny, no lack and no becoming. These are allmental abstractions, apparently superimposed onto the ever-present seamlessintimacy of experience.Experiencing itself, from its own point of view, cannot experience any lack orinadequacy. It always only knows its own ever-present fullness—full of seamless,indivisible experiencing alone. Therefore, experiencing knows itself ashappiness and fulfilment. It would take the arising of thought and the creationof an imaginary entity that was just a part of experience, for the sense of lackto be conceived or felt.Likewise, experiencing itself, from its own point of view, can never bethreatened and is therefore fearless. It can never be agitated and is thereforepeace itself. It knows nothing other than or outside of itself and is thereforelove itself. It knows no object and is therefore beauty itself.Fear, agitation, unhappiness, dis-ease, otherness, separation, alienation,loneliness, despair, hatred, unkindness, cruelty, all these, require first theimagining of an entity that is apart from the whole. With this apparentfragmentation of experience into seeming things, objects, entities, selves andthe world, time, space, duration, causation, birth, death, decay etc., becomeseemingly real. However, they are only as real as the entity that thinkingimagines.Having said that, the incomprehensible beauty of this is that even thisimagining is itself only made of experiencing and, therefore, there is no trueignorance, no true ignoring of the true nature of reality.Ignorance is ignorant only from the imagined point of view of ignorance.Experiencing itself knows no ignorance. It knows only itself.image [../Images/9781908664136_002.jpg]We do not need to give experiencing a name, nor could we give it a name thatadequately expresses what it is. At best, we could ascribe to it the sum totalof all possible names and even all possible words. That is the best the mindcould do. Or, we could ascribe to it the simplest of all possible names, ‘I’.However, even all possible names and words would not be adequate. Thinking fallssilent even in attempting to look towards this ‘one’, let alone in attempting toname it. Thinking is destroyed in the attempt like a moth turning towards aflame. It turns, and as it turns, it dies. It cannot stand the light ofexperience.Having seen this, we can look back at all the attempts of thinking to portraythe nature of experience accurately and, whilst we understand that theseformulations may get more and more subtle and thatsome may seem, temporarily and at a relative level, truer than others, at thesame time, we recognise that ultimately none are true.From the point of view of experiencing (which is, of course, not a point ofview), all points of view are made equally out of experiencing and yet noneadequately express it.However, from the position of experiencing itself, thinking is no longerrequired to approach it, because thinking can no longer get away from it farenough to stand back and ‘have a look’, as it were. Where would thinking go?Where would it take its stand? Only as an imagined entity.The mind as a separate entity, capable of distinguishing itself, standing apartand conceptualising experience, dissolves in this understanding and thatdissolution is the true answer to all questions about the nature of experience.Everything is too utterly, intimately, immediately, ever-presently only made of‘experiencing’, to be able to separate out one little part that can turn roundand ‘look at’ let alone conceive of something objective called ‘experience’.Water does not know the difference between ocean, wave, river, stream, cloud,rain and tears—only the mind seems to know the difference. But these differencesonly belong to water from the mind’s point of view, which is only valid from itsown point of view.In reality, these differences pertain to the mind, not to water. They do nottouch the water itself. Water only knows itself and it knows itself just bybeing itself.As ‘ocean’, ‘wave’, ‘river’, ‘stream’, ‘cloud’, ‘rain’ and ‘tears’ it isapparent ‘name and form’—as water, it is always only water.Thinking loses its name and form here and stands revealed as it always only is,eternal presence, knowing, being and loving itself alone, until the next riverof words gently bubbles up."},{"pageContent":" If you would like to enquire about anything that is written in this book, pleasecontact the author through the non-duality section of his website,www.rupertspira.com [http://www.rupertspira.com]image [../Images/9781908664136_003.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/9781908664136_bcvi.jpg]"},{"pageContent":" Electronic edition produced by Antrik ExPress [../Images/epubnow_logo.jpg]www.dmiepub.com [http://www.dmiepub.com]"}]
