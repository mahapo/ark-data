CrowKennesaw State UniversityIntroductionIn 1902 English mountaineer, poet, and occultist, Aleister Crowley (1875-1947),published his “theory of the Universe”1in which he combined the concepts ofBuddhist ontolog y with Hermetic Kabala regarding the symbolic representation ofexistence. The central thesis of his work is the enigmatic equation 0=2. He thentook his Kabalistic Ontological “map” and constructed a spiritual practice for thesystematic attainment of various levels of consciousness that ended up leading thepractitioner to a level of consciousness whereby one is “wholly free from alllimitations soever, existing in the Nature of all things without discrimination ofquantity or quality.”2In this paper I plan to explore the meaning of Crowley’s 0=2equation and detail its significance within the context of Buddhism and WesternHermetic Kabala.BackgroundBefore examining Crowley’s ontolog y, it is necessary to have a little backgroundinformation about him. In his adolescents, Crowley rebelled against the spiritualityof his parents and began looking to meet his spiritual needs elsewhere. The firstsignificant place Crowley looked was an obscure semi-Masonic organization called1Aleister Cowley, Collected Works of Aleister Crowley, vol. 2, “tyçarb[Berashith] An Essay in Ontolog y withSome Remarks on Ceremonial Magic” (Chicago: Yogi Publication Society, 1906), 233.2Aleister Crowley, Magick: Liber ABA, Book Four, Parts I-IV, 2d rev. ed., ed.

Taking initiation on November 18,1898, Crowley advanced quickly. It was within the Golden Dawn that Crowley wasexposed to many occult doctrines including Hermetic Kabala. Also in the GoldenDawn, Crowley met Allan Bennett (1872-1923), who had joined the Golden Dawnin 1894 3where he became an important member.4Bennett was a sickly very person suffering from Asthma. As time progressed,Bennett’s illness worsened and became so severe that he eventually left Britain in1900 and went to Sri Lanka for a warmer climate.5In Sri Lanka he became aBuddhist Monk and adopted the dharma name Ananda Metteyya.6A year later,Crowley joined him and converted to Buddhism.7It is within this environment thatCrowley combined his understanding of Hermetic Kabala obtained while amember of the Golden Dawn and his understanding of Buddhist ontolog yobtained while studying with Ananda Metteyya to create his theory of the Universe,0=2.Two Realities or TruthsOne of the core teachings within Buddhism is that the true fundamental state of theuniverse is void or empty, sunyata. “In order to avoid confusion it should bementioned here that there are two kinds of truths: conventional truth (samvrti-satya) and ultimate truth (paramatha-satya).”8This means that while in aconventional sense things seem real, in an ultimate sense nothing has any intrinsicexistence or essences but instead depends on conditions to seemingly cause it toexist. However, even these conditions are illusory, as Buddhist scholar, Jay Garfieldwrites, “without individual essences, there will be no basis on which to draw theabsolute, essential distinctions necessary to establish phenomena as intrinsicallyother than their conditions. Without substantial differences, there are no absoluteothers by means of which to characterize phenomena.”9This cycle of conditioningis called dependent origination, pratitya-samutpada, and is the underlying basis ofsunyata. 3Elizabeth J Harris, Ananda Metteyya: The first British Emissary of Buddhism(Kandy, Sri Lanka: BuddhistPublication Society, 1998), 5.4Ibid., 3-5.5Ibid., 7.6The best source for information relating to Allen Bennett is Elizabeth J.

Whether the duality is expressed in ideological polemics such as good versesevil, or as phenomena that appears to be independent and separate, conventionaltruth operates in an apparent state of individuality. Buddhism teaches that thisapparent distinction is an illusion. Even emptiness itself is empty and considereddependently arisen.10One fundamental aspect important to understand is that when discussingultimate and conventional truths, both are valid and accurate from a certain pointof view simultaneously. “When we use such expressions in our daily life as ‘I’, or‘being’, ‘individual’, etc. we do not lie because there is no self or being as such, but wespeak a truth conforming to convention of the world. But the ultimate truth is thatthere is no ‘I’ or ‘being’ in reality.”11This ultimate lack of duality results in anontolog y that is immanent while conventionally, our world appears to be dual. Thisdifferentiation between ultimate truth or reality and conventional truth and bothbeing simultaneously valid is the key to understanding Crowley’s 0=2 equation. Nothing and Dual IdentityWhen discussing ultimate truth, Crowley uses the word, “nothing” instead ofemptiness or void. He equates this nothing to the zero in his equation. What isimperative to keep in mind is that when Crowley says nothing or zero, he does notmean the absence of something equating to a vacuum or space. Instead Crowleyasserts, “Nothingness is that about which no positive proposition is valid.”12Likeabove, where emptiness is itself empty, nothing can be said about Crowley’snothing. In the same way, when he writes zero, he notes it is not the zero ofmathematics that is a numerical place holder and can be written to the first powerasserting identity. On the contrary, Crowley’s zero is actually zero to the zero powermeaning that it has no identify nor is extended in any categories.13On the other side of the equation we find the number two. This two isrepresentative of duality. Crowley notes that it could also be written as one plusnegative-one [1 + (-1)]. This is because for something to exist in a conventionalsense, it must be contrasted against an environment or background dissimilar fromthe thing itself. As a simple illustration Crowley wrote, “All that of which we areaware must obviously posses limits, or it could have no intelligible meaning for us;if we want ‘pork,’ we must specify its qualities and quantities; at the very least, we10Ibid., 305.11Rahula, 55.12Crowley, Collected Works, 236.13Ibid., 237.THENAT U R E O FBECOMING"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"must be able to distinguish it from ‘that-which-is-not-pork’”14 All the phenomenathat surround us can be observed because we can differentiate it against somethingthat is not the same. It is this mental differentiation that creates the illusion ofduality.Finally, in the middle of the equation is the equal sign. This indicates that thereis no difference between the ultimate truth represented by the zero andconventional truth represented by the two. Quoting from the Vimilakiti-nirdesa-sutra, Garfield notes, “that the distinction between conventional and ultimate isitself dualistic and hence merely conventional. To realize it is hence [is] to enter intonondual awareness of emptiness.”15The nondual understanding of existence isvitally important to understanding Thelma and Liber AL vel Legis. Thecosmological concepts of Nuit and Hadit are contained in the 0=2 equation. Forinstance, the following is Crowley’s commentary on the Liber ALverse, “Be thouHadit, my secret centre, my heart and my tounge!” Crowley writes:Nuit formulates me as Hadit, especially in the three centres of consciousness of herBeing. In his way, for this purpose, I became the complement of Her.These centres are those of Love, Life and language. Duality is the condition of all three.It will appear later how it is that None and Two are identical; they are distinct in our mindsonly because those minds are conscious, and therefore think of \"two\" as their own state. Butthe unconscious mind thinks Nothing, and is Nothing. Yet it is the same mind.Nuith selects three centres of Her Body to become \"Two\" with Hadit; for she asks me todeclare Her in these three. Infinite freedom, all-embracing, for physical Love; boundlesscontinuity for Life; and the silent rhythm of the Stars for Language. These threeconceptions are Her gift to us.16As can be seen, the duality between Nuit and Hadit are conventional as are thevarious states of consciousness that Crowley discusses. Nevertheless, since we areconscious, being human, we need to work within these limits until we obtain a levelof understanding whereby we can get beyond duality and understand existence inits ultimate form, nondual. This is the goal of Crowley’s systems and since he wasexposed to the Golden Dawn’s framework, he used it when creating his system. 180INTERPLAY14Aleister Crowley, Magick Without Tears(Temple: New Falcon Pub., 1973), 55.15Garfield, 325.16Aliester Crowley, Magical and Philisophical Commentaries on The Book of the Law, ed.

Each grade or level of advancement was attributed to a sepherothorsphere on the tree. In addition, noted occult author Israel Regardie stated the Treeof Life “has been found to be the most convenient system yet discovered ofclassifying the phenomena of the Universe and recording their relations.”17TheGolden Dawn used the tree of Life to map out its initiatory system. Crowley usedthe Tree of Life much like the Golden Dawn did to map out the stages of one’sattainment and to articulate the steps each person would observe when reachingeach stage.The tree itself is made up of ten circles or spheres arranged in three columns andconnected with twenty-two paths. The top three spheres and paths form a upward17Isreal Regardie, A Garden of Pomegranates: An Outline on the Qabalah, 2d ed.

In addition to the pathsforming the triangles, there are other paths connecting various spheres together in asystem that is mirrored on both sides of the center column. The spheres arenumbered one through ten starting at the top center and ending at the bottomcenter. In addition to the spheres and path, there are also three ovals that surroundthe tree and are called the veils of existence. This is the diagram and classificationsystem that Crowley used to map his levels of consciousness.Crowley first placed the zero of 0=2 at the top of the diagram represented by thethird veil of existence called ain, to which he states, “I assert the absoluteness of theQabalistic zero.”18Ainmeans “nothing” in Hebrew and is what Crowley equated tosunyata. The other side of the equation is located in malkuth, the tenth sphere onthe Kabalistic Tree of Life in which conventional, dualistic, existence operatives.The twenty-two connecting paths represent symbolic gateways or connections.Because of the immense scope of the Kabalistic Tree of Life, I am going toconcentrate on the center column and in particular focus on the three spheres,malkuth, tiphareth, and kether. Conceptually, malkuthis where one operates in the day-to-day sense and thusexperiences the illusion of duality. All phenomena appear real and separate. This isalso the place where time and space are perceived. To this end, Crowley asserted:Time [was] necessarily created by us in order to make room for the apparent existence of theduality which we devise...Two phenomena which occur in time would be consideredsimultaneous if separated in space, so that our observation of the former were delayed...[S]oas far as we are concerned, i.e., in our sensoria, so that any two impressions can only beregistered by us as consecutive. Even when we are aware of their simultaneity, we arecompelled to place them in sequence.19Because of the illusion of duality, our conventional consciousness makes thedistinctions between one object or thought verses another in time and space. Assuch, we constantly differentiate and order our soundings based on observations ofseparateness and when we observe phenomenon. The result is, “[w]e invent Space,Time, Sense-Impressions, etc. to enable us to distinguish between ‘experiences’ toexpress our conception of the multiplicity of the possibilities contained in the ideaof Zero.”20Similarly, discussing the illusory “principle of the independence of18Crowley, Collected Works, 236.19Crowley, Magical and Philisophical Commentaries, 116.20Crowley, Magical and Philisophical Commentaries, 121."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"183separate phenomena,” Garfield points out that the arising and cessation ofphenomena appears simultaneous and distinct only because we misunderstand thenature of dependent arising and thus confuse conventional reality to be ultimatereality.21However, Crowley states there are further states of consciousness in whicheventually this illusion is eliminated. The next state of consciousness proceeds from an observation of duality to a stateof unity or one-pointed consciousness. This state of mind is mapped to theKabalistic sphere of tiphareth. In tipharethCrowley notes, “the vision (orapprehension, a much better word) of the universe [is] as a single phenomenon,outside all limitations, whether of time, space, causality, or what not.”22It is in thisstate of consciousness that one attains “Knowledge and Conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel.”23Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel wasCrowley’s term for uniting the conscious mind with the subconscious. When oneachieves one-pointed consciousness, the differentiation between any one thing andother is removed. This includes the perception of time, space, perceptions of causeand effect, and even distinctions between the conscious and subconscious mind.In his ceremony to lead the practitioner towards one-pointed consciousness,called Liber Samekh, Crowley wrote “[t]he Angel appeareth in Tiphareth, which isthe heart of the Ruach, and thus the Centre of Gravity of the Mind...Hence theAngel is in truth the logosor articulate expression of the whole Being of the Adept,so that as he increases in the perfect understanding of His Name, he approaches thesolution of the ultimate problem: Who he himself truly is.”24“The subconscious,Crowley said, was to all intents and purposes the Holy Guardian Angel with whomthe aspirant wished to communicate, in order to establish his or her ‘True Will.’”25Crowley stated that one obtains one’s true will when one becomes fully aware ofone’s true self and gains complete self-knowledge. This self knowledge is obtained by withdrawing for a time to a monistic form of self-consciousness, which does notdistinguish between the Ego and Non-Ego; in other words, obtaining Samadhi...Oneconcludes from this that the Universe is identical with the Ego, and all things dissolve intoa formless essence characterized by knowledge and bliss. But this early stage of Samadhi isan illusion...But subsequent Samadhi teaches...that his universal instantaneous Unity existsas ‘None and Two’; and he learns that his Samadhi is peculiar to himself as well as commonto all.2621Garfield, 273.22Crowley, Magick Without Tears, 56.23Ibid., 56.24Crowley, Magick: Liber ABA, Book Four, 540.25Keith Richmond, Progradior & The Beast: Frank Bennett & Aleister Crowley(London: Neptune 2004), 174.26Crowley, Magical and Philisophical Commentaries, 117.THENAT U R E O FBECOMING"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"184INTERPLAYWhen this state of consciousness is reached, barriers between the conscious mindand subconscious are eliminated and they interact as one. Thus the main task of apractitioner was “to have Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy GuardianAngel, to become aware of his nature and his purpose, fulfilling them.”27Reachingthis point of self-knowledge, i.e. knowing one’s True Will, was of great significanceto Crowley. In fact, it was the centerpiece of his spiritual and philosophical system. Despite the importance of this step in the path of attainment, this state ofconsciousness is only a step on the path towards deeper state of consciousness; astate in which the true nature of existence is realized. Crowley places this level ofattainment on the Kabalistic sphere called kether. Ketheris where one becomesfundamentally aware of the ultimate nature of truth; what Buddhists often call“enlightenment.” Crowley called this ultimate state of consciousness or initiation“ipsissimus”; a combination of the Latin word, ipse, meaning self, and the Latinsuperlative inflection, -issimus. In regard to this attainment Crowley writes:[T]he Ipsissimus is wholly free from all limitations soever, existing in the Nature of allthings without discriminations of quantity or quality between them. He has identifiedBeing and not-Being and Becoming , Action and non-Action and Tendency to Action, withall other such triplicities, not distinguishing between them in respect of any conditions, orbetween any one thing and any other thing as to whether it is with or withoutconditions...The Ipsissimus is pre-eminently the Master of all modes of Existence; that is,His being is entirely free from internal or external necessity. His work is to destroy alltendencies to construct or to cancel such necessities. He is the Master of the Law ofUnsubstantiality (anatta). The Ipsissimus has no relation as such with any Being ; He has noWill in any direction, and no Consciousness of any kind involving duality.28The Ipssissimus no longer operates on a day-to-day basis within the illusion ofduality. Upon reaching a fundamental understanding of the truth, one continues tooperate in the world around us, but sees and understand phenomena in a radicallydifferent way. Commenting on this state of consciousness, Crowley describes it as theexperience where the universe itself, is “abolished and annihilated.”29He continues,“It is commonplace to say that no words can describe this final destruction. Such isthe fact; and there is nothing one can do about it but put it down boldly as I havedone above.”3027Ibid., 96.28Crowley, Magick: Liber ABA, Book Four, 491.29Crowley, Magick Without Tears, 57.30 Ibid., 57."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"185ConclusionAs can be seen, Crowley obtained much of his ontological understanding from theconcepts in Buddhism; translating the ideas of sunyataor emptiness into theKabalistic ain, or nothing. Crowley adapted the concepts of dependent origination,pratitya-samutpada, and conventional truth (samvrti-satya) and ultimate truth(paramatha-satya) into the compact equation of 0=2. In doing so, he took Easternontological concepts and presented them in a Western Kabalistic framework thatcan be explored by those with little Eastern understanding. By mapping the variousstates of consciousness to spheres on the Kabalistic Tree of Life, Crowley presents asystem by which a practitioner could systematically work to gain the various formsof consciousness. By first transcending dual consciousness and leaving malkuth, apractitioner can reach one-pointed consciousness and achieve the first major goal ofobtaining Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel and gainingunderstanding of one’s True Will; this stage being mapped to tiphereth. No smalltask itself, but once completed, the practitioner would work towards higher statesof consciousness ending in the sphere kether, obtaining full comprehension of thetrue nature of the universe. Taken all together, Crowley’s system of attainment combined disparate elementsof Eastern and Western philosophy and theolog y into a spiritual philosophy bywhich practitioners can obtain higher states of consciousness and understanding ofthemselves and the universe.REFERENCESCrowley, Aleister. “tyçarb[Berashith] An Essay in Ontolog y with Some Remarkson Ceremonial Magic” in Collected Works of Aleister Crowley, vol. 2.
