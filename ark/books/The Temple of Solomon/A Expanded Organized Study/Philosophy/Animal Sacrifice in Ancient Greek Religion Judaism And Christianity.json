At the same time,being born a Christian in a big modern city, I had the experience of a cultthat had nothing to do with animal sacriWce. My knowledge of animalsacriWce at that time was limited to stories from the Old Testament, which,as I was taught, referred to an old cultic realityWnally outdated by Chris-tianity. Furthermore, mentions of a ‘temple’ other than a ‘church’ in narra-tions belonging to the New Testament always constituted a puzzle to me,because I had stayed with the impression that anything pertaining to atemple other than a Christian church ‘ought to’ belong to the Old Testa-ment. It took me much time to realize that, in the early years of Christianity,the successor to Solomon’s Temple was still standing in Jerusalem, and muchmore time to think of that temple as an area where animal sacriWces wereperformed. Due to my romantic view of Greek marble temples, I was alsolate in accepting that, much to my disappointment, what is left from Greekshrines today is far removed from their functional proWle: in fact, the smellof animals—dead or approaching their death—was what mainly reigned inthe sacred areas of ancient Greece. These late realizations are directly con-nected with the questions from which the present book has stemmed.I wanted to explore the fact that Christianity is known as a religion withno altars for slaughter, in combination with the historical fact that earlyChristians came from religious environments where animal sacriWce waspractised. Did the absence of sacriWcial interest on the part of Christianscome about suddenly and abruptly? Or was it a gradual development? Inorder to study this issue, I have chosen to start from a date when Greek andJewish animal sacriWce was still practised (100bc), but Christianity had notyet appeared. I have chosen to stop before the better-documented thirdcentury, but at a date when Christianity had already expanded in theMediterranean as a religion without altars for slaughter (ad200). At thatpoint Greek animal sacriWce was still practised, whereas oYcial Jewishanimal sacriWce had stopped long before (ad70).The area of my study is the Greek-speaking East and Jerusalem. By theterm ‘Greek-speaking East’, I mean—roughly—mainland Greece, the Ae-gean islands, Asia Minor, and any area of Greek settlement where Christians"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"came or could come into contact with Greek pagans.1Egypt is not consid-ered, given the diVerences in the Greek material coming from an area with avery distinctive local religious culture.2In the book, I shall not deal withRoman ritual, but rather with Greek ritual in an area and a period of RomaninXuence. The main reason for this limitation is that theWrst encounter ofChristianity with paganism took place in Greek-speaking areas, so it wouldbe extremely important to envisage this cultural encounter in its originalform.Readers must have noticed that I have so far avoided choosing thefollowing as the main question: ‘why did Christians not oVer animalsacriWces?’ In the course of the book, it will become obvious that such aquestion might be misleading, and only partly legitimate. However, acknow-ledging that the question will progressively arise in the reader’s mind, I haveventured to express an answer to the question of ‘why’ in the last section ofthe book (Epilogue). This answer constitutes the counterpoint to Section 2of Chapter 1, where my suggestion on the way in which the issue of sacriWcecan be studied is presented.In the remaining chapters the issue of animal sacriWce is studied bothfrom the point of view of Greeks and Jews separately, and in combinationwith Christians. Thus, Chapter 2, on Greek animal sacriWce, can function initself as theWrst systematic approach to Greek sacriWce in the Roman period,but it mainly points to the problems possibly generated within Greekcommunities by the emergence of Christianity. Similarly, Chapter 4, onJewish animal sacriWce, focuses on some aspects which have not beenemphasized in the bibliography on late Second Temple Judaism, but it alsoemphasizes the multifarious character of the Jewish context, which formedthe background to Christianity. Finally, Chapter 6, on early Christians andanimal sacriWce, shows that the implication of unity contained in the term‘Christianity’ is in fact misleading, since the diVerent religious backgroundsof the groups which this religion encompassed resulted in a wide spectrumof responsiveness to the new message.Chapters 3 and 5 are ‘bridges’, which help the reader understand thefundamental diVerences between the Greek and Jewish sacriWcial systems,and make more obvious the contrast between, on the one hand, tworeligions in the context of which animal sacriWce took place, and, on theother hand, the religion of Christianity, which called the practice of animalsacriWce into question.1On pagan cities in Palestine, see Schu ̈rer (1973–87), vol. 2.I, pp. 85–183. Morerecently, Belayche (2001).2The most recent description of the multifold Egyptian religious world is Frank-furter (1998).viPreface"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"In seeking to draw conclusions on animal sacriWce for each of the threereligions studied here, I have come to realize that one cannot help utilizingsources from within the speciWc religious context. However, a few cases donot follow this pattern (for instance, Pliny on Christians, or Paul on tablesladen with meat).In order to make clear the scope of the study, I should specify that by‘animal sacriWce’ I mean the ritual slaughter of an animal for variousreligious purposes. In my treatment of religious animal slaughter, I includeboth alimentary and non-alimentary slaughter.3In this book, priority is given to the sacriWcial use of animals, and not ofother sorts of organic or non-organic matter. Since there is also evidence fornon-animal oVerings in the period 100bc–ad200, I acknowledge that mydisregarding this evidence might be criticized by readers. As a response tothis supposed criticism, I must stress that,Wrst, the sacriWcial status of non-animal oVerings is still disputed among scholars,4and as such these cannotconstitute a safe basis for a comparative study. Second, the prominencegiven to animal oVerings characterizes both Greek religion and Judaism, asI will specify in the course of the book. Third, I chose to focus on animalsacriWce because, among all the other types of sacriWce, animal sacriWce is theone most often mentioned or alluded to in Greek pagan, Jewish, andChristian texts, so I see it as the basic common ground between the threereligions.Finally, I have to warn readers of what they willnotWnd in this book,despite their reasonable expectations.This book does not deal with human sacriWce. Even if the authors used inour study talk about the issue, the relevant discussion would be beyond thescope of this book. My study focuses on everyday Greek and Jewish ritualreality, and human sacriWce cannot be considered as such. Furthermore, thefact that reports on human sacriWce were actually inXuenced by conceptualcategories such as Greeks–Jews, Greeks–barbarians, myth–history, reality–3By contrast with that of J.-P. Vernant, my study is not limited to the alimentarycharacter of sacriWce. Vernant himself, being aware of the fact thatŁ\u0002ødesignatesdiVerent rites, chooses to talk only about ‘sacriWce sanglant de consommationalimentaire’. See the ‘Discussion’ following Vernant’s paper in Rudhardt–Reverdin(1981), 29–30.4This was made obvious in a Table Ronde on sacriWce, which I attended in Paris,entitled ‘SacriWce animal et oVrande ve ́ge ́tale dans les socie ́te ́s de la Mediterrane ́eancienne’ (organizers: Centre Gustave Glotz (CNRS-UMR 8585), E ́cole Pratique desHautes E ́tudes, Colle`ge de France, 24–6 June 2001). There the category of non-animaloVerings caused a major problem as regards the deWnition of the term ‘sacriWce’, andthis diYculty dominated the discussion until the very end of the seminar.

Admittedly, the phenomenon of animal sacriWce in thiscontext has been thoroughly studied from various, even contrasting, angles,5but the inclusion of these issues in the book would not change the main linesof the argument. Even from the point of view of Christianity, it has beenproved that the role of the imperial cult was secondary in the persecutions ofChristians.6Categories of evidence such as iconography, animal remains, and culticediWces will not be used in this book. The systematic presentation ofdepictions of sacriWce would require a study of the conventions used torepresent animals, participants, and paraphernalia in a sacriWcial ritual.Furthermore, it can be easily understood that an archaeological study ofanimal-sacriWcial remains would require not only the undertaking of sys-tematic excavation projects covering all Greece and Asia Minor, but thatthese excavations should regard sacriWcial remains as a principal object ofthe project and not as accidentalWnds. As long as this condition is notfulWlled, it has to be accepted that the record of sacriWcial remains does notcontribute signiWcantly to the building of a theory. What is more, studies onthe functional aspect of cultic ediWces are missing, and such studies cannotbe undertaken here without a contribution from otherWelds of research,namely archaeology and, particularly, temple architecture, in which thewriter of this book is not a specialist.The issue of abstinence is also absent from this book, since abstinence hada great variety of meanings: it could be abstinence from ritual, but it couldalso be abstinence from meat in general, or from certain animal species, orfrom certain parts of the animal’s body, or from certain varieties of plants.Philosophical or other spiritual trends must have played their role in suchinstances of abstinence, and inXuenced individual worshippers and cultfounders. But the overall picture drawn from our literary texts and inscrip-tions cannot support any claim that, due to theoretical objections, thepractice of animal sacriWce was forsaken by worshippersen masse.From the Christian context, I have decided to leave out liturgical texts,since the stylistic conventions of this genre make it deserve a special study.This book would not have been written if it were not for the support of myfamily, mainly my parents, both classicists.

SCHOLARLY APPROACHES TO SACRIFICESince the nineteenth century both anthropological and historicalwork has been carried out with reference to sacriWce in ancientreligions. So it would be useful to start with a general overview ofthe most important scholarly theories on sacriWce. In these theories,scholars have talked about ‘sacriWce’ without strictly delineating theterm, or distinguishing animal victims from non-animal oVerings. Inpresenting their theories, I will also keep to this tactic.Anthropological TheoriesSacriWce in generalSacriWce belongs to the sphere of religious practices, and as such itinitially concerned those scholars whoWrst dealt with religion,namely anthropologists. TheWrst anthropologists were nineteenth-century Europeans who were dealing with non-European cultures:colonial expansion was a great stimulus for the erudite who wereinterested in exploring the particularities of the foreign societies theycame across. In theory, anthropologists were not supposed to beexclusively engaged in the study of one civilization. In reality, though,most of them were better acquainted with one civilization, and, onthe basis of their study of the society known to them, they formedgeneral theories without paying attention to the particularities ofother civilizations. Theories about sacriWce were incorporated in theearliest anthropological theories, and as such they were inXuenced by"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"the trends of thought which shaped the latter. Only recently havescholars become aware of the fact that: ‘L’e ́poque n’est plus ou`l’oncroyait pouvoir e ́laborer une the ́orie du sacriWce englobant tous lesmille ́naires et toutes les civilisations.’1E. B. Tylor on sacriWceE. B. Tylor, one of the leadingWgures in theWeld of nineteenth-century anthropology, apparently did not share this view, expressedby J. Rudhardt and O. Reverdin. In his main work,Primitive Culture(1871),2he used a great variety of ethnographic material (includingGreek material), and presented sacriWce as a ritual whose mainpurpose was as a gift to the gods. He thus categorized sacriWcesaccording to their manner of reception by the deity, and accordingto the motives of the sacriWcer. In theWrst category, oneWnds cases ofsacriWce where the deity consumes (a) the oVerings themselves (‘sub-stantial transmission’, in Tylor’s terms), (b) their essence (‘essentialtransmission’), and (c) the soul of the oVering (‘spiritual transmis-sion’). In the second category, Tylor traces the evolution in thenotion of sacriWce from a gift-oVering to an homage-oVering andto an oVering of abnegation on the part of the worshipper.Tylor’s analysis was shaped by the theory of evolution, whichexplains everything in terms of development and progress throughtime; as Darwin did in the biologicalWeld, so anthropologistsregarded all early human practices and beliefs as simpler than, andinferior to, those coming next (and above all to those prevailing inthe scholar’s own times). Evolutionist anthropologists applied thisprinciple to the peoples whom they studied and whom they called‘primitive’, a term implying a programmatic expectation of some-thing comingsecondand thus being better. One of the obviousevolutionist biases applied to theWeld of religion is the suppositionthat earlier religions could be interpreted by means of pragmaticexplanations, in contrast with the ‘higher religions’ (i.e. Christian-ity), which were of a spiritual character.3Even the very act of sacriWce1TheWrst sentence in the preface of the volume by Rudhardt–Reverdin (1981).2The year indicated next to each work is that of theWrst edition, unless otherwiseindicated.3See e.g. Tylor (19034), ii. 375: ‘theologians, having particularly turned theirattention to sacriWce as it appears in the higher religions, have been apt to gloss2Approaching the Issue of SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"was condemned as belonging to ‘barbaric ages’, to the ‘lower phases’of religion, which are ‘explanatory of the higher’.4Evolutionistmethods stress the diachronic aspect in human history and try toWnd causal threads connecting the past with the present.5W. Robertson Smith on sacriWceW. Robertson Smith was among the English scholars who took upthe tradition of evolutionism. He was a very distinguished Semiticscholar, who studied the Old Testament from the anthropologicalpoint of view. His theory of sacriWce depends on the Bible, but movesin a wider area than that of Jewish ritual, and is to be found in hisworkThe Religion of the Semites(1889). Using the Old Testamentevidence, Robertson Smith concentrated on the sacriWcial type wherethe victim is eaten, and saw in it ‘an act of social fellowship betweenthe deity and his worshippers’.6The animal victim is the sacredsymbol of the clan,totemas it is called. By sharing itsXesh andblood, men partake of its divine vitality, and aYrm their commonlinks to thetotemand to each other.7Thus, Robertson Smithstressed the character of the sacriWcial meal as a ritual ofcommunionand tried to prove that any further meanings—such as gift or atone-ment or eucharist—developed later, in the frame of higher socialstructures.Robertson Smith’s theory was correctly criticized8for projectingonto ancient societies the Christian experience of the Eucharist,where Christ’s body is supposed to be shared by the faithful.Robertson Smith belonged to that subcategory of the evolutionisttrend in England, which is known as the ‘Cambridge School’. Otherover with mysticism ceremonies which, when traced ethnographically up from theirsavage forms, seem open to simply rational interpretation.’4Ibid. 363–4.5Tylor’s most famous contributions to evolutionism are the technical termsanimism, which designates an earlier faith-stage than the belief in gods, andsurvival,which designates what has come down from the past to the later generations, who canno longer explain it.6Robertson Smith (19273), 224.7The belief in the link between the clan and the animal is the so-calledtotemicbelief.8Mainly by M. Mauss, whose work on sacriWce (Hubert and Mauss 1899) isdiscussed below.Approaching the Issue of SacriWce3"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"prominent members of it were Jane E. Harrison and James Frazer.The distinctive characteristic of this school was the attention it paidto ritual rather than to myth. Before this change in perspective, thetradition of Romanticism had led scholars to pay attention only tothe myths of diVerent peoples and to collect them by means of themethods of historical criticism.J. G. Frazer on sacriWceThe anthropologist James Frazer, in his workThe Golden Bough(1890), did not set out a general theory covering all cases of sacriWce.However, a long section of his work (entitled ‘The Dying God’) wasdedicated to cases similar to the ritual of Diana Nemorensis, asdescribed by Strabo (5.3.12–13); according to Frazer, the priestlyking of that ritual (and of its parallels) was the embodiment of thespirit of fertility. Frazer interpreted the king’s ritual murder as anattempt to protect the spirit from the king’s weakness. Thus, to Frazerthe purpose of sacriWce is to liberate an immortal spirit from themortal body it inhabits. However, Frazer also described other sacriW-cial rites, such as oVerings to the ancestral gods or killings of animalsfor the fertility of the crops or for the cure of cattle from disease.Frazer has been criticized for the evolutionist positivistic model heproposed, namely that mankind proceeded from magic to religion toscience. But besides this conviction, Frazer’s theory suVered frommethodological deWciencies. The terms which he used did not alwayshave the same meaning, and the distinctions and analogies were notclearly drawn. Just like Tylor, Frazer also used a great variety ofethnographic and historical material, but where his approach wasmethodologically wrong was in his uncritical selection of this mater-ial in order to support his argument (as is obvious from Frazer’sobsession with fertility).99A very sound criticism of this method was oVered by E. E. Evans-Pritchard: inthe last century anthropologists used a particular sort of comparative method by‘selecting from a vast mass of data, uneven and often poor in quality, whateverphenomena appeared to belong to the same type . . . The qualities which werediVerent in each instance were neglected. This is a perfectly sound method ofscientiWc analysis, so long as conclusions are restricted to the particular qualityabstracted and it is not then assumed that because phenomena are alike in respectto this single quality that they are alike in other respects which have not been subjectto critical comparative analysis.’ In Singer (1981), 145–6.4Approaching the Issue of SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"H. Hubert and M. Mauss on sacriWceAdiVerent anthropological approach was the work by H. Hubert andM. Mauss, ‘Essai sur la nature et la fonction du sacriWce’, inL’Anne ́eSociologique(1899). As the title of the series where this essay waspublished makes obvious, the writers brought sociological tools intotheWeld. Sociology had been conspicuously promoted in France byE ́. Durkheim (Mauss’ uncle and teacher), whose work inXuenceda whole generation of scholars, including Hubert and Mauss. ToDurkheim, the notion of society was the main tool of explanation,and this was even applied to the religiousWeld.10Despite the fact thathis approach oVered new possibilities to the study of religion, it hasbeen remarked that Durkheim went further than he should andmade ‘society’ a sort of autonomous entity. What Mauss contributedto the study of religion was his supersession of such theoreticalabstractions, and his attachment to concrete evidence.11Durkheim still belonged to the evolutionist tradition.12However,the essay on sacriWce by Hubert and Mauss drew attention not to thegenetically prior, but to the ‘types’ contained in a sacriWcial act. Thiswas aWrst step away from evolutionism, but not a step towards totalrejection of it, since the two authors still believed that the worship-pers did not understand the origin and motive of their actions.Leaving aside—but not completely—the evidence for Greek sacriWce,on the excuse that it consists of piecemeal sources, Hubert and Maussconcentrated on Jewish and Hindu texts. They regarded sacriWce as ameans of communication between the human and the divine, anddistinguished the diVerent stages in this communication, those ofsacralizationanddesacralization. TheWrst case represents the move-ment from a profane to a sacred state, the second the oppositemovement. While the victim becomes sacred, the person who oVersthe sacriWce loses his sacred character, which he acquires again afterthe victim has been killed and has lost its sacred character. Thehighest point of sacredness is the moment of the animal’s killing.10His representative work here beingLes Formes e ́le ́mentaires de la vie religieuse(Paris, 1912). For criticism, see the review by Malinowski (1913), esp. 527–9.11Evans-Pritchard, in Singer (1981), 190.12His belief in totemism as a primary form of religion is characteristic of thisapproach.Approaching the Issue of SacriWce5"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"I personally think that the essay of Hubert and Mauss is a kind ofproto-structuralist13analysis, preceding the sort of approach ofwhich Vernant was to be the main representative (see below). But,as has been rightly pointed out,14these writers were restricted, andthus misled, by their material: that is, in contrast with Hindu rites, inGreek sacriWce the areas between sacred and profane were not sep-arated by a ritual marking the transition from the one state to theother; for instance, there was nothing separating the sacred momentof killing from the secular moment of butchering.E. E. Evans-Pritchard on sacriWceThe last anthropological theory on sacriWce which we shall examine isthat of Evans-Pritchard. He lived through the so-called Malinowskianrevolution—Bronislaw Malinowski (1884–1942) was Evans-Pritchard’steacher—namely, the replacement of evolutionism by functionalism.Anthropologists started to think at a synchronic level and tried toWnd out how societiesfunctioned, rather than how they emerged. Thepresentwastobeexplainedby thepresentandnotby thepast.15The newschool of methodology stressed the importance ofWeldwork, andintroduced the principle ofInternal RelationsorInterdependence,which was to explain how societies were perpetuated. What wentwrong with the new approach was that society was thus considered assomething stable and unchangeable through time: ‘unless there isequilibrium, it is diYcult to give ‘functional’ accounts of institutions,for these amount toshowing how persistence of a society is furthered byeach institution and hence such stability must be assumed to exist ifthe speciWcation of the factors furthering it are (sic) to be the veryparadigms of explanation.’16Evans-Pritchard mainly used the evidence he collected during hispersonalWeldwork among African peoples. His theory on sacriWce is13My term might imply a sort of evolutionism in methodology! Leach (1976),4–5, called the method of Hubert and Mauss ‘empiricist structuralism’, as distinctfrom the ‘rationalist structuralism’ of Le ́vi-Strauss.14Kirk (1981), 68–70. Also Rudhardt (1958), 295–6.15Evans-Pritchard himself was not in favour of a mere empiricist method, and hepreferred a combination of evolutionism with functionalism. He thought that histeacher was unable to make abstractions, which would facilitate the use of compara-tive method.16Gellner (1981), p. xix.6Approaching the Issue of SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"to be found inNuer Religion(1956), and it only refers to thesepeoples. Evans-Pritchard rejected the theory of Robertson Smith,that sacriWce is a meal of communion with a god, and stressed insteadthe piacular character of the sacriWcial oVering: the victim is asubstitute for the person who oVers the sacriWce. However, as hasbeen correctly stated, Evans-Pritchard did not justify his interpret-ation of sacriWce as substitution.17Leaving theWeld of anthropology, let us now pass on to sometheories exclusively concerned with either Greek or Jewish sacriWce,starting with theWrst. It is useful to point out that the scholars whodealt with the Greek evidence were aware of all the aforementionedtheories.Greek sacriWceK. Meuli on Greek sacriWceK. Meuli’s article ‘Griechische Opferbra ̈uche’, inPhyllobolia fu ̈rP.Vonder Mu ̈hl(1946), constitutes a genuinely new approach to GreeksacriWce, especially animal sacriWce. Meuli concentrated on the typeof sacriWce where the kill precedes a feast. He was theWrst to haveclaimed that the ritual behaviour involved in a Greek sacriWce de-rived from that of Palaeolithic and Mesolithic hunters. MeuliWrstcoined the termUnschuldkomo ̈die(comedy of innocence); this is akind of ‘staging’ during the sacriWcial ritual, by which worshipperstry to hide and deny the slaughter of the victim.From that point onwards, theories on Greek sacriWce have reachedthe highest point in scholarly sophistication, and have exerted aninXuence which is still felt by scholars today; that is why I shall givemore space to their exposition.W. Burkert on Greek sacriWceThe scholar who, in making the most of Meuli’s theory, has gonefurther than he did, is W. Burkert. He continues the tradition ofthose scholars who pay attention to theritual form of religion ratherthan to its myths. Burkert justiWes this attitude by means of physi-ology: myth requires the development of articulate human speech,17See Kirk (1981), 47–50, and, more extensively, de Heusch (1985).Approaching the Issue of SacriWce7"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"whereas ritual goes back even to animals. This last remark providedthe main basis for Burkert’s theory, since what he is best known for isthe application ofethology (the study of behaviour) to the analysis ofreligious phenomena. His most famous work,Homo Necans(1972),in which his theory of sacriWce is to be found, is an excellent sampleof this method. A furtherWeld which contributed to shaping Bur-kert’s theory isphenomenology. The reason why he has actuallyadopted phenomenology is to counterbalance the use of ethology,in other words, to avoid being accused of reductionism (the reduc-tion of an event to a basic external cause). Through phenomenology,the scholar approaches the events from inside.18However, BurkertspeciWes again that an exaggerated phenomenological approachmight deprive the scholar of the ability to stand at a distance fromhis subject, and thus lead him to the neglect of further importantaspects. Burkert is only partly in favour of the theory that religion isa system ofsigns, i.e. of the structuralist approach: for him, thescholar must also try to keep in contact withhistory. But, again,Burkert does not rely on history in an evolutionist way: he is againstthe evolutionist views of ‘primitive’ and ‘rational’ ways of thinking orof a ‘primary’ feeling underlying the ritual. Functionalism has alsopartly inXuenced Burkert, in the sense that he seeks only to place thebehavioural signs of the ritual in theirsocial context; according toBurkert, mere functionalism might be misleading, since it supposesthe stability of society, an assumption which, he claims, derived frommodern expectations of stability in the world.With all these methodological tools, Burkert created a sacriWcialtheory which continued the paradigm of Meuli. Burkert considerssacriWce to be a remnant of the society of Palaeolithic hunters: thosemen ritualized their collective ferocious action of killing in order tostrengthen the sense of communityvis-a`-visits external enemies.Being inXuenced by the work of R. Otto,Das Heilige(1917), wherethe author regards the ‘sacred’ as the tool for a phenomenologicalapproach to religion, Burkert reinterprets the categories of the sacred18Burkert gives a beautiful explanation of what the phenomenological approachto religion is: ‘Religion erschliesse sich nur von innen her, fu ̈r den Gla ̈ubigen, so wiedie Kirchenfenster nur fu ̈r den in vollen Farben strahlen, der im Innern der Kircheist.’ Burkert (1981), 99.8Approaching the Issue of SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"on a behaviouristic basis.19The behaviouristic terms have beenborrowed from K. Lorenz, who, in his bookOn Aggression(1963),talked about the progressive institutionalization of violence inhuman societies.20Thus, Burkert’s Palaeolithic hunters are violentkillers; but, at the same time, these killers are aware of their aggressiveinstincts; they almost feel guilty, and here is where the ‘comedy ofinnocence’ comes into play.After the exposition of the aforementioned theory, Burkert dedi-cates the rest of his book to the application of his general principlesto various Greek rites. Basing himself on literary and epigraphicevidence, Burkert mainly focuses on Greek religion as depicted inmyth and as practised in the Classical period. However, despite thefact that the immense amount of philological and archaeological datacollected by Burkert is sometimes later than the Classical period, it isnever used by him as evidence for the period covered in our book.Using the notion of anxiety, Burkert manages to comprehend allkinds of sacriWce: more speciWcally, he reducesŁı\u0003\u0004Æ;\u0003\u0005\u0006ªØÆ;I\u0007\b\u0007\b\t\u0007, and\u000bHæ\b\fto combinations of four diVerent terms.These are, on the one hand, ‘death’ and ‘gift’ and, on the otherhand, ‘eating’ and ‘dispensing with’.Criticism of Burkert’s theory on Greek sacriWceBurkert’s book remains a classic. But it has given rise to criticism,both in terms of its theory and of its method.As regards Burkert’s theory, recent discoveries have struckHomoNecansat its very core. TheWrst scholar to have proved Burkert’sapproach misleading was A. E. Jensen, who showed that, in primitivesocieties, the ritual killing of a wild animal was not of a ‘sacriWcial’character; sacriWce took place later, in agricultural societies, and thevictim was a domestic, not a wild, animal.21A more elaborateexposition of this criticism has been oVered by the historian ofreligions J. Z. Smith, who, going even further than Jensen, has19Ibid.: The three elements of the sacred, namely ‘tremendum’, ‘fascinans’, and‘augustum’, become ‘Angst’, ‘Beseligung’, and ‘Rangordnung’. The way of reinterpret-ation raised objections among the scholars’ audience, as one can see in the discussionfollowing the paper.20Burkert himself admits that these books were his sources. See his chapter inHamerton-Kelly (1987).21Jensen (1963).Approaching the Issue of SacriWce9"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"pointed out that it is wrong to place the origins of ritual killing inpre-agrarian societies (‘The Domestication of SacriWce’, inViolentOrigins, 1987).Smith provides us with an ingenious analysis of the importance ofdomestication for the understanding of sacriWce. Domestication isthe result of the sedentary way of living, which in turn presupposesthe concepts of future and planning: these are not ‘primitive’ con-cepts. The notions involved in the religious meaning of sacriWce arenot ‘primitive’ either: for instance, terms used of pollution and itsremoval presuppose mental categories of a high level. Smith alsostresses that the selection of an animal for sacriWce is a secondarylevel of selection after that of selective breeding. This selective kill hasnothing to do with the fortuitous kill carried out by a hunter. As forthe terrible emotions usually attributed to the ‘primitive hunter’,these derive from the reinterpreted reality of hunt. This reinterpret-ation, which consists in a mythologization of the past, is eVectedwithin agrarian societies, and still persists in modern bibliography.For Smith, ritual is not a remotetremendumfact, but has its roots inthe intellection of culture, and it simply emphasizes and exaggeratesthe breakthroughs of the ‘civilized’ way of living. SacriWce is the ritualact which stresses the striving for perfection of the animal species.Smith focuses on facts, and not on the motives of human action,and he is against any kind of psychological explanation. In myopinion, this is generally acceptable, as long as it does not go toofar. But I think that Smith’s approach tends towards the oppositedirection of interpretation: that of ‘demystifying the ritual’.22Ascholar dealing with religion should also take into account internalpsychological factors, which lead to the adoption of a religiouspractice; after all, this is what gives religion its particular character.Despite his attempts to diVerentiate his own methodology fromthat of scholars attached to evolutionist models, Burkert has not evenescaped criticism from this point of view. Thus, his work has beenregarded as continuing the evolutionist tradition.23What is to berejected, according to this criticism, is the evolutionist assumption22The expression is used by B. Mack (1987), 50.23A very good point made by an archaeologist, Sarah Peirce (1993); see esp. hern. 18 and p. 224.10Approaching the Issue of SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"that the phenomena-‘remnants’ under study have their origin in theremote past, and the risky attempt to reconstruct the psychologicalcondition of people in that remote past. Burkert does resort toreductionism, even if he does not admit it: that is, ethologicalexplanations are used to interpret the whole setting of a religious rite.However, what is especially obvious in Burkert’s work is his insist-ence on the morbid aspect of sacriWce. Maybe it has not been noticedby scholars, but this insistence derives from Burkert’s personal pes-simism about his own times:Some overstatements [in Lorenz’s book] no doubt have been corrected,but some of the criticism and subsequent neglect may be viewed as part ofthe schizophrenia of our world, which pursues the ideal of an ever morehuman, more easygoing life amid growing insecurity and uncontrolledviolence. . . . The thrust ofHomo Necansruns counter to these trends. Itattempts to show that things were diVerent in the formative period of ourcivilization; it argues that solidarity was achieved through a sacred crimewith due reparation. And while it has no intention of thwarting modernoptimism, it tries to warn against ignoring what was formerly the case.24AndHomo Necanscloses with a truly sombre prophecy:The modern world, whose pride is in the full emancipation of the individual,has gradually allowed the ritual tradition to break down. At the same time, ithas relegated death to the fringes of existence and thought. As the idealistictradition deteriorates, however, secret societies, ecstatic behavior, love ofviolence and death spring up all the more wildly and destructively amidseemingly rational orders. Ritual cannot be produced artiWcially, much lessits transcendent orientation, which is no longer shrouded in superstitionand secrets. The ideal of a new, non-violent man is a protest of hope againstthe tradition of violence and anxiety. But it is hard to foresee how theindividual, egocentric intelligence can be subordinated to the collectiveneed in order to make possible the continuance of mankind over the breachbetween the generations. In the end, societal forms in which man’s archaicpsyche will be granted its rights will presumably assert themselves. We canonly hope that primitivism and violence will not be released unbridled. Inany case, our knowledge of the traditions that proved themselves in the pastand thus survived in the various experiments of human development shouldnot be lost as we proceed, by trial and error, toward an uncertain future.2524Burkert (1983), p. xiv.25Ibid. 297.Approaching the Issue of SacriWce11"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"BurkertWnds remnants of primitive violence even in protest demon-strations against the war in Vietnam: ‘. . . confronting the authoritiesand the police, youngsters still experience the sacred shivers of awe.’26I think that this projection of Burkert’s personal pessimism ontoancient societies is what above all exposes him to criticism. However,Burkert, without denouncing his theory of sacriWce, has recentlyconceded on the centrality of aggression in human society.27Perhaps one of the weaknesses that remains unchangeable inBurkert’s book is that his obsession with origins deprives him ofthe opportunity to apply his theory to historical periods later thanthe Classical period. So, it is diYcult to imagine what Burkert wouldhave to say about the issue of the encounter between paganism,Judaism, and Christianity, with the latterWnally becoming a religionwith no altars.R. Girard on Greek sacriWceIn the same year asHomo Necans, another book of similar characterwas published. It wasLa Violence et le sacre ́(1972), written by theliterary critic R. Girard. He too attributes sacriWcial killing to violentfeelings; but he considers these feelings to stem from the very heart ofsociety and not from a remote stage in the past. According to Girard,violence is repeated mimetically from generation to generation, andreligion provides the means to legitimize it; thus, violence reaches itsclimax in the ritual killing of a victim selected at random. To provehis theory, Girard uses a huge amount of literature taken from everyperiod, Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the twentieth century. This,I think, constitutes the main fault of his approach. Even Burkertnotes that Girard’s approach is based on literature and not on ritual,andWnds the theory incompatible with Mediterranean cult.Where Burkert concentrates his criticism of Girard is on thenotion of violence. Burkert admits that many controversial evolu-tionist ideas found inHomo Necansare corrected by Girard, but hethinks that violence is not the key to the explanation of all kinds ofsacriWce. For Burkert, only the notion of anxiety would help tointerpret all sacriWcial acts, including those not followed by feasts.2826In Hamerton-Kelly (1987), 159–60.27Burkert (1997), 333V.28The criticism of Burkert is to be found in his papers in Rudhardt–Reverdin(1981) and Hamerton-Kelly (1987).12Approaching the Issue of SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"In my view, Girard’s theory is an accumulation of various data,which somehow predetermine the end at the cost of ignoring theparticularities of each context or period. Recently, however, scholarsof Christianity have used Girard’s work as a tool to approach Paul’ssacriWcial terminology in his letters.29Greek sacriWce according to the Vernant schoolAfter Burkert, the second most inXuential theory on Greek sacriWce isrepresented by a whole school. Its adherents are inXuenced by the socialanthropologist Claude Le ́vi-Strauss, whoWrst applied structuralismto the social sciences. This is the French structuralist school ofJ.-P. Vernant, M. Detienne, J.-L. Durand, and others. The main bookswhich are representative of this trend are: M. Detienne and J.-P. Vernant(eds.),La Cuisine du sacriWce en pays grec(1979), G. Berthiaume,LesRoˆles du Mageiros(1982), and J.-L. Durand,SacriWce et labour en Gre`ceancienne(1986). Burkert provides us with a very clear explanation ofstructuralism: ‘In a more speciWc way, structuralism is termed thescience of signs, to coincide with ‘‘semiology’’, while at the same timethe concept of ‘‘sign’’ and ‘‘language’’ has been expanded to cover nearlyevery aspect of civilization.’30The Paris school concentrates on the type of sacriWce which isfollowed by a feast (see Preface, n. 3). In this view, sacriWce is an act ofmeat-eating, legitimately constructed around the eVort of thesacriWcers to hide and deny the violent act of killing an animal. Inthis regard, the French school totally denies that the notion of‘murder’ is the central aspect in a sacriWce: ‘Pre ́cise ́ment, la ce ́re ́mo-nie du sacriWce pourrait se de ́Wnir comme l’ensemble des proce ́durespermettant d’abattre un animal dans des conditions telles que laviolence en apparaisse exclue et que la mise a`mort reveˆte sanse ́quivoque un caracte`re la distinguant nettement du meurtre, lasituant dans une autre cate ́gorie, a`l’e ́cart de ce que les Grecs enten-dent par crime de sang,phonos.’31Starting from the ritual of theBouphonia, where the animal is pushed to nod assent, the Frenchschool adopt the notion of a ‘comedy of innocence’; but they claimthat sacriWce contains this comedy in order for the guilt of killing to29Hamerton-Kelly (1985), (1990aandb).30Burkert (1979), 5.31Vernant (1981), 7.Approaching the Issue of SacriWce13"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"be resolved. Bouphonia also serves as an illustration of the fact thatthe Greeks were aware that they sacriWced an animal which helpedthem in their agricultural labour.The French school totally rejects the separation of Hubert andMauss between sacred and secular. Instead, they insist on the com-munal and secular character of the feast, which, however, takes placein a religious context: according to them, Greek meat-eating alwaystook place during a ritual occasion; also, the sharing of the meatbetween men and gods represented theWeltanschauungof the Greekcitizen.As its adherents are structuralists, the French school does notexamine sacriWce over time.32They rather belong to the trendwhich Burkert calls ‘ahistorical structuralism concerned with formalmodels’.33In my opinion, the main error of the structuralist approach is thefollowing: this school tried to construct a theory of sacriWce based ona motif of non-violence, on the basis of one ritual, namely theBouphonia. So, not only did this school choose to study one par-ticular kind of sacriWce, namely that which was followed by a feast,but it chose one speciWc example of this kind as a proof of the wholetheory. In my view, this selectivity tends to distort the evidence.34Despite the criticism it might arouse, one has to admit that theFrench structuralist approach placed sacriWce for theWrst time in thesecular context of the Greek Classicalpolis, without resorting topsychological or biological reductionism. The new method allowedscholars to deal with aspects which had been neglected, such aswomen and sacriWce, the symbolisms included in the stages of thesacriWcial procedure, and similar issues.3532Georgoudi’s chapter in Detienne–Vernant (1989) is one of the exceptions thatprove the rule.33Burkert (1985), 4. Notice the comment made by John Ma (1994) about thestructuralist method: ‘The ultimate end, rather than conviction through pure dem-onstration, is an eVect of admirable elegance achieved through structure and balance’(p. 75).34A long time after I reached this conclusion, Stella Georgoudi gave a papercriticizing the approach of the bookLa Cuisine du sacriWce. It is now published inGeorgoudi–Koch Piettre–Schmidt (eds.) (2005), 115–47.35Detienne’s and Durand’s chapters in Detienne–Vernant (1989).14Approaching the Issue of SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Thesaurus Cultus et Rituum AntiquorumA very important step toward the systematization of all scholarlyapproaches to sacriWce is the article in theThesaurus Cultus et RituumAntiquorum(ThesCRA).36Although neither a study of historicalevolution nor any mention of early Christianity is contained in thisarticle, it must be the most systematic recent treatment of GreeksacriWce. From another point of view, it seems that this articlecorroborates the importance of the present book: the writers empha-size the privileging of Archaic and Classical sources made so far in theresearch on sacriWce, and, consequently, the need for the study ofevidence from the Imperial period,37something which in this book isattempted for theWrst time.However, despite the promising attitude adopted by its writers, thearticle itself rather focuses on Archaic and Classical evidence. More-over, the remark on the need for the study of later evidence incorp-orates reservations about the reliability of such evidence. Forinstance, quite old-fashionedly, the evidence from Pausanias is notconsidered to be very important, since, according to the writers,Pausanias is interested in ritual because it falls out of the norm.38The article also stresses the tendency which will probably be thedominant one in the near future, and this is multidisciplinary stud-ies.39As a proof of this tendency, the writers have provided us with arich bibliography including an zooarchaeological section. Apart fromthis section, the bibliography also contains some very interestingrecent studies, like the article in which Fritz Graf views GreeksacriWce as a system of signs calling us to interpret them.40Jewish sacriWceM. Douglas and F. SchmidtA scholar who, even though an anthropologist, has been speciWcallyconcerned with Jewish sacriWce is Mary Douglas. Her recent work onLeviticus,Leviticus as Literature(1999), is a very good analysis of theconceptual structures underlying a text dealing with animals. As36Thesaurus Cultus et Rituum Antiquorum(ThesCRA), vol. 1 (Los Angeles, 2004).37Ibid. 132.38Ibid.39Ibid. 134.40Here cited as Graf (2002).Approaching the Issue of SacriWce15"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"such, it is extremely valuable for the student of animal sacriWce,especially when used in parallel with the French school’s analysis ofsimilar concepts in Greek sacriWce.41What is lacking from Douglas’sapproach is the insertion of her study into the historical context ofJewish religion. This insertion has begun to be eVected in the work ofF. Schmidt, who has applied the structuralist models used by MaryDouglas to late Judaism.Schmidt, inLa Pense ́e du Temple(1994), has mainly stressed theimportance of a certain vision of the Jerusalem Temple in thethought of the sectarian Judaism found at Qumran. Since the centralmotif in his study is the Jerusalem Temple, Schmidt has also dealtwith sacriWce, but unfortunately he has not fully exploited hismethod in the study of mainstream Judaism, which is the subjectof this book.42Structuralism is a good example of a method which, even thoughwidely followed, has not managed to inXuence all areas of a particu-larWeld. Thus, if, in Greek religion, structuralism has helped scholarsto see sacriWce in its context, by disentangling it from theories on theorigins of the practice, a similar tendency has not yet been noted inthe bibliography on Jewish religion, with the exception of the an-thropologist Mary Douglas. Instead, the existing studies on JewishsacriWce, still haunted by the evolutionist model, mainly deal with itsorigins, and do not talk about the role of sacriWce in Jewish society,especially that of the late Second Temple period.Apart from a special reference to the very original book by Kla-wans, below, only a general outline of the theories on Jewish sacriWceis given here, since, independently of my inclusion of Judaism in thestudy of sacriWce, my overall approach to the subject is primarily thatof a classicist.Main scholarly approaches to Jewish sacriWceSome of the theories on Jewish sacriWce can be regarded as the equiva-lent of Evans-Pritchard’s approach, as they focus on thesubstitutorycharacter of the victim; the latter is supposed to be immolated in the41See Durand (1979a).42An exception is his contribution to the volume by Georgoudi–Koch Piettre–Schmidt (eds.) (2005), 177–96.16Approaching the Issue of SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"place of the oVerer. As a result of the scholarly obsession with origins,evidence for this particular interpretation was even sought in Babylon-ian religion.43Apart from the two aforementioned drawbacks, that of seeingJewish sacriWce from the point of view of its origins, and that ofstudying it independently of Jewish social history, scholarly ap-proaches to Jewish sacriWce suVer from a further disadvantage: theinXuence of Christian theology. Thus, certain of the theories stressingthe substitutory function of Jewish sacriWce consider the Old Testa-ment sacriWcial ritual aspreWguring Jesus’s death, the latter havingbeen interpreted as an atoning substitutory sacriWce for man’s sake.44Before Tylor talked about the primary aspect of sacriWce as beingthat of gift, scholars studying Near Eastern cults had stressed thatJewish sacriWce is predominantly a present to God.45In its theo-logical variation, thisgift theorymade sacriWce a projection of theoVerer’s desire to dedicate himself to God as a gift.46G. L. Bauer was theWrst to express clearly the view that the giftoVered to the Jewish God in a sacriWce was ameal. In the twentiethcentury his theory made its reapperance in an evolutionist guise,where the concept of feeding the deity is underplayed by scholars as a‘primitive’ element in Jewish cult, or as a Canaanite inXuence.47Atthe same time, other modern scholars do not deny that the conceptof God being oVered a meal is intrinsic in Jewish sacriWce.48Along the same lines, but with its emphasis on theunifying role ofthe meal, there ran Robertson Smith’s theory on Jewish (and, byextension, Semitic) sacriWce: as we have seen above, according tohis evolutionist interpretation, at the heart of Jewish sacriWcial ritualoneWnds the belief in the natural links uniting thetotemwith thosepartaking of itsXesh and blood, as well as the worshippers with eachother.I have pointed out the defects in Robertson Smith’s theory: evo-lutionism, and dependence on the Christian concept of Eucharistic43See Michaelis (1753), Jahn (1805), Dussaud (1921), Blome (1934).44See Rivie`re (1952).45See Bauer (1805), Gramberg (1829, 1830), Lagrange (1905).46See Bahr (1837, 1839), Gese (1977).47Thus, de Vaux (1964), 39–40 and (1973), 449–50.48Wendel (1927), Gaster (1962).Approaching the Issue of SacriWce17"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"sacriWce. A further deWciency which should be mentioned here, in thecontext of theories on Jewish sacriWce, is Robertson Smith’s insist-ence on the consumption of the victim’s blood. How can we reconcilethis with the fact that Jewish religion is known for its taboo onblood? Consumption of blood is strictly prohibited in the Bible(Lev. 17: 10–14). Of course, one could say that the adoption of highersocial forms caused the Jewish belief in the consanguinity betweentotemand humans to be superseded by more ‘spiritual’ motifs.However, this hypothetical evolutionist suggestion cannot suY-ciently explain how the element which had been the kernel ofsacriWce according to Robertson Smith, namely consumption ofblood, did not even remain as asurvivalin Jewish ritual.It would be unfair to underestimate the fact that RobertsonSmith’s theory emphasized the connecting character of the sacriWcialmeal, both in the direction of man and the divine, and within theframework of the community. In fact, recently, scholars have againstressed the aspect of the common meal in Jewish sacriWce.49In the end, scholars have generally come to admit thatexpiatorykilling (based on the substitutory role of the victim), gift, and meal areall essential aspects of Jewish sacriWce. These aspects are not mutuallyexclusive; instead, the diVerent types of Jewish sacriWce allow for theeVective representation of all these functions.50Jonathan KlawansA very original and challenging analysis of Jewish sacriWce is thestudy by J. Klawans,Purity, SacriWce and the Temple(2006). Themain aim of Klawans’Xuently written book is to refute scholarlyappoaches which distort the phenomenon of Jewish sacriWce.Some distorting approaches place Jewish sacriWce at an allegedly‘inferior’ religious stage, which was either to be replaced by other,‘better’ forms of worship, like prayer and other eirenic cultic acts,or to be superseded by Jesus’ death and the Eucharist. Some otherdistorting approaches see Jewish sacriWce as a development overprimitive rituals. Both tendencies deprive sacriWce of any symbolicmeaning which it might have incorporated, and take it to be a49Marx, in Schenker (1992).50See Hartley (1992), pp. lxvii–lxxii. The presentation above owes much to thepaper presented by A. Marx in the seminar mentioned in n. 4 of the Preface here.18Approaching the Issue of SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"purely ‘material’ procedure. Klawans states from the beginning thathis book questions the distorting scholarly views on JewishsacriWce. He stresses and analyses the symbolism which is inherentin the Temple and in Jewish sacriWce, and which he closely connectsto purity. This symbolism, according to Klawans, is based on twotheological ideas:imitatio Dei, and attracting God’s presence in thesanctuary.According to Klawans, modern biases have made scholars takeOld Testament prophecies, rabbinic writings, and Qumranic textsto be radically critical of the Temple, but the author’s aim is to provethat this is not the case. The whole book is thus written by Klawanswith the aim to prove that the anti-Temple criticism allegedlyfound in some sources is no more than the result of modernscholarly projections. That is why the author asserts: ‘There are anynumber of reasons why Jewish, Christian, or even secularist modernsmay wish to believe that cult sites and animal sacriWce ought toremain things of the past. But scholarship that attempts to provethat point, or that simply rests on it, becomes a tool of theology orpolitics.’51Despite his originality and critical stance, it seems that Klawans istoo obsessed with his own symbolic system. Believing sacriWce to be astage in the procedure ofimitatio Dei, he makes all the evidenceWtthis scheme. In other words, Klawans does what he accuses otherscholars of doing, namely, he projects his own biases onto theevidence. Klawans’ pro-sacriWcial stance, on which his whole bookis based,52alerts one as to the objectivity of the study.However, in the framework of citing arguments against those whoconsider the so-called ‘cleansing of the Temple’ and the Last Supperas rejections of the Temple and sacriWce, Klawans is the only scholarwho pays attention to the issue of sacriWcial metaphor. Klawans’treatment of sacriWcial metaphors in the framework of Jesus’ wordsat the Last Supper will concern us in Chapter 6.51Klawans (2006), 254.52As Klawans characteristically claims: ‘Had the history of religion turned outdiVerently from the way it did, perhaps someone would have to write a book aboutthe fact that scholars denigrate prayer more than they should.’ Ibid. 10.Approaching the Issue of SacriWce19"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Historical ApproachesP. Stengel and M. Nilsson on Greek sacriWce. The importanceof Nilsson’s work for the purposes of this bookIn the bibliography on religions, there are also some predominantlyhistorical approaches, but these do not have sacriWce as their mainsubject, nor do they provide a theoretical interpretation of it. In someof these approaches, however, one canWnd references to, or sectionson, animal sacriWce in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, which isthe time-span of the present book.P. Stengel and M. Nilsson were the main representatives of the shifttowards ritual in German scholarship on religion, as this had beenrepresentedWrst by the Cambridge School in England. Stengel andNilsson were classicists concerned with Greek religion, but neither ofthem avoided the pitfall of evolutionism. They too tried toWnd‘primitive’ ideas, antecedent meanings and purposes hidden underrituals, with the supposition that the peoples practising rituals couldno longer understand their initial meaning.53In his workDie griechischen Kultusaltertu ̈mer(1890), Stengel dedi-cated a section of the chapter on cult to sacriWce. The section is adetailed description of all types of Greek oVerings. In his presenta-tion, Stengel for theWrst time distinguished between bloody andunbloody sacriWces, as he dealt separately with them. Contrary toNilsson, who treated puriWcatory sacriWces separately on the groundsof their ritual peculiarity, to Stengel all sorts of oVerings, includingsacriWces to chthonian deities, expiatory sacriWces, and humansacriWces, were included in the vast category of ‘sacriWce’. Stengel’sworkOpferbra ̈uche der Griechen(1910) is mostly useful for its ar-rangement on the basis of Greek terms (e.g.Ł\u0002\rØ\f;\u0003\u0005\u0006ªØÆ;ŒÆæ\u0007\bF\f).Apart from his attachment to an approach to religion on the basis ofritual, Nilsson had an unsurpassed knowledge of Classical An-tiquity. One of his teachers was the German classicist Ulrich vonWilamowitz-MoellendorV, the founder of the method which isknown in classics as Hermeneutics. Nilsson was mainly a historian of53For the criticism of these theories, see Burkert (1981), 93–5. Also Burkert(1983: 27–9).20Approaching the Issue of SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"religion, ‘perhaps the greatest of all modern scholars in theWeld ofGreek religion’,54but as such he also exploited his qualities as aphilologist, an archaeologist, and a historian.To the modern scholar of religion, many of Nilsson’s interpret-ations and categorizations might seem arbitrary and old-fashioned.For instance, the Swedish author often distinguished the religion ofthe ‘educated’ (die Gebildeten) from the religious beliefs of the‘people’, the ‘simple folk’ (die Massen);55or, even, the religion ofthe city-states from cults in the country. The latter distinction isperhaps due to Nilsson’s rural background (his parents were peas-ants).56Despite these and other questionable aspects, Nilsson’s worksrepresent what is still the most thorough and systematic attempt tocharacterize Greek religion, from Mycenaean times down to theRoman Imperial period. His most representative book, entitledGeschichte der griechischen Religion(1940), is very well organizedand shows a vast knowledge of the evidence.Nilsson integrates the issue of sacriWce into his general commentson Greek cult. Thus, generic sacriWcial terms are discussed in hisworks introductory to religion.57Nilsson even provides us with ashort account of Robertson Smith’s theory on the totemistic charac-ter of animal sacriWce, which he rejects as regards Greeks and ‘otherIndo-European peoples’.58Otherwise, sacriWce is mainly mentionedby Nilsson in the context of Classical civic religion.5954Mejer (1990), 335.55See Wide–Nilsson (1931), 38–9. See also the title of ch. 8 in Nilsson (1925), 263:‘The religion of the cultured classes and the religion of the peasants’, and Nilsson(19512), 676 (‘die Volksreligion’), 700 (‘Leuten’ vs. ‘gebildeten Leuten’), 701 (‘ho ̈her’-‘Erlesen’ vs. ‘nieder’); in ibid. 681 Nilsson attributes the success of Christianity to thesimplicity of the people.56In fact, in Nilsson’s work there is an underlying link between the distinctionseducated–folk and city–country. See mainly Nilsson (1940), 20–1. Also Nilsson(19512), 699.57Nilsson (19673), 70–1, 77–9, and on the various types of sacriWce, 79–80, 94–7,122–4, 129–135.

It is worth dwelling for a moment onNilsson’s treatment of the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Nilssontalks about the ‘Hellenistic-Roman time’ asoneperiod (hellenistische-ro ̈mische Zeit),60and notes a reduced interest of the Greeks in Greekreligion during this period. According to Nilsson, this lack of interestwas the result of the decline of Greek city-states, to which religion(‘patriotic religion’, in Nilsson’s terms) had hitherto been attached.61From the Hellenistic period onwards, says Nilsson, individualismreplaced patriotism:62religion was a personal, not a civic, matter,63since Greek cities were lost in the wider context of the Hellenistickingdoms and the Roman Empire.64The educated turned to phil-osophy, and the great mass of people to superstition, mysteries, andforeign cults. From the Greek cults, only those of Asklepios andHecate retained great popularity.65The same scholar thinks that the interest of Hellenistic poets andhistorians in Greek religion was due only to an intellectual roman-ticism, which culminated in Pausanias’ text, representing the second-century archaism fostered by Hadrian. This romanticism was exactlysymptomatic of the decline of Greek religion.66Nilsson (1948), 66–7, 68, (1940), 87, 94; and (c) as an opportunity for the establish-ment of interstate relations; Nilsson (1925), 256–7, where the following cases arediscussed: colonies sending sacriWcial animals to the metropolis (with an emphasis onthe Athenian procession of victims—see also Nilsson (1948), 68), a colonist’s sacriWcein the mother-city, and a common sacriWce of two Cretan cities.Nilsson also refers to the diVerences between sacriWcial cults; men vs. heroes: ‘Theforms of the cult of living men were in general not those of the cult of heroes; sacriWcesof blood (\u0003\u0005\u0006ªØÆ) were not oVered to the former, but altars were raised and burnt-oVerings made upon them just as to the gods’ (Nilsson (1925), 286).

However, Nilsson accepts the partial survival of the oldstate religions in the form of local patriotism: ibid. and Nilsson (1948), 177, 187.65Nilsson (1925), 263–93, (1948), 171.66Wide–Nilsson (1931), 41–2; Nilsson (1925), 295–9.22Approaching the Issue of SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"To Nilsson, the reduced interest in Greek religion was a realityalready detectable in philosophical teachings of the early Hellenisticperiod, when, among other symptoms, people were inXuenced byTheophrastus’ objections to animal sacriWce.67Thus, Greek inscrip-tions talking about a pure heart are explained as a result of Theo-phrastus’ wider appeal,68and Plutarch’s text (with no references) ascorroboration of the increased tendency to magic.69All this negative disposition towards later Greek religion underlies anarticle written by Nilsson in 1945, in which he deals with animalsacriWce more extensively,70and argues for its decline in the Romanperiod. In this article, NilssonWrst argues that in pre-HellenisticGreek religion, sacriWce was an expensive cultic act, taking placeonce a year or on special family occasions. And he adds: ‘In Greekreligion there was also a monthly cult, especially the cult of Apollo andthe house cult; yet as far as is known animal sacriWce did not occur inthis, rather oVerings of a less pretentious kind. It might seem to theGreeks that they venerated their gods too rarely, bringing oVerings tothem generally once a year, less frequently once a month, and moreoften at irregular occasions.’71Nilssongoesontosaythat,atthebeginning of the Hellenistic period, we come across theWrst dailyoVerings. Passing on to the time of Pausanias, he says that daily servicecontinued to be practised, but ‘animal sacriWce was not the dominatingrite’.72Strikingly enough, Pausanias’ references to daily oVerings asquoted by Nilsson do not support this view.73A long section of the article is dedicated to examples of cultic useof incense, lamps, hymns, and speeches, as evidence for the fact thatanimal sacriWce was rejected not only by Christians but by pagans,too. Among these examples, several belong to the Roman period orcome from Asia Minor. TheWnal section of the article is about thecult of Asklepios, and an inscription from Epidauros, where the word67Nilsson (1925), 275–6, 281–2; (1948), 89–90.68Nilsson (1948), 90, with no references.69Ibid. 163.70Nilsson (1945).71Ibid. 64.72Ibid. 65. Nilsson can easily go on to talk about the Roman period, since hebelieves in the continuity of the Roman period with the Hellenistic one (see n. 60above).73Pausanias,Elis I, XIII.10,Achaia, XXIII.11.Approaching the Issue of SacriWce23"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"\u0007ıæ\u0005\u000fæ\b\u0010is brought forward by Nilsson as evidence for incense-oVering (the inscription isLSS25, 2nd or 3rd c.ad):‘...aWre-bearerwent round the altars, probably to burn incense (any other sacriWce ishardly thinkable).’74Nilsson bases his argument on this mutilatedinscription in order to restore the sequence of a ritual not based onanimal sacriWce. This ritual ‘impressed people and seemed to them tobe a more appropriate veneration of the gods than animal sacriWcewhich took place but rarely and at irregular intervals’.75So, inNilsson’s view, Greeks showed an increasing lack of interest in animalsacriWce, because they began to realize that this practice was inappro-priate to worship, and favoured other cultic forms instead.In recent standard works on Greek religion, even that of the laterperiod, the refutation of Nilsson’s argument is not among the aims ofthe authors.76In fact, to the extent that the second chapter of thisbook (on Greek animal sacriWce) can be read independently of itsconnection with the chapter on Christianity, it is structured so as toserve the following aim: to establish the thesis of continuity in animalsacriWcial practice by means of which it is proven that there is nosuYcient evidence to support Nilsson’s claim that animal sacriWcewas in decline in the period we are studying. One could be scepticalabout my choice to disprove Nilsson’s outdated views. However,Nilsson’s work is still pivotal in the study of Greek religion, andmodern scholars still cite it, sometimes without making clear to thereader which aspects of the section cited are still valid and whichnot.77Nilsson’s still overwhelmingWgure, and the fact that he isthe only classicist who saw Greek religion—and, thus, sacriWce—diachronically, provide a legitimate framework in which we can setout the evidence.Further historical approachesAmong modern scholars, only R. Lane Fox has challenged Nilsson’sview on the decline of animal sacriWcial cult.78He has insisted on the74Nilsson (1945), 69.75Ibid.76Martin (1987), Price (1999b).77See e.g. Beard–North–Price (1998), i. 342, n. 78, where the reader would expectthe writers to keep their distance from the Nilssonian cliche ́s contained in the pagescited.78Lane Fox (1986), 69, mainly 70–2.24Approaching the Issue of SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"fact that bloodless cult was not a new way of worship, starting in theHellenistic period. He has correctly advocated the view in favour ofwhich this book argues, namely that whenever animal sacriWce wasnot oVered, this was due more toWnancial reasons than to moralhesitation. Unfortunately, his point is not accompanied by referencesproving it: ‘The bloodless alternative to sacriWce owed something toease and economy, but nothing to growing scruples about sheddinganimals’ blood. When pagans could pay for it, they did, and thescruples of a few philosophers made no impact.’79However, sacriWcedoes not constitute the main theme in Lane Fox’s book, so there is nosystematic refutation of Nilsson’s theory. Lane Fox’s examples ofanimal sacriWce come from Miletus (2nd c.ad), Astypalaia (2nd or1st c.bc), Pisidia (Imperial period), Asklepios’ shrine at Pergamum(apparently 2nd c.ad), and Lydia. Quite strikingly, most of theseexamples refer to Asia Minor and not mainland Greece, where onecan alsoWnd numerous instances of animal sacriWce.Finally, a few other works on religion, which deal with the issue ofsacriWce, should be mentioned here. A very original approach tosacriWce from the point of view of the Roman imperial cult is thatby S. R. F. Price inRituals and Power: The Roman Imperial cult in AsiaMinor(1984). Apart from an analysis of the dynamics of the imperialcult, Price has also stressed the importance of two issues: that of theexact recipient in the sacriWces of the imperial cult and that of thedivine (or not) status of the emperor. In this regard, Price’s booktouches the area of anthropology, and it is the combination of historyand anthropology that certainly constitutes its originality.As regards Jewish sacriWce, two authors should be mentioned, evenif they have not provided us with a satisfactory interpretation of theissue. E. P. Sanders’s bookJudaism; Practice and Belief: 63bce–66ce(1992) could be regarded as the only one which acknowledges theimportance of animal sacriWce in the Temple of the Roman period; itcontains very vivid descriptions of the sacriWcial activities in theTemple.I should also mention R. K. Yerkes’SacriWce in Greek and RomanReligions and Early Judaism(1952), even if it does not deal with theperiod covered by this book. Despite its ambitious title, the work leaves79Ibid. 71.Approaching the Issue of SacriWce25"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"out the most crucial phenomenon in the relation of Judaism to Chris-tianity: the coexistence of the two beforead70.The survey above has not includedallthe monographs or parts ofmonographs which deal with special aspects of the subject.80WhatI have rather tried to present here is a ‘history’ of the most inXuentialschools of thought concerned with sacriWce, a sort of commonbackground from which every scholar has to start. I have presentedthe inauguration, use, and handing down of methodological tools,which were used selectively according to each scholar’s personalpreferences. What remains for the inheritor of this tradition is theawareness that he/she uses models which others have used, andaccordingly the impulse to specify the meanings and limits of his/her own methods.2. CONCLUSION: THIS BOOK’S THEORETICALAPPROACH TO SACRIFICEIt is evident that theanthropological theories presented above arebased on sources of the Classical–early Hellenistic periods as regardsGreek religion, and on the Bible (that is the First and early SecondTemple periods) as regards Judaism. What is more, even this histor-ical background is used as foundation for the formation of anthro-pological theories on theoriginsof sacriWce, for which, actually, wehave no evidence. So, as regards chronological limits and intent,these theories can contribute very little to the aims of the presentbook. Methodologically, however, anthropological theories such asthe ones above can be used as a basis for a discussion on sacriWce.Thus, one notices that anthropological theories on sacriWce movealong two lines, the onevertical, the otherhorizontal. The vertical lineconcerns the relation between the oVerer of sacriWce and its recipient,80See e.g. on choice and cost of animals, Jameson (1988). Or on military sacriWces,Pritchett (1979), 83–90. Sarah Peirce (1993) denies even the smallest evidence of guiltduring Greek sacriWce, and instead reinterprets the old theory of sacriWce as a gift. Theidea of sacriWcial guilt is also criticized by A. Henrichs (1998). For a further sacriWcialtheory based on the idea of violence, see Bloch (1992), 24–45.26Approaching the Issue of SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"a relation which is expressed in the beliefs of the worshippers, bymeans of a theological or metaphysical language. The horizontalrefers to the relation of the oVerer with the reality in which he/shebelongs, that is, the members of his/her society, the principles and thematerials within it.Some theories have their focus on the vertical line (Tylor, Hubertand Mauss, Evans-Pritchard), others on the horizontal one (Meuli,Burkert, Smith, Girard), others on both lines (Robertson Smith,Frazer, Vernant, and, even though not an anthropologist, Price),but this does not mean that there can be an absolute distinctionbetween the theories according to their focus. It is also worth no-ticing that most anthropological theories on Jewish sacriWce focus onthe vertical line, that is, the oVerer’s relation to the Jewish God.As regards thehistorical approaches to sacriWce presented above,one could clearly state that historical theories on sacriWce are missing(that is why, in this case, I have used the term ‘approach’ instead of‘theory’). In other words, there is no such thing as a ‘history’ ofsacriWcial practice through time. The only historical approach toGreek religion, that of M. Nilsson, does not have sacriWce as itsfocus, and even when it does (for instance, in Nilsson’s article of1945), it is inXuenced by Nilsson’s evolutionist idealization of theClassical period, and his underlying view that monotheism came asan answer to the already reduced interest in Greek religion.Of course, as we shall see in this book, not much changed throughtime as regards practices and modes of animal killing, mainly inGreek religion (in Judaism one notices minor diVerences throughtime). So, a diachronic study of Greek religion or Judaism in isol-ation is not very appropriate, since the two religious systemsremained more or less the same. However, something must havechanged when Christianity, a new religious system, entered theirWeld. It is obvious that the missing aspect of all the historical pre-sentations is that none of them tries to study the impact which theattested coexistence of Greek religion and Judaism with Christianityhad on animal sacriWcial practice. This point is the main questionaddressed by the present book.The theories presented above either look for the origins of animalsacriWce or just take it for granted. I rather focus on the eventstriggering the cessation of animal sacriWce—even if the term ‘cessation’Approaching the Issue of SacriWce27"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"is itself relative, as will be shown. Obviously, a theory explaining thecessation of animal sacriWce would presuppose a systematic study ofthe circumstances under which this cessation took place. This bookis primarily aWrst attempt to look into these circumstances bydemonstrating the centrality which animal sacriWce continued tohave in Greek religion and Judaism when Christianity appeared.81Only at the end is a more personal view on the cessation of thepractice expressed.It is now time that I presented a few points about the view taken inthis book as regards animal sacriWce. (I have stated from the begin-ning that, in this chapter, I continue to use the term ‘sacriWce’ withno further speciWcation, because most scholars whose theories I havepresented have done so. Yet it has been evident that, in forming theirtheories, all these scholars mainly had animal sacriWce in mind.)Having been inXuenced by the methodology of the anthropolo-gists whose work I have studied, I think that the act of sacriWce is acomposite of beliefs, gestures, objects, and materials, which aredeWned by both theverticalandhorizontallines, as these have beendescribed above: that is,verticalis the line linking oVerer and recipi-ent, andhorizontalis the one linking the oVerer with objective reality.Both the vertical and horizontal lines are characterized by the use ofcodes.In my view, sacriWce is a way for the oVerer to approach therecipient (either divine or not). I do not use the phrase ‘communicatewith’ the recipient, because the response of the recipient is not alwaysobvious to the external observer. This approach is eVected along whatI have called the vertical line, which includes every belief, wish, orintention which the oVerer bears in mind when performing the act ofsacriWce. The codes of the vertical line through which the oVerer81Actually, while my book was in the process of being published, Guy Stroumsamade a similar attempt: Stroumsa (2005). The promising title of his book (La Fin dusacriWce) creates expectations in the reader. Despite admitting the writer’s knowledgeof a rich recent bibliography, in fact one has to be satisWed with a general, and at timessimplistic, overview of Second Temple Judaism and early Christianity. Furthermore,Stroumsa tends to focus on Christian writers of the third and fourth centuries.However, it is worth retaining Stroumsa’s comparison of the cessation of sacriWceto a ‘change of paradigm’—in Thomas Kuhn’s terms; I would not agree, though, withhis view that this change consists in an ‘inte ́riorisation de la religion’: see Stroumsa(2005), 24–5.28Approaching the Issue of SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"approaches the recipient are, for instance, those of metaphysics,theology, or religious art. Furthermore, the code of language is anintrinsic component of the vertical line, because it is through lan-guage that all other codes are communicated, so language is commonto the whole vertical line.On the other hand, thehorizontalline of the sacriWcial procedurerepresents man’s reality in the strict sense: the members of the societyto which the oVerer belongs, their principles, and the practicalitiesavailable within the framework of this society. We could imagine thisline as consisting of many sections, each representing a particularrealm of reality: the realm of cultic space and instruments, the realmof oVerings (including animals, or parts of their bodies, plants, andeven non-organic objects), the realm of human activities (modes ofkilling people/animals or of dying), the realm of values (justice,purity), the realm of lifestyles (continence)—and others, which, iflisted, would produce an endless series. Each of these realms func-tions through a code (buildings, images), but, as in the case of thevertical line, apart from their own codes, the meaning of all theserealms is further communicated by the common code of language,that is, words. Words do not constitute a particular realm, but movealong the whole horizontal line (see Figs. A to C, where language hasbeen depicted in italics).This book mainly deals with thehorizontalline, the line of reality.Moreover, despite the fact that reality is detectable through a greatdeal of evidence other than textual, this book is mainly written on thebasis of texts.If we were to draw only a part of the horizontal line, characterizingeach section of it (‘spaceþinstruments’, etc.), we would have Fig. A,in which it is clear that language (‘lang.’) arises in every section of theline.If we provide indicatively some of the respective linguistic terms initalics (‘open altar’, ‘ox’, etc.) underneath each section of the horizon-tal line, this gives us Fig. B.— space + instruments (lang.) ———— offerings (lang.) ———— activities (lang.) ———— values (lang.) ———— lifestyles (lang.) ——Fig A.The horizontal line of sacriWcial procedure (a section thereof)Approaching the Issue of SacriWce29"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Of course, these are speciWc terms used for the separate elementsin an animal sacriWce. The more general terms used for the notion of‘sacriWce’ in Greek and Jewish religion (see pp. 33–7 and 173, re-spectively) cover more than one section of the line. This is to beexpected, since sacriWce is a whole procedure for the activation ofwhich the oVerer selects objects and beings from many domains ofthe real world around him or her. Thus, in the case of Greek andJewish religion, Fig. B could be changed as shown in Fig. C (with thereader always bearing in mind that this is only a part of the line).As we shall see in the relevant section, Fig. C will help us understandthe mechanism of metaphor used in Christian texts. By means ofmetaphor the terms normally applied to a section of the line movetowards other sections of it.I have to stress that thehorizontalline, that is, the one linking theoVerer with objective reality, directly depends on theverticalline. Inother words, the relation of the oVerer to the recipient is what deWnesthe materials and gestures evident in a sacriWcial act. For instance, ifa group of worshippers believe that their recipient has human needs,this will result in a succession of sacriWcial acts involving the oVeringof a portion of meat to the particular god.—— space + instruments ———— offerings ———— activities ———— values ———— lifestyles ——Greek religion(open altar)(honour ofthe dead)(civic tradition)Judaism(Jerusalem Temple)(obedience tothe Law)(pigeons)(‘restoration’after childbirth)(slaughter)(ox)(slaughter)Fig B.The horizontal line with associated linguistic terms—— space + instruments ———— offerings ———— activities ———— values ———— lifestyles ——Greek religion(honour ofthe dead)(civic tradition)Judaism ———p r e s e r v a t i o n - o f f e r i n g—————(‘restoration ’after childbirth)ÕÕeqeq¹¹ h≤eim = offer a sacrifice (see p. 34)(obedience tothe Law)————————Õeq¹ h≤eim————Fig C.The horizontal line with generic sacriWcial terms30Approaching the Issue of SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"So, whereas both lines are open to a structuralist study on the basisof semiotics, I believe that the horizontal line is more easily access-ible, if we want to embark on the study of radical religious changes.By accepting the interdependence of the two lines, we shall be able torecognize that an obvious change in the horizontal line signiWes thata fundamental change in the whole system has taken place. This isbecause, when a worshipper starts thinking diVerently of his/herrelation to the object of sacriWcial worship (vertical line), this resultsin the use of diVerent codes in the everyday reality of worship(horizontal line). In other words, a change in the vertical line resultsin changes in the horizontal line, even if the modern observerWrstspots the changes in the latter.Minor changes in ritual (for instance, the quantity of animalssacriWced) should not be regarded as stemming from a change inreligious beliefs (vertical line), but rather as a variety in the horizon-tal line of the sacriWcial system.It must have become evident that the writer of this book has apreference for structuralist approaches to the issue of sacriWce, al-though her main method is the traditional hermeneutic one, whichconsists in the close reading of texts.

The two ways represent twodiVerent approaches to what I have chosen to call thehorizontallineof the sacriWcial system (Chapter 1, section 2), that is the line corre-sponding to man’s reality, from which the particulars for an animalsacriWce are drawn. This line corresponds to the aspects of space,instruments, animal or other oVerings, and human activities and values.As regards Greek animal sacriWce itself, the presentation of thematerial has been inXuenced by Nilsson’s view of animal sacriWce,which has been presented in theWrst chapter, and against which Iargue. More speciWcally, I argue in favour of the continued import-ance of animal sacriWce in Greek religion, by citing evidence for thevitality of Greek animal sacriWcial practice in the period 100bc–ad200. Sections B.i to B.iii below serve this purpose.As regards Greek animal sacriWce and Christianity, I present caseswhere sacriWce was obligatory among members of a pagan commu-nity or was felt as a personal need by some pagans (section B.iv). Inthese cases, sacriWce could be a source of dissension, either within apagan community, because some (Christian) members did not com-ply with its rules, or within a group of Gentile Christian converts,because some of them would be uncertain about the ‘correct’,sacriWcial or non-sacriWcial, form which their religious expressionshould take."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The two diVerent ways of approaching Greek sacriWce, in itself andin relation to Christianity, constitute the axes of construction of thischapter, and render my presentation diVerent from other studies onGreek sacriWce. The diVerence does not consist in bringing newevidence to light, but in bringing into relief new elements in theevidence already known—or else in stressing things which are usuallytaken for granted.Preparing the reader to realize the cultic revolutionWnally broughtabout by the religious system of Christianity, where animal sacriWce didnot constitute the focus of worship, I insist on the centrality of the unit‘animal’ in Greek paganism. The animal remained the primary sign inthe codes deWning the reality (horizontal line) of Greek sacriWce: theritual code, the dietary code, and, of course, the linguistic code. That iswhy I stress the insistence of various communities on religiously ex-pressing themselves by means of an animal sacriWce, and show thateuergetism was not always the channel of this religious expression. Toprove this, I leave behind the scholarly view of Pausanias as a nostalgicantiquarian, and instead follow his text as a guide to genuine expres-sions of religious vitality, in his own time. More importantly, I questionwhat is usually referred to as ‘lack of directive’ in Greek religion, bypointing at cases where ritual conformity in the form of an animalsacriWce was, if not explicitly required of members of the community,nonetheless imposed on them by a social convention, or else tradition-ally conceived by members of the community as the only way to expresspersonal religious needs. IWnally present a further aspect of the semi-otic importance of animals in Greek religion, their role in deWning thefuture by means of the art of divination.A1. LIMITS OF THE NOTION ‘SACRIFICE’IN ITS GREEK CONTEXTGreek Terms Used of Animal SacriWce—Categoriesof Animal SacriWceThe Greek vocabulary used of sacriWces in the period 100bc–ad200does not generally contain terms diVerent from those used in earlierperiods. In Greek religion, animal sacriWces could have the followingGreek Animal SacriWce33"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"functions: oVering, divination, puriWcation, propitiation, sealing of anoath. Apparently, these types were not deWnitely separate, and theoVering-type was almost omnipresent, since even sacriWces performedfor reasons such as propitiation,1or divination,2wereoVeredto deities.It is necessary to specify that, in the period covered by the book, mostof the Greek evidence for religious animal slaughter concerns cases ofthe oVering-type, or, at least, cases whose prevailing character is thatof theoVering. Animal sacriWce of the oVering-type is usually denotedby the Greek termsŁı\u0003\u0004Æ—Ł\u0002\rØ\f,3more generally by the termƒ\ræ\u0006(Ł\u0002\rØ\f), and, less frequently, by the termsK\fÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\f/ŒÆŁÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\f.Theverb\u0007\ræØŁ\u0002øis used in cases where a preliminary sacriWce is requiredbefore the main one, but it does not exclusively refer to animal oVer-ings.4Especially in the case ofŁı\u0003\u0004Æ—Ł\u0002\rØ\f, the beginning of thesacriWcial act is designated by the verbŒÆ\u0012\u0006æ\u000e\r\u0003ŁÆØ, which already inHomer and Classical sources denotes the throwing of barley grainsonto the animal victim,5or the shearing of a few hairs from the victim’sbrow.6Finally, when in the sources terms like›º\bŒÆı\u0012\rE\fand cognatesare used, one may assume that the victim was wholly burnt.Because of the frequency of its occurrence, and the particularimportance given to it in modern bibliography, it is necessary todwell a moment longer on the sacriWcial termK\fÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\f. The deWni-tion of the term pertains to the issue of the distinction between‘Olympian’ and ‘Chthonian’/‘heroic’ sacriWce. This issue has cometo constitute a standing puzzle for scholars: the well-known passagefrom Herodotus,7and in particular some passages from later sourcesincluding Pausanias,8initially led scholars to believe that sacriWces1See Pausanias,Corinth, XXXV.11,Laconia, XIII.5.2See Plutarch,Cimon18.4.3\u0013\bıŁı\u0012\rE\f, in the case of bulls slaughtered.4See Lupu (2005), 60–3, with regard to a Pergamene inscription from the Ascle-pieum inscribed in the 2nd c.ad, and rather constituting a compilation of olderregulations prevailing at the sanctuary.5Od. 3.445.6Euripides,Alcestis74, as conWrmed by the following verses (75–6), and as taken,at least, by\u0014VB (where Vand B are MSS of the Greek text and\u0014the scholia to them).See Dale (1954), 57–8 and xxxiii.7Herod. 2.44:ŒÆd \u000b\bŒ\u0015\bı\u0003Ø \u000b\u0015 \t\bØ \by\u0012\bØ OæŁ\u000f\u0012Æ\u0012Æ\u0016 ̄ºº\fø\f \u0007\bØ\u0015\rØ\f;\bQ \u000bØ\u0017a\u0016 ̇æ\u0006Œº\rØÆ ƒ\u000bæı\u0003\u0006\t\r\f\bØ \u0018Œ\u0012\u0019\f\u0012ÆØ;ŒÆd \u0012fiH \tb\f ‰\u0010 IŁÆ\f\u0006\u0012fiø;\u001aˇºı\t\u0007\u0004fiø \u000bb K\u0007ø\fı\t\u0004\u0019\fŁ\u0002\bı\u0003Ø;\u0012fiH \u000bb \u001d\u0012\u0015æfiø ‰\u0010 læøØ K\fÆª\u0004\u0011\bı\u0003Ø.

Theseritual particularities are mostly drawn from sources later than theClassical period. It should be stressed that the relevant passagesdescribe sacriWces to heroes, and nowhere mention the term\u000eŁ\u000f\fØ\b\u0010. In any case, elements contained in these descriptions led tothe formulation of a ‘classic’ type ofchthoniansacriWce in modernbibliography, deWned as follows:.the victims were black;12.they were slaughtered at night, with their head pressed down-wards;139The distinction between Olympian and chthonian sacriWce has been a scholarlytopossince the early 19th century (see Henrichs (2005), 47), and is found in all classicmanuals of Greek religion. See e.g. Stengel (19203), where the presentation of GreeksacriWce includes many sections, among which are these on sacriWces to chthoniandeities (§ 72), the cult of heroes (§ 79), and the cult of the dead (§ 80). In Stengel(1910) chthonian cults and cults of the dead are studied in the same section (XVI),but they belong to a section other than that on Greek sacriWce in general (XV).In fact, the distinction made in Classical sources (expressed by the verbsŁ\u0002\rØ\fandK\fÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\f) designates the diVerence between oVerings to the gods, on the one hand,and oVerings to heroes and the dead, on the other. The notion of thechthonian(\u000eŁ\u000f\fØ\b\u0010) was only introduced by the scholiasts of the Roman period.

The military sacriWces denoted by thetermsƒ\ræ\u0006and\u0003\u0005\u0006ªØÆhave been studied comparatively. For in-stance, W. K.

The limitation of myresearch to animal sacriWce means that, in the case of Greek religion,I shall not deal systematically with libations or vegetable oVerings, soIWrst have to justify the marginal treatment of these two areas ofnon-animal oVerings.Libation, that is the ritual pouring of a liquid (usually wine), seemsto be the most problematic of Greek non-animal oVerings, for thefollowing reasons:20.A self-evident, but quite important, point is that libation was anact not covered by any of the Greek terms denoting ‘sacriWce’(see above), but was designated by a distinct term,\u0003\u0007\b\f\u000b..Both literary and epigraphic evidence shows that animalsacriWce oVered on an altar was always accompanied by alibation, but not always by other non-animal oVerings..Libations could be also oVered alone, independently of animalsacriWces, on special occasions: truces, banquets, and the cult ofthe dead (where they took the special form of\u000e\bÆ\u0004,thatis,libationsnot exclusively of wine, but of other liquids as well, like honey)..Relevant to the latter characteristic is the fact that a libation didnot require the existence of an altar or a\u0012æ\u0006\u0007\r\u0011Æ, but could beoVered anywhere..As regards Greek iconography, the evidence comes from theClassical period, but it shows the particularity of libations:20The following characteristics do not fully cover the issue of libations, but theyare selected to make clear the comparison with animal sacriWce. The most recentaccount of Greek libations is Graf (1980), with bibliography. The article mainly dealswith the semiotics of the constituents of libations.Greek Animal SacriWce37"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"namely, vase paintings show gods pouring libations but notsacriWcing animals.21In other words, whereas Greek ritual killing was inextricably boundup with the oVering of a libation, the latter was also considered aquite distinct and autonomous sort of oVering.Despite admitting the importance of libations in Greek religion,I have decided to deal with them only marginally,22because of twocharacteristic features: (a) they were a complementary ritual elementto animal sacriWce; and (b) even if they were oVered alone, as analternative, they never came as a general rule to substitute for thepractice of killing an animal.23The latter characteristics apply even more to the rest of the non-animal oVerings (e.g. incense, cakes etc.), since these were not asautonomous as libations. Even Lucian, in his ironical treatment ofsacriWce, contained in his treatise—\ræd Łı\u0003ØH\f, mainly aims at animalsacriWce, whose procedure he presents in detail.24So, for instance,21See HimmeImann (1998), 120–9 (also few paintings of gods oVering non-animal sacriWces); I owe this remark on the iconographic diVerence between animalsacriWce and libation to Prof. R. Osborne.22The context where I shall deal with libations rather more extensively in thisbook is Christian persecutions, where it seems that the oVering of a libation by theaccused Christian played quite an important role; but it was another type of reasonwhich demanded the particular oVering (on which see Ch. 6).23Independently of the omission or not of libations from the book, it would be anomission of gratitude not to thank the scholars who have spent their time ondiscussing (or electronically corresponding) with me on libations: Prof. R. C. T.Parker, Dr S. R. F. Price, Prof. R. Osborne, Prof. J. Scheid, Prof. G. Berthiaume,Dr V. Huet. The Table Ronde on sacriWce (see Preface, n. 4), which I attended thanksto Prof. Scheid’s invitation, made me realize the diYculty in setting limits to the term‘sacriWce’. I am solely responsible for theWnal choice of limits as far as this book isconcerned.24Louise Bruit-Zaidman has pointed out the perfect compatibility between ani-mal and non-animal oVerings in Greek religion, by citing many examples of thecoexistence of animal and non-animal sacriWce in the same cult, and, at a certainpoint, by stressing Lucian’s equalizing enumeration of animal and non-animal oVer-ings inOn sacriWces12 (see below, in the main text). She has insisted that theexaltation of non-animal oVerings above animal oVerings was mainly an argumentof philosophical/vegetarian circles. See Bruit-Zaidman (2005). From my point ofview, Bruit-Zaidman’s emphasis on coexistence of animal and non-animal oVeringsexactly proves the non-autonomous character of non-animal sacriWce.Pausanias usesŁ\u0002øonly for animal oVerings (despite his admission of the archaic useof the term for non-animal oVerings:Elis I, XV.10), but usesŒÆŁÆª\u0004\u0011øfor both animaland non-animal oVerings (Corinth,X.5,Elis II, XX.3,Arcadia,II.3,Boeotia,III.8).38Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"in the aforementioned treatise (On SacriWces12), immediately afterciting on a par theŁı\u0003\u0004ÆØof an ox, a lamb, a goat,incense, and acake,Lucian goes on to ridicule those who sacriWce (Iºº\u001a\b¥ ª\r Ł\u0002\b\f\u0012\r\u0010), byironically describing in detail only the procedure for an animal, notvegetable, sacriWce. To me, this passage suggests that, at the religiouslevel, animal oVerings were at the centre of discussions and criticismsof sacriWce, as, at the linguistic level, the verbŁ\u0002ømainly alluded toanimal oVerings.25Generally, the examples which Lucian chooses inorder to ridicule sacriWcial practice in the aforementioned treatise allderive from scenes of animal oVerings.For the aforementioned reasons, in this book, I shall deal onlymarginally with examples of non-animal oVerings apart fromlibations.26Some scholars of Graeco-Roman religion (see n. 24 on LouiseBruit-Zaidman) have come to regard libations and other sorts ofnon-animal oVerings as having an equal status to animal sacriWce.Yet, it is possible to cite some further reasons proving that animalsacriWce occupied the pre-eminent position in Greek religion.If we are to look for someWxed element which persists through thediverse components of Greek sacriWcial practice, I would suggest thatthis is most convincingly identiWed as the conceptual category of theanimal’s body.27This proposition makes animal sacriWce the primaryoVering in Greek religion. Indeed, Greek sacred laws show that thebody parts of the sacriWcial victim (independently of the speciesconcerned) had a more or less standardized correspondence tothose partaking of the victim’s body: gods, priests, worshippers,and, among the latter, men and women. This was not the case withother sorts of oVerings, where not only would a single unit (e.g. aplant, a cake) remain undivided, but also a great variety of plants andingredients was involved.2825Admittedly\u0007\ræØŁ\u0002øcould probably be used of both animals and cakes, see n. 4.26Such a case is the oVering of incense mentioned by Pliny (Ep. X.96).27That by the term ‘animal’ we mainly have the quadruped animal in mind isrightly pointed out by Poplin (1989), 15. Despite the ingenuity of the particularcomments, I would regard this article as a bad example of the French school ofthought: in the article, evidence is gathered unsystematically from various times,places, and disciplines.28See the epigraphic collections by Sokolowski,passim.Greek Animal SacriWce39"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Apart from its character as an oVering, animal sacriWce servedfurther ritual purposes, such as puriWcation and divination. Veget-ables, cakes, or libations did not have functional roles of this sort,except in Pythagorean circles, where divination based on vegetableswas adopted as a deliberate reaction to common practice.29In Greece, animal sacriWce did not cease to be practised until atleast the second centuryad. The argument from cheapness in inter-preting the occasional preference for libations over animal sacriWce iscontradicted by evidence for the persistence of animal oVerings inmany Greek locations (including poor ones), a phenomenon consti-tuting the focus of this chapter. This cultic persistence is indicative ofthe character of Greek ritual, and should not be underestimated.From a macroscopic point of view, this willingness on the part ofthe Greeks to expendWnancial resources on sacriWcial animals provesthe importance that animal sacriWce had for Greek cities. As I shallshow in this chapter, the richer a Greek community was, the moresplendidly it tried to celebrate its festivals by increasing its expend-iture on sacriWcial animals.The limits to the deWnition of sacriWce presented above havedetermined my use of the sources: I have given priority to referencesto animal sacriWce.A Typical Description of Greek Animal SacriWcefrom Our PeriodAn important gap in our evidence for the period 100bc–ad200 isthat nowhere are we provided with a detailed description of thesacriWcial procedure, similar to the Homeric descriptions. The onlypassage referring to the order followed in the sacriWciaI procedurecomes from a critic of animal sacriWces, namely Lucian. This passagehas concerned us earlier, but in a diVerent context (pp. 38–9 above).To make his sarcasm at the sacriWcial scene more acute, Lucian madeuse of a colourful realism. In the passage below (On SacriWces12–13),I have highlighted the terms corresponding to stages in the sacriWcialritual:29See Bouche ́-Leclerq (1975), vol. 1, pp. 181–2.40Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"When they have establishedaltarsandformulaeandlustral rites, they presenttheir sacriWces, the farmer an ox from the plough, the shepherd a lamb, thegoatherd a goat, someone else incense or a cake;[ . . . ] But those who oVervictims—to come back to them—deck the animal withgarlands, afterWndingout far in advance whether it isperfect or not, in order that they may not killsomething that is of no use to them; then theybring it to the altar andslaughter itunder the god’s eyes, while it bellows plaintively—making, wemust suppose, auspicious sounds, andXuting low music to accompany thesacriWce!

This is the only element which does not agree with earlierepigraphic evidence, where the skin is a perquisite for the priest;otherwise, the ‘setting’ of an animal sacriWce, according to the de-scription above, is the following:1. An altar and a victim are necessary before the ritual starts;in particular the victim must have been chosen as being un-blemished.2. Prayers are said and lustral rites are performed, presumably forthe oVerer (and the priest?).3. The victim is garlanded and escorted to the altar.4. The victim is slaughtered (probably by the priest), and thepriest pours the blood around the altar, and carves upthe victim so as to extract its entrails. (We are not told thatthe entrails are extracted in order to be eatenin situ, but theredoes not seem to be any other reason for the priest to distin-guish the entrails from the rest of the victim.)5. The rest of the victim is burnt on the altar-Wre.Unfortunately, no information about meat-sharing is given by Lucianor any other Greek writer in the period we are studying.

SOURCES AND METHODOLOGYSourcesAs regards the literary evidence, our sources are the major Greekprose texts of the period: Diodorus Siculus, Dionysius of Halicar-nassus, Strabo, Plutarch, Pausanias, Appian, Lucian. Here, it is usefulto give an account of the contexts in which references to sacriWce aremade by each author.In theBibliotheca Historicaof Diodorus, animal sacriWce mainlyoccupies a place in the myths he narrates. However, several times amythical event is invoked to account for cultic particularities in theauthor’s time. Diodorus’ history also contains scenes which elucidatethe phenomenon of animal sacriWce and the conceptions whichsurrounded it, even when they refer to the past.30Dionysius of Halicarnassus sought to assert the Greek character ofRoman religion, by describing contemporary examples of RomansacriWce conducted in the Greek way, and to some extent these can beused by us as indirect evidence for Greek ritual. Like Diodorus,DionysiusWnds the evidence for the past in the present, but fordiVerent reasons. The text of Dionysius shows that Greeks andRomans could communicate by means of a language consisting insacriWcial semiotics.In theGeographyof Strabo animal sacriWce mainly belongs to thestrange and exotic, but some examples concern Greek animalsacriWce supposed to be conducted in Strabo’s time, or are detaileddescriptions of other people’s sacriWcial rites. Furthermore, com-ments inserted in the text,31or sacriWcial terms used, can equallyconstitute reliable material for the modern scholar.30See e.g. his description of the Egyptian sacriWcial ritual, in Diodorus 1.70.4–5,or his comment on the oVering of sacriWce during the rise of the Dog Star, in 4.82.2.31See e.g. Strabo 7.3.4 on the close relation of women to sacriWce.42Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The authors whose texts contain most references to sacriWce, andare used as the main sources in this book, belong to the laterWrst andsecond centuriesad.In Plutarch’sLives, references to religious practice necessarily con-cern the past, both Greek and Roman, but these can be used cau-tiously as evidence for Plutarch’s awareness of cultic change betweenthe past and his own time. In theMoraliathe evidence for animalsacriWce comes from Plutarch’s time, and here, whenever Plutarchdeals with religion, he shows great artistic skill.32Not only does heinform us about the existence of animal sacriWcial cults in severalplaces around Greece (and Rome), but he also provides us withdescriptions of sacriWcial scenes, and an account of the mentalitiessurrounding animal sacriWce conducted in Greece, Rome, Egypt, andJudaea.Along with Plutarch’sMoralia, theDescription of Greece(\u0016 ̄ºº\u0006\u000b\b\u0010—\ræØª\u0019\u0003Ø\u0010) of Pausanias can be used as a source for the creation of a‘cultic map of Greece’,Wlled not only with names and sites, but alsowith the religious conceptions and tendencies in the second centuryad.33Only a few of the cults referred to by Pausanias belong to theremote past; thus, his text will constitute the main literary source inthis chapter, since Pausanias describes in detail many diVerentsacriWcial cults in mainland Greece of the second centuryad. Here,I stress not only Pausanias’ interest in sacriWce, but also the similarityof his perspective to that of Greek sacred laws.A marginal reference to Appian’sDe bello civiliwill be made in thecontext of sacriWcial obligations imposed on individuals.One of the satires of Lucian (On SacriWces) has already concernedus, as a source of description of ritual.As will have become obvious, Greek treatises speciWcally address-ing animal sacriWce are lacking from the period studied in this book,when Christianity encountered the pre-existent practice of animalsacriWce. The exception to this rule might be Pausanias, who de-scribes many Greek sacriWcial cults in detail, but here again these32This is admitted by Russell (1968), 133.33The only book to have stressed Pausanias’ value as a source for his contempor-ary Greece is Arafat (1996): Pausanias ‘kept an open mind, looking at both ancientand modern, but the stress on the local adds an extra dimension to the study of thecontemporary. . .’ (p. 12).

Those studied inthis book come from the well-knowncorporaof Greek inscriptions,complemented by epigraphic publications in periodicals.35From theepigraphic evidence, I have only included direct evidence for animalsacriWce, namely inscriptions which explicitly refer either to animalsacriWce or posts related to sacriWcial cult.Direct epigraphic evidence includes not only cultic regulations andsales of priesthoods, but also decrees and dedications. The collections ofsacred regulations (such as the ones made by Sokolowski) are notfully representative of the various cultic issues. The classiWcation ofcertain inscriptions under the heading ‘sacred laws’36is no guaranteethat religious issues are not contained in other epigraphic categories.Thus, a number of honoriWc decrees can contain much more substan-tial material as regards sacriWce (for instance, recording that theperson honoured made distributions of sacriWcial meat) than theinscriptions traditionally classiWed as sacred laws from the same area.3734Of course, this treatise incorporates long sections from Theophrastus’ criticismof animal sacriWce (4th–3rd c.bc).35See the Bibliography, section 2. When use of speciWc epigraphic publications ismade, references are given in the footnotes.36For the most recent—and, I think, most successful—attempt at a deWnition ofthe (usually) vague term ‘sacred law’, see Lupu (2005), 4–8. Lupu has collected andrepublished a great number of ‘sacred laws’ published after Sokolowski’s last volume(1969).37An example: the sacred law from Stratonikeia contained inLSA, no. 69, containsonly the verbŁ\u0002øas regards sacriWce. However, if one looks at the stelai honouringthe priests of Zeus Panamaros, important references are made to the distribution ofsacriWcial meat by the priests (IStratonikeia, nos. 202, 203).For this period, one canWnd many more epigraphic references to sacriWce bylooking through Jeanne and Louis Robert’s various works and articles, rather thanthrough epigraphic collections; but, again, the lack of a consistent index to theRoberts’ work deprives the student of any certainty about the completeness of sucha search.

The characteristic dispersion ofinscriptions in time and space deters us from forming either a syn-chronic view of sacriWcial practice all around Greece, or a diachronicview of sacriWcial practice in one place. Moreover, simple attestationof the practice does not mean a ‘description’ of it. Thus, in cases wherewe only have a mention of animal sacriWce, there is no way for us toknow the exact ritual procedure followed at the time. A furtherproblem which we are faced with in the study of inscriptions is that38The terms themselves do not allude to sacriWce; however, in some cases they arecombined with a sacriWcial context. For instance, the word\rP\u000eis found on stelaidepicting a sacriWce (IPrusa ad Olympum40 and 46). The word\rP\u000eÆæØ\u0003\u0012æØ\b\fisfound on a relief depicting a libation andWre on the altar (IAlexandreia Troas78). Onthe other hand, weWnd stelai and reliefs with depictions of animal sacriWce, butwithout any allusion to it in the text (IApameia Bithynien und Pylai33 and 35). On\u000eÆæØ\u0003\u0012æØ\b\f, seeOGIS699, n. 6 and 835.39Altars are dedicated to gods (OGIS423,IEphesos1266, where there is also arelief depicting a sacriWcialWre), to kings (OGIS175), to the emperor (SIG3814),even to important men (IKnidos59: Artemidorus is to become\u0003\u0002\f\fÆ\b\u0010with Artemisand to be honoured with sacriWces and games). Altars are also related to theremembrance of the dead (e.g.IBithyniaIII 6: a\u0013ø\t\u000f\u0010is dedicated\t\f\t\u0019\u0010 \u000e\u0006æØ\f).Such altars might just have been bases (see Hellmann 1992, 74), although theexplicit reference to the dedication of the altar (and not of both the altarandwhat itsupports) rather excludes this possibility. But, apart from that, it is not certainwhether the dedication concerns the altar as ananathe ̄ma, or implies also the oVeringof a sacriWce, either at the moment of the dedication or at regular intervals. Thus, inthe case where the dedicator is a priestess (IKyme38), it is very likely that a sacriWcetook place, but, quite often, even if the remains of an altar are archaeologically visible,the text has no reference to a\u0013ø\t\u000f\u0010(INikaia1035, 1055, 1067), so a sacriWce is notnecessarily implied.Greek Animal SacriWce45"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"the so-called ‘epigraphic habit’ has been studied systematically onlyin relation to the impact that Roman dominion had on socialmobility in the West.40The epigraphic reaction of mainland Greeceto Roman rule has not been speciWcally studied as such, and there isno comparative study of epigraphic production as between mainlandGreece and Asia Minor, including religious inscriptions. Finally,another puzzle concerns chronology: the evidence does not alwaysagree with the limitations set by the student. Fortunately, thisproblem has been easily solved here by a slight modiWcation of ourtime-limits.41In conclusion, it is crucial to emphasize that the evidence foranimal sacriWce in mainland Greece and Asia Minor is obstinatelyscanty and discontinuous as regards the period we are concernedwith. On the one hand, epigraphic sources are scarce, both chrono-logically and spatially—with the exception of Athens, Rhodes, Delos,and Ephesus. On the other, the literary evidence is characterized bytwo problems: either it deals with sacriWcial rites which are mythicalor earlier than our period, or, in the best case, it deals only withsacriWcial rites of the second centuryad.4240See MacMullen (1982); Woolf (1996).41Thus, our chronological framework of inclusion of inscriptions is the following:.Not all inscriptions are exactly dated, so I have decided to extend the initialchronological limits by 10 years on each side, i.e. theWnal limits are 110bcandad210..Datings of the sort ‘before X’, ‘after X’, or ‘around X’ are included only whenthey are congruent with these limits, i.e. the earliest date is ‘after 110bc’ andthe latest one ‘beforead210’..Texts dating ‘aroundad210’ or ‘around 110bc’ are also included..I have not included texts with the following datings: ‘uncertain’; ‘within 2ndc.bc’; ‘within 3rd c.ad’;.whereas I have included texts dating: ‘end of 2nd c.bc’; ‘beginning of 3rdc.ad’; ‘2nd/1st c.bc’; ‘within 1st c.bc’; ‘within 1st c.ad’; ‘within 2nd c.ad’;‘2nd/3rd c.ad’..From datings of a general character, I have included: texts of ‘Roman times’,or of the ‘Imperial period’..Texts generally dating to the reign of an emperor are included, up to thosedating to the time of Septimius Severus.42See e.g. books 1–4 of Diodorus, which deal with Greek and foreign sacriWces ofthe mythical, prehistoric, and early historical past.

The researcher must be able to separate the wider argumentwhich the speciWc reference serves from the reference itself, and todetermine the degree to which the reference was distorted for thepurposes of the author’s argument.A further problem is whether one should include terms not denotinganimal sacriWce, but which, however, are related to animal sacriWce.References totemples have not been used in this book, as they do notexplicitly concern animal sacriWce, even if they constitute implicit evi-dence for the existence of cult, which could not be other than sacriWcial.Wheneverareferencetoafeastismadebyanyofoursources,thereferencehas been includedonlywhen it is accompanied by the speciWcation thatthe feast follows a sacriWce (Łı\u0003\u0004Æ), as in the following passage fromStrabo (10.5.11):43‘Tenos has no large city, but it has the temple ofPoseidon, a great temple in a sacred precinct outside the city, a spectacleworth seeing. In it have been built great banquet-halls (hestiatoria)—anindication of the multitude of neighbours who oVer sacriWce togetherthere (synthyontes) and take part with the inhabitants of Tenos in cele-brating the Poseidonian festival (Loeb tr. modiWed, my emphasis).’ Infact, such references to feasts serve as conWrmation of the fact that, whenwe come across the Greek termŁı\u0003\u0004Æalone, animal sacriWce is implied.Sometimes we may not come across the termŁı\u0003\u0004Æ, but it is certainthat the sacriWce mentioned is that of an animal; such cases arethe following: distinct reference to divine or heroic honours, becausewe have no evidence that this distinction could function in a43This method of mine might result in an overlap with the texts studied by PaulineSchmitt-Pantel.

If animal sacriWce, or some aspects of it,was something extremely alien to the reader whom the authoraddressed, I suggest that the author, when talking about the past,could either have omitted the relevant section, or have inserted somecomments warning the reader about the diVerence.Greek Animal SacriWce49"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"A further point to make concerns animal sacriWce practised inoracles (i.c).

Finally, we shall discuss the issueof continuity in Greek religion in general (i.d).i.a.Explicit evidence for the continuation of animal sacriWcesSome of the Greek authors studied in this book clearly refer to rituallinks between their present and their past. These are Diodorus,Plutarch, and Pausanias.Diodorus likes presenting the myths of the places he talks about astheaitiaof cultic particularities in these places. These cultic particu-larities consist in speciWc characteristics of old-established rituals ofanimal sacriWce, which survived up to his time. Thus, a myth about aplace, narrated by Diodorus, can at the same time be theaitionforthe sacriWcial rite practised at this place.Plutarch does not hesitate to interrupt his narration about the pastin theLivesin order to talk about rituals of animal sacriWce, whichwere established in what was to Plutarch the remote past, and whichcontinued to survive down to his own time.Pausanias is the author who, rather than interrupting his narrationof the past withXashes onto the present, most explicitly starts fromthe present and goes back in time in order to give us the link to thepast. Observing an animal sacriWce alive in his time, he either recordstheaitionof this practice, or talks about a change having occurredthrough time. When only theaitionis recorded, I presume that nochange has taken place, except if the author says so.In all of the examples below, I focus on instances where the verbused denotes animal sacriWce.Cases where no change has occurredGeneral comments(1) SacriWces are oVered to Hera Teleia before weddings (Dio-dorus, 5.73.2).(2) In Samothrace, the inhabitants still use some forms of theirancient language during their sacriWces (Diodorus, 5.47.3).50Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The islands(1) In Samothrace, there are still altars on the summits of themountains, on which the inhabitants sacriWce in memory of theirsalvation from theXood (Diodorus, 5.47.5).(2) In Rhodes, there is the habit of laying the victims on the altarbefore they light theWre (Diodorus, 5.56.5–7).(3) In the Rhodian Peraia, no one is to eat pork before comingto the shrine of Hemithea to oVer a sacriWce (Diodorus,5.62.5–5.63.1).45(4) The Cretans oVer sacriWces to Idomeneus and Me ̄rione ̄s (Dio-dorus, 5.79.4).(5) In Knossos, each year the inhabitants celebrate the wedding ofZeus and Hera by sacriWces (Diodorus, 5.72.4).(6) EveninPausanias’time,theinhabitantsoftheislandofTheraoVerannual sacriWces (K\fÆª\u0004\u0011\bı\u0003Ø\f)toTherasastothefounderofthecolony.Theaitiongoes back to the mythical past (Paus.Laconia,I.5–8).Mainland Greece, the Peloponnese(1) In the sanctuary of the Cabeiroi in Boeotia, Pelarge ̄and Isth-miades refounded the cult, and according to an oracle from Dodona, asacriWce (Łı\u0003\u0004Æ) of a pregnant victim was established in honour ofPelargeˆ(Paus.Boeotia, XXV.5–8).(2) The city of Delphi oVers sacriWces (K\fÆª\u0004\u0011\bı\u0003Ø)tothesonofAchilles, ever since the time when his appearance caused fear to theGalatian raiders, in the third centurybc(Paus.Attica,IV.4).(3) In the temple of Artemis at Aulis, all victims are permissible;theaitiongoes back to the Trojan War: on seeing a favourable wind,each Greek sacriWced to Artemis whatever he had at hand (Paus.Boeotia, XIX.6–7).(4) Plutarch informs us that, until his own time (\t\u0015\u000eæØ \fF\f), theAthenians still oVered a ram to Konidas, Theseus’ tutor; this happenedone day before the festival of theTheseia(Plutarch,Theseus4).

The Plataians undertook to make annualoVerings (21.2,K\fÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\fŒÆŁ\u001a\u001eŒÆ\u0003\u0012\b\fK\fØÆı\u0012\u000f\f) to the Greeks who hadfallen in the battle of Plataia and had been buried there. The oVeringswere made on the 16th of Maimakterion, up to Plutarch’s own time(21.5,\u0018\u0012Ø ŒÆd \fF\f). After the detailed description of the splendidprocession, Plutarch goes on to decribe the sacriWcial killing carriedout by thearchonof the Plataians:Aristides21.5App. II (1)...heslaughters the bull at the funeral pyre, and, with prayers to Zeus andHermes Chthonios, summons the brave men who died for Greece tocome to the banquet and its copious draughts of blood; next he mixes amixer of wine, drinks, and then pours a libation from it, saying these words:‘I drink to the men who died for the freedom of the Greeks.’ These rites, I say,are observed by the Plataians down to this very day. (Loeb tr., slightlymodiWed)As is shown in Appendix I to this chapter, the description above isthat of a ‘chthonian’ ritual, which is diVerent from the ‘Olympian’ritual of the Eleutheria, the latter just mentioned in the same passagebut not described by Plutarch. Consequently, in this Plutarchanexample on Plataia, we have evidence for the survival oftwoanimalsacriWcial rituals of distinct types.46Plutarch says that the\u000b\rØ\u0007\f\b\u0005\u000fæ\bØpartake of the sacriWcial meatin imitation ofthe mothers of those sent to Crete (23.3).

They assume that the nature and performanceof animal sacriWce was essentially the same in the Archaic or Classicalperiod as in their own day. By contrast, in the following examples ofsurvival of animal sacriWce, the authors do comment on changeswhich had occurred through time.Allusions to change or explicit statements about change(1) The inhabitants of Tenedos ‘have continued to perform downto modern times’ sacriWces to Tennes (Diod. 5.83.3, Loeb tr.). In thispassage from Diodorus, we do not come across the usual expression‘up to now’ (\t\u0015\u000eæØ \u0012\bF \fF\f), so we are probably to conclude that thesesacriWces were not performed at the time of Diodorus, though we arenot told the reason for this (possible) change.(2) A passage about a ritual originating in the past, but in which theauthor points out a change, comes from theMoralia(527D). Plutarchcompares the Dionysia of the past with those conducted in his owntime. In this context, the ‘decadence’ consists in the elaboration of theoriginal ritual rather than in its fading out. As we have pointed out insection A2 of this chapter (under ‘Methodology’), one should alwaysbe aware of the rhetorical context in which sacriWce is placed. Here, forexample, the passage on the Dionysia belongs to the treatise—\ræd\u0005Øº\b\u0007º\bı\u0012\u0004Æ\u0010. It is not surprising, then, that what the author wants tocondemn in the modern version of the Dionysia is the display ofwealth, shown, for instance, in the procession of pairs of victimsinstead of a single ram as in the old days.Plutarch,Moralia527DApp. II (2)Our traditional festival of the Dionysia was in former times a homely andmerry procession. First came a jug of wine and a vine branch, then onecelebrant dragged a he-goat along, another followed with a basket of dryWgs,and the phallos-bearer came last. But all this is nowadays unregarded andvanished, what with vessels of gold carried past, rich apparel, carriages ridingby, and masks: so has what is necessary and useful in wealth been buriedunder what is useless and superXuous. (Loeb tr.)(3) In the next example, Pausanias leaves open the possibility that achange could indeed have taken place as regards the disposal of theGreek Animal SacriWce53"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"victim after sacriWce (Elis I, XXIV.9–11). In the Elean Altis, before thestatue of Zeus Horkios in thebouleute ̄rion, an oath is taken by theathletes and many others, that they will not oVend against the OlympicGames. The oath is taken upon theXesh of a boar (K\u0007d Œ\u0006\u0007æ\bıŒÆ\u0012\u000f\t\fı\u0003ŁÆØ \u0012\b\t\u0004ø\f, ibid. XXIV.9). Pausanias admits that he forgotto ask about a speciWc ritual detail: what do they do with the boar afterthe oath? He merely cites evidence from Homer to prove that ‘theancient custom about victims was that no human being might eat ofthat on which an oath had been sworn’ (ibid. XXIV.10, Loeb tr.).(4) A further sacriWcial ritual originating in the past but varyingthrough time is recorded in Plutarch’s life ofAratus(53.4–5). TheSicyonians had moved Aratus’ tomb to their city (from Aegion). Thetomb was still called Arateion in Plutarch’s day, and two sacriWceswere oVered at it (Ł\u0002\bı\u0003Ø\f): the one was called\u0014ø\u0012æØÆ, and wasoVered on the 5th of Daesios, in commemoration of the city’sdeliverance by Aratus. The other sacriWce was oVered on Aratus’birthday. Aratus was the recipient of both sacriWces, but only in thesecond did he have a personal priest carrying out (ŒÆ\u0012æ\u000e\r\u0012\b) thesacriWce. The use of the Greek verb leaves no doubt that the sacriWceoVered on the birthday of Aratus involved the killing of an animal.Plutarch focuses more particularly on the birthday rite, which wascharacterized by the participation of various groups of citizens. In hisdescription he uses the imperfect, and the reason for this tense is givenat the end of the account: only a few elements of the splendid proces-sion described were still in use in Plutarch’s time. Time and othercircumstances, which Plutarch does not analyse, meant that only avery basic ceremony was still observed at the time when he wrote:Plutarch,Aratus53.4–5App. II (3)TheWrst of these sacriWces was performed by the priest of Zeus the Saviour;the second by the priest of Aratus, who wore a headband, not pure white butpurple and white, and hymns with accompaniment of lyre were sung by theartists of Dionysus, and the gymnasiarch took part in the procession, at thehead of the boys and young men of military age; then followed the council-lors wearing garlands, and all other citizens who desired. Of these ceremo-nial rites the Sicyonians still preserve slight traces, celebrated on the samedays of the year, but most of them, owing to the passage of time and thepressure of other matters, have lapsed.

This instance goes back tothe mythical and historical past, as is obvious in theaitioncited bythe author. There is no reference to the kind of the sacriWces oVered,but in all probability (although not certainly) these were animalsacriWces, because in other cases Pausanias likes to specify the kindof non-animal oVerings.47The passage concerns us here because itconstitutes one of the observable cases where a historical change isexplicitly pointed out by the author. The change is attributed to thefoundation of thecoloniain Corinth:48Pausanias,CorinthIII.7App. II (4)But after Corinth was laid waste by the Romans and the old Corinthianswere wiped out, those sacriWces to the sons of Medea were not carried out bythe new settlers any more, nor do their children cut their hair for them orwear black clothes.

I presume they couldWnd information in theirsources,49but the possibility of oral testimony should not be under-estimated, as Pausanias’ remark on his questioning the inhabitantsproves. Both Plutarch and Pausanias might have recorded commentsmade by elderly people in their environment.Plutarch likes to stress that certain sacriWcial rituals fostered in themythical or historical past were still being kept in the old way (as inthe examples of the Oschophoria and of the sacriWce at Plataia), and,as an indirect proof of this, he, a Greek of the second centuryad,isconsistent in using the same variety of sacriWcial terms as those usedin the Classical period (Ł\u0002\rØ\f;K\fÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\f;ŒÆ\u0012\u0006æ\u000e\r\u0003ŁÆØ). However, wehave seen two instances where Plutarch acknowledges a changebetween past and present (the cases of the Dionysia, and of Aratus).Plutarch’s comments on these ritual changes concern the scale ratherthan the nature of the rites (for instance, the number of participants47See e.g. Paus.Laconia, XXIII.8 (K\t\u0013\u0006ºº\bı\u0003Ø\f Iº\u0005\u0004\u0012ø\f \t\u0006\u0011Æ\u0010),Elis II, XX.2(\t\u0006\u0011Æ\u0010 ŒÆ\u0012Æ\u0012\u0004Ł\u0019\u0003Ø\f...\t\r\tÆª\t\u0015\fÆ\u0010 \t\u0015ºØ\u0012Ø),Arcadia, II.3 (\u0007\u0015\t\tÆ\u0012Æ ŒÆŁªØ\u0003\r\f).48See Strabo, 8.6.23, Appian,Pun. 136, Plut.,Caesar57.49According to the note in the Loeb edition: ‘M. P. Nilsson (Studia de DionysiisAtticis, Lund, 1900, p. 91) believes that Plutarch is comparing the Attic festival, known tohim through his reading, with the festival as celebrated in great cities in his own time.’Greek Animal SacriWce55"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"and victims, and not, say, the method of slaughter). Since, in all theinstances above, Plutarch(a) is still quite keen to draw distinctions between sacriWcial rites,by using diVerent terms for them;(b) does not insert any explanatory comments on their conduct asit wasin the past; and(c) does not point to any diVerence in sacriWcial technique be-tween the Classical past and his present,we can say that neither he nor his readers were aware of any signiWcantchange through time in the way an animal sacriWce was performed.Just like Plutarch, Pausanias apparently assumed in general thatsacriWcial rituals fostered in the past stayed the same in his time, ashis use of distinct sacriWcial terms (Ł\u0002ø;K\fÆª\u0004\u0011ø;\u0012\u000f\tØÆ)andhislackof explanatory comments prove. Two cases where he indicated achange are the exception, but in these two cases the reasons for change,although not explicitly stated, seem to be similar to those given byPlutarch: in the case of the Olympic oath, Pausanias’ emphasis on whatused tohappen (K\u0007\rd \u0012\bE\u0010 ª\r Iæ\u000eÆØ\b\u0012\u0015æ\bØ\u0010) seems to imply that thepassage of time, and not a speciWc human choice, changed the ritual.Again, the reason for which the sacriWces to Medea’s children hadceased was discontinuity in the occupation of the place.50The four (or, possibly,Wve, along with Diodorus’) instances ofsacriWcial change studied in this section do not in any way constituteindications of extensive decay, abandonment, substantial alterationor scaling-down of animal sacriWcial cult: one of these instances (theDionysia) shows that the sacriWce became more elaborate, whereasthe case of Aratus concerns lack of splendour and not the cessation ofsacriWce. Only two (or three) instances are worth considering, and ofthese only the case of Corinth records a total eclipse of sacriWce—if itwas an animal sacriWce; the other refers to a possible, but not certain,diVerence in the disposal of the victim (the Olympic oath), whereas itis very doubtful whether the case of Diodorus alludes to the cessationof sacriWce.50Misleadingly, the Loeb translation implies that the Romansdeliberatelystoppedthe Greek sacriWcial practice (‘. . . the new settlers broke the custom of oVering thosesacriWces . . .’).56Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"i.b.Greek sacriWcial omens as a further sign of continuityPlutarch narrates events from the past, but in none of the instances ofdivinatory animal sacriWce contained in the GreekLivesdoes he givethe impression that he is talking about an obsolete practice. Here aresome Plutarchan examples of divination from animal sacriWce:Plutarch tries to justify the unexpected approach of Aratus toAntigonus Doson (c.224bc) by giving the evidence for a sacriWcepredicting this approach (Aratus43.4–5). In a sacriWce oVered byAratus, themantisfound the liver to have two gall bladders enclosedin a single foil of fat. The omen meant that Aratus would enter intofriendship with the person he most hated.51InCimon18.4 the reader is prepared to expect Cimon’s death; thefollowing omens appeared in the sacriWce oVered by Cimon before heset out on his expedition to Cyprus (c.450bc):(a) as themantiscut the victim, ants started gathering round itsdried blood, and they brought it next to Cimon’s toe wherethey started moulding it;(b) the lobe of the animal’s liver had no head (º\b\u0013e\f \bPŒ \u0018\u000e\b\f\u0012ÆŒ\r\u0005Æº\f).The usual Greek expression used of the latter omen in Greek litera-ture isƒ\ræa ¼º\b\u0013Æ,52a very bad omen deriving from the fact that theappendix attached to the upper lobe of the liver was missing. InscientiWc nomenclature, this appendix is calledprocessus pyramidalis,but in Greek the term used of it wasº\b\u0013\u000f\u0010.53The passage about Cimon shows that, apart from extispicy, othersigns accompanying the sacriWce could be used as a basis for divination,too (ants, blood).The following are examples where sacriWcial divination isnotbased on extispicy:51Friendship must have been inferred by the fact that two identical organs werecontained in the same area (just like the cover in which both Antigonus Doson andAratus are wrapped:Aratus43.5). And hatred must have been inferred from the factthat these organs were gall bladders (\u000e\bºÆ\u0004).52On the uncommon expression used inCimon, see the reference in Pritchett(1979), 76, n. 121.53For these clariWcations, see ibid. 74–6.Greek Animal SacriWce57"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"TheWrstexamplepreparesthereaderforthequarrelbetweenAlexanderand Cleitus (328bc,Alexander50.2–3): Alexander called Cleitus whilethe latter was oVering asacriWce.

Alexanderwas notiWed about the event, and learnt that the sign was ominous.The second example of sacriWcial omens not deriving from extis-picy isPyrrhus6.4–5. Pyrrhus planned to come to terms with bothPtolemy and Lysimachus, so the three kings came together for thesacriWce marking the treaty (c.296bc). A bull, a boar, and a ram werebrought for the sacriWce, but the ram died at once before the sacriWcetook place. ThemantisTheodotus prevented Pyrrhus from partici-pating in the treaty, because the sign meant that one of the threekings would die. Thus, Pyrrhus refrained from making peace (we donot know whether the animal had already been consecrated).The third example shows that omens could be obtained from thedead animal, but not necessarily from its entrails: as Pyrrhus oVeredbull-sacriWces in honour of his dead son (272bc), the tongues of thebeheaded bulls were seen to come out of their heads and taste theblood; this was a bad omen (Pyrrhus31.3).To sum up, the following omens derive from animal sacriWce asreported by Plutarch (in order of sacriWcial stages):1. one of the animals for sacriWce dies before the sacriWce takes place;2. some of the consecrated animals follow the oVerer;3. the sacriWcial blood is tasted or used by other animals (e.g.insects) or by the victim itself;4. the liver has noprocessus pyramidalis;5. the liver has two gall bladders enclosed in a single foil of fat.Only in two cases (3 and 4) does Plutarch expect his readers to knowthat the omen was bad. Admittedly, in the other three cases Plutarchdoes interpret the omens. But he does not feel obliged to explain to hisreaders what extispicy is. This practice is taken for granted, and Plutarchsimply cites several cases of it. The details given in Plutarch’s accountsmight have been added by his intermediate sources, but this is a furtherproof of the fact that neither Plutarch, nor apparently any intermediatewriters on whom he depended, saw anything systematically diVerent, oralien, in the religious practice of the Classical or Hellenistic period.58Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"So, since a decision on the continuity in the practice of sacriWcecan be reached only on the basis of the way in which the author putsacross the image of cultic life in the past, I suggest the following:(a) it is unlikely, if not impossible, that Plutarch was not aware ofsacriWcial extispicy or various sacriWcial terms from his ownexperience, and that he just reproduced what he found in hissources;54(b) if Plutarch just projected onto the past the practices of his owntime, it means that the latter were still current;(c) Plutarch nowhere oVers a radical explanation of the diVerentsacriWcial practices and terms he uses, which would be the caseif he had decided to ‘reconstruct’ a forgotten sacriWcial reality(he never says, for instance, ‘people in those days used to takeomens from entrails’ or ‘they used to oVer\u0003\u0005\u0006ªØÆ’).Plutarch does not feel the need to justify the use of a supposedlyobsolete practice. Though we can never be sure about changesthrough time, what Plutarch read about sacriWcial omens in hissources evidently seemed entirely familiar to him and his readers.This conclusion generally applies to all instances of animalsacriWce from the mythical or Classical past contained in Plutarch’sLives.

We are nottold about any sacriWce from the visitor.LGS83, vv. 18–35App. II (5)The council and people decided that, on the occasion of consultation of theoracle, the priest of Apollo, the one elected by the city, should proceed, and,(along with him, should proceed) one from each magistrature of thestra-te ̄goiand thenomophylakes, and oneprytanis, and (one)tamias, and thegrammateusof the god and theprophe ̄te ̄s; if anyone of the aforementioned isill or on a journey, let (the city) send another one; and let thestrate ̄goiandthenomophylakesalso enlistrabdouchoifrom among the citizens, three men(not) younger than 30 years old . . . when the aforementioned reach theoracle, and oVer the sacriWce according to the custom, and take goodomens, let thegrammateusof the god, after the sacriWce, receive the writtenquestions from those who want to consult the oracle . . .

Noticing this crucial diVerence, wecan see that the example from Coropa, along with those by Plutarchand Pausanias below, do however show a line of continuity in thatthey depict the gods of the oracles as recipients of animal oVerings.From Plutarch’s treatiseDe defectu oraculorum(Moralia409V.), weknow that an animal sacriWce always preceded the consultation of theCitizens were not only asked to give money for a sacriWce (Phocion9.1), but could alsotake the responsibility for conducting a public sacriWce, thus satisfying their desire fordisplay and gaining in social prestige (Nicias3.4–6).Military sacriWces(mostly\u0003\u0005\u0006ªØÆ).Theseus27.2,Alexander31.4,Solon9.1V.,Aris-tides11.3V.,Themistocles13.2,Dion27.2.60Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"oracle at Delphi (see esp.Mor. 437 f.).

He advocates more strongly than anyone elsethe Greek origin of the Romans, and supports his view by citing56Translated and discussed in Lupu (2005), 61–3.Greek Animal SacriWce61"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"evidence from ritual. Thus, when he attributes certain Roman sacriWcesto the Arcadians who had come to Italy, his proofs are the ritualsimilarities between Greek and Roman sacriWces, which are evident inhis own times (Ant. Rom. 1.32.5–33.3). Plutarch must have been awareof Dionysius’ claims, since he mentions the theory about the Arcadianorigins of the Carmentalia and the Lupercalia (Romulus21).A passage from Dionysius is of particular importance for our study ofthe continuity of sacriWcial rites. Dionysius presents religious continuityas a deliberate human choice, and even gives a reason for this choice:\u0012ÆF\u0012Æ(religious practices)ªaæ K\u0007d \tŒØ\u0003\u0012\b\f \u000eæ\u000f\f\b\f \u000bØa \u0005ıºÆŒB\u0010 \u0018\u000e\rØ\u0016 ̄ºº\u0006\u0010\u0012\r ŒÆd \u0013\u0006æ\u0013Ææ\b\u0010 \u000e!æÆ;ŒÆd \bPŁb\f I\u0017Ø\bE ŒÆØ\f\b\u0012\b\t\rE\f \rN\u0010 ÆP\u0012a \"\u0007e \u000b\r\u0004\tÆ\u0012\b\u0010ŒæÆ\u0012\bı\t\u0015\f\u0019 \t\u0019\fØ\t\u0006\u0012ø\f \u000bÆØ\t\b\f\u0004ø\f.(Ant. Rom. 7.70.3).These both the Greeks and barbarian world have preserved for the greatestlength of time and have never thoughtWt to make any innovation in them,being restricted from doing so by their fear of the divine anger. (Loeb tr.)Divine wrath is an issue discussed both in the ancient sources and inmodern scholarly studies. Ancient authors believed that Greek godsmade their wrath manifest when mortals neglected their religious du-ties.57Modern scholars talk about ‘gods’ appeasable anger’,58and thefear felt by their worshippers.59What is original in the passage fromDionysius is that he refers to thewayin which gods were worshipped,and not just to the omission of worship. Thus, with regard to oursubject, gods would be pleased not only if they were oVered sacriWcesregularly, but also if the ‘technique’ of sacriWce remained the same.60A change in technique would concern, for instance, the materials oVeredto deities: animals might cease to be slaughtered, and only plants oVeredin their place. No changes of this sort are alluded to in any of our sources.However, in the examples which we have studied, whenever a culticchange is recognized by the author to have occurred, there is no hint atany discomfort felt by the worshippers. How could one explain this?57See Paus.Arcadia, XLII.5–6. The probably spurious essay in theMoraliacalledParallela Graeca et Romanaalso contains stories about omissions of sacriWces.58Lane Fox (1986), 95.59Ibid. 98.60Talking about the Egyptians, Diodorus also refers to their concern to keep thesame religious oYciants, who would honour the gods in the same way (1.73.3).62Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"In the examples where there is an explicit statement of change, theauthor attributes it to time (Plutarch also adds the general factor\u0007æ\u0006ª\tÆ\u0012Æ, ‘circumstances’), or to discontinuity of occupation. Itseems that the sort of ‘change’ which disturbed Greeks was anydeliberateattempt to alter the way in which gods were worshipped.61Change through time is not deliberate, and is the only one for whichgods would not be displeased.This section is fundamental for the rest of our study of Greek animalsacriWce, because it proves that the discontinuity in the attestation ofanimal sacriWce in the sources does not mean discontinuity in thecultic practice itself. Even if unevenly distributed in time, literaryevidence from our period points to the authors’ assumption aboutcontinuity in animal sacriWce, and the only cultic changes attestedconstitute rather marginal cases in the history of Greek animalsacriWce. Besides, two of the main aspects of Greek religiosity, namelydivination and oracular consultation, seem not to have discontinuedincorporating animal sacriWces in their procedures. Finally, a passagefrom Dionysius has shown that animal sacriWce was preserved be-cause of the religious conservatism of Greeks, who thought thatkeeping to tradition without changing it would please the gods. Ashas been correctly pointed out, Christians sought to change thetraditional way of worship, and this was what aroused the anger ofcontemporary pagans.62ii. Vitality and Local Variety of Greek Animal SacriWce:Pausanias and the Similarity of his Perspective to thatof thelegessacraeHaving proved the continuity in Greek religious experience (sec. i), inthis section I shall seek to demonstrate that the predominance of evi-dence for animal sacriWce in second-century texts does not necessarily61Deliberate alteration of rites is implied in a further argument of Dionysius, inhis attempt to prove that the Romans are not barbarians (Ant. Rom. 7.70.4–5). In thecomplicated argument Dionysius says that, if the Romans were barbarians, theywould have changed Greek religious practices. This did not happen, so, as Dionysiussays, the Romans are not barbarians.62Lane Fox (1986), 95.Greek Animal SacriWce63"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"point to a sudden revival of cult in the second century, but rather to acontinuous attachment of the Greeks to local rituals, which were manyand multifarious. Animal sacriWce was not performed in a single temple,as was the case in Judaism, but there were many variations in localpractice within the framework which is broadly deWned as ‘pagansacriWcial practice’. In the course of this section my speciWcfocuswillbe the text of Pausanias, which I use with fewer reservations than otherscholars (I give reasons for this choice), and which I compare to epi-graphic evidence.The multifarious character of Greek religion is mainly attested in avery peculiar kind of epigraphic evidence, which could be consideredas the closest parallel to a sacred book. This consists in regulationsconcerning individual cults. These regulations are usually called byscholars ‘sacred laws’ (leges sacrae). Strictly speaking, a sacred law is awritten regulation on the cultic procedure to be followed by wor-shippers in a speciWc sacred place. Sacred laws concern both publicand private sacred places, so they can be issued by a city,63a group ofpeople,64or even by an individual.65Quite often, the authorityissuing the law is not stated.Admittedly, many examples of sacriWcial regulations contain ref-erences to non-animal oVerings. There are even instances where anexplicit prohibition of animal sacriWce is made in the law.66In othercases non-animal oVerings prevail in the inscription, but referencesto sacriWcial victims are not completely missing.67In general, though,animal slaughter is present throughout the period we are studying,mainly in documents from cities, whose ‘oYcial’ conception of anoVering was that of an animal slaughtered on the altar.68In order better to illustrate what a ‘sacred law’ is, I selectivelypresent the law from Andania:63See e.g.LGS65, 92bc.64See e.g.SIG31104, 37/6bc.65See e.g.LGS55, 2nd c.ad.66See e.g.IHadrianoi36, 1st c.bc–1st c.ad.67See e.g.LGS52, 1st c.ad.68As we shall see, in the latter case the purpose of an animal sacriWce is usuallyalimentary.

In Roman religion custom requiredabsolute concentration during ritual; such was the obsession ofthe Romans with punctiliousness that, in case an event regarded asa bad omen took place during a sacriWce, the sacriWce should berepeated.71Of course, as regards Greek religion we do not happen toknow similarly extreme examples.Apart from the passages cited above, the law from Andania containspassages concerning the distribution of the portions of sacriWcial meat70This translation of\"\u0007\u0015æþacc. is the one given by Daux (1935).71See Plutarch,NumaXIV.2,Moralia270C, mainlyCoriolanus25, where it is saidthat a sacriWce was repeated 30 times!66Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"(vv. 95–9).

This decrease in sacred lawswas emphasized by Nilsson.75Since Nilsson’s time, thanks to system-atic epigraphic collections, the number of inscriptions strictly deWned72On the role of Mnasistratus as reformer of the mysteries, seeSIG3, no. 735 withnotes, and note 9 to no. 736.73The inedibility of puriWcatory sacriWces is generally assumed to be the rule inGreek religion, but it is surprising that the relevant evidence is so meagre. See thereferences in Parker (1983), 283, n. 11.74Paus.Messenia, XXXIII.6.75Nilsson (19512), 354, counts no more than 10 instances from the Imperialperiod. Nilsson (ibid. 66–75) dedicates only a section to early Hellenistic sacredlaws, and inserts those of the Roman period in the footnotes of the same section.He considers the sacred laws of the Hellenistic and Roman periods as a reactionagainst the new wave of cults: these laws, says Nilsson, make obvious the need of theold religion, which feels threatened, to protect itself by listing its characteristics (ibid.p. 66). However, this does not agree with Nilsson’s admission that the evidence forsacred laws in the Imperial period is quite scanty (ibid. p. 354). If we follow Nilssonand accept that these laws supposedly embodied the reaction to new cults, theyshould have been increasingly more frequent.Greek Animal SacriWce67"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"as ‘sacred laws’ has, of course, become larger, but still not as large as thenumber of sacred laws from the Classical period.76However, apartfrom sacred laws, rich evidence for the importance of animal sacriWceis provided by: (a) inscriptions not usually deWned as ‘sacred laws’,which we shall study in section iii; (b) the literary evidence of thesecond centuryad. Prominent within this evidence is the text ofPausanias, with which we are concerned in the present section. Pau-sanias not only recorded the existence of cults, but described theircharacteristics. Details concerning local cultic variations often consti-tute the gist of his reports, and in this light the focus of his reports issimilar to that of the inscriptions called ‘sacred laws’.In the latest studies Pausanias has been examined in four culturalcontexts: the Second Sophistic and the archaism involved in it,77religious experience,78the archaeology of Roman Greece,79andsacriWcial cults of local heroes.80The two former approaches arerather theoretical. But it is important to note that they are takeninto account by the two latter approaches, which are more practical.However, all these studies miss a central point in the text of Pausan-ias. What we should emphasize here is that Pausanias repeatedlytalked aboutworship, and that this worship was centered on acts ofoVering, among which was prominent the act ofanimal sacriWce.81I must note that Ekroth’s book is the only one which studiesPausanias from the cultic point of view. However, since she dealswith hero-cults in the Archaic to the Early Hellenistic periods, heruse of Pausanias’ text as a source for his own time is secondary to herwider aims.A crucial section at which Pausanias enters Ekroth’s book is herstudy of the termK\fÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\f, whose meaning she considers to be76Thanks to collections such as those by Sokolowski, Segre ́, and more recently,Lupu (2005). In the collection by Lupu alone, apart from nos. 23 and (perhaps) 24,which he is publishing, in App. B there are listed about 20 instances of sacred laws (notall of them dealing with animal sacrifice), dating from the 1st c.bcto the 2nd c.ad.77Bowie (1974).78Elsner (1992).79Alcock (1993).80Ekroth (2002) and (1999).81Of course, next to the act of ‘oVering/slaughtering’ an animal, Pausaniasprovides us with evidence for the act of ‘oVering/dedicating’ an object. The categoriesof dedicated objects reported by Pausanias can vary, but prominent among these arestatues.68Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"diVerent from that ofŁ\u0002\rØ\f,82but which she does not completelyclarify. With reference to the author we focus on here, namelyPausanias, the conclusion that one could draw from Ekroth’s presen-tation regarding the occurrence ofK\fÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\fin the sources,83is thatshe questions Pausanias’ use of the termK\fÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\f, both as regardsperiods earlier than his and as regards his own time. Especially withregard to the time of Pausanias, which mainly concerns us here,Ekroth does not make it clear whether the frequent use of the termK\fÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\fproves an augmentation ofK\fÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\frituals or an augmen-tation of the use of the term, but in both cases she attributes the largefrequency (in the presence ofK\fÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\frituals or in the use of theterm) to the second-century archaism. In either case, I disagree withEkroth’s diagnosis of archaism in this context.Since Ekroth herself admits that ‘the bulk of the evidence forK\fÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\fsacriWces is found in Pausanias’,84why not admit that thesesecond-century rituals seem widespread to the modern reader simplybecause a writer recorded them very conscientiously for theWrst time?Pausanias lived in a period inwhich intellectuals showed a deep love forthe Greek past. But it is his description of rituals which resulted fromthis love, and not the rituals themselves. Generally, even if RomanGreece was romantically obsessed with her past to a certain degree,I cannot imagine that the geographical extent which the sacriWcialrituals recorded in Pausanias attest can be attributed to archaism(let alone an archaism fostered by the Romans). Let us think of caseswhere the sacriWce (Łı\u0003\u0004Æ) took place on an isolated altar,85or on aremote summit,86or even among the remains of a temple.87There is nospecial reason to suppose that in these cases the sacriWce was not that ofan animal, because Pausanias would have speciWed the material oVeredinstead, and would have used a term more appropriate to the oVering,as he did elsewhere.88So, these might be cases where the cultic contexts82Ekroth (2002), 74–5, 126.83Ibid. esp. 121–8.84Ibid. 125.85Such altars abound in the text of Pausanias.

I believe thatit is time we focused onworship, and the main reason for the survival ofworship seems to have been the spontaneous desire for cultic expres-sion. This desire, whose existence is proved by the inaccessibility of theplaces where it was fulWlled, is unlikely to have been fostered byarchaism, nor did it depend on abundance inWnancial resources.An allegedly archaistic and unreliable use of the termK\fÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\fbyPausanias can also be explained along the same lines. The text ofPausanias is not the earliest in our period to attest the geographicalextent of Greek animal sacriWcial practice. Plutarch’s works are quiterich in evidence for animal sacriWce in many places in Greece,90and infact Plutarch is also aware of a distinction between the worship of divineandtheworshipofheroicWgures.91The fact that Pausanias uses the termK\fÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\fmore frequently can simply result from his conscientiousnessin describing every cult in detail. Our trust in Pausanias does not mean89Alcock gives three reasons for the survival of rural sanctuaries (not just ritual) inRoman Greece: archaism, territorial self-deWnition, and the taking over of sacredplaces by wealthy communities. Alcock (1993), 200–10.90The following examples explicitly refer to animal sacriWce, according to themethodological premises I have set (see sec. A2 in this chapter).Moralia, fr. 106 iscited because it is reasonable to read it in connection with Plutarch’s discussion ofcastration of animals in the same passage. Plutarch often accompanies the sacriWcialrite described by anaition.Aegina:Moralia301F.Phocis:Mor. 1099E–F.Boeotia:Mor. 655E, 693E–F, fr. 54.WestAitolia:Mor. 294C.Eretria:Mor. 298B.Cos:Mor. 304C and E.Lampsakos:Mor. 255E.Greece in general:Mor., fr. 106.Even if written as consolation to an exile, the following passage could apply to non-exiled Greeks as well: crowds of worshippers included not only people from the areawhere the speciWc festival was held, but also visitors from other places in Greece.Surely, one of the activities of these visitors must have been their oVering of sacriWces:‘Surely the exile too is free to sojourn in Eleusis during the Mysteries, to keep holidayat the Dionysia, and to visit Delphi for the Pythian and Corinth for the Isthmiangames, if he is fond of spectacles’. . .

Thus, the work of Pausanias canvery naturally constitute evidence for the assumption that, in theperiod when the number of sacred laws diminishes, animal sacriWcedid not cease to be important, even if some communities had declined.Indeed, the sacriWcial themes found in the text of Pausanias show agreat similarity to sacred laws as we know them from inscriptions.Pausanias describes many sacriWcial rites as practised in diVerentplaces in Greece, and conscientiously deWnes their characteristics,often by evoking anaitionfor them.One such deWnition of sacriWcial characteristics pertains to theissue already touched on, namely theenagizeinsacriWce.

(Loeb tr.)Other passages from Pausanias could be also read as if they were‘sacred laws’: not only do they deal with the species of the victimoVered, but they further specify in detail the way of burning theanimal, and eating the meat, especially when the sacriWcial practice isoutside of the normal.For instance, it seems that Asklepios of Epidauros was honouredwith more than the standard god’s portion of thigh-bones:9593See also the expression\tc \u0005\u0015æ\r\u0003ŁÆØinLGS54, 1st c.ad.

Ekroth (2002, 313–25)considers the restriction\bP \u0005\bæ\u0006a reinforcement of the already existing practice offeasting on sacriWcial meat. Generally, Ekroth (ibid. 325–30) tries to undermine Scul-lion’s model, which focuses on the recipient’scharacter, by stressing theritualaspectinstead (¼the circumstances under which a sacriWce was performed), but in the end sheadmits that her category called ‘modiWed ritual’ is ‘a means of recognizing in ritual thecharacter of the recipient or a particular side of the recipient’s character’ (ibid. 329).95For a ‘standard’ description of an ‘Olympian’ sacriWce, see Burkert (1983), 3–7.Also Durand (1979a).72Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Corinth, XI.7App. II (9)While to the god are being sacriWced a bull, a lamb, and a pig, they removeCoronis to the sanctuary of Athena and honour her there.

(Loeb tr.)Sometimes Pausanias merely insists on the variations in species fromplace to place:Laconia, XV.9App. II (10)The Lacedaemonians are the only Greeks who surname Hera Goat-eater,and sacriWce goats to the goddess.

(Loeb tr.)In the following Pausanian ‘sacred law’, what is peculiar is thedistribution of meat. In the Elean Altis the right to partake of thesacriWce to Pelops belonged not to the person attached to the cult ofPelops there (the soothsayer), but to an oYcial from the priestlyhierarchy of the cult of Zeus. It seems that this was the only relationallowed between the cult of Zeus and that of Pelops. Otherwise therewas a cultic separation, evident in the way one should approach theshrines. The heroic shrine of Pelops was not at the same level of purityas the temple of Zeus. That is why a person should not eat from thevictim dedicated to Pelops, if he96was intending to visit the temple ofZeus.97Even more valuable is the fact that this passage also informs usabout a similar hierarchy between god and hero in Pergamon. Butthe regulation from Asia Minor concerns bathing, and not sacriWce.So the reader is probably to assume that both rules, that from Elis96The weak pronoun\bƒcan also be used of a woman, but see the noteworthyexpressionI\f\u000bæd N\u000bØ!\u0012fi\u0019in the same passage.97An excellent study on the relation between heroic and divine shrines, alsoexpressed in architecture, is Kearns (1989).Greek Animal SacriWce73"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"and that from Pergamon, concern purity: meat coming from anheroic sacriWce constituted an impure element in the sanctity of agod’s temple.Elis I, XIII.2–3App. II (13)Right down to the present day the magistrates of the year sacriWce to him (sc.Pelops), and the victim is a black ram. No portion of this sacriWce goes to thesoothsayer, only the neck of the ram it is usual to give to the ‘woodman’, ashe is called. The woodman is one of the servants of Zeus, and the taskassigned to him is to supply cities and private individuals with wood forsacriWces at aWxed rate, wood of the white poplar, but of no other tree, beingallowed. If anybody, whether Elean or stranger, eats of the meat of the victimsacriWced to Pelops, he may not enter the temple of Zeus. The same ruleapplies to those who sacriWce to Telephus at Pergamus on the river Caı ̈cus;these too may not go up to the temple of Asclepius before they have bathed.(Loeb tr.)The text of Pausanias provides us with many other passages relat-ing to the act of sacriWce, both animal and non-animal, which provethat he consistently paid attention to local religious traditions.98But how did Pausanias acquire the information needed, when hewanted to describe cultic acts around Greece? It is almost certainthat the inhabitants of the places which Pausanias visited informedhim about local traditions, either myths or cults. And it is impressivethat, even after a city ceased to exist, its sacred tradition could bepreserved in the memories of its experts. This was the case with thecultic centre of Andania, which lay in ruins when Pausanias visitedthe place (Messenia, XXXIII.6): Pausanias could still meet experts inthe traditions of Andania, the so-calledK\u0017\u0019ª\u0019\u0012Æ\u0004,99and ask them forinformation on the name of the city. And we have already seen anexample of preservation of contemporary (not lost) tradition in the98Further descriptions of sacriWce by Pausanias:Corinth, X.5 (plant burnt with thevictim), XI.4 (pregnant victims oVered with libation containing honey), XXVI.9(Cyreneans: goats to Asklepios/Epidaurians: no goats to Asklepios);Laconia, XIV.9(dogs sacriWced), XX.4 (horses sacriWced);Arcadia, XXXVII.8 (all animal speciessacriWced, special way of slaughter), XXXVIII.8 (‘on the spot’ restriction);Boeotia,III.5–8 (xoanaburnt with the victims), XII.1 (sacriWce of the labour-ox—aition),XIX.7 (all animal species sacriWced—aition);Phocis, IV.10 (‘chthonian’ rite),XXXII.14–17 (description of the festival of Isis).99On the groups of theexegetai, see Garland (1984), 114–15; Bloch (1953); Oliver(1950), 24–52, 122V.; Jacoby (1949), ch. 1.74Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"passage on the Olympic oath; in this, Pausanias admits that he forgotto ask about a speciWc ritual detail (\bPŒ K\t\f\u0019\t\u000f\f\rı\u0003Æ K\u0007\ræ\u0015\u0003ŁÆØ,ElisI, XXIV.10). The reference by Pausanias to the action of questioningpresupposes that he expected locals to know the cultic traditions ofthe place.On the other hand, the fact that the locals could give informationabout ritual details suggests that these were well inscribed on people’sminds, and did not result from a superWcial archaism externallyimposed.Consequently, the text of Pausanias proves that, well into the secondcentury, animal sacriWce continued to be practised even in the mostremote places, as a result of the religious needs of the inhabitants.Independently of the longevity of communities, the ritual of animalsacriWce continued to incorporate many variations: in the animalspecies used in sacriWce, in the method of slaughter, in the form ofconsumption of sacriWcial meat. We have to bear in mind that, how-ever empirical these details sound to the modern reader, they wereessential to Greek religion: by forgetting or underplaying them, we arein danger of explaining sacriWce without taking full account of what‘sacriWce’ actually was. Since all these details depended on the trad-itional local character of the recipients, animal sacriWce might be agood means of illustrating the proposition that ‘Greek paganism’ is aterm for a whole set of practices diVering from place to place.iii. The Prominent Individual and the Community:SacriWcial Cult in the CitiesSo far, vitality and variety in sacriWcial practice have been assumed tocharacterize the whole of our period, even if one main literary sourceproving it, namely Pausanias, belongs to the second century. Epi-graphic sources also attest to this vitality, but in the present sectionI use them speciWcally as evidence for the omnipresence of animalsacriWce in the Greek ritual dialogue between community and indi-vidual. In this dialogue, animal sacriWce was a standard means ofcommunication. The present section is dedicated to the positiveaspect of the ritual dialogue through sacriWce, whereas section B.ivbelow treats the problematic aspect of it.Greek Animal SacriWce75"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The importance of animal sacriWce in the exchange of honours(and food) between community and individual is probably thereason why the majority of epigraphic references to animal sacriWcein this period comes from civic decrees, dedications, and commem-orative inscriptions, by whichGreek cities bestowed honourson indi-viduals, but also from inscriptions commemoratingprivate donationsmade by individuals to the community. In these inscriptions, sacriWcecan be found in two contexts: the individual oVered sacriWces or paidfor them, or included animal sacriWce in the conditions of his/herdonation (below iii.a); animal sacriWce is associated with the hon-ours bestowed on an individual (below iii.b).These contexts of animal sacriWce will make it obvious that animalsacriWce, or the honour of participating in it, or the gift of a sacriWcialvictim, are elements of a code of interaction between city andindividual. Of course, I should specify that my designation of theindividuals honoured as ‘prominent’, either donors or honorands, isrelative: prominence might not have been objectively recognized bythe city, but sought by family members of the deceased.100Or,prominence might have been so limited that the reasons for it werenever recorded.101Or, the name of the prominent citizen might neverbe known to us because of fragmentary evidence.102Bearing this inmind, for reasons of clarity I now present cases where the evidence isnot characterized by such limitations.iii.a.SacriWcebya prominent individualThe epigraphic texts of this section illuminate the fact that the oVeringof a sacriWce was considered an honourable act on the part of a citizen,something which was acknowledged by the city by means of a decree.Thus, in a decree from Delphi (SIG3734—App. II (14)), dating to 94bc, the city of Delphi honours the Athenian Ammonius with a crown.100As is probably the case with Philonides of Synnada (2nd c.bc), where we do nothave any mention of sacriWces, but the number of honours bestowed is disproportionateto his ‘prominence’. SeeBCH7 (1883), 300, no. 24.101See the simple epitaph of a citizen honoured withenhagismos(c.100bc):SEGXVI.418.102On the same stone as that of Philonides (see n. 100), another citizen washonoured with a statuesynbo ̄[mo]nto the city(?).

At home, they would probably not always eatmeat coming from a sacriWce. But, in the religious environment of thetemple or the city, meat-eating depended on sacriWce, and sacriWce wasan important part of the ceremony.

Both forms of praise are common amongthe inscriptions from Panamara, and probably not unexpected.The priestly couple of our inscription refused their sacriWcialperquisites (IStrat. 202—App. II (15)).

I have preferred to keep the term ‘foundations’ only for donations related tothe cult of the dead.120An analogous example isIEphesos859A, but the inscription is very fragmen-tary.

So, just asthe editor has remarked, the contributions for sacriWce are not listedby the founder himself, but they are a further arrangement made bythe city.130(What is not clear in the description above is whether thearrangement regarding the contribution of victims applies to bothsacriWces, on the twelfth andWfteenth days of Artemisios.131) TheTermessians of Oenoanda express their gratitude not by means of asimple honoriWc dedication (or a statue), but by materially contrib-uting to the expenses of the ritual. Here, sacriWce is a gift both to thecity, and by the city. The city’s largesse is also made obvious in theregulations forbidding taxation, either on the sacriWces themselves oron otherWnancial transactions on the festival days.The text from Oenoanda is, thus, representative of the interactionbetween city and individual. Indeed, it helps us to link the twomechanisms I describe in this section:129‘the 12th, a sacriWce for ancestral Apollo;’ (v. 42). Also: ‘the 15th, the secondsacriWce for ancestral Apollo;’ (v. 43), (tr.

In any case, this sacriWcial obliga-tion imposed on the villages will concern us in the next section (B.iv).In the description above, at least twenty-seven bulls weresacriWced,134thirteen on behalf of the city oYcials, and fourteen onbehalf of thechoraof Oenoanda, apart from those contributed byother cities. Such a great number of animals was undoubtedly themain source of meat for the feast which followed.135However, I haveoften stressed in the course of this study that the aspect of ritual initself should not be underplayed. TheWrst impression created by aritual celebration, and shared by the worshippers, is visual. At thesame time, since ostentatiousness went along with aneuergesia,spectacle was the best way for aneuergetesto attract attention. So,the organizers of religious festivals invested a lot in the visual aspect:a sacriWcial procession, with all the civic and priestly authoritiesparticipating in hierarchical order, and the garlanded sacriWcial vic-tims led along, was an imposingly magniWcent spectacle. So much soindeed, that the much expected sacriWce (because of the feast whichfollowed) could often be delayed in favour of the procession.136132On this point, see [Wo ̈rrle], 151V.133Ibid. 256.134We cannot be sure about the exact number of victims because of the need forrestorations.135See [Wo ̈rrle], 254–5.136That is why a sacred law from Astypalaia puts a limit to the period of delay. Thelaw (LSS83) dates to the 2nd or 1st c.bc. See also the comments on sacriWcialprocessions made by Robert inHellenicaXI–XII, 120–3.

More speciWcally, Robertdiscovered that an oracle, engraved on the wall of Oenoanda in thesecond centuryad, can be attributed to Apollo’s oracle at Claros.137This Clarian text copied in Oenoanda declares Ether as the appropriategod, and recommends the prayer to him as the appropriate ritual. Itdoes not require animal sacriWces. This text was taken by Robert asrepresenting a movement ‘vers le monothe ́ı ̈sme’,138where the pureritual ofprayerwas to replace animal and non-animal oVerings,139and which was brought from the oracle of Claros as a means ofconciliation between pagans and Christians in Oenoanda.140Inde-pendently of whether Robert’s hypothesis is sustainable in its context,in the donation of Demosthenes the strong religious identity of paganlocals is displayed in the long description of the sacriWcial processionwithout the inclusion of any hint at conXicts between pagans andChristians in the area.To sum up, when a Greek wanted to seek prominence, he saw to itthat his public image would beWrst that of ‘pious man’, and then that of‘generous man’. ‘Piety’ means being in accordance with the religiousidentity of a city, and so with its gods and festivals. A sacriWce to thegods of the city was both a proof of such piety, and an occasion to regalethe city’s inhabitants by means of a\rP\ræª\r\u0003\u0004Æ.Whenacitizenrespectedboth the religious and the communal character of a festival, the city wasalways willing to acknowledge it, as we shall see next.iii.b.SacriWcetoa prominent individual,andsacriWcial meatgiven toa prominent individualThe focus of this section is not on civic sacriWces subsidized by anindividual, but on civic sacriWces oVered by the cityforor, usually,toan individual.137Robert (1971b)OMSv. 617–39.

Actually, Artemidorus is among the Roman citizens namedCaii Iuliiwhose case was studied by Robert: basing themselves on theirfriendship with the Roman authorities of the Late Republic, these citizenshad helped their city in politically hard times, and that is why theywere given great honours, among which are found burial in thegymna-sion,and,occasionally,asacriWcial cult.141These were individual cults,and as such they are explained in the context of the cultic shift occurringin theWrst centurybc, when the collective cult of benefactors wassuperseded by the cult of individuals (which was soon to be supersededby the divine cult of the emperor).142Scholars usually assume that, fromthe reign of Augustus onwards, such individuals were mostly oVered‘chthonian’ (or else ‘heroic’) and not divine sacriWces.143In anycase,sacriWcialhonours for individualcitizenswere acommoncharacteristic of the period before or during the reign of Augustus.144141See Robert,OMSVI, 42–7,EA49–50,HellenicaVIII, 95–96.142Price (1984b), 47–52.143Thus ibid. 49–51. There is no hint that such prominent citizens would behonoured with other than animal sacriWces. My discussion of thegymnasionbelowcontains explicit evidence for animal sacriWces.144Divine sacriWces to Barcaeus of Cyrene (16/15bc:SEGIX.4) are the lastdivine sacrifices offered to individuals, along with the divine sacrifices to Artemidorus.Greek Animal SacriWce87"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Even Roman oYcials were not debarred from sacriWcial honours on thepart of Greeks.145Here, I would like to dwell for a moment on the relation of theGreek citizens honoured to the space of thegymnasion. Presumably,since prominent individuals of theWrst centurybcwere buried in thegymnasion, one would think that the sacriWces decreed in theirhonour took place there too. However, thegymnasionmight nothave been the exclusive place where such individuals were hon-oured,146since the ceremonial duties assigned to theepheboiof agymnasioncovered the whole city-space.The rituals performed by theepheboiwere incorporated in civicreligious life,147and this is illustrated in an honoriWc inscription fromAthens (SIG3717, 100/99bc): in it, theepheboiwere honouredbecause of the proper performance of their cultic duties.

They even sailed to Mounichia and Salamis inorder to oVer sacriWces. One can see that all the aforementionedsacriWces are performed during festivals of the city, and not just inthe framework of thegymnasion. Furthermore, the many references tobullsassacriWcial victims in this inscription imply that these sacriWceswere followed by lavish feasts shared by all citizens.The divine sacriWces to Diodoros Pasparos have only been recently placed in the contextof the Mithridatic Wars, so in the 1st c.bc, by Jones (1974), esp. 197–8, and, morerecently, Jones (2000). This dating is also adopted by S. Price, who gives a very goodsummary of the honours to Diodoros. See Price (1984b), 48.145See Price (1984a), 51. For the proconsul Munatius Plancus, there is only Robert’sprovisional statement inHellenicaVIII, 84.146In the same way, there is no need to suppose that the inscriptions honouringprominent individuals were placed near agymnasion, as was supposed for examplein the case of Artemidorus. See the comment on vv. 9–11 of the inscription inIKnidos,p.50.147Robert talked of thegymnasionas a ‘new agora’, but unfortunately this importantremark is restricted to a promise made in a footnote:OMSVI, 46 and n. 7 on the samepage. The whole of this footnote is dedicated to the revision of some cases in Delorme(1960); as Robert proves, in all these cases Delorme misleadingly linked the specialhonours of benefactors to their relation with thegymnasion.Lackofinsistenceonthewider role of thegymnasionwithin Greek civic religion also characterizes the book byGauthier (1985).88Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Among the sacriWces performed by the Athenianepheboiof thisinscription were those oVered to civic benefactors.148We are not toldwhere these sacriWces took place, but the clear reference to thecosme ̄te ̄sand thedidaskaloimakes thegymnasionthe most probableplace; on the basis of this inscription, one could similarly presumethat sacriWces to prominent individuals of theWrst centurybc,studied in this section, took place in thegymnasiontoo.This presumption is not unreasonable. However, given the role oftheepheboiin the religious life of a Greek city, as described above,other civic areas might equally well come to mind instead of, or alongwith, thegymnasion. The cult of prominent people was decreed bythe city, and the honours oVered to them expressed the city’s grati-tude, so these sacriWces must have had a broader impact than justchanging the rituals in thegymnasia. The whole civic space would beopen to accommodate the ritual of the benefactors. The celebrationwas for the whole city, and not just for theepheboi.

Only in this way can we explain the factthat diVerent aspects of it are present in the honours conferred bycities to individuals: the act of oVering could be a means to worship aprominent person; the honorand’s participation in the sacriWcialceremony was an honour given by the city, a living victim was aspecial gift to the honorand, and even the meat from the slaughteredvictim was a sign of the city’s gratitude to him/her.To sum up this section on animal sacriWce at the level of interactionbetween city and individual: I would not totally deny that in the period100bc–ad200 the individual is more prominent in inscriptions thanwas the case earlier. Inscriptions usually calledleges sacraeare not soprominent epigraphically, and one notices instead an augmentation ofinscriptions recording honorary decrees passed by cities, and donationsmade by individuals; religious issues do appear in these, indeed manyrelated to animal sacriWce, which is our subject here, but only as abackground against which the individual stands out. Despite thischange in the character of epigraphic documents, I do not suggest156The designation follows Robert (1966), 38.Greek Animal SacriWce91"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"that religious feeling in itself changed. It is rather that, in this period,diVerent aspects of it were made public. The individual becamemore conspicuous, but not to the detriment of his city: traditionalgods and rituals were preserved, celebrations involved the whole civicspace, but now people were explicitly named in texts; not only thedonors, but all the inhabitants of a city, or all the villages around a city.Though the attestation of speciWc movements towards a non-sacrificialmonotheism within the Greek culture of this period cannot bedenied,157the evidence for the increased role of individuals in contri-buting to local sacriWcial cults suggests that civic religion had room forfurther enrichment.iv. Occasions on Which SacriWce on the Part of theIndividuals Was Seen as an Externally Imposed Obligationor as a Personal DutyKeeping to the context of ritual dialogue between community andindividual, here I present the opposite pole of the harmoniousvitality of animal sacriWce presented in section iii: here, animalsacriWce could become a contentious activity, in the case wheresome members of the community, such as recent converts to Chris-tianity, abstained from it, or in the case where some recent convertswere puzzled as to how they could express their need for communi-cation with the divine element if not by a sacriWce.Here I will,Wrst, deal with sacriWces whose oVering was an exter-nally imposed obligation, either because a relevant item of legislationso ordained, or because a sacriWce was conventionally expected to beoVered on important occasions in private life. In this respect, epi-graphic evidence proves to be especially illuminating. I will, second,present evidence for the fact that animal sacriWce could be a personalneed felt by the pagan worshipper, a duty which was imposed onhim/her only by his or her conscience.The question whetherallthe sacriWces with which we are concernedhere, and which are denoted byŁı\u0003\u0004Æ, are animal or not can beleft aside for the moment, because what is of interest is rather the157See Mitchell (1999).92Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"mechanisms of political and social obligation to participation insacriWce.Animal sacriWce as an obligation oYcially imposed by the city onprivate individuals was a Coan peculiarity par excellence, as Coanepigraphic texts attest:158one (perhaps the most famous) amongthese contains a long list of groups charged with sacriWcial obliga-tions (LGS168); it dates to theWrst centurybc, and the groups aredesignated on the basis ofWnancial terminology. Thus, theWrst halfof the inscription obliges various leaseholders of public revenues,including cult revenues, to oVer sacriWces.

A further characteristic of the second half of the inscrip-tion is that it speciWes the type and price of the victims required.159Here are two passages from this inscription:(a)LGS168, vv. 9–13App. II (21)and let the purchasers of the income of public tuna-traps160sacriWce, andpitch a tent; and let also the leaseholder of the other tuna-trap, which is onthe Nautileon, sacriWce and pitch a tent; and let the purchaser of the incomeof the Mousai161sacriWce, and pitch a tent on the same terms; and on thesame terms let the purchaser of the income of the Aphrodeision (sic)162sacriWce, and pitch a tent; . . .

In some cases, instead of a sacriWce a sum could be paid to therelevant priest(ess), equivalent to the value of the perquisites given to the priest ifthe sacriWce had been made. See the Coan regulation dated around 125bcin ibid.(the commentary on pp. 432V., esp. p. 436 on v. 8).159For a detailed commentary of the inscription, see ToepVer (1891).160I follow the interpretation of\u0003Œ\b\u0007\u0006given by ToepVer (1891), 423–6. See alsoRobert,HellenicaIX, 96, n. 2.161According to ToepVer (1891), 426–7, this must either designate a priesthood oftheMousai, or the leasing of taxes for the public sacriWces oVered to them.162Again, ToepVer (ibid. 427) thinks of a leasing concerning either publicsacriWces or a temple income.Greek Animal SacriWce93"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"inhabitants.163More pragmatic explanations integrate this law, and itsother Coan parallels requiring obligatory sacriWces, in the state policyof increasing public religious income and promoting Coan religion.164Apart from the strengthening of local identity, which we cannotdeny in this type of regulation, diVerent reasons seem to haveinspired the three prominent local legislators of the inscriptionfrom Dereko ̈y, which dates toad138,165and also concerns an oYcialobligation of sacriWce. The Lycian document stipulates a partialreform of the cult of Lycian Zeus, mainly as regards the contributionsof the inhabitants to the common sacriWce. A long section of thedocument (BI.1 to BII.22) lists the contributions (\u0003ı\t\u0013\bºÆ\u0004) made bythe villages (\u000eøæ\u0004Æ) of each of theWve regions (›\t\bıæ\u0004ÆØ). Each villagecontributes a diVerent amount, but each region is required to pay fora total of 20\u0003ı\t\u0013\bºÆ\u0004, so the fair distribution of the total of 100\u0003ı\t\u0013\bºÆ\u0004must have been the aim of the reformation,166as is impliedby the comment which follows the list of contributions:[Dereko ̈y] vv. BII.23–36App. II (23)Because there are some sacriWces requiring more expenses, and it is fair thatall the regions should play an equal part both in the expenditure of thesacriWces and in the care for them, we considered it reasonable that (only)then should the same region oVer again the same sacriWce, when all theregions have oVered all the sacriWces in turn, and so that this endures and ismade clear, (namely) that everyWve years the same region has to oVer thesame sacriWce, the priest of Zeus on the summit, after all sacriWces falling inthe period of his priesthood have been oVered, shall declare by publicdocuments in the month Panemos which sacriWces were oVered by eachregion.

In order for the cityto extract theWnes more easily, the names of those who did notparticipate would be made public. These issues were under thepersonal care of theagonothetes[Wo ̈rrle], vv. 80–5).A similar punishment is illustrated in another document, namelythe long Ephesian inscription on the donation of Vibius Salutaris(IEphesos27,ad104). Among the terms of the donation was theoVering of natal sacriWces (apparently animal) to Artemis, by menappointed by lot for this issue. The redactor of the inscriptionspeciWes that, if those to whom the sacriWcial duty has been allottedfail to carry out what they are obliged to, they will owe Artemis aWneof 5 denarii each (vv. 492–4, 528–31).More evidence for obligatory sacriWces imposed by the authoritiescomes from literary texts. To contextualize the latter sort of evidence,it is worth mentioning a passage from Plutarch’sLifeof Aratus(Aratus45.1–2), concerning the sacriWcial honours paid to Antigo-nus Doson (Łı\u0003\u0004Æ\u0010...%\f\u0012Øª\u000f\ffiø \u0003ı\f\r\u0012\u0015º\bı\f). These were fostered byAratus, whose policy was criticized by the anti-Macedonian Pelo-ponnesians. In this passage Plutarch is rather supportive and non-critical: he presents Aratus as being in a position not allowing him tooppose Antigonus Doson (ibid. 45.2–3).The sacriWces to Antigonus did not survive up to Plutarch’s time.But the passage makes it obvious that in the Greek world sacriWcecould be suddenly introduced to the already existing traditionalcalendar as a result of decisions made by leaders or for leaders; itcan be taken that Plutarch’s readers would understand this.The following event took place in 43bc, and it is similar to thatreferred to by Plutarch, in that it concerns a sacriWce ordered by aleader. Appian records an order of the triumvir Lepidus, whichresembles the decrees later issued by Roman emperors:Appian,De bello civili4.5.31App. II (24)While these events were taking place Lepidus enjoyed a triumph for hisexploits in Spain, and an edict was displayed in the following terms: ‘MayFortune favour us. Let it be proclaimed to all men and women that theyshould celebrate this day with sacriWces and feasting. Whoever shall fail todo so shall be put on the list of the proscribed.’ Lepidus led the triumphalprocession to the Capitol, accompanied by all the citizens, who showed theexternal appearance of joy, but were sad at heart. (Loeb tr.)Greek Animal SacriWce95"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Appian does not say anything about the geographical area to whichLepidus’ order was meant to be applied; however, from the referenceto popular participation in the triumph, it seems that all the inhab-itants of Rome were implicitly meant to conform.The cases of sacriWces introduced by Aratus and Lepidus showthat, at times, a Greek or a Roman leader could oblige all theinhabitants of an area to follow his whims. Failing to do so couldhave consequences for their lives,Wnances, and, possibly, for theirreputation among fellow citizens.Another context of literary evidence where obligatory sacriWces areinserted concerns ‘customary’, not oYcially imposed, sacriWces. Suchis the case of sacriWces performed in the frame of athletic competi-tions. All ancient games were performed in connection with theshrine of a god or goddess; the Olympic Games were connected toZeus and Hera. To participate in them was to accept the religiousidentity of the Elean grove, and to comply with the cults of the area.Thus, before the games began, an oath-sacriWce was oVered to ZeusHorkios in thebouleuterion, not only by male athletes, but also bytheir fathers, brothers, and trainers (Paus.Elis I, XXIV.9).167Beforeeach athletic competition it seems that the relevant participantsoVered a sacriWce, as the following passage implies:168Paus.Elis I, IX.3 App. II (25)The order of the games in our own day, which places the sacriWces to the godfor the pentathlum and chariot-races second, and those for the othercompetitionsWrst, wasWxed at the seventy-seventh Festival. (Loeb tr.)Those girls and women who won in the foot-games in honour of Herawere given portions of the cow sacriWced to the goddess (Elis I,XVI.2–3).A further category of ‘customary’, that is, conventionally oVered,sacriWces concerned important occasions in private life, for examplemarriage.169Plutarch inserts an item of information about nuptial167The examiners of the participants took an oath too (Elis I, XXIV.10), but it isnot clear whether a sacriWce was also involved. His wondering about the boar is nothelpful in this respect because it refers to ‘the oath of athletes’ (ibid.).168In this passage, as the following lines also show, a change through time is notedby Pausanias, but it concerns onlythe order in which sacriWces were oVered.169With the exception of Cos, where sacriWces related to weddings were requiredby the state: Segre ́, ED 89, vv. 1–2, dated by Segre ́in the 1st c.bc, where a sacriWce isoYcially required from those married in the shrine of Nike.96Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"sacriWces in his description of the cults at Plataia (Aristides20.6): ineveryagora, he says, there is an altar of Artemis Eukleia and a statuein her honour, where brides and bridegrooms (mentioned in thisorder!) oVer sacriWces before marriage.170It seems that such a maritalsacriWce could be accompanied by symbolic gestures, as in the case ofthe marital sacriWce to Hera: the couple used to drop the gall bladderof the victim from the altar. This meant the expulsion of bitterness oranger from the marriage (Plut.Mor. 141E–F).A Greek wedding was not only preceded by, but also consisted in,asacriWcial oVering. In this case, sacriWce would be oVered in theframework of a ceremony, a sort of a party in which a number offriends participated; the god who was oVered the sacriWce was alsoregarded as being present and well disposed at the event (Plut.Amator-ius771D–E).SacriWce could also be oVered by women before their secondmarriage, or even by the mothers of the future brides.

(Loeb tr.)172Finally, conventional sacriWces were not only connected to the birth–marriage–death cycle of life, but also to crucial moments in life.SacriWces of this kind were oVered, for instance, by those acquittedin the Areopagus.173So far we have examined cases where political or social conventionobliged the worshipper to oVer a sacriWce. But along with these, thereare cases where the worshipper himself or herself felt the need to oVera sacriWce, in an attempt to approach the gods after a personal crisis.In some of theLivesof Plutarch, sacriWce is connected to the decisivemoment before death. Even if earlier than the period under study, thefact that the following evidence is cited by Plutarch means that heexpected his readers toWnd common elements between his narrationand their experiences: Lycurgus oVered a sacriWce to the Delphic godas an act of piety before his voluntary death (Lycurgus29.4). Similarly,Themistocles oVered a sacriWce before his suicide.

(Loeb tr.)Here, the sacriWce is not imposed upon the woman because of anysocial custom or rule, but is a personal necessity.The examples above are particularly indicative of two things:Wrst,the inXuence that the society of the city or the village could exert onan individual; thus, for instance, a bride’s absence from the localshrine, where she was supposed to oVer a sacriWce with her friends,would have immediately been noticed and condemned. Second, theproblems which could potentially arise in the minds of some GentileChristian converts, when the latter, having been used to express their(pagan) religious needs by means of a sacriWce, would have diYcultyin being accustomed to new ways of (Christian) religious expression.Potentially, then, non-compliance with local cults or with someone’sold religious practices could constitute the ground for disputes betweenpagan and Christian members of the pagan community, or the reasonfor cultic puzzles within early groups of Gentile converts to Christianity.A few comments are needed to sum up the evidence considered inthis section (iv). J. B. Rives, studying the importance of the edict ofDecius on sacriWce,174makes the following remark:The Greek tradition tended to involve a higher175level of participation on thepart of its citizens, but more as representatives of the citizen body than asindividuals; groups representing various population groups were particularly174Rives (1999); the quotation is from pp. 145–6.175(sc.) ‘than in the Roman context’.Greek Animal SacriWce99"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"common in religious processions. But although the mass of citizens often tookpart in civic festivals, cult regulations generally neither stipulate nor evenmention their participation. In both the Greek and the Roman traditions,then, public religion was primarily a collective phenomenon, in which theparticipation of individual citizens was traditional but not essential.In the light of the evidence examined, which, except for Lepidus’decree, concerns the Greek world, it seems that Rives’ point is notentirely valid. The Coan inscription in particular seems to underminehis position, because it is precisely an example of a state imposing acertain cultic act, possibly for reasons of uniWcation (the two Lycianincriptions seem rather more concerned withWnancial issues). Fur-thermore, one should not think that traditional cult was not marked byobligation; it comprised a sort of social expectation or personal needfor participation, which ended up being felt as a duty. So, the pointsmade in the passage from Rives’ article need some modiWcation:(a) ‘Participation of groups’ is a notion which can easily be used bythe historian; one should not forget, however, that a groupconsists of smaller units, and that these units are deWned byinternal relations between individuals. Thus, for instance, theneighbourhoods of a Greek city would participate in the cityfestival as groups, but, in each neighbourhood, the participationor not of a family176in the feast would be quite a noteworthyissue for discussion. So, to the historian, the participants in acult might look like a ‘mass’ of citizens, but in fact, the ‘mass’itself consisted of mutually related individuals.(b) Cult regulations do mention the participation of individuals,and make it obligatory by the imposition ofWnes, and even the176I use the term ‘family’ to designate both ‘individual’ and ‘household’; Rives(1999) uses the term ‘individual’ to cover both (p. 145, n. 59).177For a further example of obligatory participation, this time concerning theprocession, seeLSS61 (donation in Aigiale), vv. 45–9:\u0007\b\t\u0007\rı\u0015\u0012ø\u0003Æ\f \u000bb \u0012e\f \u0013\bF\f KŒ\u0012\bF \u0007æı\u0012Æ\f\r\u0004\bı½\bƒ\u0002\u0007_æ_ı_\u0012½\u0006\f\rØ\u0002\u0010 ŒÆd½›\u0002ªı\t\fÆ\u0003\u0004Ææ\u000e\b\u0010½Œ\u0002Æd \bƒ \u0018\u0005\u0019\u0013\bØ;IŒ\bº\bıŁ\r\u0004\u0012ø\u0003Æ\f\u000bb ŒÆd \bƒ \f\r!\u0012\ræ\bØ \u0007\u0006\f\u0012\r\u0010;\rN \u000bb \t;\u0012\bf\u0010 \tc IŒ\bº\bıŁ\bF\f\u0012Æ\u0010 K\u0007Æ\fÆªŒ½Æ\u0002\u0011\u0015\u0012ø½›\u0002ªı\t½\fÆ\u0002\u0003\u0004Ææ\u000e\b\u0010 \u0012æ\u000f\u0007øØ ‹\u0012øØ i\f \u000b\u0002\ffi\u0019½\u0012\u0002ÆØ·(One does not need a lot of imaginationto think of possible ways in which children would be called to discipline!)178Commenting on the Roman context, Rives (1999) says: ‘. . . while many factorsencouraged popular involvement, nothing suggests that it was mandatory’ (p. 145).100Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"publication of the deviants’ names.177The same could possiblyhave been the case in the Roman context (Lepidus’ order).178(c) ‘Traditional but not essential’ are two terms not mutuallyexclusive. Individual participation in public religionwas es-sential. First, because ‘traditional’ implies the notion of ex-pectations as to what was normal. And these expectationsgenerate a sort of obligation. Second, and more importantly,the smallest unit of the group, namely the individual, wouldgive a ‘traditional’ form of expression to a personal need, byoVering a sacriWce. So this was a further sort of obligation, notimposed by the city upon an individual, but by the conscienceof an individual upon himself/herself.In fact, our last example, concerning Plutarch’s mother, makesobvious that, what might seem a mere group of worshippers to themodern researcher was in fact a polymorphous assemblage consist-ing of people having diVerent needs and reasons to participate in afestival. We should keep this in mind when studying the notion of‘collective’ in Greek religion; participation in a public Greek ritualcould acquire a personal character, since some people might havedeWned their participation in festivals on the basis of their personalneeds and not at all on the basis of their relation to a city. Even if thiswoman would externally have seemed to participate in the festival ofthe god Eros just to share the joy of the feast, in fact she knew that shehad joined the group of participants for a personal reason, aninternal demand which could not be obvious to fellow worship-pers—let alone the modern student of Greek religion, if it were notfor Plutarch. The case of Plutarch’s mother could be representative ofan important number of cases, since we know that many worshipperswould come from afar only to participate in a religious festival of acity which was not their own (see n. 90).Compliance or non-compliance with Greek sacriWcial rules, cus-toms, or personal habits must have been among the most prominent179This is also pointed out by Mitchell (1993), vol. 1, mainly with reference to thedominating ruler cult: ‘it was not a change of heart that might win a Christian convertback to paganism, but the overwhelming pressure to conform imposed by theinstitutions of his city and the activities of his neighbours’ (p. 10). One could add:and also imposed by his tendency to worship in the way he had been used to do for years.Greek Animal SacriWce101"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"instances of the importance which individual religious choices had forthe city.179Apart from the large-scale prosecutions taking place duringlocal or general persecutions of Christians, speciWc cases of Christiannon-compliance, either with community rules or with personal pagan‘ancient habits’, are not attested. The case of the Corinthians implied inthe ICor. concerned Christian conformity with the sacriWcial feastsin honour of pagan gods, and not a puzzle about whether a sacriWcialfeast could take place within the Christian community. Even so,I suggest that it is entirely valid for historians to attempt to imaginethe signiWcance of individual compliance or diVerentiation in theframework of a local pagan community, or within a group of Gentileconverts to Christianity.CONCLUSIONBearing in mind the model analysed in section 2 of Chapter 1, wecould say that theverticalline of the Greek sacriWcial system, the onewhich comprises all sorts of wishes and beliefs which the oVerers ofsacriWce have in relation to the recipient of sacriWce, remainedunchanged. The reason for this is stated in the passage from Dionys-ius (Ant. Rom. 7.70.3), where the author attributes the religiousconservatism of the Greeks to their fear of divine wrath. So, sincethe vertical line of Greek sacriWcial system remained the same, it isnatural to expect nothing more than local variations in thehorizontalline. Indeed, this chapter proves this to be the case by a detailed studyof the realms of reality where animal sacriWce played a role: that is,historical conscience, local religious identity, the relation of cities andcitizens, and social relations within the community.More speciWcally, this chapter has been structured with two mainintentions: to show that animal sacriWce was a vital factor of Greekreligious life in the Late Hellenistic and Imperial period (sections B.i–iii);and to highlight speciWc instances where animal sacriWce was an actrequired of the Greek pagan, or felt as a necessity by him/her (sectionB.iv). The one intention has served as a counter-argument to Nilsson,while the other has made more manifest to the reader the potentialproblems that the encounter of pagans and Christians would cause.102Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"In the frame of this chapter’sWrst intention, we have seen thatevidence for animal sacriWce—both literary and epigraphic—aboundsin the second centuryad, but it would be misleading to suppose thatanimal sacriWce was not vivid in previous periods. Apart from the textof Pausanias, even in the earlier texts of Diodorus and Plutarch there isan overall presumption of continuity, both in general and in detail,and the few instances where change is speciWcally referred to are quitemarginal. These authors present several kinds of sacriWces, which tookplace in the mythical or historical past, either by not making commentson the ritual mode used in each case, or by explicitly witnessing theircontinuous performance up to their own times.The text of Pausanias is the most detailed guide to animal sacriWcefor our period. Yet, this author is mainly referred to in modernstudies as an important representative of second-century archaism.Does, then, this archaism cover cases of revival of animal sacriWce insome places around Greece? Though we cannot exclude the notion ofcultic revival altogether, it is necessary to make the following com-ments regarding the continuity of the practice of animal sacriWce inour period of study:(a) In the countryside of mainland Greece animal sacriWce was acrucially diVerentiating factor of religious identity, as the text ofPausanias shows.180It is more reasonable to consider the manylocal varieties, not as a programmed nostalgic return to thepast,181but as resulting from the need of inhabitants to preservetheir religious identity.(b) Since Pausanias does not hesitate to point out a change in cult,as the example from Roman Corinth shows (Corinth, III.6–7),it would be easy for him to point out a renaissance in localcults, if that were the case. Pausanias rather aYrmed thealready existent identity of mainland Greece by stressinglocal religious characteristics.182180The factor of identity has very often been stressed in recent scholarship, eitherfrom the point of view of monumental writing or from the religious point of view. OntheWrst, see Woolf (1996), 32. On the second, see Alcock (1993), 216; Lane Fox(1986), 91–2. Especially on Pausanias’ interest in Greek identity, see Arafat (1996), 10.181Nor could one consider the local varieties as a reaction to decline. Nilsson didso ((19512), 66). See n. 75 above.182See the quotation from Arafat (1996) in n. 33 above.Greek Animal SacriWce103"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"(c) Nor did the several sacriWcial cults described by Pausaniasconstitute empty remnants of the traditional religion in thecountryside. Nowhere does Pausanias present them as the lastrepresentatives of a dying religious tradition. The reader israther to see these cults as genuine samples of a still-livingGreek religion, which was omnipresent,evenin the countryside.In sum, ‘lists’ of cults might have resulted from an archaism fosteredby Hadrian, but the cults themselves were not ‘archaic’. The increasedreligious interest of Pausanias was symptomatic of a similarly in-creased interest in matters religious on the part of second-centuryscholars, and not on the part of worshippers. Despite the decrease inthe population of mainland Greece detected by archaeology, GreeksacriWcial cult remained alive, even if it was not always splendid.183Inother words, lack of material means cannot be regarded as havingbrought about a change in the nature of Greek cult.Having proved that, despite their chronological dispersion, literarytexts of our period demonstrate an implicit sense of continuity,I have used the second-century evidence from Pausanias in order toprove that animal sacriWce continued to be performed by Greeksduring the whole period of this study, even in the smallest commu-nities, even outside the lavish context of civic euergetism. Also,having accepted Pausanias as a meticulous witness to the still-thrivingGreek cults, I have used his text as complementary to the scantyepigraphic examples of ‘sacred laws’ from this period; in fact, I havenoted similarities between the two.It is true that ‘sacred laws’ (inscriptions exclusively dealing withreligious rules) are few in this period, especially if we take intoaccount the augmentation in inscriptions noticed in theWrst andsecond centuriesad—the so-called ‘epigraphic habit’. Leaving asidethe inherent problems which the term ‘epigraphic habit’ involves,184I have shown the term ‘sacred law’ in itself to be relative, sinceevidence for animal sacriWce can be equally well contained in literary183See Alcock (1993). She has shown that the decrease in rural population inmainland Greece in the early Imperial period is partly conWrmed by the evidence, butthis does not mean that the level of religious activity in the countryside was lower.184This failure has already been noted by scholars. See G. Woolf’s attempt at acriticism of the notion ‘epigraphic habit’, in Woolf (1996), 24, 30, 38.104Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"passages resembling ‘sacred laws’, and in inscriptions of honoriWcdecrees and donations, that is, types of texts which are not usuallyclassiWed as ‘sacred laws’. Especially in the case of decrees and dona-tions, it is indeed surprising to see that two diVerent genres ofepigraphic record, namely rules on animal sacriWce, and representa-tions of careers showing theWnancial and social prominence ofRoman citizens, were regarded by Greeks as subjects equally worthrecording. Of course, there are cases, such as that of Oenoanda,where the two kinds of record coexist in a particularly exuberantway: individuals and sacriWcial animals are mentioned in the samedocument, and people and cities acquire prestige because of theirconducting processions of animals. It is the insistence on the epi-graphic attestation of sacriWcial cult which we should rather stress,and not the dwindling number of inscriptions exclusively dealingwith sacriWcial laws (which, in the end, might also be attributed tothe variety of techniques in monumentalization).The vitality of Greek religion was partly owed to individual initia-tives. Thus cities could honour individuals by animal sacriWces or theprovision of sacriWcial victims. Individuals could subsidize civic cultsand festivals, or bequeath money for the performance of a new ritual.Animal sacriWce was of course the core of this two-way process,which rendered the Greek city the centre of a rich cultic life. Againstthe view of Nilsson, who saw the Empire as having devoured theGreek city, our epigraphic evidence shows that the Greek citiescontinued to be living historical entities in the Roman Empire, andcivic religion to be vigorous. In fact, a point of importance which hasarisen in our study is the spatial interaction between the city and thegymnasion: because of its structure as an educational centre, thegymnasioncontributed to the revitalization of the whole religiouslife of the city.In view of all the above, any suggestion of decline in Greek religiouslife in this period (cf. Nilsson’s thesis) is wrongly based on the scanti-ness of epigraphic and literary evidence before the second centuryad.From within the vitality and variety presented, and in the frame ofthe second intention of this chapter, I have focused on the extremecase of non-compliance with the cults of the city or with someone’scustomary need for religious expression, both requiring the oVeringof a sacriWce. The civic obligation could either take the form of anGreek Animal SacriWce105"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"obligation explicitly legislated for by a Greek city, or an expectationtraditionally expected to be fulWlled in the framework of a localcommunity. The personal need could be felt as a duty to communi-cate with god after a crisis in life.Not having evidence for the possible problems stemming from non-compliance, here I have only hinted at them, by collecting as manyspeciWc cases as possible: for instance, in the case of civic or just socialobligations for sacriWce, a bride’s absence from a customary sacriWcialcelebration before the wedding would become conspicuous and, po-tentially, subject to condemnation. In the case of a personal need forapproaching the divine, a Gentile convert to Christianity, who had beenpreviously used to oVer sacriWces to his pagan gods, would feel some-how puzzled before worshipping his new—Christian—god. The puzzleas to what form the approach to god the Christain should take wouldcreate problems within groups of Gentile converts.In Greek religion animal sacriWce did not cease to be the means ofreligious expression even in places far away from the cities, wherearchaism and money could not have played such an important role.The animal remained a unit of exchange between city and individual.This, along with the fact that animal sacriWce had priority over everyother type of sacriWce, demonstrates that the animal was the main signin the codes of thehorizontalline, that is, in the several realms of man’spractical reality. We ought to keep this in mind when approachingother Mediterranean cults. That is why, before passing on to thepreaching of the Christian apologists against sacriWces, it will be usefulto study animal sacriWce in the context of another Mediterraneanreligion in the same period, namely late Second Temple Judaism, inorder to see whether the animal had the same, or a similar, place in thehorizontal line of the Jewish sacriWcial system.106Greek Animal

decree that every year repre-sentatives from all over Greece should gather at Plataia, and that everyWve yearstheagonof the Eleutheria should be celebrated there; also that a force should belevied against the Persians, and that the Plataians should be left inviolable andholy so that theycould sacriWce to Zeus Eleutherios on behalf of Greece

SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"referred to by Aristides in 21.1, and, presumably, celebrated during theEleutheria.1But it is quite obvious that the name ‘Eleutherios’ is absent fromPlutarch’s description of the ritual.The problem is solved if one looks carefully atAristides19.7: there, it issaid that the battle at Plataia took place on the fourth of the monthBoedromion,on whichthe Greeks still (ŒÆd \fF\f \u0018\u0012Ø) gather at Plataia inorder to celebrate the sacriWce to Zeus Eleutherios oVered by the Plataiansfor the victory. However, the ritual described inArist. 21.5 is said to havetaken place every year on the sixteenth of the month Maimakterion.In consequence of all this, Iwould suggest that the ritual described inArist.21.5is that of the oVerings to the dead, and is diVerent from the sacriWce to ZeusEleutherios referred to in 21.1. The prayer to Zeus made by the archon during hisoVerings to the dead should not confuse us, because the archon also summonsHermes Chthonios. If this suggestion is correct, it means that the annual oVeringsto the dead were a further initiative taken by the Plataians, and that this customexisted alongside the sacriWce to Zeus Eleutherios proposed by Aristides andratiWed by the Greeks. The meaning of the first sentence inArist.21.2wouldbe:‘after the ratiWcation of the proposal of Aristides, the Plataians took the furtherinitiative to make annual oVerings to the dead.’ Thus, in Plutarch’s time,twoannual festivals survived: that of Zeus Eleutherios on the fourth of Boedromion,and that of the oVerings to the dead of Plataia on the sixteenth of Maimakterion.The arguments in favour of the existence of two sacriWcial rites are bothinternal and external: Plutarch uses the wordsŁ\u0002ø=Łı\u0003\u0004Æwhen he refers tothe sacriWce to Zeus Eleutherios (19.7, 20.4, 21.1), and the wordK\fÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\fwhen he refers to the oVerings to the dead (21.2). As we have seen in sectionBi of Chapter 2, Plutarch is quite cautious with regard to the sacriWcial termshe uses: he almost always usesK\fÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\fto refer to funeral oVerings (e.g. inthe case of Pyrrhus’ son,Pyrr. 23.1).The gloomy character of theK\fÆªØ\u0003\t\u000f\u0010is obvious in the description givenby Plutarch: the terms used (\u0003\u0005\u0006\u0017Æ\u0010;Æƒ\t\bŒ\bıæ\u0004Æ), the colour of the victim(black), and the deity involved (Hermes Chthonios), all allude to a ritualwith ‘chthonian’ characteristics.2We do not know whether a sacriWcial mealfor the participants followed.The succession of events narrated by PlutarchWts the argument for theexistence of two sacriWces. Thus, inArist. 20 Plutarch describes the procedure1The confusion is evident, for instance, in the description by Burkert (1983), 56–7,who treats ch. 21 inAristidesas a whole; his cross reference to the text of Pausaniasabout the altar of Zeus Eleutherios also proves that he considers the description inPlutarch as related to the cult of Zeus Eleutherios.2The term is used in the sense analysed by Scullion (1994), but see also pp. 35–6above for further characteristics of ‘chthonian’ sacriWces.Greek Animal SacriWce109"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"by which the altar to Zeus was consecrated after the instructions given by theDelphic oracle. The proposal by Aristides at the beginning ofArist. 21 comes asa conclusion to all this procedure: it would be appropriate to celebrate andconsolidate the consecration of the new altar by an annual panhellenic festivalcomprising aŁı\u0003\u0004Æ, and by a pentetericagon. However, the Plataians wanted totake a further step—possibly for reasons of prestige—by caring for the deadthemselves (Arist. 21.2): the Plataians then undertook to make oVerings tothose who fell in battle (K\fÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\f).The internal arguments above might require a rearrangement of chapters.Thus the proposal of Aristides (21.1) should possibly go at the end of ch. 20,so that the description of the ritual following it is left unaVected by anyallusion to the sacriWce to Zeus and becomes the beginning of ch. 21.The external arguments cannot be very helpful, but still they do notcontradict our interpretation: Pausanias (Boeotia, II.5) tells us that therewas a common tomb for the Greeks who fell at Plataia, except for theLacedaemonians and the Athenians, who had separate ones. He mentionsan altar of Zeus Eleutherios, something else (lacunaein the text) made ofbronze, and the fact that the altar of Zeus and his statue were made of whitemarble. In II.6 he gives brief information about theagonof the Eleutheria.In Thucydides (3.58.4) we have the mentioning of clothes, seasonal fruit,andWrst-fruits being oVered to the dead. Surprisingly, no reference to theritual killing of a bull is made. In fact, in Thucydides the account of the ritualis put in the mouth of a Plataian, who uses theWrst person plural to refer toit. As the Plataian is addressing the Spartans, he is using the ritual to arguethat the Plataians are benefactors of the Spartans. This particular characterof the passage in Thucydides corroborates my suggestion that the oVeringsto the dead of Plataia were a purely Plataian initiative.3I would venture to suggest that the Plataians of the Persian War periodtried to exploit ritually their victorious participation in the war so that theywould have a strong political argument in the future.Plutarch’s narrative about the Plataians thus proves to be a very valuablesource of information about the cultic life of his own time. According toPlutarch, two distinct rituals of animal sacriWce were kept unchanged fromtheWfth centurybcdown to the second centuryad. They were bothconnected with the memory of the glorious battle at Plataia, and it is evidentthat their celebration pertained to issues of identity, that of Greece ingeneral, and that of Plataians in particular.3The use ofWrst person plural in Thucydides could suggest that the rite wasperformed without the participation of other Greeks. Nor does Plutarch’s narrative ofthe funerary ritual involve or hint at the presence of other Greeks apart from thePlataians.110Greek Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"APPENDIX

HOW THE CHARACTER OF JEWISH SACRIFICIALWORSHIP DIFFERS FROM THAT OF GREEKSACRIFICIAL WORSHIPWhoever has been used to studying and talking about Greek pagan-ism has great diYculty in accommodating his mode of thinking tothe Jewish religious code. This diYculty stems from the diVerencesbetween the two religious systems. Although in both Greek religionand pre-ad70 Judaism animal sacriWce was the central cultic act, thecontext of sacriWcial performance in mainstream1Judaism had aparticular character, not similar at all to the Greek context.AtWrst, I should make clear to the reader that I do not disagreewith the view expressed in recent scholarship on Judaism, namelythat the Jewish religion incorporated great varieties of belief. How-ever, I should stress two facts. First, my focus in this book is cult, and,more especially, animal sacriWce. With the exception of sectarian Jews(i.e. those in Qumran), Jewish sacriWcial cult could only take place inthe Jerusalem Temple. This does not leave much space for us to admitvariety in sacriWcial practice. Second, in this book I am mainlyusing evidence dating before the Mishnah was created (c.ad200).The mishnaic corpus represents various layers of tradition, so wecannot know whether its rules were actually in force in the Templebefore itsWnal destruction by the Romans inad70 (on whichsee below). Whereas in the next chapter I demonstrate and admitthe variety depicted in the Mishnah, I also stress that its rules cannot1The term is used in the sense of ‘non-sectarian’."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"be safely used as evidence for an applied practice of sacriWcial varietyin the pre-ad70 Temple.2The brief presentation that follows intends to introduce the readerto the special nature of Judaism and the particularities of its sacriWcialcult.To begin with the most evident diVerence, also applying to thewhole of Greek and Jewish culture, Greek religion has left a greatnumber of artefacts and texts, either depicting religious scenes or, atleast, inspired by or dealing with religion. This is not the case inJudaism, where we have no depictions nor is there a kind of ‘epi-graphic habit’. Even in late Judaism (‘late Second Temple period’, as itis called), with which we are concerned in this book, the impact ofHellenization did not result in the adoption of the custom of record-ing religious occasions on stone.Of course, contributory to the lack of any need for recordingJewish celebrations was the simple but fundamental fact that main-stream Judaism had not many sites, but only one, where ritual tookplace according to well-known regulations, namely the Temple inJerusalem. The Temple was founded by King Solomon before themiddle of the tenth centurybc, but it became the central cultic placeof Judaism only after King Josiah’s reform (639–609bc). Aided bythe legendary discovery of the Book of Deuteronomy, Josiah com-pelled all Jews to oVer sacriWces only in the Temple in Jerusalem.3From then on the history of Israel became inextricably linked to thehistory of its Temple—hence the division into the period of Solo-mon’s Temple (the First Temple), and the Second Temple period.All sacriWces described in the Pentateuch were made to the OneGod of Israel. SacriWces to any other recipient were idolatrous and,thus, to be condemned. All the occasions on which a sacriWce shouldbe oVered were ordained in the books of Leviticus, Numbers, andDeuteronomy. These books prescribed both animal and vegetableoVerings, but, in the overall picture of these prescriptions in theirpresent form, animal victims prevail both in number (even if they are2This stance is the opposite of Klawans (2006), 109, who, in his polemical critiqueof the English translation of Schmidt (1994), quite happily cites rabbinic andQumranic evidence in order to prove that the Temple was not as exclusive as one(along with Schmidt) might think.3See de Vaux (19733), 331–9.118From Greek Religion to Judaism"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"accompanied by vegetable oVerings) and importance.4Especiallywith regard to libations, these seem to have been merely accompany-ing elements to animal sacriWces.5In this book, when referring to theterm ‘sacriWce’ I mainly meananimal sacriWce, a convention whichcorresponds to the importance of animal sacriWces in Judaism.According to the Bible, the occasions on which a sacriWce couldbe carried out were either deWned by the calendar and representedthe whole nation, so that on these occasionspublicsacriWces wereoVered; or were individual obligations and resulted in the oVering ofprivatesacriWces.Public Jewish sacriWces were regularly oVered every day and, inaddition, more lavishly during Jewish festivals. The only groupresponsible for the oVering of public sacriWces was the hereditarypriesthood in the Temple. Jewish religious festivities had almost a‘national’ character. Jews who went up to Jerusalem to attend Jewishfestivals had the opportunity to strengthen their links with religioustradition, and to meet each other around the Temple. Unlike theGreek world, where a general invitation could be explicit, and eveninclude Romans (\u0016'ø\tÆE\bØ) and other foreigners (\u0017\u0015\f\bØ), Jewishfestivals were mainly for Jews, and no general invitations were issued,even if foreigners were welcome. The gradation of levels of ‘Jewish-ness’, which dominated the entrance to the Temple, most obviouslyillustrated Jewish religious exclusivity.The individual Jew had no space for initiative during festivals.Biblical regulations on these festivals had the role of ‘sacred laws’deWning the victim and the priestly perquisites. By means of a taxpaid by all Jews in the world, the Temple always had the resources forthe prescribed public oVerings, and these were always holocausts. So,in no case could an individual Jew pay for the festive oVerings, andentertain people, in a way resembling Greekeuergetism. Besides, sincepublic sacriWces were whole-oVerings, that is, holocausts, worship-pers could not consume public oVerings.4Research has recently shown that sacriWcial rules in the Old Testament derivefrom diVerent sources, which reXect diVerent attitudes towards the pre-eminence ornot of vegetable oVerings. See Marx (1994).5In the course of the Table Ronde mentioned in the preface, n. 4, at the promptingof a paper by A. Marx, it came to be generally accepted that in Judaism libations andincense-oVerings were not autonomous oVerings.From Greek Religion to Judaism119"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"If a Jew wanted to participate in a festival in an active way, he/shehad to make the God of Israel an oVering of his/her own. But a Jewcould also visit the Temple and make a private oVering at any time,not necessarily during a festival. Whatever the occasion, individualJewish sacriWces were either a sign of thankfulness, or were made bypeople in a certain physical or moral condition. In contrast to thecase of public oVerings, in this case the rules did not always excludethe consumption of sacriWcial meat.The truth is, however, that there is no explicit evidence for Jewishbanquets related to religious occasions. Since the Jewish Templenever functioned as a place for the display of inscriptions, we cannotknow if there ever were Jews who became prominent because theyentertained people with banquets. It seems that any Jewish banquetswhich followed private sacriWces were given in the framework of anextended family, and could not involve strangers as guests; in thesecases, one sacriWced animal usually represented the whole group.This is conWrmed by Josephus’ testimony for the private feast onthe occasion of Passover: he uses the term\u0005æÆ\u0012æ\u0004Æ, and makes acalculation on the basis of the fact that a Passover victim correspondsto ten people (BJVI.423, 425). Besides, if a kind ofeuergetismwascommon practice among Jews, I suggest that a parable like the one inLuke 14: 15–24 (a host entertaining poor and handicapped strangers)would not have been worth recording.6The aforementioned diVerence between the meaning given to theterm ‘festival’ by a Greek and by a Jew is made obvious in thefollowing Philonic passages. In these we can easily see Philo’s disdainfor Greek religion. As we shall see, Philo was a faithful Jew, and histestimony cannot be regarded as unrepresentative of the way inwhich a Jew saw Greek religion. Philo admits that religious festivals6TheProtevangelium of James(c.ad150) gives a colour of euergetism to the sceneof joy following the announcement of Mary’s birth. On hearing the good news,Joachim says: ‘And bring me twelve [tender] calves, and the twelve calves shall befor the priests and the elders, and a hundred kids, and the hundred kids shall befor thewhole people’ (Hennecke–Schneemelcher (1991), p. 427, my emphasis). See also i. 426:‘. . . Joachim was a very rich (man), and he brought all his gifts for the Lord twofold;for he said in himself: What I bring in excess, shall befor the whole people. . . .’ This‘Hellenization’ of the scene cannot but be misleading for the reader. Besides, theeditor of this apocryphal gospel admits that the author has no knowledge of Jewishcustoms: ibid. 423–4.120From Greek Religion to Judaism"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"are occasions of joy and relaxation, but he is against any sort oftransgression taking place during them. Commenting on the sin-oVering made after festivals (De spec. legibus 1, 190–3), Philo admitsthat a festival is an occasion for joy, but takes the opportunity to talkwith disdain about any behavioural deviations: unmixed wine, com-bined with lots of food, can lead to unrestricted sexual misbehaviour,which uses the festal occasion as an alibi. These excesses concernpagan festivals, for, in contrast, Jewish Law enjoined participation inthe Temple cult, so that, by means of the participation in hymns andsacriWces there, it prevents such phenomena. The whole Jewish ritualmakes worshippers constrain desire.InDe cherubimPhilo dedicates a whole section to the denunci-ation of pagan festivals (90–7). Two passages are worth quotingbecause of the sacriWcial imagery contained in them, which showsthat, at least to a Jew, the main aspect of a Greek festival was thesacriWces oVered during it. TheWrst of the two Philonic passagespresents the sacriWcial victim as oVered in vain because of thedebauchery reigning in the festival:And so long as they conWne their unseemly doings to houses or unconse-crated places, their sin seems less to me. But when their wickedness like arushing torrent spreads over every place and invades and violates the mostsacred temples, it straightway overturns all that is venerable in them, and asa result come sacriWces unholy (Łı\u0003\u0004Æ\u0010 I\fØ\u0015æ\bı\u0010), oVerings unmeet(ƒ\ræ\rEÆ ¼Łı\u0012Æ), vows unfulWlled . . . (De cherubim94, Loeb tr.)The second Philonic passage equates the physical blemish on thevictim to the defect in the pagan worshipper’s soul:And if an animal be found to be blemished or imperfect, it is driven out of theconsecrated precincts and not suVered to approach the altar, though it isthrough no will of its own that it has any of these bodily defects. But theythemselves—their souls are a mass of wounds from the hideous maladies withwhich the irresistible power of vice has smitten them . . . (ibid. 96, Loeb tr.)One can imagine that, even if many people gathered around theJerusalem Temple, its sacred character would deter worshippersfrom misbehaving. What is more, contributory to the lack of trans-gressions during Jewish festivals was the fact that the distribution ofsacriWcial meat was kept ‘under control’, since it was made on a smallFrom Greek Religion to Judaism121"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"scale. So, Philo’s comments bring us back to what we have stressed asregards the diVerence between Greek and Jewish religious festivals: inGreek religion partaking of sacriWcial meat concerned a wide public,even the whole community, whereas in Jewish religion it only con-cerned the companies of the oVerers.7Taking again the main diVerence between Greeks and Jews intoconsideration, namely the insistence of the Greeks onrecording(inwritten, iconographic, or sculpted form), we can go back to ourinitial theoretical approach to sacriWce (see Chapter 1, section 2),and, on the basis of it, outline the diVerences between the Greek andJewish sacriWcial systems.Thus, atWrst sight, what I have called thehorizontalline ofsacriWcial mechanism—that is, the society and the visible realitysurrounding the oVerer—might seem to prevail in the Greek sacriW-cial system. However, if we look more carefully, we can deduce thatour lack of knowledge about theverticalline of Greek sacriWce—theline comprising the wishes and intentions of the oVerer—is whatmakes the latter seem inadequately developed. Whereas we know thatGreek sacriWces were of diVerent types (see e.g. Chapter 2, sectionB.IVon customary sacriWces), the main corpus of evidence which hasreached us concerns sacriWces followed by public feasts in the com-nunity (\rPø\u000e\u0004ÆØ). Thus, although we know that in general terms therelation of the oVerer to the recipient remained the same, we areignorant of the more intimate factors deWning this relation. Theuncertainty of scholars regarding the diVerence betweenŁ\u0002\rØ\fandK\fÆª\u0004\u0011\rØ\fproves this limitation: we do not know with certainty thecriterion for preferring the one instead of the other. In view of thecharacter of the existing evidence, then, a safer conclusion on GreeksacriWce would be that to the modern student of Greek sacriWce thehorizontal line, and mainly the aspect of the worshipper’s relation tothe community, is more manifest than the vertical line.7Apart from the morbid account contained in the passage which I have quotedearlier (the dead at the end of the Jewish War are counted on the basis of how manyJews usually participated in a Passover festival,BJVI.420–7), Josephus never gives afull description of what exactly happened during Jewish festivals. When referring tothe function of sacriWces in Jewish religion, Josephus admits that these were alwaysoVered with a feast (\rPø\u000e\u0004Æ) in view (Ant. III.254). Elsewhere, though, he attributesthis habit to the Greeks (ApionII.138), and says that Jewish people did not oVersacriWces in order to get drunk (ibid. II.195).122From Greek Religion to Judaism"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"In the case of Judaism, however, we shall see that the existence of afew sacred books (the Pentateuch and, later, the Mishnah) contrib-uted to the detailed listing of sacriWcial rules.

However, the three characteristics just mentioned ren-der our knowledge of the horizontal line more limited, apart fromthe information that the Jewish religious mechanism did not allowfor a centrally organized distribution of sacriWcial meat at each of thepublic oVerings. On the other hand, the same sacred books renderthe vertical line of sacriWce in mainstream Judaism clear to us, sincethe recipient was always the One God, and the reasons for which onecould oVer sacriWces were carefully listed.B. A GLANCE AT THE HISTORY OF THE TEMPLEIN JERUSALEMThe form of Judaism which pagans and theWrst Christians knew wasa monotheistic religion deWned by a sacred book and a temple: thePentateuch, and the Temple in Jerusalem. This is usually called‘mainstream Judaism’, a term which does not exclude variety inJewish beliefs, but which has been used by scholars as a contrast tothe Jewish sects, which took exception to at least one of the twoelements above (for instance, the Qumran sect and its distancingfrom the Jerusalem Temple). A basic characteristic of mainstreamJudaism is that we cannot easily talk about its ‘Hellenization’ or‘Romanization’. These terms, when applied to religion in Palestine,rather concern the religion of the coastal cities which had been incontact with Greeks from the Hellenistic period, or the variousinland cultsother thanthat of mainstream Judaism.8The reason isthat ‘Hellenization’ or ‘Romanization’ presuppose a peaceful andgradual course of inXuence on a cult, while, whenever Greek,8On pagan cities in Palestine, see Schu ̈rer (1973–87), vol. 2.1, pp. 85–183.

The chronologicalperiod we are concerned with starts while the Second Temple inJerusalem still stands. The history of the Jewish Temple is a long one,and is marked by struggles against internal and external enemies.As this is a book written from a classicist’s point of view, a briefsurvey of the circumstances when conXict centred around the Templeis indispensable for the understanding of the place of Jewish sacriWcein the Graeco-Roman context: whatever happened to the Temple hadan unavoidable impact on Jewish sacriWcial cult.9TheWrst crisis in the history of the Temple was the conquest of theSouthern Kingdom (of Judah) by the Babylonians in 587bc. Solo-mon’s Temple was destroyed,10and the Jews were led into exile (theso-called ‘Babylonian captivity’). This was brought to an end by thenew conqueror Cyrus II, who in 539bc, allowed the Jews to return toPalestine. Towards the end of the sixth centurybcthe Second Templewas built in Jerusalem.In the 160s a second crisis, a conXict between the High PriestMenelaos and his opponents, led to the persecution of Jews byAntiochos IV, who forbade Jews to follow their religion, and,among other atrocities, had the Temple desecrated and its treasuresrobbed (168bc).11Scholars are divided between those who see in theactions of Antiochos an attempt to promote a diVerent form ofmonotheism among the Jews, and those who take them as an attemptto impose the Greek pantheon.12The latter view seems more9As regards the historical outline of early Palestine, apart from the relevantvolumes inCAH2, namely vols. 3.1, 442–510, 3.2, 371–460, 6, 261–96, see Kuhrt(1995), vol.2, pp. 417–72. For our period, the standard work is Schu ̈rer (1973–87),mainly vol. 1, pp. 125–557.10The main narrative is 2 Kings, 25: 8–10.11The main narrative is 1 Macc. 1: 20–64. Though many traditions exist on theissue, and, respectively, many interpretations, the desecration must have consisted inthe sacriWce of a pig on the altar (Josephus,BJI.34,Ant. XII.253), or in the entry ofAntiochos in the Holy of Holies (2 Macc. 5: 15–16), or both.12The latter view has been presented by Millar (1978b). With regard to the eventspreceding the Maccabean revolt, the author is theWrst to have drawn the distinction124From Greek Religion to Judaism"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"probable (see 2 Macc. 6: 1–9 on the institution of the cult of OlympianZeus in the Temple, along with the imposition of other cults); but,whichever is the best explanation, the measures of Antiochos gave riseto the revolutionary movement of the Maccabees (named after theleader of the revolt, Mattathias Maccabaeus), and fostered the com-position of the Book of Daniel in its present form, and of 1 and 2Maccabees, which depict the tribulations of the Jews under Antio-chos. As has been rightly pointed out, ‘it was in the persecution of the160s and the resistance to it that Jewish monotheism, its sacriWcialcult and the personal observances required of its adherents faced andsurvived their greatest test’.13The son of the leader of the revolt, JudasMaccabeus, rededicated the Temple in 164bc(Hanukkah).Under the Hasmoneans (successors of the Maccabees), who wereboth political rulers and High Priests, and after various degrees ofdependence on the Seleucids, Judaea became independent in 129bc.This independence lasted until the Romans started to becomeinvolved in Jewish aVairs.TheWrst involvement of the Romans is related to the third crisis inthe history of the Temple, brought about by Pompey. In around 63bc, along with a sacrilegious entry into the Holy of Holies,14Pompeyput an end to the conXict between the High Priests John Hyrcanus IIand Aristobulus. He installed Hyrcanus II as High Priest (not king),and the structure which he left behind created the circumstancesleading to the recognition of Herod (later called ‘the Great’) as kingof Judaea (37–34bc). During Herod’s reign a lavish reconstruction ofthe Second Temple took place.Judaea was ruled by Herod and his successors untilad6, and fora short period fromad41 to 44. In fact, for almost sixty years, untilad66, Judaea was under the direct rule of Roman governors.The fourth crisis in the Temple history had the most permanentconsequences for the Temple and its sacriWcial cult. It marked the endbetween Hellenization imposed from above and Hellenization sought internally, and,accordingly, theWrst to have distinguished two separate phases (one in the 170s, theother in the 160s) of innovations in the life of the Jews in Jerusalem.13Millar (1997), 104.14Josephus,Ant.

The Romanvictory was marked by the total destruction of the Temple, which wasnever rebuilt. In the next chapter I shall deal more extensively withthe issue of the continuation (or not) of sacriWces afterad70.The memory of the Temple survived the building itself. During theuprising of Bar Kochba (this is its leader’s name in rabbinicalsources), which lasted for three years (ad132–5), the rebels issuedcoins with legends such as ‘for the freedom of Jerusalem’. This symbolcan hardly be explained as not alluding to the Temple or, even, itsrestoration.15Whatever the true extent of attempts at the restorationof the Temple might have been, after the suppression of the BarKochba revolt, Jews were banished from Jerusalem.All the periods of crisis brieXy outlined above suYce to show howimportant an institution the Temple was, both as a symbol of Jewishreligion, and as a symbol of national pride.15Religious causes have also been suggested with regard to the Diaspora revoltunder Trajan (Egypt,ad115–17), but this contention is more diYcult to prove,mainly because Judaea was not involved in this uprising.126From Greek Religion to Judaism"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"4Jewish Animal SacriWcein the Period 100bc–ad200INTRODUCTIONAlthough some scholarly views resembling Nilsson’s on Greek reli-gion present the sacriWcial cult in the Jerusalem Temple as havingdeclined in the late Second Temple period,1in this book there is noneed to prove the case for aXourishing Jewish sacriWcial cult in ourperiod of study. The reasons are the following:(a) Any view about decline of Jewish sacriWces would only concernprivate oVerings, since there is no reason to suppose a cessationof public sacriWces in the Temple, as the evidence from Josephusfor Pompey’s intrusion into the Temple proves (BJI.148¼Ant.XIV.65–8). Consequently, the Temple did not cease to performits regular function as a cultic centre for Judaism.(b) The studies in favour of an alleged decline are mainly based onassumptions, and have no concrete evidence referring to thedecline of Jewish sacriWcial cult. Such assumptions are, forinstance, that it would be diYcult for Diaspora Jews to travelto Jerusalem even for the three times a year prescribed by theBible (Exod. 23: 17, 34: 23; Deut. 16: 16); or that the spread ofChristianity met an already dwindling interest in sacriWce.(c) In contrast to the lack of any systematic reaction to Nilsson’sview as regards Greek religion, scholarship on Judaism has seen1Yerkes (1953), 119, 198; Rowland (1985), 40, 41."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"studies refuting the view of a declining Jewish sacriWcial cult inthe Second Temple period.2(d) There is no sort of positive evidence from our period in favour ofthe one or the other thesis, namely the decline orXourishing ofthe sacriWcial cult in Jerusalem. The combination of diVerentelements is inconclusive,3and so no safe conclusion can bereached.In view of the above, the thesis I adopt regarding Jewish sacriWcialcult in the late Second Temple period is as follows: one cannot refutethe continued importance of public oVerings, and the continuouspresence of private oVerings, although the diachronic evolution ofthe latter is not possible to trace even in the later period.As the previous chapter has made obvious, a study of JewishsacriWce cannot but be very diVerent from a study of Greek sacriWce.The association of the Jewish worshipper to the one Temple of theone and only God, as well as the existence of the Bible, and later ofthe Mishnah, two sacred books giving shape to this association, arethe reasons for this diVerence.This chapter on Jewish sacriWce is divided into two sections, onehistorical and the other structural. This division is dictated by thenature of our sources, since some of them look at the evidencediachronically, being inXuenced by the historical books of the OldTestament, while some others achronically, consisting in the inter-pretation of the Pentateuch.Initially, ahistorical presentation (section B1) of the JewishsacriWcial institutions on the basis of sources written in the periodwe are studying will show the importance which the main sacriWcialcentre, the Jerusalem Temple, had in Judaism: from where did theTemple acquire its prestige, what was its character as a building in2Goodman (1999), where it is argued that massive pilgrimage to the Templeduring religious festivals was fostered by Herod the Great. According to Goodman,Herod had foreseen the proWt which would come from Diaspora pilgrimage to thegreat shrine, and, among other actions promoting his vision, he had the Templelavishly rebuilt. On the duration of Herod’s rebuilding, see Schu ̈rer (1973–87), vol. 1,p. 292, n. 12.3So Goodman quite honestlyXags the evidence undermining his thesis in the lastparagraph of his article (1999, 75), but hisWnal triumphal sentence does not suYce toallay the doubts already raised in the reader’s mind.128Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Jerusalem, what was the Temple’s relation to Rome, how were Templeand sacriWce viewed after the destruction ofad70? Our evidence ismainly drawn from Josephus, but also from Philo and the Mishnah,with the latter being the source for post-ad70 Judaism.The second section (B2) is a detailed study of thestructure of theJewish sacriWcial system, with the factor of development over timeonly rarely visible. This achronic part will focus on the ritual insti-tutions themselves: the High Priest, and the rest of the priesthood,the food laws and sacriWcial regulations of the Jews. Philo and theMishnah are the primary sources here, but I shall also use somepassages from Josephus.The novelty of my approach here lies in the way in which the workof Philo and the mishnaic evidence are presented. The categorizationapplied to Philo’s evidence gives shape to his not strictly consistentallegorical analysis, while the emphasis given to the conceptual cat-egories of the mishnaic text makes evident the unexpected degree ofvariety contained in this formulaic legal text (independently of thedegree to which its rules were in force beforead70). But since thisbook is written from the historical point of view, the main novelty ofthe present chapter is that the two kinds of presentation, historical andstructural, are not isolated from each other: within the structuralpresentation I point out elements from which one can infer a devel-opment through time (see the section on Josephus in section B2), and,more importantly, ponder the possibilities of a connection betweenPhilo’s teaching, the Diaspora, and Jewish Christians (see on Philo insection A, as well as the Prologue and Conclusion to the discussion ofPhilo in section B2, and the Conclusion to this chapter).Although removed from everyday reality, it is the texts of Philo andthe Mishnah, and not the text of Josephus, which make it possible forus to look both at thehorizontaland theverticallines of the JewishsacriWcial system. In the Mishnah, a very important factor for itswriters is the intention of the oVerer, which undoubtedly deWnes theoVerer’s relation to God (vertical line). But it is Philo who persistentlyconnects the whole range of the sections of the horizontal line (suchas species or gender of animals, values such as justice, etc.) to areaswhich define the relation between offerer and God, that is to sectionsof the vertical line (such as the notions of thanking, of expiation, ofsacrilege, etc.). If we accept the fact that many Jews of the DiasporaJewish Animal SacriWce129"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"knew the writings of Philo, then we may accept that through Philosome Jews may have also connected the two lines; in other words,some Jews may have adopted a life attitude in which animal sacriWcewas seen as an allegorization of their values in life (horizontal line) andof their relation to God (vertical line).A. THE SOURCESJosephusFlavius Josephus was a Jewish writer of theWrst centuryad. He was apriest, who also participated in the politics of his day, having playeda central role during the Jewish War against the Romans inad66–70.The works of Josephus which will be of interest for us in this book areThe Jewish War,The Jewish Antiquities, and secondarilyAgainstApion. Josephus is also known for his autobiographicalVita, butthis work does not serve our purposes here.The Jewish Warcovers the period from the Maccabean revolt uptoad73, when Masada, the last fortress held by the Jews, fell tothe Romans. The work is written from a pro-Roman perspective.TheJewish Antiquitiesis a history of the Jewish people, starting with theCreation and reaching the eve of the war. InAgainst ApionJosephusdefends Judaism against anti-Semitic slander.In the course of his writings Josephus often mentions anotherwork, which he apparently intended to write, entitled ‘On Customsand Causes’.4This work, he says, would focus on the religiouspractices of the Jews. If we had it today, we could talk with muchgreater certainty about the ritual performances in the Temple. Evenwithout this, though, in the existing four works one canWnd asubstantial amount of information about the Second Jewish Temple,that is, the Temple which the Jews built after their return fromBabylon in 539bc, and which continued to exist until the captureof Jerusalem by the Romans inad70.4Cf. e.g.Ant.

Josephus was a Jew of priestly descent, who wrote inGreek. He might not have provided a representative sample of theworld he belonged to, but his voice is the only testimony for Jerusa-lem Judaism, and as such it is extremely useful.5Some further remarks are necessary. Josephus’ work is historical.His intention was not to interpret the history of the Jews, but tonarrate it in a continuous form. It might not be by pure chance thatJosephus’ claim about the antiquity of the Jewish nation, as heexpressed it inAgainst Apion,was excellently served by hisJewishAntiquities. Besides, Josephus’ preference for history is shown by thefact that he gave priority to his historical works and not to theprojected ‘On Customs and Causes’.The history of Josephus is methodologically characterized by themodel ofcontinuity: as a matter of course, the Jews of his day areconsidered by him to be the descendants of the Jews of the OldTestament. This line of continuity is obvious in theAntiquities,where the history of the Jewish people starts from the very beginningof the world and goes on until the time of the Roman Empire.What is more interesting is that Josephus managed to integrate bothhis sources and his personal experiences in this model. In his minimaltreatment of Jewish institutions,6Josephus’ primary source for Jewishhistory, the Bible, is enriched here and there with details apparentlyknown to him from contemporary Jewish cult.7Scholars have alreadytried to correlate these non-biblical details with later rabbinic traditions.8Actually, Josephus never explicitly acknowledges his indebtedness tocontemporary sources. So scholarly attempts to combine Josephus withlater rabbinic compilations of laws are misleading and insecure.The pre-eminently historical character of Josephus’ work leads usto use his testimony more for issues pertaining to the history of the5Discussion of Josephus, with bibliography, is given in Schu ̈rer (1973–87), vol. 1,pp. 43–63.

Apart from the few points where hispresentation diVers from Scripture, Josephus just re-narrates theBible. At least in the works whose publication he achieved, Jewishritual is not interpreted by him. Strikingly, this task had been carriedout earlier, by a Jewish writer from the Diaspora, namely Philo.PhiloPhilo was a Jew of the Diaspora who lived in Alexandria in theWrstcenturyad. We do not know the exact dates of his life, apart from theautobiographical detail he gives in the workDe legatione ad Gaium(1), which is about a Jewish embassy to the emperor Gaius: there,Philo includes himself in a group of old men. Since the embassy tookplace aroundad39–40,9we can conclude that Philo was born in thelater decades of theWrst centurybc.Philo’s works consist primarily of treatises on the Pentateuch. Theonly works which refer to his contemporary reality areDe legationead Gaium,In Flaccum, andDe vita contemplativa. Since Philo’s workfocuses on the Old Testament, and particularly on the Pentateuch,it does not provide us with a historical account of Judaism, or witha descriptive picture of contemporary Jewish religious life (even ifPhilo talks of the Bible as if it were the ‘general rule’).Because of the special character of Philo’s work, it is not easy forthe reader to grasp that model of continuity which is so evident inJosephus. Of course, Philo talks about all the elements of Jewishreligion which constitute the frame for the oVering of sacriWces.The Tent, the Temple, their altars, and their ritual appurtenances,the High Priest and his robes with their adornments, are all presentand described. What is lacking is a sort of diachronic connectionbetween these elements; this connection might be implied by Philo,but it is never clearly stated by him. Philo does not write history; heinterprets the Jewish Law.The method which Philo uses when he deals with the Old Testamentisallegory. That is to say, the material in the Old Testament is not takenliterally, but its events and characters are used as symbols of higher9For the chronological implications of the embassy, see the Loeb edition of Philo,vol. 10, pp. xxvii–xxxi.132Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"truths. Philo uses the concrete narrations of the Old Testament as abasis for philosophical discussion on matters theological. He is not theWrst to have employed allegory; Philo’s predecessors in this methodcame both from the Greek world and from Judaism.10The dependenceof Philo on each of them still remains a highly debated issue.11The main characteristic in Philo’s allegory is that higher meaningsare expressed in Greek philosophical terms.12However, apart fromsome fundamental motifs throughout his work,13Philo does nothave a consistent philosophical system. He rather belongs to the‘school’ of eclecticism; this means that his ideas are drawn from anumber of Greek philosophical systems: Platonism, Peripateticism,Stoicism, Cynicism, Neo-Pythagoreanism. Philo combines all thesesystems, with the intention of giving the biblical text a philosophicalmeaning. Nevertheless, one can discern inconsistencies in his at-tempt: Scripture is not a literary work devoid of stylistic deWciencies,and since Philo is totally dependent on it, he has to adapt himself tothe text, without caring about repetitions, slight shifts from philo-sophical principles already stated, or even contradictions. Despitethese faults, Philo’s erudition is admirable, even if his combination ofGreek philosophy and Judaism seems too extraordinary to have beenthe common rule among Jews of the Diaspora.14In my view, Philo can be considered as representative of the Dias-pora Jews at a diVerent level from that of the relation between Greekphilosophy and Judaism. More speciWcally, I suggest that his belief inthe importance of Jewish ritual might have been quite commonamong Diaspora Jews.

But I have seen no evidence that Philo speaks for a segment ofJewry large enough to be called amarginal Judaism.’ However, a ‘liberal’ group of Jewsin Alexandria might have adopted Greek habits for the preservation of their way ofsocializing and their political rights; see Turner (1954), 58.Jewish Animal SacriWce133"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"B2 in this chapter, where I also stress how helpful young students of theJewish Law might have found Philo’s interpretation of the Torah.15The evidence we have at our disposal does not allow us to answerour many questions about Philo. But, compared with Josephus, Philoseems more dependent on the letter of the Law. His treatment of thePentateuch obliges us to use his text as evidence for the signiWcance ofthe Temple sacriWcial cult, and not for a historical reconstructionof the Jerusalem, or even the Jewish Diaspora, rituals.The non-historical character of Philo’s work must be at least in partthe result of his living away from Jerusalem (which he seems to havevisited only once16). It seems hard to suppose that any other Jew notliving in Jerusalem had reliable information on whatever additions—trivial or not—were made to the Temple cult as described in thePentateuch. Probably, Philo’s lack of acquaintance with contemporaryTemple ritual must also have characterized most Jews of the Greek-speaking communities in the Diaspora: the puzzles arising from the textof Scripture, to which Palestinian rabbis gave diVerent interpretations,would not have been urgent issues for Greek-speaking Diaspora Jews.The urgency arose afterad70, and again it was only felt by Palestinianrabbis, who composed theWrst codiWcation of the Jewish Law.The MishnahThe Mishnah is the oldest extant corpus of Jewish Law, and its redac-tion is traditionally ascribed to Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi, who died at thebeginning of the third centuryad. We should insist on the fact that thiscode of law was not the result of a formulation which started andWnished at the time of R. Judah ha-Nasi. The rabbis mentioned in theMishnah belong to several generations of the Tannaim (rabbis of the1st–2nd c.ad), so we are confronted with a compilation representinga long history of rabbinic legislation. J. Neusner is theWrst scholar tohave classiWed the legislative material of the Mishnah into three cat-egories, each one representing a stage in rabbinic legislation. Thus the15One might think that Philo’s expositions would not be popular, but, judging bythe sheer number of his biblical treatises, one can rather suppose the opposite. Sandmel(1979), 13, says that Philo would have bored his congregation in the synagogue.16De providentia64.134Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Wrst stage is represented by the work of the rabbis beforead70 (‘beforethe Wars’), the second stage by rabbinic work in the period 70–135(‘between the Wars’), and the third stage by rabbinic work afterad135up to the Mishnah’sWnal redactionc.ad200 (‘after the Wars’).17Despite the generally admitted fact that various chronological strataof rabbinic legislation are contained in the Mishnah, and that evenJosephus might have used material which would later be called mish-naic, I cannot with conWdence use the Mishnah as evidence for theperiod before itsWnal redaction. The reason for this is that ‘we do nothave any signiWcant evidence that a corpus of Mishnah—whether inwriting or orally formulated and orally transmitted in exactly thelanguage of the original formulation—lay before Eliezer’18(i.e.c.ad70,Eliezer being the student of R. Yohanan ben Zakkai, the founder of therabbinic ‘school’ at Yavneh). This statement being the result of Neus-ner’s internal analysis of the Mishnah, I would like to add here a piece ofexternal evidence corroborating his view: neither Philo nor Josephusexplicitly refers to any (written or oral) source other than the Bible whenthey deal with issues related to the Temple. Even if Josephus’ reportdiVers from the Bible at some points, we should not assume theexistence of a corpus of Law behind these diVerences. It is more likelythat, by the time of Josephus, inconsistencies between practice and thePentateuchal text had begun to arise. But it would be wrong to attributethese deviations to a programmatic reformation of the biblical Lawmade by any speciWc group. In consequence, I think that the Mishnahmust be treated as a product of its time, as an attempt at codiWcation ofrabbinic teachings in written form, only reliable as a piece of evidencefor what Jewish sagesc.ad200had to say aboutJewish legal matters.Of the six divisions of the Mishnah, it is theWfth which will mainlyconcern us here: it is calledKodashim, meaning ‘Holy Things’, and itmostly deals with Jewish animal sacriWces and the Jewish sanctuary.1917See Neusner (1981).The second stage is more or less identical with the so-calledYavnean period, that isc.ad70–120 (after the town of Yavneh, the main centre ofrabbinic activity at that time). The third stage is more or less identical with theUshanperiod, i.e.c.ad140–80 (after the town of Usha, where rabbis worked in that period).For a very good introduction to the issues concerning the compilation of theMishnah, see Stemberger (19962), 108–48 (with bibliography).18Neusner (1973), ii. 52; quoted by Stemberger (19962), 130.19For a full analysis of theWfth division, see Neusner (1978–80), and, as asummary of this, see his 1979a.Jewish Animal SacriWce135"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"TheWfth division is not the only one dealing with animal sacriWce, sosome passages from other divisions will also be dealt with. I muststate from the beginning that I shall approach the Mishnaic textthrough its English translation.TheWfth division, with its material probably dating to the periodad70–170,20consists of eleven tractates:Zebahim, animal oVeringsMenahoth, meal oVeringsHullin, animals killed for foodBekhoroth,WrstlingsArakhin, vows of valuationTemurah, the substituted oVeringKerithoth, extirpationMeilah, sacrilegeTamid, the daily whole-oVeringMiddoth, measurementsKinnim, bird-oVerings.The tractates Menahoth and Middoth will hardly concern us at all,since Menahoth only deals with non-animal oVerings, and Middothwith the dimensions of the Temple.It is a fact that the Mishnaic text, like that of Philo, is not historic.It might be of historical importance in itself, but the compilers didnot talk of Judaism as a historic continuum. Historic references arefew and allusive, and so highly ambiguous.Here I have thought it useful to study the way in which theWfthMishnaic division views sacriWce, by insisting on the conceptualcategories which it contains.21So, in accordance with the nature ofthe text, my use of the Mishnah will be similar to my use of Philo, inthat it will mainly focus on the structure of ritual as it was under-stood by the writers, and not so much on the historical dimension.20See Neusner (1978–80), vi. 49–214.21Although in this attempt I have been inspired by Mary Douglas’ work onLeviticus and F. Schmidt’s on the Qumran material, I am not going so far as toWnd symbolisms behind the conceptual categories of the Mishnah. Douglas’ mostrecent book on Leviticus is Douglas (1999). See also her 1993 and 1995; the mostfamous is Douglas (1966). Along similar lines of thought, see Schmidt (1994).

THE EVIDENCE1. Historical PresentationThe work of Josephus contains extensive descriptions of the physicalappearance of the First and Second Jewish Temples.22I shall not describethe architectural structure of the Temple in detail, since it is a very debatedissue, even among specialists, and can be studied through recent bookson the subject.23Apart from these long descriptions, throughout thewhole work of Josephus there are numerous references to the Temple.These consist of the writer’s comments on Jewish ritual, of commentsincluded in the speeches of his characters, and of simple narrationshaving to do with piety and its observance or its neglect. One has tocollect all these elements in order to acquire a general impression of thesigniWcance which the Jewish Temple had in Josephus’ mind.The Temple through Josephus’ history: space, people, sacriWcesSpaceJosephus accepts that God himself prohibited human sacriWces since thebinding of Isaac (Ant. I.224–36), and that Moses instructed the Jews tobuild a Temple as soon as they arrived home (Ant. IV.199–201). Conse-quently, regulations having to do with cult and its place had been handeddown long since, and were to be respected. The Temple in Jerusalemwas the place where animal sacriWces should be oVered in the right way.Apart from providing the place for the oVering of sacriWces, themain role of the Jewish Temple was to shelter the Law of Moses. Untilthe Temple was built, the Law had been sheltered in an Ark, which22On Solomon’s Temple, i.e. the First Temple: Jos.Ant. VIII.63–98.

The references to the early SecondTemple, which the Jews built after the Exile, are indirect, and mainly have a depre-catory tone relating to its lack of splendour in comparison with Solomon’s Temple;they are to be found inAnt.

And the bronze altar he set up before the temple opposite thedoor, so that when this was opened the altar was before the eyes (of thosewithin the temple), and the sacred ministrations and the splendour of thesacriWces might be seen. (Loeb tr.)The passage above does not make the diVerence between the twoaltars immediately clear, namely that the bronze altar was for animalsacriWces, and the golden one for incense oVerings.25Elsewhere,though, Josephus says that the bronze altar was for the burnt oVer-ings (›º\bŒÆı\u0012!\u0003\rØ\u0010,Ant. VIII.88), or he refers to a large and a smallaltar (ibid. 92), or to the censer inside the Temple (Łı\tØÆ\u0012æØ\b\f,BJV.216–18), and the altar outside it (\u0013ø\t\u000f\u0010,BJV.225).26In the descriptions of the Tent, of Solomon’s Temple, and ofHerod’s Temple, Josephus keeps the division of the interior into theHoly of Holies and the Holy Temple. In the Holy Temple threeelements stood: the lampstand, the table, and the golden altar orcenser. The Holy of Holies was the place for the Ark both in the Tentand in Solomon’s Temple, but it was empty in Herod’s Temple. As24For a list of these sanctuaries, see de Vaux (19733), 302–8.25In fact, this lack of clarity might go back to the Hebrew term for the altar ofincense-oVering. See ibid. 410–13.26See also the testimony of Hecataeus from Abdera about the two altars, one,stone-made, outside the Temple, and the other, golden, inside (ApionI.198).138Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"regards the altar of animal sacriWces, this was always outside the Tentor Temple (Ant. III.122–5, 134–49 on the Tent; VIII.71, 104–5 onSolomon’s Temple;BJV.215–219,ApionII.102–4 on Herod’s Temple).InApionII.80–2 Josephus gives anotherdimension to this division ofthe Temple’s interior, and this is a refutation of the slanders of Gentiles.The Temple, Josephus says, was not a place where an ass’s head wasworshipped, nor was a Greek fed there in order to be sacriWced. EvenPompey saw the sacred objects in the Temple when he entered it.27The division of the Temple area into zones actually started fromthe exterior, where successive precincts were diVerentiated from oneanother in terms of the admittance of diVerent groups. To start fromthe outside to the inside, there were: the court where both Jews andGentiles were admitted, then the court where only Israelites (menand women) were admitted, then the court where only male Israeliteswere admitted, andWnally, the priests’ court, just outside the Holy ofHolies. The latter could only be entered by the High Priest. (Ant.VIII.95–8 on Solomon’s Temple;BJV.190–200,Ant.XV.410–20, andApionII.102–4 on Herod’s Temple).An example of the observance of this division into zones is given inBJII.340–1, where a Roman (a tribunus of Agrippa, named Neapoli-tanus) reveres the Temple from where it was allowed for him to do so.As the main place of Jewish cult, the Temple was liable to pollution.Murder deWling the Temple is a constant theme in Josephus. Themurders of worshippers which Archelaus had committed in the Tem-ple during Passover (Ant. XVII.213–18,BJII.5–13) were used as anaccusation by Antipater (Ant.XVII.237,BJII.30) and the Jews (Ant.XVII.313,BJII.89–90), in whose speeches the prevailing parallel is thatbetween the blood of the people and their sacriWcial victims.28ToJosephus, the murders committed in the Temple by the terroristsicarii(whom he calls ‘brigands’,ºfi\u0019\u0003\u0012Æ\u0004) were a sign of impiety, whichcaused the capture of Jerusalem by the Romans (Ant. XX.165–6).Pollution in the Temple could also be caused by any act contra-vening Jewish ritual regulations. Josephus attributes the death ofAntiochus Epiphanes to his deWling of the Temple; Antiochus hadsacriWced swine in the Temple and bespattered it with their grease27On Pompey entering the Temple, see alsoAnt. XIV.71–2,BJI.152.28See alsoAnt. IX.151–2, XI.297–301.Jewish Animal SacriWce139"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"(Ant. XII.359, and for the deWling XII.246–56, XIII.243,BJI.31–5).During the governorship of Coponius in Judaea another kind ofpollution was due to the Samaritans, who scattered human bonesin the Temple’s porticoes (Ant. XVIII.29).The presence of statues in the Temple area was forbidden, and thatis why the Jews were against Herod’s golden eagle (Ant. XVII.151–6),also against Pilate’s introduction of busts to the Temple (Ant.XVIII.55–9), and against Gaius’ desire to have his statue placedthere (Ant. XVIII.261–309,BJII.184–203).29PeopleFrom a very few references in his text, one can see that Josephusfollows the biblical tradition according to which the servants of theJewish cult were traditionally appointed by Moses (Ant. III.188–92,Aaron as High Priest;Ant. III.197–8, consecration of the priests;ibid. 258, consecration of the Levites as assistants).The High Priesthood in Josephus becomes the national symbol ofcoherence. Even the keeping of the High Priest’s vestments gaveauthority to the ruler of each period (Ant. XV.403–9, XVIII.90–5).For Josephus, the High Priest, invested with both religious and non-religious duties, is in eVect the human who comesWrst after God (ApionII.194). The High Priest directs ceremonies of worldwide signiWcance,and is revered by people from all over the world (BJIV.323–4).30Josephus provides us with a brief description of the High-Priestly vest-ments (Ant. III.159–78,BJV.231–6). Giving the details of how these weremade, he surprises us with his exaggerated citation of botanical parallels!Josephus does not insist much on symbolisms; however, he brieXycitesthe allegories attached to the High-Priestly robe (Ant. III.184–7).Josephus considers the lawful succession of High Priests as animportant aspect of Jewish history; he presents the succession ofHigh Priests even before the erection of the Temple, and onwards(Ant. V.361–2, VII.110, VIII.12, X.151). He appears really concerned29Philo’s treatiseDe legatione ad Gaium, which is not dependent on the Pentateuch,is a kind of a chronicle of Gaius’decision to appropriate the sacred area of the Temple forhis statue. As Philo says, this decision was to aVect not only a Jewish population, but thewhole Jewish nation (De leg. 184). Philo’s statement suYciently proves that, for bothJerusalem and Diaspora Jews, the religious character of the Temple was incontestable.30Avery good account of the High Priesthood in Josephus is given by Thoma (1989).140Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"when the High Priesthood is illegally occupied by unworthy men (BJIV.147–9, 153–7), or when it is not invested with the political powerit used to have (Ant. XIV.77–8, 491). The fullest enumeration of HighPriests is contained inAnt. XX.224–51: it starts from Aaron and goeson until the time of Titus, and this is the most representative proof ofJosephus’ perception of continuity.During Jewish festivals a large number of private individuals cameto Jerusalem to oVer sacriWces (Ant. IV.203–4 on the three annualpilgrim festivals, XVII.214 on Passover, 254 on Pentecost,BJII.515on Tabernacles). People could come to Jerusalem independently ofthe festivals, for instance, for the accomplishment of a personal wishto visit the sacred place. This, for example, was what motivated Helenfrom Adiabene to oVer sacriWces of thanksgiving in the Temple (Ant.XX.49). Individuals could oVer thanksgiving sacriWces in a militarycontext, as in the case of Judas Maccabaeus, who oVered sacriWces tocelebrate his victories and the safety of his army (Ant. XII.349).The gathering of people in the wide area of the Temple duringreligious festivals was not only a chance for Jews to strengthen theirfaith in the Law; it was also an opportunity for revolt and lynching:Alexander Jannaeus was pelted by the people with citrons as he wasabout to sacriWce. The people did not remain unpunished (Ant.XIII.372–3). Josephus gives a very vivid account of the insidiousmethods used by the terroristsicariiin the Temple during Jewishfestivals (Ant. XX.165,BJII.255).SacriWcesPublic sacriWces were oVered on the basis of the biblical regulations.But they could also be oVered for the kings who ruled or controlledthe Judaean territory. Such was the sacriWce oVered for the Romanemperor (ApionII.76–7,BJII.197, see below). Josephus also refers tothe sacriWcial oVering for the Persian rulers (Ant. XI.17, 102).3131Ant. XI.17: Cyrus’ letter to the satraps in Syria is invented by Josephus; there hetalks about the wish accompanying Jewish sacriWces thatthe kingdom of Persia mayendure.InAnt. XI.102, where Josephus mentions Jewish sacriWces forthe well-being ofthe king and the Persians, he somewhat alters the biblical text, which is actually talkingabout wishes forthe life of the king and his children. So, are these elements some kindof anachronism having to do with Josephus’ personal pro-Roman sentiments, evi-dent throughout theJewish War?Jewish Animal SacriWce141"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Josephus strongly appreciates the oVering of sacriWces during wars, asin the case of Antiochus Sidetes who, during the siege of Jerusalem, sentHyrcanus I victims and spices as a sacriWce for the feast of Tabernacles(Ant. XIII.241–4). Of course, such chivalries could also become anopportunity for deceit, as in the case of the besieged Aristobulus II,who paid for Passover victims which he never received (Ant. XIV.25–7).Public animal sacriWces could continue to be oVered even duringdiYcult circumstances, as, for instance, when Pompey captured theTemple: the priests continued to make the daily oVerings as if nothinghad happened, and they were slaughtered during their ministry (BJI.148–51,Ant. XIV.65–8). The oVering of public sacriWces would onlycease for special reasons. Thus, at the beginning of the Jewish War, thesacriWce on behalf of the Romans and the emperor was rejectedfollowing an order—even if, according to Josephus, there were hostilereactions to this decision (BJII.409–10). Josephus also narrates how,during the siege of Jerusalem, Titus learnt that the daily sacriWces hadceased to be oVered because of lack of men—or lambs, according to adiVerent reading (BJVI.94).Throughout the centuries, the selling of sacriWcial animals, orother goods of religious character, must have made the Temple intoa powerful magnet for merchants.32SacriWce outside the TempleIn several parts of his work, Josephus describes the building of twotemples other than the one in Jerusalem. These are the Samaritantemple, which was allegedly erected with the permission of Alexanderthe Great (see mainlyAnt. XI.302–47 on the events surrounding itsconstruction, XIII.254–8 on its destruction), and the Temple at Leon-topolis in Egypt, which was built in the second centurybcby Onias, aperson of priestly origin (see mainlyAnt. XII.385–8, XIII.62–73 on itsconstruction,BJVII.420–36 on its construction and destruction).Josephus gives no details about the ritual conducted in those temples,apart from the reference to the priestly personnel at Leontopolis, who, ashe says, belonged to the Jerusalem religious personnel (Ant.

But, on the other hand, thiscould be the result of our not having other evidence for the ritualconducted in these temples.Here it is interesting to cite two mishnaic passages, which showthat, even afterad70, the rabbis were perfectly aware of the existenceof other Jewish cultic centres, which they did not think it sacrilegiousto mention. Indeed, at some points the text betrays a positive attitudetowards them:TheWrst passage is found at the end of the tractate Zebahim (ch. 14),and is a strangeXashback to early Jewish religion, when there was noTemple. At that time, legitimacy of sacriWces of various designations andtheir consumption followed the legitimacy of the cultic ‘high places’.33The second passage of historical importance explicitly refers to thetemple at Leontopolis, and, strikingly, belongs to the tractate dealingwith meal-oVerings (Menahoth):[If he said] ‘I pledge myself to oVer a Whole-oVering’, he must oVer it in theTemple. And if he oVered it in the House of Onias he has not fulWlled hisobligation. [If he said,] ‘I will oVer it in the House of Onias’, he should oVerit in the Temple, but if he oVered it in the House of Onias he has fulWlled hisobligation. R. Simeon says: Such is not accounted a Whole-oVering . . .

(Loeb tr.)InthesametreatisePhiloinformsusaboutthenatureoftheseoVerings:two lambs and a bull (317, Agrippa’s letter). In fact, Philo does not specifyfor whom the sacriWces were oVered, but scholars usually assume thatthey were oVered for the emperor as such, since Augustus paid for them.So, we should stress that only after this assumption is made can wecorrelate the evidence in Philo with that found in Josephus.Josephus talks about sacriWces on behalf of the emperor and theRoman people (\u0007\ræd \tb\f ̊Æ\u0004\u0003Ææ\b\u0010 ŒÆd \u0012\bF \u000b\t\bı \u0012H\f\u0016'ø\tÆ\u0004ø\f), andreports that these were oVered twice a day (BJII.197), and wereborneWnancially by the Jewish people (ApionII.77).34According tothe same author, sacriWces paid for by Gentiles, along with thatoVered on behalf of (\"\u0007\u0015æ) the Romans and the emperor,35ceasedto be oVered at the beginning of the Jewish War (BJII.409–10).An interesting detail from Philo is the reaction of Gaius to thestatement of the Jewish ambassadors that, on three occasions, Jewshonoured the emperor with thanksgiving holocausts on his behalf.Gaius would have preferred sacriWces oVeredtohim (De leg. 355–7).The Temple’s resources for the festal animal sacriWcesAccording to the pre-Exilic tradition, which is alive in Josephus’mind, the imposition of the annual poll-tax of half-a-shekel on allJews is attributed to Aaron (Ant. III.194–6, see Exod. 30: 11–16): ‘Thesum thus collected was expended upon the needs of the tabernacle’34If Josephus means the same oVering, there is an inconsistency with Philo, onwhich see Schu ̈rer (1973–87), vol. 2, p. 312.35Or, according to some MSS, ‘on behalf of the Romans, (that is) on behalf of theemperor’.144Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"(Ant. III.196, Loeb tr.). Apparently, what is meant by ‘needs’ alsoincludes the sacriWces oVered by the community, even if this is notexplicitly stated.Philo’s reference to the half-shekel, which he calls ‘Wrstfruits’(I\u0007Ææ\u000eÆ\u0004) and ‘ransom-money’ (º\u0002\u0012æÆ), is not explicitly connectedto sacriWces either (De spec. legibus 1, 76–8): ‘For it is on theseWrst-fruits, as prescribed by the law, that the hopes of the pious rest’ (ibid. 78,Loeb tr.). According to Josephus, since its imposition, the tax becamean obligatory contribution to the Temple, paid by all Jews, even thoseoutside Jerusalem (Ant. XVIII.312). This tax was an incontestable rightof the Jews, and they fought for it strongly, as becomes obvious inthe later period (Ant. XVI.163, 167, 169, 171).36After the destruction oftheTempleinad70 the same amount would be required by Vespasianto be given to the Capitolium by all Jews (BJVII.218).37A clearer connection between the poll-tax and animal sacriWces ismade only in the Mishnah, in the tractate Shekalim (the shekel dues)of the second divisionMoed(set feasts): ‘What did they do withtheTerumah? They bought therewith the Daily Whole-oVerings and theAdditional Whole-oVerings and their drink-oVerings, the Omer and theTwo Loaves and the Shewbread, and all [else needful for] the oVerings ofthe congregation’ (Shek.4.1, tr. Danby).Terumah(here)¼shekels takenat stated times out of the Shekel-chamber in the Temple.The historical dimension of animal sacriWce afterad70The creation of the mishnaic orderKodashimin a period when therewas no Temple made Neusner wonder about the purpose of thedocument. I think that his answer to the question misses quite animportant point, and this is what I shall argue for here. Somequotations from Neusner are necessary: ‘True, moving out ofthe locative world of Temple, sanctuary, and sacriWce, and into aframe focused upon community and upon activity possible anywhere(among people of a certain sort), Mishnah by no means presentsmaps of a world of nonsense. From one perspective, it outlines the36Strikingly, when Josephus exposes the various privileges given to the Jews byRomans inAnt. XIV.190V., there is no clear reference to this tax. On the contrary, itspresence in bk.

That is the really powerful, anti-contextual datum of our division.’39‘The pretense that nothing haschanged in 500 years . . . and that the ancient system goes forwardunaVected by change and by time is the most eloquent apologetic.’40The rabbis of the Mishnah ‘do not permit the rebuilding of a cult. Butthey do everything they can to preserve concrete facts—not merely ageneralized memory—about the one which has been destroyed. Thatmust mean they wanted the Temple rebuilt and the cult restored’.41To one who has not read the Mishnah and relies on Neusner’spresentation, the rabbis are depicted as follows: dreamers about aglorious past, so obsessed with it that they pretend that nothing haschanged up to the present, and try still to live in the past by re-creating its reality.42Certainly, this is not the picture coming out ofthe Mishnah itself. The rabbis are fully aware of the fact that theTemple has been destroyed, and they do not hesitate to say so, even ifthey confuse things somewhat (here the events ofad70 with those ofad135): ‘On the ninth of Ab the decree was made against ourforefathers that they should not enter the land, theWrst Templeand the second [Temple] were destroyed, Betar was taken, andthe city was ploughed up. . .’ (Taanith 4.6, tr. Neusner). In anycase, the rabbis know well that their legislation can apply to a periodwhen the Temple is not there. This is obvious even from our division,Kodashim: in the tractate Hullin (beginnings of chapters 6, 7, 10, 11,and 12), where the limits of application of certain ritual laws aredrawn, a standard phrase about two periods of time has the Templeas an indicator: ‘[The requirement to] cover up the blood applies inthe Land and abroad,in the time of the Temple and not in the time ofthe Temple. . .’ (Hull. 6.1, tr. Neusner, my emphasis).As we have seen, Neusner has tried toextractmishnaic informa-tion about whether the rabbis wanted the restoration of the Temple,38Neusner (1979b), 110–11.39Ibid. 118.40Ibid. 119.41Ibid. 121.42Thus, rabbis sound like F. Scott Fitzgerald’s Great Gatsby, when he asks: ‘‘‘Can’trepeat the past?’’ he cried incredulously. ‘‘Why of course you can!’’’ (The GreatGatsby, ch. 6).146Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"or did not. He need not have looked for it, since it is explicitly statedat the end of the description of the daily sacriWce: ‘This is the order ofthe daily whole oVering in the liturgy of the house of our God. May itbe [his] will that it be rebuilt, soon, in our own days. Amen’ (Tam.7.3, tr. Neusner). This wish invalidates Neusner’s statement about themishnaic utopia, and its supposed move from ‘cult to community’.In other words, Neusner wanted to spiritualize a work which istotally made out of this world, and is based on the hope that theTemple will be rebuilt—sooner or later—and everything will be inorder again. With this in mind, we can see the whole Mishnah in atotally diVerent light, as a kind of schedule for the future. Until thatfuture was reached, the rabbis might have thought that Jews shouldprepare themselves by abiding by the mishnaic rules.Despite the historical evidence for the destruction of the Temple inad70, a quite acute question in modern scholarship has beenwhether sacriWces continued to be oVered after that date, until thebanishment of the Jews from the Holy Land inad135.43Severalopinions have been expressed, but the early evidence, either arch-aeological or literary, is too scanty, and so scholars have used textsdating later than the second centuryad, that is, Talmudic extracts.However, even in the Mishnah passages such as the followingare quite suggestive: ‘R. Joshua said: I have heard that sacriWcesmay be oVered although there is no Temple and that they may eatthe Most Holy things although there are no curtains and the LesserHoly things and the Second Tithe although there is no wall; since its[i.e. the Temple’s]Wrst dedication sanctiWed it both for its own timeand for the time to come’ (Eduyoth 8.6, tr. Danby).Among the scholars who have worked on the issue, I agree withsome points made by A. Guttmann,44who drew the distinctionbetween private and public sacriWcial oVerings. He stressed thatpassages like the one above give evidence for private oVerings,while, at the same time, presuppose the cessation of private sacriWcialcult. As regards public oVerings, the cessation is explicitly stated.Thus, Taanith 4.6 says that the Tamid ceased on the seventeenth ofthe month Tammuz (the Greek month Panemos): ‘‘‘Ceased’’ here43A short account of the scholarship on the subject is given in Clark (1959–60), 270–1.44Guttmann (1967).Jewish Animal SacriWce147"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"means that it never was restored, for otherwise this would have beenrecorded, the Tamid being a very important public sacriWce.’45The evidence drawn from Josephus corroborates the cessation ofpublic sacriWces. InBJVI.94, Josephus says about Titus:K\u0007\u0015\u0007ı\u0003\u0012\b ªaæ K\u0007\u001aKŒ\r\u0004\f\u0019\u0010 \u0012B\u0010 -\t\u0015æÆ\u0010;—Æ\f\u0015\t\bı \u000b\u001aq\f \u001d\u0007\u0012ÆŒÆØ\u000b\rŒ\u0006\u0012\u0019;\u0012e\fK\f\u000b\rº\r\u000eØ\u0003\te\f ŒÆº\b\u0002\t\r\f\b\f I\f\u000bæH\f=Iæ\fH\f I\u0007\bæ\u0004fiÆ \u000bØÆº\rº\bØ\u0007\u0015\fÆØ \u0012fiHŁ\rfiH ŒÆd\u0012e\f \u000bB\t\b\f K\u0007d \u0012\b\u0002\u0012fiø \u000b\rØ\fH\u0010 IŁı\t\rE\f.Then, having learnt that on that day—it was the seventeenth of Panemus—theso-called continual sacriWce had for lack of men/lambs ceased to be oVered toGodandthatthepeoplewereinconsequenceterriblydespondent...(Loebtr.)If Jewish sacriWcial ritual ever started again after the seventeenth ofPanemus, Josephus was not obliged to mention it, since he is sup-posed to narrate the events of the war, up toad70. However, I doubtwhether the social orWnancial problems (indicated by the lack ofmen or lambs, respectively, according to the reading adopted) oc-curring at the end of the war, and prohibiting the oVering of publicsacriWces,46would have been solved so quickly as to allow the re-sumption of public sacriWcial ritual. So, it is more than likely thatJewish public sacriWces stopped inad70.As Guttmann has also stressed, what is more surprising is thatthere is no rabbinic regulation condemning private oVerings. Therabbis are concerned about the legitimacy of the sacriWces oVered,and not about the fact that they were oVered (see Eduyoth 8.6,quoted above). Consequently, if sacriWces continued to be oVeredby Jews afterad70, these were private, and were not considered asillegitimate by the rabbis.In the case of Greek religion, we have seen that no event similar tothe Fall of the Jewish Temple is known, and that, in the period we arestudying, continuity in sacriWcial practice was just taken for granted.In the case of Judaism, where we do know of an event interruptingthe sacriWcial procedure, the issue of continuity in sacriWcial practicepresents the following paradox: Josephus is obsessed with historical45Guttmann (1967), 140.46Despite Clark’s admission of the general impoverishment after the impositionof theWscus Judaicus(Jos.BJVII.218), the author still thinks that public sacriWcialritual ‘would have been carried on with only a minimum of restoration of the holypremises, and in less grandeur of ritualistic style’. Clark (1959–60), 273.148Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"continuity, and yet he does not provide us with evidence for sacriW-cial continuity. He, who delineates the history of the Jews and theirTemple in detail, who was a priest and experienced the destruction ofthe oYcial centre of Jewish sacriWcial worship inad70, does not feelthe need to wonder about the extent to which sacriWcial cult waspractised by Jews after the fall of the Temple. On the other hand,Jewish authors writing in aboutad200 do not present events in theirhistorical dimension, yet they bear witness to a concept of continuity,since they remain strongly attached to the sacriWcial cult in theTemple, and hope for its restoration.2. Structural PresentationPhiloPrologue: Philo’s attachment to animal sacriWcial practice and hispossible impactMost of this presentation is based on Philo. The reason why Philo’swork concerns us more in the structural section results, of course,from the fact that a large part of his work deals with Jewish sacriWcialritual, since a large proportion of the Pentateuch does so. Yet, on theother hand, this characteristic serves to illustrate Philo’s attachmentto the Law from a more speciWc point of view, namely animalsacriWce. Philo’s laborious work on the Pentateuch contains a greatnumber of allegorizations pertaining to Jewish animal sacriWce.These concern the place where animal sacriWce was carried out, itsministers, the individual oVerer of animal sacriWces, and, most inter-estingly, the body of the animal victim itself.Scholars like Goodenough and Sandmel have emphasized that Philowas a pious Jew, but what is absent from their analysis is the pragmaticelement in Philo’s thought, the reality of animal sacriWce in all its gorydetails as Philo read about it in the Bible, or even as he himselfexperienced it. Much as one would like to present Philo’s transcendentphilosophical reality, one should not forget that Philo’s philosophy isbased to a great extent on concrete sacriWcial regulations. It is as ifscholars have been so inXuenced by Philo’s allegorical method thatthey too try to avoid any reference to Philo’s citation of vivid sacriWcialJewish Animal SacriWce149"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"regulations. The structural presentation in this chapter partly under-mines the scholarly idealized image of a Philo who likes the world ofideas more than naturalistic descriptions.47The presentation below sets Philo in the framework of a number ofJews who, although prone to adopt less pragmatic interpretations ofthe Law, did not regard these as undermining their belief in the valueof sacriWcial ritual.The minute details of animal sacriWcial ritual contained in thePentateuch, especially Leviticus, did not deter Philo from interpret-ing even the smallest elements in it. As we shall see, he did that notonly by allegorization, but by giving functional explanations. In fact,this is evident in the most practical aspect of all in the sacriWcialprocedure, namely consumption of meat, which Philo does notallegorize, but which he explains in a practical way (see e.g.De spec.legibus 1, 220). This shows that to Philo animal sacriWcial ritual wasas important as the rest of the Jewish Law, and acceptable in all itsgory details, without any need for sublimation being felt on his part.Although he was a Jew of the Diaspora, and Temple sacriWcialpractice was not part of his life, Philo considered animal sacriWcialritual to be crucial to his religious conscience.Philo’s allegorizations of the Pentateuch do not indicate any con-tempt for ritual on his part. To Philo, animal sacriWces are the otherside of the gratefulness, the purity, and the holy and true life, whichshould characterize the oVerer.The most famous example of Philo’s opposition to the abolition ofcult almost comes as a proclamation. InDe migratione Abrahami(89–93), Philo blames some people (\rN\u0003d ª\u0006æ \u0012Ø\f\r\u0010) who concentrateon the symbolism of the Law and despise its literal meaning (fromhere onwards, they will be called ‘allegorists’). Those people, saysPhilo, should obey the rules which other, greater men hadWxedbefore them. Sabbath, festivals, and circumcision should be kept,for otherwise, ‘we shall be ignoring the rites of the Temple and athousand other things, if we are going to pay heed to nothing except47An exception to this rule is Klawans (2006), who admits that Philo’s allegoriesdo not lead ‘to any rejection of sacriWces on the literal, performative level’ (p. 117).However, he is also obsessed with superimposing his own scheme onto Philo’sallegories by underplaying the variety in Philonic allegorizations (see esp. his lastparagraph on p. 121).150Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"what is shewn us by the inner meaning of things’ (De migrationeAbrahami92, Loeb tr., slightly modiWed48). Philo does not go on toexplain why abolition of the Temple ritual would be bad, but it isobvious that for Philo such a thing constitutes the last stage of decayin the life of Jews.49Elsewhere, before describing the oVerer’s bodily preparation be-fore sacriWce, Philo dedicates a section to the cleansing of the soul(De spec. legibus 1, 257–60). He says that, while the oVerer’s body is tobe cleansed through the rite of the red heifer, the soul is to be puriWedthrough the observation of the animals oVered for sacriWce. Onseeing theXawless animal,you (sc. the oVerer) will proceed to wash away the sins (±\tÆæ\u0012\tÆ\u0012Æ) anddeWlements (Œ\u0019ºE\u000bÆ\u0010) with which you have besmeared your whole life, someinvoluntary and accidental, some due to your own free will. For you willWndthat all this careful scrutiny of the animal is a symbol representing in aWgurethe reformation of your own conduct, for the law does not prescribe forunreasoning creatures, but for those who have mind and reason. It isanxious not that the victims (Łı\u000f\t\r\fÆ) should be withoutXaw but thatthose who oVer them (Ł\u0002\b\f\u0012\r\u0010) should not suVer from any corrodingpassion. (De spec. legibus 1, 259–60, Loeb tr.)This passage is very characteristic of Philo’s interpretative technique:according to Philo, the Law’s main preoccupation is the soul of theoVerer, and not the body of the victim; but the oVerer would bereminded of his/her soul only on seeing the concrete oVerings,namely the unblemished animal victims.Philo gives two reasons for the literal, cultic observance of the Law:‘we shall gain a clearer conception of those things of which these arethe symbols; and besides that we shall not incur the censure of themany and the charges they are sure to bring against us’ (De migra-tione Abrahami93). The second reason might be a hint of the factthat criticism of the many was a serious reason why Philo chose to beattached to cult, although we cannot know if this was his main reasonfor not abolishing his attachment.48Philo’s Loeb edition (vol. 4, p.185) translates the Greek word±ªØ\u0003\u0012\r\u0004Æby‘sanctity’, but I think ‘rites’ is the correct translation.49For a similar passage, seeDe ebrietate18.Jewish Animal SacriWce151"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Despite the fact that Philo can convince his readers of his commitmentto animal sacriWce, many passages remain puzzling.50For instance, Philosays that, if the oVerer is pure, ‘the sacriWce standsWrm, though theXeshis consumed, or rather, even if no victim at all is brought to the altar. Forthe true oblation, what else can it be but the piety of a soul which is dearto God?’ (De vita Mosis 2,108,Loebtr.,slightlymodiWed).51Afurtherproblem in Philo’s work is the interchange of practical with symbolicexplanations. In contexts other than sacriWcial, Philo can give functionalexplanations for the biblical rules, with no aim atWnding symbolisms.52However, I believe that, having Philo’s clear and explicit statement thathe is not against ritual, puzzling passages such as the aforementionedones should be rather regarded as hyperboles to which Philo’s allegoricalzeal led him.A further point to make concerns the impact of Philo’s teachingson his contemporaries. I suggest that Philo’s writings might havebeen used for teaching purposes, so his views—and allegorizations—might have been shared by a wider public. I cite the followingevidence. At times, Philo is very good at systematically setting outwhat in the Bible is represented by lengthy and often unclear regu-lations. Thus, inDe spec. legibus 1(168V.), Philo makes a very usefulpresentation of all the diVerent sacriWcial types in Jewish cult. I canimagine that this systematic presentation would have been quitehelpful for any student of the Law. Moreover, in Philo’s treatmentof festal sacriWces inDe spec. legibus 1, one cannot help noticing thatthe author presents a synthesis which is diVerent from the biblicalone. My overall impression is that Philo rearranged his material in away which makes it easy to memorize, especially as regards the typeand number of animal sacriWces oVered at festivals. This is demon-strated by the following facts:50De spec. legibus 1, 285–8, 271–2,Quod deterius potiori insidiari soleat20–1. InQuestions and Answers on Exodus(bk. 2, q. 7), Philo placesWrst oVerings at the same levelas the oVerer’s . . . emptiness! Thus he interprets the sentence ‘thou shalt not appear withempty hands before Me’ (Exod. 23: 15c) in two ways: (1) the oVerer should come to GodwithWrstborn and unblemishedoVerings; (2) even if materially empty, on approachingGod, the worshipper is internallyWlled with God’s spiritual light.51For the same point, seeQuestions and Answers on Exodus, bk. 2, q. 98. Similarpassages inDe spec. legibus 1, 272,De plantatione108.52Klawans (2006), 117, where he also accepts Philo’s ‘interplay of practical andsymbolic explanations’.152Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":".Philo does not strictly follow the biblical succession of festivals;53.he correlates the number of victims oVered in a festival with thenumber of victims of another festival;54.for the same festival, he uses the evidence of Leviticus next tothat of Numbers.55I tend to believe that the treatiseDe spec. legibus 1suggests moreclearly than any other that Philo taught younger Jews the Law.In view of the points made above, I think that Philo might haverepresented the middle way between the allegorists and those believingin the pragmatic value of Jewish rituals, with more inclination to thelatter. Also, since Philo’s writings were obviously read (or were used forteaching) by other Jews, his whole work on the Pentateuch can beconsidered to represent a substantial group of Diaspora Jews. It is thenimportant to suggest that a number of Diaspora Jews respected andbelieved in Jewish ritual, without feeling at odds with an allegoricalinterpretation of it. Especially the sections on animal sacriWce, whichconcern us here, show that animal sacriWce continued to have a greatimportance for Jews living away from Jerusalem.1. The Tent in PhiloTo Philo, the Tent is the place for Jewish sacriWces par excellence.Philo’s aim is to give a deeper meaning to the text of the Pentateuch,not to the historical books which follow. Consequently, what dom-inates his work is the Tent and not the Temple, even if there arereferences to the Temple. What is more, the continuity between Tentand Temple is not so evident in his writings as in Josephus.53Philo presents the festival of Trumpets (De spec. leg.1, 180) before that ofUnleavened Bread (ibid. 181–2). In the biblical presentation, Trumpets (Lev. 23:23–5 or Num. 29: 1–6) follows the festival of Unleavened Bread (Lev. 23: 6–8 orNum. 28: 17–24).54Cf. his comments on the doubling of the victims oVered, inDe spec. leg. 1, 170(Sabbath in relation to the daily oVering) and 180 (festival of Trumpets in relation to\f\bı\t\u0019\f\u0004Æ).55According to Philo, the victims oVered atPentecostare two calves, one ram, andseven lambs. Also two lambs as preservation oVerings, which are eaten by the priests(De spec. leg. 1, 184). According to Leviticus (23: 15–22), the victims oVered atPentecost are one calf, two rams, seven lambs, and two lambs as preservation oVer-ings. According to Numbers (28: 26–31), the victims oVered at Pentecost are twocalves, one ram, and seven lambs. See alsoDe spec. leg. 1, 186–8, on theDay ofAtonement, where Philo combines the accounts in Num. 29: 7–11 and Lev. 16.Jewish Animal SacriWce153"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"To Philo, the Tent is clearly the predecessor of the Temple; the Tentwas constructed as a temporary, portable temple, suitable forsacriWces, until the day when the Jews would conquer the land inwhich a splendid temple would be built (De vita Mosis 2, 71–3,Questions and Answers on Exodus, bk. 2, q. 83).Philo’s detailed description of the Tent (De vita Mosis 2, 76–108)almost recalls the description in Josephus,56if the emphasis were noton numbers and allegorization. The elements allegorized by Philo arethe colours used for the veils (ibid. 84–8), and also the Ark, theCherubim over it, the candlestick, the table, and the altars for incenseand burnt oVerings (ibid. 94–108).It is interesting to dwell for a moment on the symbolism of the twoaltars: the altar of incense symbolizes man’s thankfulness for thebeneWts deriving from earth and water (ibid. 101), and that is whyit is appropriately (according to Philo) called the vapour-keeper—Łı\tØÆ-\u0012æØ\b\f(from\u0012\u0019æH, ibid. 105). In the same way, Philo says, thealtar of burnt oVerings is calledŁı\u0003ØÆ\u0003-\u0012æØ\b\f, because, ‘when hethus speaks of the altar which destroys sacriWces as their keeper andguardian he alludes not to the parts and limbs of the victims, whosenature is to be consumed byWre, but to the intention of the oVerer’(De vita Mosis 2, 106, Loeb tr.).57Elsewhere, emphasizing the social dimension of the table in theTent, Philo says that it ‘indicates a kind of communion among thosewho receive a common share of salt and sacriWces’ (Questions andAnswers on Exodus, bk. 2, q. 69, Loeb tr.).Dealing with the dimensions of the altar for animal sacriWces,Philo justiWes their equality by the equality which the oVeringshave before God, independently of their quality or quantity; thequadrangular shape of the altar is taken by Philo as a symbol of thesound soul of the oVerer (ibid. bk. 2, q. 99). The horns of the altar facetoward the four sides of the horizon to indicate the duty of every manin the world to bringWrstfruits and sacriWcial victims to the one altar.On the other hand, the horns are symbols of the non-acceptance ofoVerings by the impious (ibid. q. 101).56Josephus also allegorizes the sacred objects in the Tent or the Temple (Ant.III.181–183,BJV.212–14, 217–18), but in a stereotyped way.57The same interpretation of the wordŁı\u0003ØÆ\u0003\u0012æØ\b\finDe spec. leg. 1, 290.154Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"The citations about the Tent prove that Philo recognizes its socialcharacter, and stresses the capacity of the one and only Jewish altar,and emphasizes its capacity to create relations among pious oVerers,wherever these come from.2. The notion of the ‘Temple’ in PhiloAs I have already stressed, Philo’s work concentrates on the Penta-teuch. This special characteristic results in the fact that we do not haveany detailed description of the Temple, since Philo does not deal withthe historical books of the Old Testament.58The only place where hegives a short account of the Temple isDe spec. legibus 1,66–78,wherehe mainly emphasizes the social character of the sacred area, as he didwhen dealing with the Tent.59The Temple, says Philo in this section, is one because God is one,and because God does not approve of the oVering of sacriWces athome. God sets a sort of ordeal for the pious: if one is willing tosacriWce, one does not care about distance; consequently, if peopleare to come to the Temple out of piety and only that, they have toleave their families. To Philo, Jews seem to have succeeded in thisordeal (the building of the Temple was already a proof of their piety),since so many of them come to the festivals every year:Countless multitudes from countless cities come, some over land, othersover sea, from east and west and north and south at every festival. . . . theydevote the leisure, as is their bounden duty, to holiness and the honouring ofGod. Friendships are formed between those who hitherto knew not eachother, and the sacriWces and libations are the occasion of reciprocity offeeling and constitute the surest pledges that all are of one mind. (De spec.legibus 1, 69–70, Loeb tr.)58The same observation is to be found in the appendix of vol. 7 in the Loeb editionof Philo. Explaining the reason for the inaccuracy of Philo’s description of the Temple,the commentator says (p. 619): ‘...that the description should be slight is naturalenough. He is expounding the laws of the Pentateuch and these did not provide for thebuilding which would be needed when the nation was settled in Palestine . . . but onlyfor a portable sanctuary.’ I am not sure about the rest of the comment: ‘This last . . . wasfullydescribed...andtheomissionofanysuchdescriptionheremaybeduetoafeelingthat this one part of the law had been deWnitely suspended.’59To Philo, the holiest temple of God is the world, and only after that does he referto the Temple:(e \tb\f I\fø\u0012\u0006\u0012ø ŒÆd \u0007æe\u0010 IºŁ\rØÆ\f ƒ\ræe\f Ł\r\bF \f\b\t\u0004\u0011\rØ\f \u0012e\f \u0003\u0002\t\u0007Æ\f\u0012Æ\u000eæc Œ\u000f\u0003\t\b\f \rr\fÆØ...(De spec. leg. 1, 66).

The High Priest in PhiloPhilo’s insistence on the role of the High Priest has been noted byscholars.60His long expositions relating to the High-Priestly robe61suggest that these allegories must have been familiar among Jews.62Apart from describing his vestments, Philo very often deals with theregulations on the life and behaviour of the High Priest.63(a) The role of the High PriestThe High Priest is presented as prayingand giving thanks not only on behalf of the Jewish nation, but of thewhole human race, and, generally, on behalf of the whole natural world(De spec. legibus I,97).The High Priest is not only a servant of God, but of his nation aswell; this is said by Philo when he explains why the sin oVerings64required of the people are of the same species and gender as thoserequired of the High Priest (see below, section 5, on the allegorizationsof animals): ‘But the equality of honour which the high priest enjoys isevidently not so much on his own account as because he is the servantof the nation also, giving thanks in common for all through the holiestof prayers and the purest of sacriWces’ (ibid. 229, Loeb tr.).60See e.g. Laporte (1991), although he does not employ a clear distinction ofcategories: ‘High Priest’, ‘ordinary priest’, ‘Logos’, and ‘wise man’ are all dealt withtogether.61The most thorough Philonic descriptions of the High Priestly robe areDe vitaMosis 2, 109–35 andDe spec. leg. 1, 84–97.62At least this must be our assumption, when we read Josephus’ report on theoracularXashing of the stones on the High Priest’s robe (indicating God’s presence orvictory). ThisXashing, says Josephus, stopped 200 years before he wrote theAntiqui-ties(Ant.

The only pragmatic descriptionmade by Philo with regard to the Day of Atonement is inaccurate, butat the same time extremely amusing:For all inside is unseen except by the high priest alone, and indeed he,though charged with the duty of entering once a year, gets no view ofanything. For he takes with him a brazier full of lighted coals and incense,and the great quantity of vapour which this naturally gives forth coverseverything around it, beclouds the eyesight and prevents it from being ableto penetrate to any distance. (De spec. legibus 1, 72, Loeb tr.)Philo considers to be very signiWcant the fact that on the Day ofAtonement the High Priest enters the Holy of Holies having taken oVhis decorated full-length robe. Philo even says that the High Priestenters the Holy of Holies naked (!): ‘to pour as a libation the blood ofthe soul and to oVer as incense the whole mind to God our Saviourand Benefactor’ (Legum allegoria 2, 56, Loeb tr.).In the treatiseQuis rerum divinarum heres(82–4), Philo uses theimage of the High Priest entering the Holy of Holies as a justiWcation ofa tautology in the Bible, namely ‘he led him out outside’ (K\u0017ªÆª\r\f \u000bbÆP\u0012e\f \u0018\u0017ø, Gen. 15: 5). On the day of Atonement the High Priest is atthe same time ‘in’ and ‘out’: his body might seem to be in the Holy ofHolies, but his mind is out of this world. That is why he is not a man‘until he comes out’ (\u001eø\u0010 i\f K\u0017\u0015ºŁfi\u0019,Lev. 16: 17), that is, until his mindis in the heavens.6765In the expression ‘if the High Priest sins’ (Lev. 4: 3), Philo adds the adverb‘involuntarily’ (De spec. leg. 1, 230), which he takes from the previous verse. See theLoeb edition, vol. 7, p. 233, note b.66On the High Priest’s unsinfulness, see alsoDe fuga et inventione108.67Of course, this is a wrong interpretation of Lev. 16: 17, where the meaning isthat nobody can enter the Temple before the priest comes out of it.Jewish Animal SacriWce157"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"(c) SacriWcial allegorizationsExtremely interesting are the passageswhere PhiloWnds parallels between the High-Priestly robe andsacriWcial victims. Trying to justify the division of the sacriWcialvictims, Philo brings forward as corroborative evidence the divisioninto equal parts of many things; among them there is the High-Priestlyrobe, whose emeralds with the symbols of the tribes of Israel areequally set on the right and on the left side (Quis rerum div. heres,176).The colours of the animals in Jacob’s vision are to be found in theHigh-Priestly vestments and ritual gestures (De somniis 1, 213–17):before sacriWcing, the High Priest must purify himself with ashes andwater—this corresponds to the ash-sprinkled animals in Jacob’svision. Then, the High Priest is to wear his robe with the variegatedbreastplate on it—which stands for the variegated animals in thesame vision. And,Wnally, on the Day of Atonement the High Priest isto wear the pure-white linen robe, which corresponds to the pure-white animals in the vision.Puzzling also is the question about thepetalon(a part of the HighPriest’s headgear): its purity is compared with the purity of a lamb!(Questions and Answers on Exodus, bk. 2, q. 121).Philo has numerous references to the High Priesthood. He believesthat this oYce is invested with the highest prestige, and only worthymen can have it. The High Priesthood is of cosmic signiWcance, andin it all parts of the world are connected both with one another andwith God. The High Priest is not only invested with a cosmic role,but also with a universal one, since he is the mediator between allhumans and God.4. The ordinary Temple staVin PhiloAs regards the ordinary Temple staV, here I focus on passages in Philowhich mainly concern the relation of the ordinary priests to theprocedure of animal sacriWce.Where the original appointment of the priests by Moses is de-scribed, Philo identiWes the oVering of sacriWces as the task only ofthose worthy of performing it, and so he gives a special value to thepriests: ‘the most suitable persons should be chosen as priests, andlearn in good time how they should proceed to bring the oVerings tothe altar and perform the holy rites’ (De vita Mosis 2, 141, Loeb tr.).6868The High Priest only exceptionally went up to the altar to oVer sacriWces alongwith the priests (Jos.BJV.230).158Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"According to Philo, sacriWces also deWne the way in which thepriestly garments are made: the clothes which the priest wears consistof a linen tunic and breeches. The tunic allows the priest to movequickly and freely, when he has to carry the victims, the libations, and,in general, everything related to sacriWces. The breeches are neededbecause, during his ministry before the altar, the priest must have thelower part of his body covered (De spec. legibus 1, 83).69Emphasizing the importance of the division of victims, and ingeneral, of everything (De agricultura127–30), Philo provides uswith an item of information about priests. He mentions that somepeople are assigned to carry out the job of scrutinizing the animals,and that these people are called by some\tø\t\b\u0003Œ\u000f\u0007\bØ(Xaw-spiers,ibid. 130). As this term is not to be found in the Septuagint, it ispresumably a term coined by Greek-speaking Jews. Talking elsewhereaboutXaw-spiers, Philo does not use the term\tø\t\b\u0003Œ\u000f\u0007\bØ, butspeciWes that these were a very special category of priests, anddescribes their duties: ‘the most highly approved of the priests,selected as most suitable for the inspection ofXaws, examine thevictims from the head to the extremities of the feet, both the visibleparts and those which are concealed under the belly and thighs, forfear that some small blemish has passed unobserved’ (De spec. legibus1,166, Loeb tr., slightly modiWed). After this naturalistic description,Philo seems to recall himself to order by means of an allegorization:‘The examination is carried out with this excessive minuteness inconsideration not of the victims oVered but of the innocence of thosewho oVer them’ (ibid. 167).The Law orders that the priest be sober during his ministry (Deebrietate, 2).70The expression used here by Philo is\f\u0019\u0005\u0006ºØÆ Ł\u0002\rØ\f,which literally refers to the wineless oVerings of the priests. The shiftfrom the quality of the victim to that of the oVerer is a strange one,and is also to be found in Sophocles and Plutarch.7169On the priestly garments, see alsoDe vita Mosis 2, 144, in the context of theoriginal ‘investiture’ of the Levitical tribe. Josephus informs us that the physicallydefective, and thus non-oYciating, priests wore ordinary clothes:BJV.228.70See alsoDe spec. leg. 4, 188–92, where Philo explains the regulation ordering thepriests’ sobriety by the necessity of their having clear thinking during their making ofdecisions.71Oed.

This piety shewn by so populousa nation made it needful to have also a number of temple attendantsto help in the sacred services’ (De vita Mosis 2, 159, Loeb tr.).The reason for the appointment of the Levites as Temple attend-ants, and the historical explanation of the distinction between priestsand Temple attendants, is to be found inDe vita Mosis 2, 159–86.Philo’s narration does not clarify how the term ‘Levites’ could des-ignate both the whole tribe and the Temple attendants only, an issuewhich goes back to the Pentateuch.72However, without insisting onthe use of terms, he makes clear the diVerence between two groups ofministers; it lies in their distance from the altar:Now the consecrated persons consisted of more than one order (\bP \t\u0004Æ \u0012\u0006\u0017Ø\u0010\u0012H\f ƒ\ræø\t\u0015\fø\f).

(ibid.174, Loeb tr.)AsinthecaseofGreekreligion,animalsacriWces were ofWnancialimportance for the priests (but not for the Temple attendants),since, among their revenues, the latter received perquisites consist-ing in parts of the bodies of sacriWcial victims (De spec. legibus 1,145–51).73Despite the fact that Philo lived far from Jerusalem, he was quitefamiliar with the character of the Temple personnel. He was aware ofthe distinction between higher and lower personnel in the same‘priestly’ tribe of Levi, but his lack of clarity on the use of the term‘Levite’ goes back to the Pentateuch. In any case, the distinguishingcharacteristic of the hierarchically higher staVin the Temple was theirpurely ritual duties, namely, the oVering of sacriWces and prayers.72See de Vaux (19733), 361–6.73From Josephus (BJV.228) we learn that even the priests who could not oYciatebecause of some physical blemish received their birthright portions (\t\ræ\u0004\u000b\r\u0010).160Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"5. Philo’s treatment of animals: overlap of dietary and sacriWciallaws; symbolismsIn only a few passages does Philo talk about living animals, either aspart of the natural world or as domesticatedXocks and herds. Inmost other instances animals are referred to as sacriWcial victims or asedible matter. In this section my emphasis is mainly on passagesdealing with the sacriWcial aspect of animals.One should note here that the animal species oVered in JewishsacriWces were oxen, lambs, kids, rams, pigeons, and turtle-doves.74Jews never oVered swine (see above, pp. 139–40, on Antiochos deWl-ing the Temple); indeed they abstained from eating pork.75Jews werealso opposed to excessively large oVerings of tame animals.76In a passage conveying a small ecological message (De providentia69–72), Philo shifts the blame for the enjoyment of delicious animalsfrom God to man: God is not to blame for the creation of a variety ofspecies, but man is to blame for his gluttony when he eats them.Man’s saving grace is the existence of certain people who abstainfrom every sort of meat and only live on vegetables. The ecologicalmessage drawn from the passage is that the variety in nature shouldnot be exploited by man by all means, because variety exists to givebeauty to the natural world.Animals as foodWhat is important to our subject is the fact that Philoinsists on the distinction between animals suitable for food andanimals suitable for sacriWce.77He lists ten kinds of animal,distinguishing them into three suitable for sacriWce (sheep, oxen, andgoats) and seven suitable for food (Questions and Answers on Exodus,74See Leviticus,passim.75See Jos.ApionII.137.76Ibid. 138–9.77Despite his approval of vegetarianism, when Philo allegorizes the curse ‘thoushalt eat the grass of theWeld’ (Gen. 3: 17), he gives a diVerent meaning to the word‘grass’. In a deprecatory way, he says that grass symbolizes food, typical of anirrational animal, in contrast with divine foods, typical of a rational creature (Ques-tions and Answers on Genesis, bk. 1, q. 50).His position, though, is ambiguous when (in ibid. bk. 2, q. 58) he interprets theverse: ‘As the herbs of fodder I have given you all things’ (Gen. 9: 3). Philo does notexclude an interpretation allowing for the consumption of meat. But he himselfwould prefer to think that this verse mainly enjoins vegetarianism. The passage isdiYcult to understand (unfortunately we do not have it in Greek), but it seems thatPhilo is not absolute with regard to abstinence from meat; it is impossible thateveryone should comply with vegetarianism, he says.Jewish Animal SacriWce161"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"bk.2,q.101).78InDe spec. legibus 1(162–7) he adds two kinds ofbirds suitable for sacriWce, that is the turtle-dove and the pigeon;79One wonders whether the species oVered in sacriWce could also beeaten in a non-ritual context; probably yes, since elsewhere Philoincludes sacriWceable birds and land animals among the ediblespecies, without any further speciWcation (De spec. legibus 4,105,117).Philo thoroughly analyses Jewish food laws when he speciWeswhich animals were allowed to be eaten, which not, and why (ibid.100–18). Here we are concerned with cases in which Jewish food lawsalso have inXuence on the treatment of sacriWced animals. Thesecases usually concern prohibitions on eating certain parts of thevictim’s body, and are treated below.80Striving to give reasons forthese prohibitions, Philo reaches the peak of his inventiveness.Prohibition of blood and fat—their symbolismsDiscussing theundesirability of strangulation (De spec. legibus 4,122–3),Philotakesthe opportunity to talk about the law forbidding consumption of bloodand fat (De spec. legibus 4, 122–5. See Lev. 3: 17, 7: 22–7, 17: 10–14.)Explaining that blood is the essence of the soul, Philo speciWes that thesoul which is contained in blood is not the reasonable one, but thatwhich makes the senses function. The source for the reasonable soul isthe divine spirit of ethereal nature. Philo is carried away in describingthe ethereal spirit, and does not dwell much on blood.However, in the treatiseQuestions and Answers on Genesis(bk. 2, q.59) Philo discusses the issue more extensively, this time talking aboutGen. 9: 4 (‘Flesh in the blood of the soul you shall not eat’).81He saysthat the soul consists of three parts, nutritive, sense-perceptive, andrational. Spirit is the source of the rational part, and blood is the sourceof the two others. To prove that blood is the substance of soul, Philocites the verses from Lev. 17: 11, (bis) 14 (‘the soul of allXesh is its78See Deut. 14: 5. There, no distinction is made between the two groups ofanimals, but Philo combined this passage with the evidence found in Leviticus,where only certain species are referred to as sacriWcial victims.79The evidence is again drawn from Leviticus 1: 14.80Philo presents the whole section on food regulations inDe spec. leg. 4in order tojustify the tenth commandment, which forbids desire of other people’s belongings.But see the Loeb edition, vol. 8, pp. ix–x.81Here, I do not follow the Loeb edition (suppl. I,Questions on Genesis, pp. 144–5),which translatespsyche ̄sas ‘of life’.162Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"blood’). Philo is too willing to separate things material from thingsimmaterial, and he seizes on details in the biblical text toWndarguments for this. Thus, he praises the accuracy of the Leviticalexpression ‘soul of allXesh’, which conWrms that ‘Xesh’ does notimply mind and reXection. He continues, using the biblical text asa proof of his interpretation, by saying that the expression ‘blood ofthe soul’ (from Gen. 9: 4) indicates the diVerent nature of blood andsoul, with the soul exclusively consisting of spirit, even if in coexist-ence with blood.82Philo’s use of non-sacriWcial regulations fromGenesis along with sacriWcial ones from Leviticus conWrms the fact,already known from the Pentateuch, that the blood prohibitionapplied to both religious and secular slaughter.At a diVerent level, independent of the blood prohibition, and inthe context of the sacriWce marking God’s Covenant with Israel (Ques-tionsandAnswersonExodus, bk. 2, qq. 35–6), blood acquires an evenmore important dimension, as it symbolizes the common links createdin the community because of the participation in sacriWces (q. 35): ‘theblood is a symbol of family kinship’ (ibid. q. 36, Loeb tr.). PhilospeciWes that this is not natural kinship, but one which has its sourcein unifying wisdom. He hastens to take exception to the similar con-ditions reigning in pagan sacriWces. Kinship based on wisdom cannotbe found among polytheists, since the latter have diverse opinions,which cause disputes (ibid.).The overlap between religious and secular is also obvious in Philo’sreference to the prohibition on fat. Not referring to sacriWce, Philosays that fat is forbidden, because it is the thickest part in the animal’sbody; so, abstinence from fat leads man to self-restraint and teacheshim to prefer toil to things easily acquired (De spec. leg. 4, 124).83Just82Philo’s laborious attempt to separate the material from the immaterial seemscontradictory to his statement inDe spec. leg. 1, 205, where he deals with the use ofblood in the case of a burnt oVering: according to the relevant regulation in Leviticus(1: 3V.), the blood of the burnt oVering must be poured in a circle round the altar.Philo says that this act symbolizes the soul’s libation. But how could this be true, sincein the aforementioned passages Philo struggled to show that blood and soul are ofdiVerent nature? The key to the answer may be the statement that blood and soul aremixed in the veins and arteries (q. 59 in bk. 2 ofQuestions and Answers on Genesis).83On food regulations inDe spec. leg. 4, see n. 80 above. Rules about blood and fatare also dealt with in connection with the prohibitions of mixing leaven and blood,and of consuming the fat the following day (Questions and Answers on Exodus, bk. 2,qq. 14–15, see Exod. 23: 18).Jewish Animal SacriWce163"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"after this remark, Philo inserts the prohibition on fat in the context ofsacriWcial cult: ‘...witheveryvictim these two, the blood and the fat,are set apart as a sort ofWrst fruits and consumed in their entirety’(ibid. 125, Loeb tr.).Special prohibitions: how religious is secular slaughter?Despite hisdistinction between just edible animals and sacrificial animals,84weshall see that Philo has inherited from the Bible the blurred distinctionbetween religious and secular rules on meat consumption. In otherwords, the animal slaughter which Jews carried out away from theTemple was not totally deprived of a ritual character.This is shown, for instance, in the case of strangulation as amethod of killing (De spec. legibus 4, 122). Philo expresses himselfvery categorically as to the eating of animals which have been stran-gled. He attributes this practice to the\u0014Ææ\u000bÆ\f\u0006\u0007Æº\bØ, apparentlybecause he regards it as a barbarous practice. The reason for whichstrangulation is not indicated as a way of killing, says Philo, is that itdoes not allow the blood—which embodies the essence of the soul(\bP\u0003\u0004Æ \u0012B\u0010 łı\u000eB\u0010) of the animal—to run out freely. The expressionused in the text is¼Łı\u0012Æ \u0007ÆæÆ\u0003Œ\rı\u0006\u0011\bı\u0003Ø\f, and since in this passagePhilo condemns greediness (±\u0013æ\b\u000b\u0004ÆØ\u0012\b\u0010 IŒæÆ\u0003\u0004Æ), the term¼Łı\u0012Æmust designate the animals not killed in the right way.85The meaningof¼Łı\u0012Æ \u0007ÆæÆ\u0003Œ\rı\u0006\u0011\bı\u0003Ø\fwould then be ‘cooking them withouthaving killed them in the right way’.86The fact that a Jewish writeruses a Greek root [Łı-], which most often designates sacriWcialkilling, in order to denote a secular slaughter, suggests that theeveryday Jewish practice of killing an animal had a degree of sanctity.As a conWrmation to this remark, Philo’s text provides us withinstances where biblical rules about sacriWce are also made to applyto the secular context (aandbbelow), and biblical rules aboutsacriWce are further elaborated (cbelow).(a) Thus, when Philo cites the injunction of the Law, whichforbids the separation of the newborn animal from its motherfor a period of seven days (De virtutibus125–30), he extends84See pp. 161–2 above.85In the Greek context, a similar problem as regards the meaning ofŁ\u0002øiscontained in a Plutarchan passage on Pythagoreans andWsh (Mor. 729C).86And not the incomprehensible of the Loeb tr. ‘prepare meat unWt for the altar’(vol. 8, p. 85).164Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"the rule to cover the case of slaughter for eating (\u0007æe\u0010K\u000bø\u000b\f),87whereas the regulations in Lev. 22: 27 and inExod. 22: 29 (here only about theWrstborn) only forbidsacriWceof the newborn (sheep, goats, and oxen).(b) Another biblical regulation, apparently forbidding thereli-giousslaughter of mother and oVspring animals on the sameday (Lev. 22: 28),88is analysed by Philo into two prohibitions,one of sacriWce and one of eating (De virtutibus134–6). If it isfor sacriWce that such a slaughter occurs, the very meaning ofthe word ‘sacriWce’ is annulled: ‘for such actions are slaughters(\u0003\u0005\u0006ªØÆ), not sacriWces’ (ibid. 135, Loeb tr.). Even the altarwould refuse to accept such oblations (I\f\u0004\ræÆ ƒ\ræ\rEÆ), saysPhilo, and theWre would avoid them and indeed go out, inorder to avoid polluting the air. If, on the other hand, it is for afeast that mother and oVspring are killed, only abhorrent awecould be felt at such an abnormal gastronomic pleasure! ThelimbsWxed on the spit would acquire a voice and rebuke theculprit!(c) Philo modiWes the same regulation toWt the religious contextexclusively, and to cover the case of pregnant animals; as aresult, he cites a sacriWcial prohibition with no parallel in theBible:89‘But observe that the law also banishes from the sacredprecincts all pregnant animals and does not permit them to besacriWced until they have been delivered (\tc K\u0007Ø\u0012æ\u0015\u0007ø\f ¼\u000eæØ\u0010i\f I\u0007\b\u0012\u0015Œfi\u0019 \u0003\u0005ÆªØ\u0006\u0011\r\u0003ŁÆØ)’ (ibid. 137, Loeb tr.).My examples above are taken from the Philonic treatiseDe virtutibus,where biblical examples illustrating the importance of several virtuesarepresented.Inthiscontext,thebiblicalregulationsonanimalsbelong to Philo’s exposition of\u0005ØºÆ\fŁæø\u0007\u0004Æin the Law, and, accordingto him, constitute an extension of kindness from humans toirrational beings (De virtutibus140:¼\u000eæØ ŒÆd \u0012H\f Iº\u000fªø\f \u0011fi!ø\f \u0012e87See the Loeb edition, vol. 8, p. 240, notea.88The verb used in this verse from Leviticus is\u0003\u0005\u0006\u0012\u0012ø(\bP \u0003\u0005\u0006\u0017\rØ\u0010), but the wholecontext is about oVerings to God.89See noteain vol. 8 of the Loeb edition, p. 246.

However, the ease with which he carries out his alter-ations shows that, in the minds of Jews, along with a clear distinctionbetween just edible animals and sacriWceable animals,92religious andsecular slaughter were not mutually exclusive.Finally, the following remarks on the overlap between religiousand secular slaughter in the Jewish context show that this phenom-enon is also connected to the issues of biblical interpretation andtranslation. Let us start from the Deuteronomic regulation itself:ŒÆd Æo\u0012\u0019 - Œæ\u0004\u0003Ø\u0010 \u0012H\f ƒ\ræ\u0015ø\f;\u0012a \u0007Ææa \u0012\bF ºÆ\bF;\u0007Ææa \u0012H\f Łı\u000f\f\u0012ø\f \u0012aŁ\u0002\tÆ\u0012Æ;K\u0006\f \u0012\r \t\u000f\u0003\u000e\b\f K\u0006\f \u0012\r \u0007æ\u000f\u0013Æ\u0012\b\f:ŒÆd \u000b!\u0003\rØ \u0012fiH ƒ\ræ\rE \u0012e\f \u0013æÆ\u000e\u0004\b\fÆŒÆd \u0012a \u0003ØÆª\u000f\fØÆ ŒÆd \u0012e \u0018\fı\u0003\u0012æ\b\f. (Deut. 18: 3)This shall be the priests’ due from the people, from those oVering a sacriWce,whether an ox or a sheep: they shall give to the priest the shoulder, the twojaws, and the maw. (NRSV, slightly modiWed)Philo speciWes that this regulation about the shoulder, the jaws, andthe maw asWxed perquisites for the priest, is about ‘animals sacriWcedaway from the altars (\u0012H\f \u0018\u0017ø \u0012\bF \u0013ø\t\bF Łı\b\t\u0015\fø\f)asmeatforprivate consumption’ (De spec. legibus 1, 147, Loeb tr.). So, withreference to Deut. 18: 3, Philo’s text contains the termŁ\u0002øand not aGreek verb denoting secular slaughter, yet the biblical passage is inter-preted as referring to slaughter conducted outside of the Temple.9390Thus, Philo speciWes that, although the ox is considered to be clean for use as asacriWcial victim, and the ass unclean, the Law did not despise the unclean animal andcared about it by prohibiting the yoking of an ass along with an ox—the latter beingstronger (De virt. 146–7). To Philo, this regulation symbolizes the kindness whichshould be shown towards men of diVerent nations.91Philo refers the regulations on animals back to the sphere of human beings; hecondemns infanticide (De virt. 131–3), and praises the legislators who see thatpregnant mothers condemned to death are detained until childbirth (ibid. 139–40).92See pp. 161–2 above.93Talking about perquisites from slaughter conducted outside of the Temple,Josephus also uses the termŁ\u0002ø(Ant.

At leastPhilo provides us with evidence for the fact that, in his time, Jewswere not unfamiliar with an ancient practice, in which, even when ananimal was slaughtered outside of the Temple, a degree of ritual wasinvolved. This practice was to be pointed out much later by theemperor Julian.95Symbolism of the victims in Philo(a)(Wrstborn) male—female A further Philonic treatment ofanimals as sacriWcial victims is their symbolism on the basis of theirgender, age (Wrstborn, not dealt wit here), species, and body.The issue of the victim’s gender and species is crucial in Philo’sdiscussion of theindividual oVerings, and not in his presentation ofthe animal sacriWces oVered in Jewish festivals, where he mainly dealswith the number of victims oVered. As I shall deal later with rulesspecifying which species are suitable for which occasion, here I focuson Philo’s discussion of the gender of victims oVered by individuals.As we shall see below, individual oVerings could be burnt oVerings,the so-called preservation oVerings, and sin96oVerings.Thus in the case of burnt oVerings only males are allowed to beoVered, because, according to Philo, male is superior to female. Incontrast with female, male is complete, dominant, and active. Thetwo constituents of the soul, namely the rational and the irrationalpart, or else the mind and the senses, are male and female respect-ively. That is why the burnt oVering symbolizes the oVering of thesuperior element, mind, to God (De spec. legibus 1, 200–1).94On perquisites from preservation oVerings. See also Lev. 7: 8 on perquisitesfrom burnt oVerings.95Against the Galilaeans305D–306A.96The term ‘sin’ is problematic.

Here I focus onthe latter.As regards the symbolism of aburnt oVeringinDe spec. legibus 1,206–7, the belly stands mainly for desire, but the feet are given ahigher meaning: their being washed indicates the injunction to treadthe air (ÆNŁ\ræ\b\u0013Æ\u0012\rE\f), like the soul of the lover of God.Division in the case of the burnt oVering is given various meanings(ibid. 208–11). It can mean either the unity in substance of all thingsor their origin from and their return to the One. Furthermore,division symbolizes man’s obligation to give thanks for the wholeand for each part of it. Thus man should honour God and God’sattributes separately; man should thank God for the natural worldand each of its constituents; for the human race and each of itsgenders and nations; for the human person and its primary parts—body and soul, speech, mind, and sense.The parts of the victim’s body are also dealt with when Philo talksabout the sacriWcial category of the so-calledpreservation oVerings99(ibid. 212–19). Since, in this case, the fat, the lobe of the liver, and thetwo kidneys are to be burnt on the altar, Philo wonders why it is notthe mind’s residence—heart or brains—which is set on the altar. Heends up with the answer that the mind is the source of injustice andimpiety, so it would not be right for it to be oVered to God. As for thesymbolism of the combustible parts, Philo is not very allegorical thistime, but is rather carried away with physiological remarks showingthe importance of each part.The parts of the victim to be burnt in the case of asin oVeringarethe same as those of a preservation oVering, and Philo is able toWnd ajustiWcation for this (ibid. 232, 239).100Philo sets out the laws regulating thesacriWcial perquisites, whicheach priest should be oVered (ibid. 145–52), but not without incon-sistencies: ‘It is ordained that with every victim two gifts should be98See on Gen. 15: 9V.:Quis rerum div. heres130–236; and on Lev. 7–8:Legumallegoria 3, 129–47.99This kind of oVering is discussed in sec. 6 below, along with the rest ofindividual oVerings.100The same reXections on the suitability or not of the brains as a burnable partare to be found inDe sacr. Abelis et Caini136–9, along with the misleading statementthat, in the case of the burnt oVering, everything is to be burnt except the excrementand hide. On this mistake made by Philo, see the Loeb edition, vol. 2, p. 492.Jewish Animal SacriWce169"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"presented to the priest from two of its parts, the arm or shoulderfrom the right side and all the fat from the breast, the former as asymbol of strength and manliness and of all lawful operations ingiving and receiving and general activity, the latter of gentle mildnessapplied to the spirited element’ (ibid. 145, Loeb tr.). This expositionis misleading for two reasons. Evidently, the biblical passage to whichPhilo refers is Lev. 7: 31–4, which only refers to preservation oVer-ings, and not to all kinds of oVerings (Philo says ‘every victim’).Second, in the same biblical passage it is said that the priest is to beoVered the right shoulder and thebreastof the victim (and not thefatof the breast, which is to be burnt on the altar101).102The perquisite of hides in the case of whole burnt oVerings (Lev.7: 8) is not given a symbolic meaning by Philo, who only refers totheir greatWnancial value for the priests (ibid. 151).As regards the regulation in Deut. 18: 3 on the shoulder, the jaws,and the maw asWxed perquisites for the priest in the case of secularslaughter, the following explanations are given by Philo: the symbol-ism of the shoulder is the same as that concerning sacriWcial slaugh-ter; the jaws belong to the most important part of the body, that is,the head, but they are also a sort ofWrst oVering of speech, sincespeech comes out of them. The maw is an extension of the belly,which is the seat of desire, and that is why its being oVered on thealtar symbolizes the disdain of food pleasures (ibid. 147–50).The Philonic allegorizations above have shown that Philo uses thebody of the animal as a code whose signs correspond to speciWctheological, ethical, and physical categories.To sum up this section on the Philonic treatment of animals: Philodoes not seem to have had any sort of ecological concern with regardto the slaughter of animals. He is as friendly to animals as the Lawallows him to be. In no case can we imagine him rejecting thesacriWcial regulations in the Bible; however, where the Law seems toexpress ecological concerns, Philo wants to exalt its mercy. As regardsthe killing of animals itself, Philo seems to share the old Jewish101The discrepancy has been also noticed by the Loeb editors; see vol. 7, p. 182,notea.102In the allegorization of Lev. 8: 29 (Legum allegoria 3, 129–31), Philo says thatWerce spirit is seated in the breast; in the present context, the perquisite symbolizingthe calming down of theWerce spirit also comes from the breast.170Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"conception of animal slaughter as a ritual procedure, even when ittakes place out of the Temple.Even in the most concrete and practical parts of the Law, such asthe regulations about the cutting-up of sacriWcial victims, Philo doesnot cease to use his beloved allegorical method. There are timeswhen, trying to justify a regulation in the Bible, he is carried awayby his obsession withWnding symbolisms;103more importantly, onecan easily spot inconsistencies in his allegorizations.1046. On the proper behaviour of the individual oVerer in PhiloPhilo’s allegorizations do not concern only the sacriWcial victims ofsacriWces oVered by individuals, but also the individual oVerersthemselves. In this section I shall deal with Philo’s presentation ofthe behaviour and the emotions of the individual oVerer before,during, or after his/her act of oVering. The questions will revolvearound the following: What are the motives which lead a privateindividual to oVer a sacriWce? What should the oVerer’s psychologicalcondition be like, when he/she approaches the altar? How should theoVerer behave during sacriWce, and what is he/she supposed to do orfeel after the victim is oVered?Philo himself does not follow a clear sequence in the presentationof the stages in an animal sacriWce; so it is for the reader to collect theevidence pertaining to each stage.(a) Before sacriWcePurity of body and mindBefore oVering an animal sacriWce, the oVerershould be pure in body. Otherwise, the Law prescribes a ritualprocedure to be followed by the impure individual. The puriWcationpreceding an animal sacriWce is eVected through the remains of the103For example, the long discussion on division inQuis rerum div. heres133V.104See above on sacriWcial perquisites. A further example concerns the regulationin Deut. 18: 3, where it is diYcult to understand why Philo presents continence astouching the altaralong with the maw. He says: ‘But let continence, that pure andstainless virtue which disregards all concerns of food and drink and claims to standsuperior to the pleasures of the stomach,touch the holy altarsand bring with it theappendage of the belly as a reminder that it holds in contempt gluttony andgreediness and all that inXames the tendencies to lust’ (De spec. leg. 1, 150, Loeb tr.,my emphasis). Here, Philo shows an inconsistency as regards the act of burning onthe altar: he takes it to be both an act of consecration of something pure and an act ofrelinquishment and disdain of something bad.Jewish Animal SacriWce171"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"slaughter of a red heifer (Num. 19). Philo’s narrative almost raises theritual of the red heifer into a general rule, as if all worshippers wererequired to go through the puriWcation procedure (De spec. legibus 1,261–72).Philo’s account of the puriWcatory rite does not diVer from thebiblical one, and he only presents it in order to allegorize it imme-diately afterwards. Thus, according to Philo, the Lawgiver chose ashesand water as a means of puriWcation in order to remind the oVerer ofhis/her humble origin; in this way, the oVerer shall reach a kind ofself-knowledge, which will deprive him/her of pride (ibid. 262–6).For Philo, the puriWcation of the body stands for the cleansing ofthe soul through wisdom and virtue (ibid. 269). The person whopractises these can conWdently come to the Temple as to his/herhome, to present himself/herself as a sacriWcial victim (ƒ\ræ\rE\b\fK\u0007Ø\u000b\rØ\u0017\u000f\t\r\f\b\u0010 Æ\"\u0012\u000f\f, ibid. 270).Philo’s apposition of bodily puriWcation with internal purity, andnot the supersession of theWrst by the latter, is more explicit in thefollowing passage:ŒÆd ªaæ \rh\u0019Ł\r\u0010 \rN\u0010 \tb\f \u0012a ƒ\ræa \tc K\u0017\rE\fÆØ \u0013Æ\u000b\u0004\u0011\rØ\f;n\u0010 i\f \tc \u0007æ\u000f\u0012\ræ\b\fº\bı\u0003\u0006\t\r\f\b\u0010 \u0005ÆØ\u000bæ\u0002\f\u0019\u0012ÆØ \u0012e \u0003H\tÆ;\rh\u000e\r\u0003ŁÆØ \u000bb ŒÆd Ł\u0002\rØ\f K\u0007Ø\u000e\rØæ\rE\f \u0018\u0012ØŒ\rŒ\u0019ºØ\u000bø\t\u0015\ffi\u0019 ŒÆd \u0007\r\u0005ıæ\t\u0015\ffi\u0019 \u000bØÆ\f\b\u0004fiÆ.For it is absurd that a man should be forbidden to enter the temples save afterbathing and cleansing his body, and yet should attempt to pray and sacriWcewith a heart still soiled and spotted. (Quod Deus immut. sit8, Loeb tr.)If the worshipper’s body, which is mere matter, needs cleansing beforehis/her praying and sacriWcing, so much more does his/her soul. The‘cleansing’ of the soul consists not only in not doing wrong (ŒÆŒ\u000f\f)inthe future, but in showing penitence about previous mistakes (ibid. 8–9).The worshipper’s need for bodily puriWcation through an animalslaughter before entering the Temple is incontestable in the passagesabove. Philo takes bodily purity for granted, and he goes on to saythatalong with it, and above it, the oVerer should have pure mind.(b) During sacriWcei. The principles drawn from the case of Abel and Cain: promptitudeandWrst oVeringsOVerings should be given to God in the right way.That is to say, the oVerer should give his/her oVeringswithout delay,and172Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"he/she should givetheWrst oVerings. These two principles are discussedin the treatiseDe sacriWciis Abelis et Caini, where Philo gives Cain as anexample of the bad oVerer, who did exactly the opposite of theaforementioned principles (De sacr. Abelis et Caini52V.).105ii. Categories of private sacriWceHere I shall deal extensively withPhilo’s presentation of private sacriWce, because, despite someinconsistencies, it is the fullest account of individual animal sacriWcefound in any post-biblical Jewish text written beforead70. Thisaccount is to be found in the treatisesDe specialibus legibus 1(mainly), andDe mutatione nominum.To follow Philo’s classiWcation, sacriWces can be oVered either onthe part of the whole nation/mankind (Œ\bØ\fÆ\u0004) or on the part of theindividual (P\u0007bæ \u001dŒ\u0006\u0003\u0012\bı). In theWrst case, the sacriWces are all burntoVerings (›º\u000fŒÆı\u0012\bØ). In the second case, they belong to the follow-ing three categories (De spec. legibus 1, 194–7):.whole burnt oVering (›º\u000fŒÆı\u0012\b\f, ibid. 198–211);.preservation oVering (\u0003ø\u0012æØ\b\f, ibid. 212–23); the sub-categoryof praise oVerings belongs here (\u0012B\u0010 ÆN\f\u0015\u0003\rø\u0010, ibid. 224–5);.sin oVering (\u0007\ræd ±\tÆæ\u0012\u0004Æ\u0010, ibid. 226–46).106The English terms given above,107denoting individual sacriWces,are translations of the Greek terms which Philo uses of Jewishindividual sacriWces. Philo’s Greek terms are generally the same asthose used in the Septuagint. The issue of whether these Greek terms105In the same treatise, apart from the principles of promptitude andWrst oVerings,the following statement by Philo comes both as further conWrmation of his attachmentto animal sacriWcial cult, and as an inconsistency with his rhetorical hyperboles aboutthe unimportance of expensive oVerings (see p. 152 and n. 50 above): ‘Such were thecharges brought against Cain who made his oVering after many days. But Abel broughtother oVerings and in other manner.His oVering was living, Cain’s was lifeless.His wasWrst in age and value, Cain’s but second. His had strength and superior fatness, Cain’shad but weakness’ (De sacr. Abelis et Caini88, Loeb tr., my emphasis). I do not thinkthat, by the last passage, Philo accuses Cain—and, by extension, any oVerer—of oVeringfruit and not animals. It is rather Philo’s speciWc purpose in this treatise, namely, to exaltAbel, which pushes him to present animal sacriWce as superior to a vegetable oVering.Still, he would not have done this if he had been against animal sacriWce.106Each of these sacriWcial types is described in Leviticus; in Philo’s terms: burntoVering in Lev. 1 and 6: 1–6, preservation oVering in Lev. 3 and 7: 11–36, sin oVeringin Lev. 4–5, 6: 17–7: 6–7.107These are the terms used in the Loeb edition of Philo.Jewish Animal SacriWce173"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"are correct translations of the Hebrew biblical terms is a diVerent oneand does not concern us here. What is of interest for our purposes isthat the Septuagint served to deWne the way in which an unknownnumber of Greek-speaking Jews in the Diaspora would refer to theirsacriWces when going to the Temple in Jerusalem.To analyse the diVerence in the individual oVerings above (ibid.194–7), Philo displays here a certain theory on the origins of sacriWce,by saying that the two reasons which prompted men of the earliesttimes (\u0007æH\u0012\bØ ¼\fŁæø\u0007\bØ)tooVer sacriWces werehonour towards God(- \u0007æe\u0010 Ł\re\f \u0012Ø\t) andthe beneWt of the sacriWcers(- \u0012H\f Łı\u000f\f\u0012ø\fT\u0005\u0015º\rØÆ). The latter reason is twofold: a human being wants either toshare in the blessings or to be released of evils. When the legislator,says Philo, classiWed the individual oVerings, he had taken intoaccount all these motives, since:.a whole burnt oVering serves the oVerer’s motive to honourGod, because it is complete, with no elements of self-interest(unlike the other two kinds of oVerings, which represent man’spersonal preoccupations);.a preservation oVering shows the oVerer’s concern with partici-pation in the beneWts of life;.a sin oVering is made by someone who wants to remove evils,namely, errors committed in the past.What is interesting about Philo’s initial remarks on the motives ofthe earliest oVerers of sacriWce is his acceptance of sacriWce as awidespread practice—that is why he talks about ‘men’ in general,and not about a speciWc nation. Second, he does not considersacriWce as the main purpose of worship, but as the means bywhich men wanted to oVer God thanks and prayers:\rN ªaæ \u0013\b\u0002º\bØ\u0012\u000f \u0012Ø\u0010 K\u0017\r\u0012\u0006\u0011\rØ\f IŒæØ\u0013H\u0010 \u0012a\u0010 ÆN\u0012\u0004Æ\u0010;z\f \u001e\f\rŒÆ \u0012\bE\u0010 \u0007æ!\u0012\bØ\u0010\u0018\u000b\b\u0017\r\f I\fŁæ!\u0007\bØ\u0010 K\u0007d \u0012a\u0010 \u000bØa Łı\u0003ØH\f \rP\u000eÆæØ\u0003\u0012\u0004Æ\u0010 ›\t\bF ŒÆd ºØ\u0012a\u0010 KºŁ\rE\f...For if anyone cares to examine closely the motives which led men of the earliesttimes to resort to sacriWcesasamediumofprayerandthanksgiving...(ibid.195, Loeb tr.)There is no need to harmonize this statement with the two reasons forsacriWce mentioned earlier.

His descrip-tion does not basically diVer from that in the Bible. At points Philo’saccount is even clearer than the biblical one, for instance when hespeciWes that the slaughter of the victim is carried out by the priest(ibid. 199). Here, this is said with reference to the burnt oVering, but,as we shall see in section 7 below, on Passover, it applied to the rest ofindividual oVerings as well.After giving the literal description of each sacriWce, Philo goes onto allegorize them: ‘words in their plain sense are symbols of thingslatent and obscure’ (ibid. 200, Loeb tr.). The symbolisms pertainingto the victims of each of the above sacriWces have been dealt with inthe previous sections. Here, I am concerned with the symbolisms andmeanings concerning the oVerer:1. The oVerer’s laying of hands on the head of the victim in thecase of awhole burnt oVering symbolizes the oVerer’s clearconscience. It is as if the oVerer says: ‘These hands have takenno gift to do injustice, nor shared in the proceeds of plunder oroverreaching, nor been soiled with innocent blood’ (ibid. 204,Loeb tr.). The circular pouring of the victim’s blood round thealtar stands for the mind’s movements before it reaches God(ibid. 205).2. As regards thepreservation oVering, Philo does not provide uswith any profound explanation concerning its character, but hegoes on to give an explanation for the subcategory of thepraiseoVering: this is made by someone who has never come across108In another treatise Philo makes a distinction between gift and sacriWce (Ques-tions and Answers on Genesis, bk. 1, q. 62). The distinctive characteristic of sacriWce isthat the oVerer divides the oVering into blood, which is poured round the altar, andXesh, which is taken home. Gift consists in giving everything to God. Cain stands forthe divider, the lover of self, whereas Abel stands for the giver, the lover of God.It seems that we cannot combine this distinction with the analysis inDe spec. leg. 1,because, if we do, only the burnt oVering is appropriate. InDe spec. leg. 1Philo saysexplicitly that the other two kinds of sacriWce are for man’s beneWt, but he certainlydoes not disapprove of them as such.Jewish Animal SacriWce175"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"unhappiness or any disaster, and who knows only happinessand prosperity. On such a person falls the obligation to oVerGod ‘hymns and benedictions and prayers and sacriWces andthe other expressions of gratitude’ (ibid. 224).3. It seems that the category ofsin oVering involves the greatestcomplications (ibid. 226V.). Scholars have questioned the accuracyof the Greek term ‘sin’ (±\tÆæ\u0012\u0004Æ), introduced by the translation ofthe Septuagint and followed by Philo. However, it is not unreason-able to assume that, this term being taken for granted by Philo, hefurther used it as a tool for making a distinction. By this distinctionhe makes two categories out of the diVerent cases of (‘sin’) oVer-ings, which are present in chapters 4 and 5 of Leviticus. Philo takestheWrst category as pertaining to involuntary sins (IŒ\b\u0002\u0003ØÆ,De spec. legibus 1, 226–34), and the second category as pertainingto voluntary sins (\u001dŒ\b\u0002\u0003ØÆ, ibid. 235V.). In the Bible there is nosign of such a clear distinction on the basis of man’s will.109In biblical criticism the whole of Lev. 5: 14–26 is considered todescribe the same kind of oVering (in Hebrew ‘asham). For Philo,however, the distinction between involuntary and voluntary sins iscontained exactly in this passage: referring to Lev. 5: 14–26, Philoinserts sins against sacred things (Lev. 5: 14–19) among the involun-tary sins along with those of Lev. 4, and only sins against men (Lev. 5:109In the Bible the distinction is rather to be drawn between Lev. 4: 1–5: 13 andLev. 5: 14–26, in which the Hebrew terms for the oVerings corresponding to thesesections arehatta’tand’asham, respectively (though they are not mutually exclusive).In the Septuagint the terms mainly used to denote the trespass in each of thesesections (though they are not mutually exclusive) are±\tÆæ\u0012\u0004Æand\u0007º\u0019\t\t\u0015º\rØÆ,respectively. Milgrom does not agree with the English renderings ‘sin oVering’(pertaining to Lev. 4: 1–5: 13) and ‘guilt oVering’ (pertaining to Lev. 5: 14–26),instead of which he uses the terms ‘puriWcation oVering’ and ‘reparation oVering’,respectively: see Milgrom (1991), 253 f., 339V. For the complications between thesetwo kinds of oVerings, see de Vaux (19733), 418–21.Sanders (1992), 108, partly accepts the use of the English term ‘sin’ in the Jewishcontext. He characterizes Josephus’ distinction of the sin oVerings between those forinvoluntary and those for voluntary sins (Ant. III.231–2) as ‘generally correct’.InDe spec. leg. 1, Philo draws the distinction between Lev. 4: 1–5: 19 (involuntarysins) and Lev. 5: 20–6 (voluntary sins). He does not consistently use the terms±\tÆæ\u0012\u0004Æand\u0007º\u0019\t\t\u0015º\rØÆ. (In this treatise, there is no reference at all to the section Lev. 5: 1–13).As for the writers of the Mishnah, they follow the biblical terminology. They refertohatta’tand‘asham, which both Danby (1933) and Neusner (1988a) translate as ‘sinoVering’ and ‘guilt oVering’, respectively.176Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"20–6) among the voluntary sins. Philo inserts the sins of the HighPriest among the sins which he considered to be ‘involuntary’.A further element of originality in Philo’s exposition of ‘voluntary’sinsis his emphasis on the control exercised by the guilty man’s conscience,something which exists in the Bible rather latently (Lev. 5: 20–6).110The biblical passage of Lev. 5: 1–13 is dealt with inDe mutationenominum(233–51). Here, Philo allegorizes the biblical regulationsabout the scale of value of a sin oVering in a very thoughtful way.111According to the oVerer’s means, the Bible prescribes three choices: asheep, a pair of turtle-doves (or of pigeons),WneXour. From ourpoint of view, the hierarchy in the oVerings described in this regula-tion shows once more that the ‘standard’ sacriWce was that of ananimal. But for Philo, these three choices of oVerings stand for threediVerent kinds of sin: sin of mind, of word, and of hand respect-ively.112He points out that the worst kind is sinful deeds, and the lessdangerous sinful thoughts. However, as thoughts are not alwaysdependent on one’s will, they are the most recalcitrant, and so themost diYcult to avoid. Sins of speech are between the two, but theycan be avoided by one’s will to keep silent.Despite the many questions which are raised by a complicatedsequence of allegorizations,113the passage fromDe mutatione nominumis very original in its conception. Philo feels able to identify diVerent sins110Thus, it is only after an internal struggle that the guilty individual makes acompensation to the person he had oVended: ‘if then after having apparently escapedconviction by his accusers he becomes, convicted inwardly by his conscience (\u0018\f\u000b\b\f\"\u0007e \u0012\bF \u0003ı\f\rØ\u000b\u000f\u0012\b\u0010 Kº\rª\u000eŁ\r\u0004\u0010), his own accuser, reproaches himself for his disavowalsand perjuries’ (De spec. leg. 1, 235, Loeb tr.). After the compensation made to theoVended, the oVender must go to the Temple and oVer a ram. Even then, says Philo,he must be accompanied by the control exercised by conscience (\u0012e\f ŒÆ\u0012a łı\u000ec\f\u0018º\rª\u000e\b\f,De spec. leg. 1, 237).111Lev. 5: 1–13 is not without problems. See Milgrom (1991), 307V.InQuestionsand Answers on Genesis(bk. 4, q. 102), Philo again lays emphasis on the point made inScripture, that one should oVer sacriWces according to one’s means.112Philo justiWes the choice of animals: the sheep stands for man’s best part, mind,because it is the noblest among animals; birds look like speech, for they are fast;WneXour is the product of manual toil, and that is why it stands for actions.113First of all, how can Philo equate the diVerent kinds of animal species to sincategories, since it is the worshipper’sWnancial capacity which deWnes the choice ofspecies? In any case, why does Philo not allegorize elements likeXour, oil, andincense—since he refers to them—as he does elsewhere (De somniis 2, 71–4)?

Most important for oursubject is the fact that Philo considers sacriWce both as a mechanismfor symbolizing sins and as an eVective means of expiating them.Philo deals speciWcally with a peculiar kind of oVering, that of theGreat Vow(usually known as the ‘Nazirite Vow’,De spec. legibus 1, 247–54).114According to Philo, this involves the most extreme of oVerings,namely the oVerer himself, which the worshipper makes after he/shehas nothing material left to oVer to God. This action, says Philo, showsthe utmost holiness and devotion to God, since one’s self is one’sgreatest possession. Along with other obligations,115the Nazirite, atthe end of his/her vow and in order to be released from it, must oVerthree animal sacriWces, a he-lamb as a whole burnt oVering, a ewe-lamb as a sin oVering, and a ram as a preservation oVering. Philo saysthat these sacriWces are made in the likeness of the person under theGreat Vow: the burnt oVering shows his/her self-dedication, the sinoVering shows his/her unavoidable human sinfulness, and the preser-vation oVering shows that, in terms of health, he/she is dependent onGod. At the beginning of this analysis Philo characterizes the GreatVow as a ‘binder’ (\u0003ı\fÆªøª\u000f\u0010) of the three sacriWcial types (ibid. 247).At the end, he justiWes this characterization:I note, and it is a very striking point, that in the three animals brought forthe diVerent sacriWces there is no diVerence of species. They are all of thesame species, a ram, a he-lamb and a ewe-lamb. For the law wishes to showin this way what I mentioned a little before, that the three kinds of sacriWceare sisters of one family, because the penitent is preserved and the personpreserved from the maladies of his soul repents, and both of them arepressing forward to that perfect and wholly sound frame of mind of whichthe whole-burnt-oVering is a symbol. (ibid. 253, Loeb tr.)Philo is very careful to point out that the Great Vow does not in anycase imply human sacriWce, which would deWle the altar. The onlypart removed from the worshipper without hurting him/her, is thehair, which is burnt along with the preservation oVering—a sort ofpars pro totooVering (ibid. 253).114See Num. 6.115These are: abstinence from wine, letting the hair grow unshaven, and avoidanceof contact with corpses.178Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Philo’s presentation of individual oVerings is both very systematic,as regards its connection with the Bible, and very original as regardsPhilo’s own thoughts. His exposition makes it clear that, in Jewishworship, animal sacriWce is the standard individual oVering, exceptin cases ofWnancial incapacity on the part of the oVerer. Philo knowsthat each sacriWcial type performs a speciWc function as regards theoVerer’s relation with God. The animal oVered can express the great-est honour given to God, the oVerer’s gratitude to God, or repentancefor a trespass. It is quite signiWcant that a Jew of the Diaspora couldtalk about all these cases and emphasize the diVerent cultic functionsrepresented by animal sacriWces.At the end of his presentation Philo provides us with a highly originalinterpretation of the Great Vow: it combines, he says, all types ofindividual sacriWces. I suspect that this is not so much an interpretationof the Great Vow as an indirect way, on the part of Philo, to teach hisreaders that all sacriWces prescribed in the Bible are equally necessary.(c) After sacriWcePhilo’s treatment of the ‘after’ of sacriWce concernsthose passages where he focuses on the worshipper’s behaviourtowards sacriWcial meat. The eating of meat frompreservationoVerings must be completed in two days (Lev. 19: 5–8). Philo givesseveral reasons for this (De spec. legibus 1, 220–3), one purelypractical, in which he sounds familiar with methods of meatpreservation: ‘It is the nature of staleXesh to decay rapidly, eventhough seasoned with spices as preservatives’ (ibid. 220, Loeb tr.).Another reason is that the meat should be generously given out topeople who need it. Here, we should not think that in the latter Philoincludes ‘people in general’, but only those who oVer the sacriWce, asthe following sentence shows:...n\u0010 \rP\ræª\u0015\u0012\u0019\u0010 ŒÆd \u0005Øº\u000f\u000bøæ\b\u0010 J\f Œ\bØ\fø\fe\f I\u0007\u0015\u0005\u0019\f\r \u0012\bF \u0013ø\t\bF ŒÆd›\t\b\u0012æ\u0006\u0007\r\u0011\b\f \u0012e \u0003ı\t\u0007\u000f\u0003Ø\b\f\u0012H\f \u0012c\f Łı\u0003\u0004Æ\f K\u0007Ø\u0012\rº\b\u0002\f\u0012ø\f......Hethebenefactor, the bountiful, Who has made the convivial companyofthose who carry out the sacriWces partners of the altar whose board theyshare.

The eating of meaton the third day would imply that there is a third element to bepreserved; but since there is no such element, the act of eating wouldbe a sacrilege.As for thepraise oVering, its meat must be consumed in only oneday (Lev. 7: 15), the reason being that those who were so readilybestowed with happiness by God should also quickly repay Him(ibid. 225).Philo also displays the rules about eating, which apply to the caseofsin oVerings (ibid. 239–46). Although the parts of the victim to beburnt in the case of a sin oVering are the same as those of apreservation oVering, sacriWcial meat from a sin oVering is treateddiVerently from that of the preservation oVering, on the basisof three rules, according to Philo:117(i) the meat from the sin oVeringis eateninthe Temple;118(ii) it is to be eaten by the priests; and (iii) itis consumed in one day. This rule is not found in the Bible, and it isimportant that a non-biblical regulation is mentioned by Philo.119The reasons for these regulations are explained by Philo with refer-ence to the oVerer: the meat must remain in the sacred precincts,because it is the sin which must remain conWned in the Temple,where its obliteration also takes place.As regards the regulation about who is to eat the meat from a sinoVering, among other points Philo makes the following: it is anhonour for the oVerers to have the priests as their guests. Moreover,117See Lev. 6: 19 and 7: 6–7. The remark made in the Loeb edition on the non-existence of a deadline for eating is sound, but the numbers of the biblical versesreferred to are wrong (vol. 7, p. 238, notea).118It could be said that this rule has its parallel in the\bP \u0005\bæ\u0006regulations of Greeksacred laws.119See the Loeb edition, vol. 7, p. 238, notea. The same diVerence from the Bibleis also found in Josephus (Ant. III.232).180Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"the fact that the priests themselves condescend to eat the victim’s meatshows that the oVerer has been given a full pardon for his/her sin.The rule about consumption of meat in one day shows that manshould be prompt when approaching virtue. However, Philo stressesthe biblical prescription that sacriWcial meat from the High Priest’s orthe nation’s sin oVerings is to be burnt, because ‘there is no onesuperior to the high priest or the nation to act as intercessor for thesinners’ (ibid. 244, Loeb tr.).In his explanation of the rules about the consumption of sacriWcialmeat, Philo even includes elements not taken from the Bible. But,from another point of view, the Philonic interpretation of these rulesproves more than anything else that Philo does not reject sacriWcialreality. Whereas, in other instances, Philo allegorizes each and everyelement in the sacriWcial procedure, his interpretation of the con-sumption of sacriWcial meat does not consist in allegorizing the act ofthe consumption itself: in other words, Philo explainswhymeatshould be consumed in a speciWc way, and notwhatthe speciWcrule of consumptionsymbolizes. If it were not for some rhetoricalhyperboles against sacriWces in the Philonic corpus, the fact thatsacriWcial meat, the most realistic sacriWcial element of all, is notobliterated from Philo’s interpretative picture would uncontestablyprove Philo’s respect for and approval of animal sacriWce.Philo’s analysis of animal sacriWcial procedure refers to all of its stages.His allegorizations either take for granted the sacriWcial procedure,which thus becomes a reminder of spiritual values, or even start to beapplied after the concrete reality (sacriWcial meat) has been accepted.7. Philo on Jewish festivals(a) DeWnition and character of festivalsIn this section I shall dealwith Jewish animal sacriWces oVered atWxed intervals of time, on theoccasion of festivals (\u001d\bæ\u0012Æ\u0004). These sacriWces depended not onthe oVerer’s personal wish, but on the Jewish calendar. So, they arethose described by Philo as common (Œ\bØ\fÆ\u0004); as oVered on behalf ofthe Jewish nation (\"\u0007bæ \u0012\bF \u0018Ł\f\bı\u0010) and the whole human race ingeneral (\"\u0007bæ –\u0007Æ\f\u0012\b\u0010 I\fŁæ!\u0007ø\f ª\u0015\f\bı\u0010).120With the exception of120De spec. leg. 1, 168 and 190.Jewish Animal SacriWce181"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Passover, the biblical instructions about the performance of thesacriWcial ritual in each festival were concerned withoneritualprocedure, conducted on behalf of all Israel, and not with manyidentical ones conducted on behalf of each household.

Describing the rite of oVering the ‘basket’ (Œ\u0006æ\u0012Æº\b\u0010, ibid.215–22), Philo says that this is not a festival, but a ceremonialfestivity (\u001d\bæ\u0012!\u000b\u0019\u0010 \u0007Æ\fªıæØ\u0010)122during which landowners bringbaskets ofWrstfruits to the Temple. Philo explains why the basket isnot a festival (\u001d\bæ\u0012): ‘For it does not aVect the nation as a unitedwhole like each of the others, nor is anything of those things broughtor oVered123sanctiWed on the altar, given over to be consumed by theunquenchable and sacredWre, nor is there any speciWed number ofdays during which the festival is to last’ (De spec. legibus 2, 215, Loebtr., slightly modiWed).This negatively phrased description contains most of the charac-teristics which deWne a Jewish festival. As we shall see below, Passoveris an exceptional case, but it is considered as a festival in the Bible andby Philo. In a festival: (1) the whole nation observes it; (2) burntoVerings are made; and (3) the duration is speciWed. The secondcharacteristic is the most important, namely, that animals are whollyburnt on the altar. A further characteristic of a festival, which Philodoes not mention, but presumably takes for granted, is that the BibledeWnes the species and the number of the victims oVered.The importance of festivals for Diaspora Jews is shown by aspeciWc remark in the treatiseIn Flaccum. Flaccus, the anti-Jewishprefect of Egypt, was arrested by the Romans in Alexandria duringthe festival of Tabernacles. Before describing the exultation felt by theJews at the arrest of Flaccus (121V.), Philo highlights the depression121De spec. leg. 1, 168.122Deut. 26: 1–11.123I suspect that the term ‘brought’ refers to animal oVerings, and the term ‘oVered’to vegetable oVerings, but I have no direct evidence for this interpretation (see,however, in the law from Andania:±ª\u0015\u0003Łø \u000bb K\f \u0012AØ \u0007\b\t\u0007AØ ŒÆd \u0012a Ł\u0002\tÆ\u0012Æ,v.33).182Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"caused by their suVerings: ‘But nothing at all of the festal proceed-ings124was being carried out. The rulers. . . were still in prison andtheir misfortunes were regarded by the commoners as shared by thewhole nation’ (In Flaccum117, Loeb tr.). This is a sound psycho-logical description, which shows both that, in normal circumstances,gaiety reigned at the Diaspora festivals, and that, in case of emer-gency, these festivals were not observed.‘Observance’ of a festival in the Diaspora cannot have concernedanimal sacriWces (perhaps with the exception of Passover, on whichsee below), but certainly all the other cultic actions peculiar to eachfestival.(b) The public animal sacriWces oVered during Jewish festivalsPhilo’swork contains many long sections on the Jewish festivals (\u001d\bæ\u0012Æ\u0004):every day, Sabbath, new month, Passover, Sheaf, Unleavened Bread,Pentecost, Trumpets, Fast/Day of Atonement, Tabernacles.125Thesection most relevant to festivals is inDe spec. legibus 1(168–89),since it focuses on the animal oVerings at the Jewish festivals. In fact,though, Philo’s obsession with arithmetical symbolism deprives thissection of any valuable information.Philo’s attempt atWnding underlying meanings in the number ofvictims oVered proves once more what I have been stressing aboutPhilo in this book: that he believed in the reality of animal sacriWce.Indeed, as in the case with sacriWcial meat, Philo accepts the very actof oVering the victims, without allegorizing it. His presentation onlyaims at justifying the number of victims oVered. However, Philo’sdependence on the Bible does not allow us to know how Jews in theDiaspora made up for their distance from the Jewish sacriWcial centrein Jerusalem.(c) Philo on the Jewish PassoverReferring to the private individual’sburnt oVering, Philo says in passing that the slaughter of the victim iscarried out by a priest (De spec. legibus 1, 199:ºÆ\u0013!\f \u0012Ø\u0010 \u0012H\f ƒ\ræ\u0015ø\fŒÆ\u0012ÆŁı\u0015\u0012ø).

In this treatment, the issue of who slaughters the victimsemerges as very important. Following the Bible, Philo includesPassover in his treatment of festivals, so he regards it as such(\u001d\bæ\u0012).126The most detailed Philonic account of the celebration of Passover isinDe spec. legibus 2(145–9). In it, the diVerence between Passover andthe rest of the festivals is made explicit:127‘For at other times thepriests according to the ordinance of the law carry out both the publicsacriWces and those oVered by private individuals. But on this occa-sion the whole nation performs the sacred rites and acts as priest withpure hands and complete immunity’ (ibid. 145, Loeb tr.). In otherwords, whereas the Jewish priests were normally commissioned tocarry out both the public and the private sacriWces, at Passover everyJew was allowed to act as a priest, and so to slaughter the victim.(We can thus understand the reason why the Bible does not specify thenumber of victims oVered: because the number of victims depends onthe number of the households observing the festival.128)The reason for such a ritual exception, Philo continues inDe spec.legibus 2, is that this rite represents a thank-oVering for and reminderof the exodus from Egypt. The Jews were so joyful at leaving the landof divinized idols that, after their departure, they slaughtered thesacriWcial victims without waiting for the priests.129Appealing tohistory (\u0007ÆºÆØa Iæ\u000eÆØ\bº\bª\u0004Æ) for these facts, Philo contends that theLaw institutionalized the annual repetition of these private oVerings.A scholarly interpretation of the passage above makes it refer tothe celebration of Passoverin the Temple and only there, where theprivate individual was exceptionally allowed to slaughter the vic-tim.130Without excluding the possibility that Passover slaughteringby laymen took place in the Temple,131I think that Philo mainlyrefers to people outside of Jerusalem.132Philo’s rhetorical emphasison the observance of Passover by all Jews is not accompanied by any126De spec. leg. 2, 145–9,De decalogo159,De vita Mosis 2, 224–32.127Also inDe decalogo159, andDe vita Mosis 2, 224.128See Exod. 12, Lev. 23: 4–5, Deut. 16: 1–8.129The inconsistency with Exod. 12 is correctly pointed out in the Loeb edition,vol. 7, p. 396, notea.130See Sanders (1992), 133, n. 42, and 134, n. 43.131See the ambiguousŒÆ\u0012ÆŒ\u000f\u0007\u0012\rØ\fin Jos.Ant.

Apart from the fact that no reference to theTemple is made here, it is unlikely that Philo would expectallJews togo to the Temple at Passover.The animal sacriWce of Passover was followed by a festival, whichtook place in each house: ‘On this day every dwelling-house isinvested with the outward semblance and dignity of a temple. Thevictim is slaughtered and dressed for the festal meal which beWts theoccasion’ (ibid. 148, Loeb tr., slightly modiWed). The account ofPassover contained in this treatise shows that Passover was an excep-tional festival:Wrst, in that the slaughtering took place outside theTemple, by laymen (that is why the Bible does not specify number ofvictims); and second, because the sacriWce was not wholly burnt, butwas followed by a feast. But, as with the other festivals looked atabove, Passover was observed by the whole nation, and its durationwas speciWed in the Bible.Without knowing to what extent the Jews followed the practicedescribed in Philo’s account of Passover, his treatment is the onlyreal-life picture of Jewish sacriWcial ritual. In all likelihood, theTemple did not occupy the central place in this ritual.Philo introduces his reader to the series of Jewish festivals in asynoptic way. His obsession with arithmetic (of days, months, andvictims) often helps the reader to memorize the succession of festi-vals, and it proves how important animal sacriWce was in his under-standing of them. However, with the exception of Passover, Philonever gives a detailed description of the Jewish festivals in his time.As regards Passover, its presentation by Philo makes it obvious thatDiaspora Jews were familiar with an animal slaughter and a festivalwhich had been sanctioned by the Bible as sacriWcial, even if it tookplace outside the Temple. Passover is perhaps the case which provesthat what made an animal slaughter religious or secular onlydepended on the circumstances. Unfortunately, however, we do notknow how many Diaspora Jews regularly conducted their PassoversacriWce wherever they dwelled.Jewish Animal SacriWce185"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"ConclusionThe way in which Philo saw Jewish animal sacriWce proves to be allthe more important, if we try to use it as a basis for makingsuggestions about what the rest of the Diaspora Jews might havethought about animal sacriWce. Unfortunately, direct evidence islacking, and thus we are obliged to envisage all possibilities regardingPhilo’s impact on Jewish thought.According to Goodenough, ‘if the Book of Acts is to be credited,the synagogues in which Paul preached were fertile ground for thedoctrine of emancipation from Jewish law, however much Jewishleaders of the synagogues may have fought it. There must have beenmany Jews of the sort Philo rebuked.’133Phrased as it is, this stanceseems to take for granted that, along with the rest of the Law, Paulalso preached emancipation from the ritual of Jewish animalsacriWce. As we shall see in the next chapter, this is not stated clearlyin Acts, but it cannot be excluded either.134In any case, Good-enough’s stance gives us a concrete basis from which to start listingthe various possibilities regarding Philo’s place in Judaism, mainly inthe period before the Fall of the Temple inad70. I am not so muchconcerned with Philo’s erudition, which must have been exceptionalamong his contemporaries, but rather with the possible impact of hisattachment to the ritual of animal sacriWce:(a) If Philo’s insistence on the importance of ritual was the excep-tion among his contemporary Jews, and Diaspora synagogueswere full of allegorists who inXuenced the participants, thiswould mean that faith in Jewish ritual was going through aserious crisis, and Paul’s preaching provided an end and asolution to this.Although we have no direct evidence refuting this view, itsounds very Christianized, and, in any case, we have shownthat Philo’s works were probably written so as to be read byJews and to serve to teach Jews. So, at least Philo’s audiencewould have shared his faith in the importance of animalsacriWce, independently of and along with the fact that theyalso appreciated his allegorical interpretations.133Goodenough (1962), 80.134See Acts 21: 21, where the termcustoms(\u0018Ł\u0019) is used.186Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"(b) Thus, we have so far adopted what seems the likeliest possi-bility, namely, that Philo had followers. Along with them,Philo represented a group who stressed the importance ofanimal sacriWce, without excluding its symbolic function. So,we presume the existence of a group (let us call them ‘Philo-nians’), who were neither on the side of the pure allegorists(since ‘Philonians’ respected ritual observance) nor on theside of those exclusively believing in ritual (since ‘Philonians’did not exclude allegory).However, this possibility leaves open the question: which wasthe larger group, that of the allegorists, that of their rivals, orthat of the ‘Philonians’?(c) A quite large number of Diaspora Jews may not have followedeither of the groups whose existence I have just assumed.These Diaspora Jews would have just taken the importanceof animal sacriWce for granted, independently of their abilityto visit the Temple, and independently of the ‘war’ betweenallegorists and ritualists.(d) Things become more diYcult when the issue of the Christian-ization of Diaspora Jews enters theWeld, and when we takeinto consideration the event of the Fall of the Temple inad70.Which group might Jews who were converted to Christianityby Paul have belonged to? As we shall also see in the nextchapter, the relevant Greek evidence for the period we arestudying is silent on this matter.135As has become clear from the examination of the possibilitiesabove, the question of Philo’s impact is not an easy one. Since pre-ad70 evidence is silent as regards the approximate percentage of Jewsfollowing Philo or another group, it is impossible to say how large hisimpact was. What is more, we cannot talk about Philo’s impact at aspeciWc time. His inXuence would have been felt both before andafter the expansion of Christianity, both by Jewish Christians and by135I acknowledge that relevant, even if very slight, items of information might beincluded in sources written in Hebrew, and I would certainly be willing to verify itmyself in the future (when my less than elementary knowledge of Hebrew becomessuYcient).

III.224V.).Josephus provides us with details which are not given in the Penta-teuch. The usual scholarly assumption is that he borrowed thesefrom oral tradition.136In the examples below, the new, non-biblical,element in Josephus’ information is italicized. (All quotations arefrom the Loeb translation, no. 8 slightly modiWed.)1. ‘An individual who oVers a holocaust kills an ox, a lamb, and akid,these last being a year old; the slain oxen may be older thanthis’(Ant.

Josephus used the term ‘thank-oVering’ (\u000eÆæØ\u0003\u0012æØ\b\u0010 Łı\u0003\u0004Æ)ofthe sacriWce which Philo called preservation-oVering(\u0003ø\u0012æØ\b\f): ‘In the performance of sacriWces of thank-oVering,the same beasts are oVered, but these must be without blemish,andmay be upwards of a year old’ (ibid. 228).3. Like Philo, Josephus also distinguishes between involuntaryand voluntary sins (±\tÆæ\u0012\u0006\u000b\r\u0010). He says about the species ofthe victims oVered in theWrst case: ‘A person who throughignorance has fallen into sin brings a lambanda femalekid . . .’(ibid. 231).4. As regards the consumption of the sacriWcial meat from sin-oVerings, Josephus says the same as Philo, namely, that themeat must be consumed in one day (involuntary): ‘but the136Thus, rabbinical parallels are cited in J.

Josephus says on the Day of Atonement: ‘On the tenth of thesame lunar month they fast until evening; on this day theysacriWce a bull,two rams, seven lambs, and a kid as sin-oVering’(ibid. 240).6. Also about the calf sacriWced as the High Priest’s sin oVering onthe Day of Atonement and the kid sacriWced as a sin oVeringon the same day: ‘So soon as this bullock137has been slain, hebrings into the sanctuary some of its blood, as also of the bloodof the kid, and with hisWnger sprinkles ittoward the ceilingseven times, and likewise on theXoor’ (ibid. 242–3).7. As for the victims oVered at Pentecost, Josephus gives diVerentnumbers from those given in the Bible, but they are not thesame as Philo’s either: ‘As whole burnt-oVerings they furthersacriWcethree calves, two rams,fourteen lambs, with two kids inatonement for sins’ (ibid. 253).1388. The following rule belongs to a diVerent account, that of puritylaws (Ant. III.258V.), and applies to cases of prolonged impur-ity, about which there is no biblical regulation:139‘But a personwho exceeds this number of days [sc. 7] in a state of deWlementis required to sacriWce two ewe-lambs, of which one mustbe devoted to theXames and the other is taken by the priests’(ibid. 262).137The term ‘bullock’ translates the word\u0012ÆFæ\b\u0010used by Josephus, whereas, of thesame oVering, Philo uses the term\t\u000f\u0003\u000e\b\u0010(De spec. leg. 1, 188, also used in Lev. 16: 3).138Except for the rams, Josephus adds the numbers of victims found in Lev. 23:15–22, and Num. 28: 26–31.139The Loeb edition of Josephus denies the existence of a biblical parallel (vol. 3,p. 444). However, a similar biblical parallel for a holocaust and a sin oVering oVeredtogether can be found in Lev. 5: 7–10, though the animal species are diVerent. In fact,Milgrom (1991), 310, thinks that Lev. 5: 1–13 talks aboutprolongationof impurity,but he does not cite Josephus.Jewish Animal SacriWce189"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"The MishnahAn approach to the mishnaic sacriWcial categoriesAs I stated in theWrst section of this chapter, on Sources, I shallpresent the mishnaic evidence on animal sacriWce by insisting on theconceptual categories around which rabbinic legislation revolves. Inother words, I shall focus on the way in which the rabbis classify theachronic elements of animal sacriWcial ritual: these elements are theoVerer, the victim, their relation to space and time, the type ofsacriWce, and the importance of the various sacriWcial types (allthese are underlined in each of the categories below).(a) Animal and vegetable sacriWcesIt is important to begin thepresentation of these elements by showing that, independently ofmy choice to focus on animal sacriWce, the mishnaic redactors seemto treat animal oVerings as more important than vegetable oVerings.In a passage from Kerithoth (¼extirpation), the rabbis explicitlystate the equality between various animal oVerings, without evenmentioning meal oVerings:R. Simeon says: Everywhere Scripture speaks of sheep before goats. Is itbecause they are the choicer? But Scripture says,And if he bring a lamb as hisoblation for a Sin-oVering; to teach that both are equal. Everywhere Scripturespeaks of turtle-doves before young pigeons. Is it because they are thechoicer? But Scripture says,A young pigeon or a turtle-dove for a Sin-oVering;to teach that both are equal. (Ker. 6.9, tr. Danby)As the only available proof of the equality between animal oVer-ings and meal oVerings, one might use the last sentence of thetractate Menahoth (meal-oVerings); however, despite theWnal pro-nouncement on equality, the fact is that a meal-oVering is generallyregarded asless thanan oVering of cattle:It is said of the Whole-oVering of cattle,aWre oVering, an odour of sweetsavour; and of the Bird-oVering,aWre oVering, an odour of sweet savour; andof the Meal-oVering,aWre oVering, an odour of sweet savour: to teach that it isall one whether a man oVersmuch or little, if only he directs his mindtowards Heaven (Men. 13.11, tr. Danby, my emphasis).In contrast to the previous ambiguous rules, the following ruleproves more easily for mishnaic Judaism what we tried to prove with190Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"diYculty for the Greek context, namely thatanimal oVerings wereconsideredmore important than vegetable oVerings: ‘The Bird-oVeringsprecede the Meal-oVerings since they come within the class of blood[oVerings]’ (Zeb. 10.4, tr. Danby).(b) Types of animal oVeringsA quite important issue is the relation ofthe oVerer to the oVering. This brings into relief the issue of theintentionof the oVerer, much emphasized by Neusner. The way inwhich the oVerer makes clear his intention depends on thedesignation used of the oVering (‘Passover-oVering’, ‘sin-oVering’,etc., see Zeb. 1), and of theway of making the oVering, that is, time,place, or several ritual gestures. For instance: ‘no other intention canrender the oVering invalid save that which concerns [an act] outside theproper time or place, or, if it is a Passover-oVering or Sin-oVering,slaughtering it under another name’ (Zeb. 3.6, tr. Danby). An examplewhere the designation of the oVering seems to invalidate the slaughteris Hull. 2.8: if someone slaughters ‘in honour of’ (or ‘for the sake of’)mountains or hills, the act is invalid.140But how is the oVerer going to make his intention known, if not byspeech?141The issue of theoral statementbecomes more prominentin cases where the mishnaic passage shows an exchange between thepriest and the oVerer, as in the case of women’s bird-oVerings(Kinnim 3.1, 3.6). Also prominent is the oral statement accompany-ing acts of sacriWcial substitution (Temurah 5).142As is obvious from Zeb. 4.6, only a speciWed number of potentialdesignations makes animal oVerings valid: ‘For the sake of six thingsis the animal oVering sacriWced: for the sake of the animal oVering,for the sake of the one who sacriWces it, for the sake of the Lord, for140Hullin deals with animals killed for food, but this tractate most clearly illus-trates the overlap between religious and secular slaughter.141At the end of Zeb. 4.6, both Danby and Neusner add that the intention mustremain unspoken, but they do not specify where this injunction derives from.142Thepromise of a sacriWce made by the oVerer brings once more into relief theissue of theoral statementmade by the oVerer. Men. 13 deals with the oVerer’ssacriWcial obligations, in the case where the initial promise is forgotten. So, the oVerermight have promised (and consequently forgotten) the following: a whole-oVering, aspeciWc species of animal, a male or female animal of a speciWc species, an animal of acertain value, one animal out of more, etc.A question which could arise is whether the promise is personal or is made beforeanother person. The answer to this question will deWne whether the Law is concernedwith the oVerer’s conscience or his ritual correctness.Jewish Animal SacriWce191"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"the sake of the altarWres, for the sake of the odor, for the sake of thepleasant smell; and as to the sin-oVering and the guilt-oVering, forthe sake of the sin’ (tr. Neusner).(c) Hierarchical classiWcation of animal oVeringsThe MishnahclassiWes theoVerings themselvesin a hierarchical order: there areMost Holy Things and Lesser Holy Things (Zeb. 1.2). This hierarchyinXuences the importance of the oVerings, since any designationfrom among the Most Holy Things counts more than anydesignation from among the Lesser Holy Things.Now within each of the two categories of Holiness there are alsogradations of importance (Zeb. 10). The Firstling and the Tithe of Cattleare Lesser Holy Things (Zeb. 5.8), but: ‘The Firstling precedes the Tithe[of Cattle] since it is holy from the womb’ (Zeb. 10.3, tr. Danby); ‘Sin-oVerings and guilt-oVerings are Most Holy Things’ (Zeb. 5.1, 3, 5),but ‘All sin-oVerings enjoined in the Law precede the guilt-oVerings,excepting only the guilt-oVering of the leper’ (Zeb. 10.5, tr. Danby).Thus, theimportance of the oVerings is mirrored in their precedence.Greater importance can be a result of frequency. Thus, ‘What is oVeredmore often than another precedes the other’ (Zeb. 10.1, tr. Danby).Precedence in ritual is related to precedence in the consumption ofsacriWcial meat (Zeb. 10.6), but there is not always consistency here.Thus, given the fact that sin-oVerings and guilt-oVerings are MostHoly Things, and peace-oVerings are Lesser Holy Things (Zeb. 5.7):‘‘‘Peace-oVerings of yesterday and a sin-oVering and a guilt-oVeringof today—those of yesterday take precedence’’, the words of R. Meir.And sages say, ‘‘the sin-oVering takes precedence, because it is MostHoly Things.’’’ (Zeb. 10.6, tr. Neusner).As for the crucial issue ofsacrilege, the tractate Meilah (¼sacrilege)shows how the designation of each oVering and its place in thehierarchy activates diVerent criteria of sacrilege (Meil. 1.3).(d) Time and place, gestures, pollution, the victim’s bodyFurtherissues of importance aretime and place. Thus, Zeb. 2 and 3 dealwith the right time (e.g. the next day) and place (e.g. outside theTemple) as regards slaughtering, burning, treatment of blood, andeating of sacriWcial portions. The factors of designation, time, andplace in diVerent combinations can render the oVering valid orinvalid (see p. 191 above, the quotation from Zeb. 3.6).192Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Disorder may be caused by the wrongmovement in space, forexample, the atoning power of the blood of a sin-oVering, which isreceived in two bowls, is inXuenced by where the bowls are (Zeb.8.12).

AWhole-oVering that went up alive to the top of the Altarmay come down again. If it was slaughtered on the top of the Altar it shouldbeXayed and cut up where it lies. (Zeb. 9.4, tr. Danby)There are distinct terms forritual gestures, especially as regards thetreatment of sacriWcial blood: the verbs ‘received’, ‘poured’, ‘con-veyed’, ‘tossed/sprinkled’. Thus Zeb. 2.1–3.Thedesignation of the oVering, or its categorization asquadrupedsor birds, results indiVerent ritual gestures. Thus, the Mishnah moveson to an even more speciWc series of rules. These concern the point ofslaughter, the sprinkling of blood, and the method of killing. So, MostHoly Things are slaughtered on the north side of the altar, and theirblood requires sprinkling many times (Zeb. 5). In the case of bird-oVerings, the point of killing is diVerent, and the method of killing isthe wringing of the neck. The procedure of killing and the location of it(‘above’–‘below’) is diVerent each time, depending on the designationof the bird-oVering (‘sin-oVering’, ‘whole-oVering’): Zeb. 6.The status of the person who keeps the bowl of sacriWcial blood(e.g. an uncircumcised person) can aVect the validity of the oVering(thus, Zeb. 2).Bird-oVerings in particular are exposed to a peculiarcategory ofpollution, the so-called ‘uncleaness of the gullet’. This can be theresult of the wrong way of killing or of the bad physical condition ofthe bird (Zeb. 7).In general, the Mishnaic legislators deWne cases ofmixing whichmight invalidate the oVerings because ofpollution (Zeb. 8). Thesecases concern mixing between beasts, either when alive or at the levelJewish Animal SacriWce193"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"of body-members and sacriWcial meat. Things become complicatedwhen the animal oVerings have diVerent designations.If animal oVerings were confused with sin-oVerings that had been left to dieor with an ox that was to be stoned, though it be but one among tenthousand, all must be left to die. (Zeb. 8.1, tr. Danby)If pieces of theXesh [of one oVering] were confused with pieces of theXesh[of other oVerings], the Most Holy Things with Lesser Holy Things, or whatmust be eaten the same day with what may be eaten during two days . . .(Zeb. 8.3, tr.

Danby).Apart from mixing,mere contact with forbidden substances is alsoto be avoided. This pertains to food contacting the sinew of the hiporXesh contacting milk (Hull. 7 and 8 respectively). In both cases,the portion of sinew or milk, which can make the food forbidden, isempirically speciWed by the criterion ofXavour (‘if there was enoughto give itsXavour. . .’).Cases ofphysically uniWed clean and unclean bodies can be con-sidered as another level of mixing, so another source of pollution, butthe reciprocal principle does not apply here:If a clean beast bore young that was like to an unclean beast it is permittedfor food; but if an unclean beast bore young that was like to a clean beast it isforbidden for food, for what issues from an unclean beast is unclean . . . If anuncleanWsh swallowed a cleanWsh this is permitted for food; but if a cleanWsh swallowed an uncleanWsh this is forbidden for food, since it was notbred from the other. (Bekh. 1.2, tr. Danby)Cases of mixing are close to cases ofritual confusion; the latterreach the apogee of impressionism in the tractate Kinnim (¼bird-oVerings), where the legislators try to solve possible problems ofpollution caused by the simultaneous presence of numerous bird-oVerings before the altar.

Joshua, ‘This illustrates that which they have said, ‘When it [theanimal] is alive, its voice is one. When it is dead, its voice is seven’. How is itsvoice seven?

Aqashya says ‘As the elders of theam haaresgrow old, their understanding is loosened from them, as it is said,He removes the speech of the trusty and takes away the understanding of theelders.

Indeed, such anacquaintance on the part of the mishnaic authors with the body andits natural procedures must be the reason why they do not hesitate tocite laws concerning human beings after laws concerning animals.This is the case with the regulations on blemishes of priests (Bekh. 7),which follow the regulations on blemishes of animals (Bekh. 6), andthe regulations onWrstborn children, which follow the regulations onWrstborn animals (Bekh. 8). Both animal and human bodies appeartightly linked in passages related to the oVerings of a woman afterchildbirth or miscarriage. It is striking that such passages werewritten by male legislators,145who wanted to expand the biblicallaws on women’s oVerings:There are women who bring a [sin] oVering [after childbirth], and it is eaten[by the priests], and there are women who bring an oVering, and it is noteaten, and there are women who do not bring [an oVering].These [women after childbirth] bring an oVering, and it is eaten: ‘She whoaborts something which is like a beast or a wild animal or a bird’, the wordsof R.

This listing isworth studying in itself: groups, or couples, of similar, identical, oropposite elements are combined in order for all cases to be covered.For our purposes, though, it is a further aspect of this systematization145The full rules about women’s purity are to be found in the tractate Niddah(¼The menstruant) of the divisionTohoroth(¼Purities).Jewish Animal SacriWce197"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"which is important; that is to say, such a classiWcation is by deWnitionstructured around basic conceptual categories, like ‘time’, ‘place’,‘clean–unclean’, ‘body’ (its members and functions). The insistenceof the rabbis on preserving and elaborating such biblical conceptualcategories resulted in a new corpus of Law, the Mishnah, which owesits particular character exactly to this process.From a more historical point of view, however, the Mishnah makesthree things obvious: (a) the chronological vagueness and the lack ofclarity in the text render the Mishnah unreliable evidence for themeanings actually attached to diVerent forms of sacriWce while theTemple still stood; (b)oVerings by private individuals were recog-nized by the rabbis as an integral part of Jewish sacriWcial practice;and (c) despite its legalistic character, the categories contained in theMishnah make the sacriWcial reality described by it (whatever thismight have been) look as varied as the Greek equivalent.More speciWc issues in the MishnahSome further issues dealt with in the Mishnah are not exactly his-torical, but they could not have been treated in the section onconceptual categories either. In other words, they contain rulescontributing to categorization, but these rules correspond to speciWcscenes drawn from cultic and everyday experience.(a) Participation of the individual in Jewish festivalsThe Pentateuchlegislates that every male Israelite must appear before the Lord threetimes a year, at the festivals of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles, andthat he must deWnitely bring an oVering on these occasions (Deut. 16:16–17). However, the Bible does not specify what sort of oVering is tobe brought by individuals. The information contained in the Mishnahmust be extracted from the following passages of the tractate Hagigah(¼the festal oVering) of the divisionMoed(set feasts):All are liable for an appearance oVering [before the Lord] except for a deaf-mute, an idiot, a minor. . .

As Hag. 1.3 and 1.4 make obvious, the oVerings brought duringfestival days fell into the categories already prescribed in the Bible.The case usually stated by scholars is that the oVerings should be aburnt-oVering and a peace-oVering,146but I think this conclusioncannot be drawn from the primary sources, either the Bible or theMishnah.147(b) SacriWcial or non-sacriWcial slaughter?A crucial problememerging from the divisionKodashimis whether the rabbis make astrict distinction between sacriWcial animal slaughter and commonanimal slaughter. The tractate Hullin, which is supposed to lay downthe rules for killing animals for food, deals both with slaughter in theTemple and with slaughter outside the Temple, and deWnes theframework of their validity. This proves what I have also statedwith regard to Philo, namely, the overlap of religious and secularslaughter, which, of course, goes back to the Bible.Mishnaic passages concerning the Passover oVering refer to theTemple, or, generally, to a Passover slaughter with no speciWcation ofplace; the following passages are from the tractate Pesahim(¼Passover) of the divisionMoed(set feasts):The Passover-oVering was slaughtered . . . in three groups . . . When theWrstgroup entered in and the Temple Court wasWlled, the gates of the TempleCourt were closed . . . The priests stood in rows and in their hands werebasons of silver and basons of gold. (Pes. 5.5, tr. Danby)146AccordingtoLev.7:11–21,vow-oVerings and freewill-oVerings are sub-categoriesof the peace-oVering.147See e.g. Danby, p. 211, n. 10: ‘On the basis of the combined passages ofDeut.16.16 andEx. 23.14 it is deduced that every male Israelite must bring on theWrstfestival-day i) a Whole-oVering . . . and ii) a peace-oVering . . .’. In fact, one cannotdraw this conclusion at all by reading the two biblical passages.Jewish Animal SacriWce199"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"An Israelite slaughtered his [own] oVering and the priest caught the blood.

(ibid. 8.3, tr. Danby)The passages quoted above may imply that the Passover sacriWcewould take place in the Temple, but that the actual act of slaughteringwould be the responsibility of the lay person, not the priest. Ofcourse, the questions are: When did this happen? Is it an imaginaryreconstruction of a Passover sacriWce, or a representation of whatactually happened in the Second Temple period?Questions about the religious or secular character of the slaughtereven arise in a tractate dealing with sacriWces in the Temple: if we areto rely on the title Zebahim (¼animal oVerings), the mention of laypeople in the following passage does not make any sense: ‘slaughter-ing is valid if it is done by them that are not priests, or by women orby bondservants or by them that are unclean, even the [slaughteringof the] Most Holy Things, provided that none that is unclean touchestheXesh’ (Zeb. 3.1, tr. Danby).A factor deWning the validity of a slaughter is the tool used for killingthe animal. But does this rule apply to a religious slaughter, a secularslaughter, or to both? ‘If he slaughtered with a hand-sickle or with aXint or with a reed, what he slaughters is valid. All may slaughter and atany time and with any implement excepting a reaping-sickle or a saw orteeth or theWnger-nails . . .’ (Hull. 1.2, tr. Danby).Rules about the validity of slaughter depend on the designation ofthe animal killed, but one wonders why terms normally attached tosacriWcial oVeringsWnd their place in a tractate about non-sacriWcialslaughter, and also what ‘(in)valid’ might mean in this context:If a man slaughtered [an unconsecrated beast outside the Temple Court] underthe name of a Whole-oVering or a Peace-oVering or a Suspensive Guilt-oVeringor a Passover-oVering or a Thank-oVering, what he slaughters is invalid.

Danby, myemphasis).Another issue is the relation between animal slaughter and con-sumption of meat. As the Mishnah was written during a time when theTemple did not exist, we cannot draw conclusions for earlier periods,but, according to Hull. 5.3, Jews would eat meat on the followingoccasions: Tabernacles, Passover, Pentecost, New Year, and a wed-ding:148‘At these four times [i.e. the four festivals] they may makethe butcher slaughter a beast against his will’ (Hull. 5.4, tr. Danby).Related to meat consumption of invalid sacriWcial victims is thefollowing rule from Bekhorot (¼Wrstlings), which makes it clear thatthere were ‘ordinary’ markets in non-sacriWcial meat: ‘All animal-oVerings that have become invalid may [after they have beenredeemed] be sold in the market and slaughtered in the market andweighed out by measure, save only the Firstling and Tithe [of Cattle]. . .’ (Bekh. 5.1).149The proWt from these animals falls to the Temple(ibid.).The passages above depict a great variety in terms of who slaugh-ters, where, and by what instrument; however, we cannot easilyreconcile them with what we know about the Temple beforead70.So it would be safer if we thought of this variety as resulting from thedebates of the Jewish sages afterad70, and not necessarily as beingthe result of the sacriWcial practice in force in the Temple.148On the latter point, see the detail in Ker. 3.7: ‘I asked Rabban Gamaliel andR. Joshua in the market of Emmaus, where they went to buy a beast for the wedding-festival of the son of Rabban Gamaliel . . .’149The same rule is found in Temurah (¼the substituted oVering), 3.5.

But one makes a hole in his house, so that theblood willXow down into it. And in the market one may not do so,so that one will not imitate theminim[in their ways]’ (Hull. 2.9,tr. Neusner).It is not always clear if some of the rules about slaughter refer to‘paganizing’ Jews or pagans: ‘If a man slaughtered a beast and it wasfound to beterefah, or if he slaughtered it in honour of an idol, or ifhe slaughtered unconsecrated beasts within [the Temple Court] oranimal-oVerings outside . . .’ (Hull. 6.2, tr. Danby).150However,sometimes the pagan is present in the narrative: ‘It once happenedthat a quaestor saw an old ram with a long, dangling hair and said,‘‘What manner of thing is this?’’ They answered, ‘‘It is a Firstlingwhich may be slaughtered only if it suVers a blemish’’. He took adagger and slit its ear. The matter came before the Sages and theydeclared it permitted’ (Bekh. 5.3, tr.

(Hull. 10.3, tr. Danby)If a man bought theXeeces of a sheep of a gentile he is exempt from the lawoftheWrst of theXeece. (Hull. 11.2, tr.

Even at the time when the Temple had not yet beenbuilt, the location of Jewish sacriWcial ritual encapsulated values ofa religious and national character. For Jews, God had made a coven-ant with Israel, the ritual part of which consisted in obligations bothon the nation as a whole, and on each of its members. Since theTemple was the place for both kinds of sacriWcial obligation, the Fallof the Temple inad70 cancelled the one part, that of nationalsacriWcial duties. As for the other part, it seems that individualscontinued to oVer sacriWces afterad70—and some even went tothe ruins of the Temple to do so. However, one can imagine that afterad70, given the importance of the Temple for each Jew, individualpiety was deprived of the highest level of its devotion.During the Second Temple period, as this is narrated by Josephus,and with the exception of the sectarians at Qumran, all Jews wereexpected to worship the One God in his one Temple (ApionII.193).The Temple emerges from Josephus’ work as both a building and avalue. Josephus only gives us a short account of the animal sacriWcesconducted there (inAnt. III), but even this has already provided uswith eight diVerences from the biblical account of sacriWce. ThesediVerences cannot but result from Josephus’ contact with Jerusalemand its Temple—as a priest, he must have seen and carried out manyanimal sacriWces—and so constitute reliable evidence for the factthat, in his time, Jewish animal sacriWcial cult had incorporatednon-biblical elements. Unfortunately for our purposes, Josephusseems to have been more interested in politics than in religion.Unlike Josephus, Philo was not a historian. His dependence on thePentateuch results in a lack of references to the Temple, but, onthe other hand, this dependence makes him focus on animal sacriW-cial ritual much more than Josephus (even if Philo himself lived at adistance from the Temple).Philo does not even inform us about the way inwhich Jewish festivalswere observed in the Diaspora. He only admits that pilgrimage to theTemple at the time of festivals linked the Diaspora Jewish communitiesJewish Animal SacriWce203"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"to one another and to Jerusalem. The only exception might be hisdescription of Passover, which, I think, derives from the experiencesthat he and other Jews (but how many?) had in the Diaspora.However, even in the depths of Philo’s allegorical expositions onecan discover elements of historical value, such as, for instance, theoverlap of ritual and secular slaughter (evident also in the Passoverritual); or one or two sacriWcial rules not found in the Bible. Even ifminor, these small details show that Diaspora communities, even if farfrom the Temple, were familiar not just with the letter of the Lawconcerning animal sacriWce, but with the practice of animal killing itself.A further element of historical value has been drawn from Philo’sability to present and analyse biblical regulations in an accessible way(with his lengthy allegorizations being the exception to this accessi-bility). This ability of Philo has led me to the suggestion that hisworks may have been used in the context of Law teaching. In alllikelihood, such teaching contributed to the understanding of thebiblical sacriWcial mechanisms by Diaspora Jews, even if, away fromthe Temple, the latter could not fully practise what they had learnt.Christianizing interpretations of Philo’s religious philosophy presenthim as looking for a higher meaning under the cruel reality of animalsacriWce; his search—these interpretations run—was to be supersededby Christianity, which annulled animal sacriWce.151In fact, instead ofthis evolutionist thesis, in my presentation I have tried to show thatPhilo seems to be the founder of a new conceptual scheme. MorespeciWcally: in Philo the areas of reality pertaining to the killing ofanimals (species, mode of slaughter, eating of sacriWcial meat) ceased tobe autonomous entities. In the sacriWcial system of the Temple, as alsoin the Greek sacriWcial system, the procedure of the killing of animalswas deWned by the occasion (for instance, sin oVering or heroic cult),but never acquired the importance that Philo gives to it. Thus, accord-ing to my interpretative scheme set out in Chapter 1, Philo connectsareas from thehorizontaland theverticallines of the sacriWcial system:to Philo the material animal and the treatment of its blood and body(horizontal line) symbolize values and qualities which man should151This seems to be the underlying assumption in Hamerton-Kelly (1991), whenhe says (p. 68): ‘Philo’s deeper meaning merely deepens the deception, while Paul’sdiagnoses the disease.’204Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"adopt in the social ethics of everyday life (horizontal line), if he wishedto have a proper relation to God (vertical line).In this framework of the thought of Philo, one notices the follow-ing two functions in his scheme:(a) Philo transforms each and every one of the animal’s bodilymembers into spiritual entities. Isolated examples of thismight be known from the Greek religious context;152yet, forthe Jewish context, this function of Philo’s allegorizationswould have constituted the most important assertion of ritual,an allegorical method undermining itself by concentrating onthe trivial. And it is historically interesting that this assertionof ritual came from the Diaspora. Thus, long before Vernant’sanalysis of sacriWce, Philo proved that the code of ritual mighthide other sorts of truth,153and made an attempt to enter thecollective unconscious encapsulated in a practice—even if hedid not follow a consistent scheme of interpretation.(b) To Philo the material aspects of thehorizontalaxis of ritual,that is, animals, blood, slaughter, are not despicable and existin order to function as means of communication with furthersections of the horizontal and the vertical lines (for instance,the values encapsulated in a pious and just life). And, in anycase, Philo does not go so far as to allegorize the most concreteaspects of ritual, such as, for instance, the eating of sacriWcialmeat.Furthermore, Philo’s peculiar philosophy and the indications in histext concerning other ‘schools’ of interpretation, diVerent from hisown, have made us realize that the issue of Philo’s inXuence on Jewsbecomes more important if connected to a number of other factors,such as: the proportion of Jews who were attracted by Philo’s teach-ings, taking into consideration the existence of Jews who might nothave been aware of disagreements between schools of interpretation;the Christianization of Jews; and the Fall of the Temple inad70.152See Plutarch,Mor. 141E–F.153Klawans (2006), 142, admits that ‘Philo’s is the most thorough symbolicexposition of sacriWcial ritual known from ancient Jewish times’, even if he makesPhilo’s systemWt his own, which is based on the assumption that sacriWcial ritualbelongs to the procedure ofimitatio Dei.Jewish Animal SacriWce205"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Having focused on the structure of the Mishnah as an organizingreligious text, I have concluded that the main achievement of theauthors of the mishnaic corpus was the construction of a highlysophisticated system of sacriWcial rules. As in Philo’s work, in theMishnah various concrete sacriWcial situations were given complexmeanings: what seems to us trivial detail in the procedure of animalsacriWce was represented as of the utmost importance by Jews livingafter the fall of the Temple.At the same time, the authors of the Mishnah were perfectly awareof what was going on around them. However, they did not specify ifsome passages were memories, representations of life at their time, ordreams about the future. The reason for this lack of clarity is, on theone hand, the various strata of tradition in the Mishnah, and onthe other, the insistence of rabbis on preserving this tradition. Thus,even if it seems tempting to exploit some passages to draw historicalconclusions, we shall never know the exact proportion of the constitu-ent elements of the Mishnah: remembrance (the period beforead70),reality (the period afterad70),andhopeforthefuture.In sum, a common aspect between the horizontal lines of Greekreligion and Judaism, which has arisen from this study, is the insist-ence on the deWnition of ritual details. This chapter has made usrealize that if, by an unexpected stroke of historical luck, we had aGreek text similar to the Mishnah, perhaps we wouldWnd that issuesabout what should be sacriWced, by whom, why, where, and in whatway, arose in pagan temples too. Of course, in the case of Greekreligion this imaginary text would have to have been composed so asto cover a great variety of local practices, since, due to the funda-mental diVerence between the Greek and the Jewish religions,namely, the concentration of the ritual in the Jerusalem Temple,Jewish sacriWces could not be characterized by local variety.For the same reason—one Temple and only one—the animal as asign did not play a major role in the horizontal axis of Judaism. Theannual celebration of Passover did not suYce to render the functionof the sacriWcial victim similar to that in the Greek case, wherehonorary gifts by or to the city and omens concerning health anddeath were centred around an animal victim.206Jewish Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"5A Bridge Linking Greek Religion andJudaism to ChristianityPAGANS, JEWS, JEWISH SYMPATHIZERS . . .AND OTHER CHRISTIANSAnimal sacriWce was the most representative cultic element of pre-Christian Mediterranean religions, either at the collective public levelor the private one. Although not lacking in variety of cases ofsacriWce, in comparison with Greek religion Judaism lacked bothlocal variety and a further crucial aspect of Greek sacriWce, that ofextispicy. To Philo, who is against any form of divination (\tÆ\f\u0012ØŒ),including that based on extispicy (Łı\u0012ØŒ),1divination is a sign ofimpiety, because it shows that the person who uses it puts his faithnot in the Cause of all, God, but in unstable elements, such as‘entrails and blood and corpses which deprived of life at once collapseand decompose and in this process exchange their natural propertiesfor others of worse condition’ (De spec. legibus 1, 62).Drawing signs from extispicy would have been one of the mostbeloved practices which a pagan would abandon if he or she decidedto follow Judaism.

And it is very likely that, by going to the synagogue,pre-ad70 God-fearers would have learnt about the Temple and theanimal sacriWcial cult conducted in it. More importantly, God-fearersmight have been inXuenced by those Diaspora Jews who, like Philo’sreaders, attached deeper religious meanings to biblical passages onanimal sacriWce. Consequently, by turning towards another religion,God-fearers would have adopted a totally diVerent way of seeing theverticalline of the sacriWcial system (see Chapter 1, sec. 2). What wasthis way? Would they have been attracted by the great majority ofJews, who did not question the worth of animal sacriWce, or by theallegorists, who did not emphasize the importance of ritual? Or bythe teachings of Philo, who represented a middle way between thetwo?Our knowledge of the category of God-fearers reinforces thescholarly, but not easily proved, assumption about the variety ofbackgrounds which must have characterized early Christian converts.Each background apparently corresponded to a particular way ofseeing man’s relation with God (vertical line), so we should expectthat Christian attitudes towards animal sacriWce extended from theabsolute denunciation of it to the complete adoption of sacriWcialworship, either in the Jewish Temple or possibly elsewhere. NeitherChristian nor any other evidence gives us a full picture of converts toChristianity, either before or afterad70. But the issue of conversionitself is not a simple one, and the expectations of each group mighthave changed after conversion to Christianity.For instance, it is legitimate to wonder whether Diaspora Jewscontinued to take the Temple cult for granted after they becameChristians. Given that Christianity was born in Palestine, in theperiod of late Second Temple Judaism, a question likely to arise iswhether Jewish Christians living in Jerusalem beforead70 oVered3Acts 10: 2 (Peter’s convert Cornelius); 13: 16, 26, 43, 50 (Paul’s audience atAntioch); 16: 14 (the dealer Lydia from Thyateira); 17: 4, 17 (Paul at Thessalonica andAthens); 18: 7 (Justus at Corinth).208A Bridge to Christianity"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"animal sacriWces in the Temple.

Finally, itwould be even more interesting to know the feelings of Jewish Chris-tian converts of diVerent backgrounds after the Fall of the Temple. Forthe time being, these questions remain unanswered by the availableevidence.Similar questions relate to Gentile Christians. Given that, as wehave seen, the oVering of, or payment for, animal sacriWces in Greekcities could be imposed on individuals, or be felt as a personal need,how can we be sure that Gentile Christians managed to abstain frompagan sacriWcial activities immediately after their conversion? Andhow could we know whether they did not fulWl a personal need for asacriWce in honour of their recently adopted God? It is indeedsurprising that, although early Christians came from among paganpolytheists and Jewish monotheists, both of whom practised animalsacriWce, Christianity should emerge as a religion in which animalsacriWce did not constitute the central act of the cultic syllabus.We shall see that, among Christians, the issue of the exact meaningof the term ‘participation’ in sacriWcial cult becomes important in theperiod afterad70. It is to be expected that such issues were notdisputed among pagans or Jews, who were familiar with the sacriW-cial procedure, so there was no reason for speciWcation. Questionsabout the limits of participation came to the foreground only whenChristians refused to comply with traditional cults.

Was the oVering accompanied by an oral explanationon the part of the one who presented it?

In fact, this chapter will make it clear thatChristian writers talk about the categories of Jews and Gentiles in abroad sense, without consideration of the varieties of, and the over-laps between, these two groups. This diYculty, in turn, complicatesany attempt at understanding the sacriWcial beliefs of converts com-ing from particular backgrounds. Furthermore, the evidence is sounevenly distributed in theWrst two centuriesadthat we cannot havea continuous view of Christian attitudes.Coming back to my terminology of thehorizontalandverticallinesin the sacriWcial mechanism (Chapter 1, section 2), it is worth notingthat this chapter provides the reader with hints of evidence forchange in the vertical axis of the sacriWcial procedure (relation toGod) as seen by—some—Christians, an issue which will be presentedas an epilogue to the book.However, as in the chapters on Greek religion and Judaism, themain part in this chapter will be given to the study of the horizontalline of the sacriWcial procedure in Christianity, that is, the axiscorresponding to the various realms of reality—for example, ritual-istic procedures, but also human practices, life attitudes, and therelevant linguistic terms which denote the above. In this context,I shall study the issues of Jewish and pagan sacriWce separately as seenby Christians up toad200. Moreover, theWrst century will be"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"studied separately from the second century, since the two periods areof a diVerent nature in this respect.TheWrst seventy years of theWrst century are marked by thepresence of the Temple, which still stood in the period when theexpansion of Christianity had started. The second century is markedby the intense struggle of Christians against pagans and Jews. Thisconfrontation left texts abounding in rhetorical arguments. The con-frontation between Christians and pagans is more manifest in theevidence, because the authorities of the Empire were adherents ofpaganism. In the evidence for this confrontation, a lack of ritualconformity on the part of the Christians is reXected, an issue forwhich the reader has already been prepared in the second chapter.Therefore, along with the arguments of Christian writers againstpagans (in the section below on the Christian apologists againstpagan animal sacriWce), I also present two real-life contexts: in theone, Christian lack of conformity to the pagan ritual of sacriWceresulted in conspicuous diVerentiation among members of the samecommunity, but without violent implications (see the section onChristians as community members); in the other context, the samelack of conformity became a proof in the hands of prosecutors andpersecutors of Christians (the section on trials and martyrdoms).Finally, the role of language should not be underestimated in theformation of Christian religious belief. The adoption of sacriWcialimagery in the early catechetical texts was a revolutionary tactic,which cannot have been completely irrelevant to second-century Chris-tian attitudes to sacriWce. Thus, Christian sacriWcial metaphors will beone of the major pieces of evidence for the fact that Christian thoughthad incorporated from its beginning elements which showed a some-what detached spirit from the reality of animal sacriWce. According tothe interpretative scheme I have adopted, and which has been analysedin Chapter 1, these hints at diVerentiation, concerning the horizontalaxis of the Christian sacriWcial system, should alert us to a crucialdiVerentiation on the vertical axis. The sole focus of Christians on adiVerent realm of reality (corresponding to a diVerent section of thehorizontal axis), that is, the exclusive focus on human actions and lifeattitudes (focus on cult emerging gradually), must have resulted from aradical change in the vertical line of the sacriWcial procedure, the oneconcerning man’s relation to God.212Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"A. THE CONTEXT AND THE SOURCESChristian SourcesFirst century and beginning of the secondThe earliest Christian texts which have come down to us through thecenturies are the Epistles safely attributed to Paul.1In all probability,these were written in the 50s, if we are to rely on the account of Paul’smissionary activity as described in the canonical Acts of the Apostles(on which see below).2Though admittedly not always agreeing withthe evidence found in Acts, Paul’s Epistles can inform us about hispersonal views, and, in this context, they are used in this book as asource for his attitude towards the Law. I also examine Paul’s lettersfrom the literary point of view, since they provide us with powerfulsacriWcial metaphors.Thus, the written evidence for Jesus and his disciples is chrono-logically later than Paul’s writings, since Mark’s gospel, commonlythought to be the earliest of the four canonical gospels, is supposed tohave been written aroundad70. The dating of Mark is mostly basedon chapter 13 of this gospel, because the description there possiblyindicates that the author had witnessed the events of the First JewishWar (ad66–70).Few scholars today would deny that Mark was the main source forthe gospels of Matthew and Luke. On the basis of their dependenceon Mark and their allusions to the destruction of Jerusalem inad70,the gospels of Matthew and Luke are regarded as having certainlybeen written afterad70, with their datings varying betweenad70and 100.Because the basic structure in these three gospels is the same,they are calledSynopticgospels (from the word\u0003\u0002\f\błØ\u0010). The issueof the exact relation of the Synoptic gospels to each other, and the1That is, probably eight of the fourteen epistles traditionally attributed to him(therefore omitting Hebrews, the three Pastoral Epistles, Ephesians, Colossians).Ku ̈mmel (1975) has very good expositions of the arguments in favour of or againstthe authenticity of the canonical epistles.2For a chronology of Paul’s activity, based on the external evidence reported inActs, see Wallace–Williams (1993), 31.Christians and Animal SacriWce213"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"question of their external sources, constitute the so-called ‘Synopticproblem’.3As regards the external sources of the Synoptics, scholarlycritical research has shown that many layers underly these texts,which ultimately might go back to oral tradition. The most famouslayer is the hypothetical ‘Qsource’, by which scholars usually denote acollection of sayings.Nowadays, most scholarly approaches to the Synoptics ratherbelong to the area of redaction criticism,4that is, scholars are notas interested in the sources of each of the canonical gospels, as in theredaction of these gospels as individual entities. This redactionmirrors the historical circumstances experienced by the author ofeach gospel.Redaction criticism has also been used in the case of John’s gospel,mainly as a basis for its dating: the picture of the Jews and the Christ-ology contained in this gospel point to a date betweenad90 and 110.Despite the dominance of redaction criticism in New Testamentstudies in recent years, some scholars have not given up tacklingissues relating to the Synoptic problem, mainly because they connectthis research with the so-called ‘historical Jesus’ question. Thus,questions about who Jesus really was, and where the earliest accountsof his life lie, depend on the thesis adopted as regards the proportionof the diVerent sources detectable in the Synoptics, or the exactnature of theQsource. In any case, the Synoptic portrait of Jesusis considered by these scholars as more reliable than that in John’sgospel (which is probably later, and very distinctive in relation to theSynoptics). Any diVerence in the theories regarding the compositionof the Synoptics seriously aVects the image of the main character(Jesus) represented in them. As a result, the scholarly images of a‘historical Jesus’ can be diametrically opposed, starting from Jesusthe Cynic5and going on to Jesus the Jew.6In this chapter, I do not dwell much on theWgureofJesusaspresentedin the canonical gospels. Instead of endorsing one or more of the manystreams of interpretation stemming from theseWrst-century texts,3See Ku ̈mmel (1975), 38V. The Synoptic problem may be considered the equivalentto the Homeric problem in Classical studies!4See Perrin (1969).5Crossan (1991 and 1998).6Vermes (1973aand 2000).214Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"I have rather adopted a conservative view, focusing onwhat is presentedas happening, but without attempting to interpret it.The Acts of the Apostles were written by the same author as Luke’sgospel,7so in the same period (ad70–100), but, on the basis of thepreface of Acts, after the gospel. Paul’s mission as depicted in Actsshows the variety of cultural environments which a Christian preacherwould have come across. This document is quite indicative of the sortof tensions which must have existed in the lives of early Christians.8From the Epistles traditionally attributed to Paul, but generallyaccepted as not written by him, I focus on the Epistle to the HebrewswhenstudyingtheissueofsacriWcialmetaphors.ThedatingofthisEpistleis usually placed in theWrst century, but not with any great certainty.The outline above is suYcient to prove that our knowledge of theWrst-century Christian texts and their authors9is limited.

The image of Jesus himselfcomes out as the most controversial of all, since it depends on eachscholar’s personal preoccupations and priorities.LateWrst and second centuriesChristian writings of the second centuryadwere developed either inresponse to Jews and pagans, from whom Christians diVerentiatedthemselves, or for internal purposes, that is, for teaching in Christiancommunities.The term commonly used of the Christian writings addressed tonon-Christians isapologetics, and the writers are known asapologists.Even if these terms are not strictly generic,10it is easy to understand the7The prefaces of both writings are addressed to a certain Theophilus. However, weshould also allow for the possibility of a ‘proto-Luke’ preceding Acts. See Wallace–Williams (1993), 8.8According to the so-called ‘Tu ̈bingen school’, the author of Acts tries to paperover the cracks existing in the early Christian communities between Jewish andGentile Christians. See Harris (1975).9The evidence drawn from Papias as quoted by Eusebius (Eccl. Hist. 3.39.14–16),also from Irenaeus and Clement (quoted inEccl.

And it is evident that, if Christians had not been accused offorsaking their ancestral religion or of relinquishing the cultic waysof the pagans,apologeticswould not have existed as a genre. TheChristian apologetic writings addressing Jews form theadversus Judaeosliterature, in which apologetics directed towards Jews take the form ofpolemics against them. It is worth noting that the characterizationadversus gentesis not generally used of the Greek apologetictexts addressing pagans, since their criticism of paganism is free ofextremes.11Christians and JewsScholars have long ago been puzzled by the polarity whichWnallycharacterized the relations between Jews and Christians; that is whythey keep proposing various models in which they try to accommo-date the diVerent stages of Jewish–Christian relations.12However,methodological questions have not ceased to arise.Although acknowledging the Jewish roots of their religion, sec-ond-century Christian writers strongly stressed their distance fromJudaism. This undoubtedly constitutes an indicator of tension in therelations between Jewish and Christian communities of the time.13The most representative work produced in this context of Jewish–Christian relations is Justin’sDialogue with Trypho the Jew. Justin wasborn in Flavia Neapolis in Samaria (I Apol. 1.1), and grew up in apagan family (Dial. 28.2).14After having tried various philosophicalschools (Dial. 2), he was converted to Christianity. His references to11The titleadversus genteswould ratherWt Tertullian’s apologetic writings, whichexpress a hostile and contemptuous attitude towards paganism.12See the Parting-of-the-Ways model in Dunn (1991), its predecessors in ibid. 1–16,and its criticism in Lieu (1994).13The evidence drawn from the Acts of the Apostles, the Epistles, and theApostolic Fathers shows that Jewish communities did exist in many places whereChristianityXourished. On Jews in Asia Minor, see Trebilco (1991), and Schu ̈rer(1973–87), vol. 3, pp.17–36. The interaction between Jews and Christians in AsiaMinor is the theme of Lieu (1996). The issue of the reliability or not of Christiansources as regards their representation of the Jews is outside the scope of this book.14On Justin’s multicultural identity, see Millar (1993b), 227–8.216Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Bar-Kochba (Dial. 1.3, 9.3) suggest that he was born in aboutad100–10.

Hist. 4.18.6), betweena Christian from Samaria, Justin, and a Jewish fugitive from Palestine,Trypho.15Both are supposedly trained in philosophy. TheDialoguemust have been written in the periodad150–60, indeed after Justin’sFirst Apology(Dial. 120.6), but its dramatic setting is the aftermath ofthe Bar-Kochba revolt (Dial. 1.3, 9.3, 16.2, 19.2, 40.2, 46.2).16In Justin’sDialogue with Tryphoone canWnd the most representativesample of Christian polemics against contemporary Judaism.17Pre-Jesus Judaism is accepted and honoured by Justin simply because OldTestament prophecy and ritual, including sacriWce, pointed to Christ.TheDialogueis an exposition of the rhetorical techniques of superses-sion by means of which Christians interpreted pre-Jesus Judaism.Christians and pagansTo describe both Greek and Roman polytheists as ‘pagans’ impliesthat one perceives the Greek and Roman religious systems as sharingcommon characteristics.

Gradually thisresulted in their prosecution before and persecution by pagan au-thorities. The historical conditions of the rise of Christianity aredeWned by the relation which Graeco-Roman polytheism (and notany other religious system) had with the web of power.There has been a scholarly debate over the oYcial form of accusa-tions against Christians before the reign of Decius. As has rightlybeen pointed out,19the researcher has to look at three diVerent levels:that of the provincial population; that of the Roman provincialgovernors; and that of the emperors. In fact it is at the lowest ofthe three aforementiond levels that the beginning of anti-Christianactions lies; in other words, public opinion in the provinces was thesource of the earliest prosecutions of Christians. In his monumentalarticle, G. E. M. de Ste.

One could equally study early Christian attitudes towardsother aspects of the pagan world, and it is very likely that the sameChristian hostility would be found to arise from the texts.29In fact,despite the concessions of the apologists to the possible existence of‘pre-Christian Christians’,30Christian selective deployment of a paganculture in harmony with Christianity was a later achievement.31Only some of the apologetic works have proved to be useful for thepurposes of this study, because of their direct hostile references to thepractice of sacriWce. The evidence drawn from Eusebius for twoApologiesby Justin (Eccl. Hist. 4.11.11–4.12, 4.16.1, 4.18.2) is incom-patible with the titles of the twoApologieswhich have come down tous as regards the emperors addressed.

A deviation from my commitment to restrict thisstudy to Greek Christian sources is my use of Tertullian’s workDeidololatria, a work which advises Christians on how to avoid thedangers of paganism.45The issues with which Tertullian dealt in hiswritings pertained to the relations of Christians with paganism,speciWcally the Roman aspect of it, as he experienced it in Car-thage.46However, especially as regards the circumstances surround-ing an animal sacriWce, as these are described inDe idololatria16–17.3, Tertullian’s comments can be studied independently of anyspeciWc reference to places and deities. It is only the basic code ofsocial obligations and ritual gestures surrounding an animalsacriWce which we need to retain here, and Tertullian’s descriptionshows that he could equally well have used Greek animal sacriWce asthe framework of such a code.47The dating ofDe idololatriais quiteproblematic.48A possibly valid dating-range is that between 197and 208.49From the category of catechetical works known asApostolic Fathers,Imainlyusetwotexts.TheFirstEpistleofClementisdatedbymostscholars42In theShepherd of Hermasthe genre is rather closer to Apocalyptic literature,even if ample advice is given to Hermas.43For a collection of such martyr-acts, see Musurillo (1972).44Like the treatise—\ræd —\u0006\u0003\u000eÆby Melito of Sardis.45However, Tertullian himself wrote some of his treatises in Greek, and he wasalluding to Greek Christian writers.

PRESENTATION OF THE EVIDENCENew TestamentFirst-century Christians and Jewish sacriWceAccording to the earliest surviving coherent narratives of the life ofJesus, the ‘canonical’ gospels, Jesus was a Jew, and the religiousenvironment in which he lived and taught was that of Judaism inthe late Second Temple period. During that period orthodox JewishsacriWces took place only in the Temple in Jerusalem.68‘Heretical’sacriWces were also oVered by Samaritans on Mount Gerizim, wherethere had been a temple before it was destroyed by John Hyrcanus.69In the canonical gospels Jesus does refer to the sacriWcial act;however, his sayings can be used selectively according to whetherthe scholar interpreting them is against or in favour of the actof sacriWce. I list here some indicative examples: after Jesus hashealed the leper, he tells him to go and oVer the sacriWce that Moseshad prescribed for the case, apparently referring to Lev. 14: 2–32,where these sacriWces are speciWed (Matt. 8: 4, Mark 1: 44, Luke5: 14). In Matt. 5: 23–4 Jesus advises worshippers not to oVer asacriWce if they do not settle their disputes with their neighboursWrst. Elsewhere (Matt. 9: 13) Jesus reminds people of Hos. 6: 6 (‘Iwant pity and not sacriWce’), and he approves of the scribe whorealized that love is more than holocausts and sacriWces (Mark12: 33). Some of these cases not definitely constituting criticismof Jewish sacriWce on Jesus’ part, canonical tradition lacks anyexplicit criticism of Jewish sacriWcial cult made by Jesus. The onlynarrations which could be considered as Jesus’ criticism of sacrificedescribe the so-called ‘cleansing of the Temple’,70but even thisepisode is not without problems. For one thing, it is only in John’sversion that Jesus ejects the sacriWcial victims from the Temple.68For a depiction of the religious activity around the Temple in that period, seeJeremias (1969) and Sanders (1993).69Jos.Ant. XIII.254–6.70The episode is described by the Synoptics as having taken place during thePassover of the cruciWxion (Matt. 21: 12–13, Mark 11: 15–17, Luke 19: 45–6).

At a deeper level, too,it is not certain whether these aphorisms contained hints at criticismof the sacriWcial cult per se, or of the way in which the sacriWcial cultwas conducted.Except for the puzzling episode of the ‘cleansing’, the rest of Jesus’career is presented in accordance with the assumption that herespected Jewish sacriWcial cult. Not taking into account the fact thatin the second century this is clearly stated by Celsus (or his Jewishpersona) in his discourse against Christianity (Contra Celsum2.6), wemust cite here the relevant evidence from the New Testament. In fact,most accounts of Jesus’ visits to Jerusalem come from John’s gospel.For, while the three Synoptics present the adult Jesus as going toJerusalem only once, that is, for the Passover when the CruciWxiontook place, John’s gospel gives us four further accounts of Jesus’previous visits to Jerusalem on the occasion of festivals: in chapters 2(Passover), 5 (Passover or Pentecost), 7 (Tabernacles), and 10 (appar-ently Hanukkah). TheWnal visit, during which the CruciWxion tookplace, is described in chapter 12. John’s depiction of Jesus repeatedlyvisiting Jerusalem at festivals has been thought by some to constitutethe main element in favour of John’s historicity.71It is very natural todeduce that Jesus was one of the worshippers during these festivalsand, consequently, that he must have participated in the Temple cultand oVered animal sacriWces. Jesus’ cultic activity is not speciWcallydescribed by John.72Using theex silentioprinciple, we can deducerather that it is taken for granted. (Similarly, Josephus’ cultic activity isnowhere described in his work, even though he was a priest.)With regard to the Passion narratives, a number of excellent studieshave indeed dealt with the speciWc problems arising from the Synop-tics and John.73For our purposes, the following consequences of these71For a splendid account of the historicity of the four gospels, with emphasis onthe so-called trial of Jesus, see Millar (1990).72Vermes (2000), 199: ‘It is important to note that although the Gospels fre-quently locate Jesus in synagogues, and during his Passover pilgrimage in the Templeof Jerusalem, they never mention that he prayed there, let alone that he participatedin sacriWcial worship.’73See Millar (1990), esp. 364, 369, 376–7; also Hooker Morna (1986), 70V.

Thus, if one follows the Synoptics,Jesus is undoubtedly presented as eating Jewish sacriWcial meat. InJohn, however, the question of Jesus’ participation in a Passover mealdoes not really arise. As regards Jesus’ words at the Last Supper, theso-called eucharistic words,74much has been said about their exactmeaning. Although Jesus’ reference to animal sacriWce in these wordsis not explicit, there are sacriWcial connotations of an atoning or acovenant sacriWce.75As we shall see in the section on metaphors, thestarting point of the textual Jesus uttering these words was his deathand not the reinterpretation of sacriWce; however, by these wordssacriWce was certainly given a new meaning.First-century narrations about Jesus provide strong evidence for thefact that Jesus respected Jewish sacriWce, but weak evidence for his rejec-tion of the Temple cult. The ‘cleansing of the Temple’ does not constituteincontestable evidence for Jesus’ criticism of Jewish sacriWcial cult.As regards the followers of Jesus and animal sacriWce, the author whosetexts raise most questions is Luke. He is the only one who gives adescription of Jewish sacriWcial cult, indeed at the beginning of thegospel (Luke 1: 5–25), and the only one who explicitly presents the earlyChristians as being present in the Temple (Luke 24: 53, Acts 2: 46, 3: 1).Scholars have not paid much attention to this unique aspect of Luke,namely, that he took the Temple for granted. How are we to explain thischaracteristic of the author, given that most scholars consider Luke’sgospel (and, therefore, Acts) to have been written afterad70?The question becomes even more puzzling when one considers that,almost certainly, Luke’s audience also included Gentile Christians,76who cannot have been familiar with the reality of the Temple.74Matt. 26: 26–9, Mark 14: 22–5, Luke 22: 17–20, 1 Cor. 11: 23–6.

Even if it is based onthe later source of the Mishnah, the scholarly assumption that theninth hour was that of the evening sacriWce is not to be disbelieved.Just as, at the beginning of Luke’s gospel, Jews are recorded as prayingduring the incense-oVering, in the same way the very early Christiansare depicted as praying during the evening sacriWce.The depiction of early Christians in close association with the Tem-ple cannot be irrelevant to the author’s attempt to reconcile the oldreligion with the emerging one. Some scholars, indeed, have regardedLuke’s testimony about early Christian cultic life as ‘pure fancy’.77However, I suggest that it would be wholly unreasonable to accept asudden detachment of early Christians from the Temple, althoughthere is no explicit mention of their participation in sacriWcial worship.As in the case of Jesus, we may deduce that the cultic activity of earlyChristians is taken for granted by Luke. Besides, in Luke weWnd astriking coexistence of two early Christian cultic environments, theTemple and gathering in houses (Acts 2: 46), which proves that earlyChristians were just beginning to create their own cultic code, butwithout wholly abstaining from the old modes. Instead of assumingthat the most common places for Christian gatherings were privatehouses, something which only the archaeological evidence of the thirdcentury conWrms,78it is indeed worth relying on Luke’s testimony, andwondering (perhaps in vain) whether a coexistence of Temple andhouse-gatherings as depicted in Luke would have continued to prevailin Christian worship if the Temple had not fallen.According to Luke’s depiction, both Christians and Jews used theTemple as a cultic area. But Luke’s picture is not idealized. He reportssome serious conXicts of Christians with the Temple authorities (Acts3: 1–4: 7, 5: 17–42), which culminate in the episode of the stoning of77Thus, for instance, Sanders (1993), 123.78See Blue (1998), 474–5.

We areentitled to assume that the term implies everything related to theMosaic Law, including sacriWces. If this assumption is right, thequestion of how many Jewish Christians Stephen represented be-comes urgent, although it remains unanswered.79From the point of view of source criticism, the text of Acts seemsto be more homogeneous than any of the canonical gospels.80Theauthor seems to have followed a more or less consistent pattern ofnarrating the events. In view of this remark, the evolution in the‘story’ of the Christian community in Jerusalem is not inconsistentor improbable: the initial compliance of early Christians with theTemple, after some serious conXicts with the Jewish Temple author-ities, becomes overt opposition in Stephen’s case, and leads to theexpulsion of Christians.Not being able to deduce more than the information that, at acertain point, the relations between Jews and Christians in Jerusalemceased to be peaceful, we should rather pay attention to the circum-stances in which early Christians converted Jews in the Temple.

Yet more than ever believers were79In Hengel (1983a), M.

The stoning of Stephen resultedin the expulsion of the ‘Hellenists’ from Jerusalem, which, in turn, promotedthe dissemination of their ideas. The whole sequence was the last stage before theGentiles heard the Christian preaching. Hengel (1983a), mainly 23–5.

Independently of reservations as to the number ofthose converted, it is more than likely that most of the Jews convertedin the Temple by early Christians had come there to present theiroVerings. One could imagine that some of the Jews carrying theirvictims to the Temple stopped to listen to the Christians. Whatwould be the impact of the Christian preaching on those Jews? Theevidence does not contain any accusation of the kind ‘Christiansdeter Jews from presenting their oVerings’, and in any case, oncebought, the victim could not but be oVered. But the image ofChristians preaching in a Temple full of sacriWcial activity is worthconsidering (even if to some scholars it constitutes pure fancy).After the expulsion of Christians from Jerusalem (Acts 8: 1), theissue of Christian participation in the Temple cult will only come tothe foreground with Paul, after his return from the third missionaryjourney. The circumstances of Paul’s arrest, described in Acts 21, arethe following. James and the elders inform Paul that some rumoursconcerning his preaching have reached and enraged Jewish Chris-tians in Jerusalem. These Jewish Christians are characterized as‘zealous for the Law’, and, as the elders report: ‘They have been toldabout you that you teach all the Jews living among the Gentiles toforsake Moses, and that you tell them not to circumcise their childrenorobserve the customs(\u0012\bE\u0010 \u0018Ł\r\u0003Ø \u0007\ræØ\u0007Æ\u0012\rE\f)’ (Acts 21: 21, NRSV,emphasis mine). As in Stephen’s case, we can also assume here thatthe notion ofcustoms(\u0018Ł\u0019) includes the sacriWces presented in theTemple.In view of the situation in the Jerusalem congregation, the eldersadvise Paul to demonstrate that he is still following the Jewish Law,and to disprove the rumours about his undermining of Jewishcustoms. It is worth stressing that the elders do not tell Paul to goto the Temple alone, oVer a sacriWce, and so prove his Jewishness, butto accompany to the Temple four people under a special form ofvow—in other words, ‘Nazirites’. As is speciWed in Num. 6, peoplewho have taken this vow should not be shaved for a period of sevendays, and on the eighth day, at the end of their vow, they should oVercertain animal sacriWces (accompanied by non-animal oVerings).8181See also Philo’s comments on the Great Vow (¼Nazirite vow) on p. 178 above.230Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"According to the elders’ advice, Paul should be puriWed along withthe four Nazirites and pay for (\u000bÆ\u0007\u0006\f\u0019\u0003\b\f) their shaving (¥\fÆ\u0017ıæ\u0003ø\f\u0012ÆØ), which would release them from their vow (Acts 21:24).

In fact, Paul must have been present in the Temple morethan once for the oVering of the Nazirite sacriWces at issue, since thepassage above implies that the completion of the days was diVerentfor each Nazirite.83This repeated presence is perhaps what causedPaul to be observed there by those whose actions led to his arrest.In his defence in front of the procurator Felix, Paul invokes hisvisit to Jerusalem as an argument for his piety, and he uses the term\u0007æ\b\u0003Œı\f\rE\f.

Paul wasan oVerer, and to his audience it did not make any diVerence if hissacriWces were not oVered on his own behalf.

There isno evident connection with the narrative in Acts 18, where, at least insome manuscripts, Paul expresses his wish to celebrate in Jerusalem(18: 21). In Acts 21 the elders are those who advised Paul to go to theTemple in order for the Jewish Christians, ‘zealous for the law’, to becalmed.(3) The apposition of the elders’ advice with its purpose implicitlyproves that the Jewish Christians, ‘zealous for the law’, felt emotionallyclose to the Temple. According to the author, these Jewish Christianshad negative feelings towards Paul, who allegedly taught apostasyfrom Moses (21: 21).(4) These Jewish Christians, ‘zealous for the law’, in Jerusalemmust have formed a distinct group, which was bigger than,84anddiVerent from, that of the Christian ‘brothers’, who had warmlywelcomed and lodged Paul and his companions the previous day(21: 16–17). Otherwise, the fear of the elders that Paul’s arrival wouldbecome known soon (21: 22) cannot be justiWed, since the ‘brothers’welcoming Paul had been already aware of his coming. Among these‘brothers’ was Paul’s host, Mnason of Cyprus, ‘an early disciple’84Acts 21: 20 (\tıæØ\u0006\u000b\r\u0010), 21: 22 (not in all MSS:\u0007ºBŁ\b\u0010 \u0003ı\f\rºŁ\rE\f).232Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"(Iæ\u000eÆ\u0004fiø \tÆŁ\u0019\u0012fiB). Following the traces of Cypriot Christian believers(or prospective believers) in Acts,85one notices that the authormostly presents them as coming from a Jewish background.86Inparticular, the earliest attested Cypriot believers in Acts (and Mnasonis ‘an early disciple’) were Jewish, since they belonged to those drivenout of Jerusalem after Stephen’s stoning, and they only preachedin synagogues (Acts 11: 19–20). Of course, this does not excludethe possibility of Mnason being an even earlier believer, and so ofhis belonging to theWrst Jewish groups of Jesus’ followers. In allprobability, then, Mnason of Cyprus, who lived in Jerusalem, musthave been a Jewish Christian.However, if this hypothesis is right, it is noticeable that Mnasondoes not seem to have shared the negative feelings which the JewishChristians, ‘zealous for the law’, had towards Paul. And if some of the‘brothers’ welcoming Paul were also Jewish Christians, it is veryprobable that they felt the same as Mnason. The author of Actswould apparently not classify Jewish Christians such as Mnasonamong those having ‘zeal for the Law’. So, this is a signiWcant hintof evidence for the proposition that what is usually called ‘JewishChristianity’ in fact consisted of more than one group, and eachgroup’s attachment to the Law had a diVerent character.(5) In case my previous hypothesis is wrong, then Mnason and the‘brothers’ welcoming Paul must have been among the earliest GentileChristians in Jerusalem. In that case, we face the possibility that thesepeople were not just less ‘zealous for the law’ than others, but that theyhad a less strong attachment to the Law than Jewish Christians, or noattachment to the Law whatsoever.(6) The four Nazirites appear to have been attached to the elders(21: 23\rN\u0003d\f -\tE\f).

In case they were notJews, they must have been Jewish Christians, so it is likely that theyformed a diVerent group, perhaps somewhere between those ‘zealousfor the law’ and those around Mnason (in case the latter were Jewish85Surprisingly enough, Mnason, or any other attempt at tracing Cypriot Christianity,is absent from the detailed study of Meeks (1983).

They must have been close to the elders, who tried tokeep a balance among Jewish Christians of diVerent groups.(7) The author of Acts presents the Jewish Christians, ‘zealous forthe law’, as complaining in the name of Diaspora Jews, who were indanger of being misled by Paul’s preaching (21: 21). And, instead of theJewish Christians expected (by the reader), theWrst who, seeing Paul inthe Temple, turned against him were Jews from Asia (21: 27). To theauthor, then, Jews and the majorityof Jewish Christians were close alliesagainst Paul. In view of this correspondence, Paul’s going to the Templeis presented more as intended to reassure both Jews and Jewish Chris-tians than Jewish Christians alone. This tone of presentation isstrengthened if we assume that the four Nazirites were Jews and notJewish Christians. Besides, when Paul is in front of Felix, he challengesthe Jews from Asia who saw him in the Temple to appear before thegovernor and make plain their accusations against him (Acts 24: 19).(8) It is unconvincing to regard Paul as a Christian who chose tooVer sacriWces to his God outside of the Jewish sacriWcial context,because what remains certain from the text of Acts is that, bothbefore and after his arrest, Paul used the episode in the Temple asan indication of his reverence for the Mosaic Law.Not forgetting that the text of Luke isWltrated by its author, I thinkit is clear that Paul faced a situation where several groups of Jews andChristians coexisted in tension. Luke’s personal views just make itmore diYcult for the modern reader to decide on Paul’s intentionswhen the latter went to the Temple. Perhaps it would be easier if theauthor had presented a scene where Paul oVered a sacriWce independ-ently of the surrounding situation. On the basis of the present narra-tive, we cannot know whether, when going to the Temple, Paulconsidered himself to be a Jew, or a Christian obliged to show thathe kept the Law at all costs. Here, it is interesting to consider the third-century piece of evidence from Origen, who admits that Paul oVeredsacriWces in the Temple (\u0007æ\b\u0003\u0005\bæa\f \u0007æ\b\u0003\f\rªŒ\r\f:Contra Celsum2.1).Even more interesting is Origen’s explanation—apparently basedon Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians (9: 20)—which attributesPaul’s sacriWcial act to his intention to behave like a Jew in orderto convert Jews (ibid. 2.1). And it is worth stressing that, as we have234Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"seen, Origen did not provide a similar explanation for refuting Celsus’statement that Jesus oVered sacriWces in the Temple (ibid. 2.6).Knowing that the episode described in Acts 21 took place longafter Paul’s conversion, one finds it hard toWt with Paul’s attitude tothe Law as passed down to us through his Epistles. In fact, even whenconsidered on its own, the relevant evidence in Paul’s letters is notfree of contradictions: occasionally, Paul characterizes the Law inpositive terms (Rom. 7: 12,–ªØ\b\u0010; 16,ŒÆº\u000f\u0010), whereas, at the sametime, he sees the Law in close connection with sin and death (Rom. 7:5, 8: 2; 2 Cor. 3: 7). It is certain that Paul’s contradictory stancesderive from his belief in Jesus. To Paul, the reality of Jesus constitutesa line dividing the Old Covenant from the New (2 Cor. 3: 6, 14). Inthese terms, Paul thinks that the Law should be diVerently read afterJesus: ‘Indeed, to this very day, that same veil stays over the reading ofthe old covenant, since it is not discovered that in Christ it is setaside; but to this very day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies overtheir minds’ (2 Cor. 3: 14–15, NRSV, modiWed).It is important to note that Paul avoids synchronizing the Law withJesus. To Paul, the Law was preparing Man (as a\u0007ÆØ\u000bÆªøª\u000f\u0010,Gal.3:24)untilthe coming of Jesus. Indeed, to use the language of electricity,whenever Paul accommodates the notions of Law and Jesus in the sametime-span, one of the two has to be ‘switched oV’, as if Paul is afraid ofan electric overload: ‘For Christ is the end of the law. . .’ (Rom. 10: 4,NRSV); ‘StandWrm, therefore, to the freedom by which Christ has setus free, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery. Listen! I, Paul, amtelling you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of nobeneWt to you’ (Gal. 5: 1–2, NRSV, modiWed). Taking these words intoaccount, it is even more diYcult to understand the feelings of Paulhimself in Acts 21, where he is presented as an oVerer in the Temple.The narration in Acts 21 leaves us in no doubt that, even after theexpulsion of Christians from Jerusalem, a large number of JewishChristians were found there; these were characterized as ‘zealous forthe law’, were devoted to the Temple, and apparently, then, theyoVered sacriWces. But, following the narrative, we have also discernedJerusalem Christians, whose devotion to the Law was of a diVerentcharacter. These could have been Jewish Christians, but we must notexclude the possibility of Gentile Christians living in Jerusalem. InChristians and Animal SacriWce235"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"the middle of this situation Paul is presented as assisting the sacriWcesof four Nazirites in the Temple. Since, according to Acts, Paul usedthis assistance as a proof of his reverence for the Mosaic Law, it meansthat he integrated himself into the Jewish sacriWcial context. But itremains diYcult to combine Luke’s depiction of this integration withPaul’s thesis in his Epistles, where he uncompromisingly refuses tocombine Jesus and the Law.To sum up this section onWrst-century Christians and JewishsacriWce: in theWrst-century Christian texts Jesus nowhere refers toJewish sacriWces explicitly. The image of Jesus stemming from theepisode of the ‘cleansing of the Temple’ described in these texts is noteasy to interpret. The description of the event does not contain clearreferences to sacriWce, and the Old Testament citations contained inthis narration are not necessarily those of Jesus. The sacriWcial con-notations of Jesus’ eucharistic words will speciWcally concern us inthe section on metaphors.As regards the relation of the post-Easter Christians with thesacriWcial cult in the Jerusalem Temple, at least we know that, at acertain point, Jews and Christians in Jerusalem were found to be inconXict, which ended in the expulsion of the latter from the city. Thereason for this expulsion is connected with Stephen’s blasphemyagainst the Temple, but the events cannot be made clearer to us.However, even after this expulsion, Christians kept coming to Jeru-salem. The text of Acts suggests that these pre-ad70 JerusalemChristians did not constitute a single group but rather several Chris-tian communities, each having its own way of attachment to the Law.Among these communities weWnd Jewish Christians who wereclosely attached to the Law, and others who were diVerent fromthem. The evidence is not explicit as regards the observance of JewishsacriWcial cult by Jewish Christians, but it is reasonable to assume thatthose closely attached to the Law observed the Temple cult. Further-more, the Temple was not used for sacrifices to the Christian God.First-century Christians and pagan sacriWceSurprisingly enough, from what one might expect concerning the culticproblems of early Christians, the evidence does not point at all to thequestion of whether the Christian God could be honoured by animal236Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"sacriWces. As I have noted in Chapter 2 (sec. B.iv), even the evidence forGentile Christians, who, as pagans, had been used to oVering animalsacriWces, is silent on this issue. Only in Acts (14: 8–18) do we have thedescription of the following event:At Lystra, a city in the Lycaonian region, after Paul’s healing of alame man, people were ready to sacriWce oxen to Barnabas and Paul,as to Zeus and Hermes respectively.87Paul used this event as thestarting point of his sermon on the real God, in contrast to the usual‘futile things’ (\u0012a \t\u0006\u0012ÆØÆ, 14: 15) to which sacriWce belonged. Thecontrast between sacriWce and the real God shows that, according tothe author of Acts, Paul objected to the oVering of sacriWce al-together, so he would not exhort his hearers to perform a sacriWceto the Christian God. Thus, this is aWrst proof of the fact that earlyChristians objected to the practice of sacriWce per se, a tendencywhich will become clearer in the second century.88Apart from this narration, the issue of animal sacrifice enters theNew Testament from the point of view of the participation in pagancelebrations. In fact, it only concerns theWnal stage of an animalsacriWcial procedure, that of meat-eating during a feast.Here I shall not deal at length with the decree on Gentile Christians,issued by the Jerusalem Council according to Acts 15: 1–35, for twowell-known reasons: (1) we have three versions of the terms of thedecree in Acts (15: 20, 29, 21: 25). This problem is exacerbated by thediVerences observed between the various manuscripts, which diVerfrom one another and exhibit both omissions and additions;89and (2)a possible attempt to combine the narrative in Acts with that of87For the evidence conWrming the connection between Zeus and Hermes, seeMitchell (1993), vol. 2, p. 24.88In the text, the Christian author takes it for granted that animal sacriWce wouldbe the standard Gentile expression of gratitude, independently of the fact that Zeusand Hermes were Greek gods, Lystra was a Romancolonia, and the inhabitantsgreeted Paul and Barnabas in Lycaonian. Modern scholarly studies show that theauthor’s assumption cannot have been so far from reality. See Mitchell (1993), vol. 2,p.30, where the author notes that the traveller in the Roman East ‘would always feelcomfortable with the similarities, a pattern of worship based on the sacriWce ofanimals, the burning of oVerings, and the dedication of stone monuments.’89For a good study of the variations of the terms in the MSS, see Foakes Jackson–Lake (1920–33), vol. 3 (The text), pp.265–9. It may be that the version to be acceptedis that of 15: 29, where clear reference is made to the oYcial decree, but this is notcertain. See Bruce (1986), 115.Christians and Animal SacriWce237"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"the Epistle to the Galatians (Gal. 2: 11–14) gives rise to furtherinconsistencies.90The only certain facts underlying the account of this decree inActs are the following. First, Christian communities quite earlydeveloped a need for delineation of conversion to Christianity,but only as regards Gentile Christians. Such a delineation was notyet made as regards Jewish Christians, and the reference to JewishChristians, ‘zealous for the law’, in Acts 21 indicates that, at thebeginning, the attachment of Jews to Christianity did not automat-ically mean their exclusion from Jewish cult. Second, an issue ofgreat importance in this delineation concerning Gentile Christianswas the abstinence from ‘things sacriWced to idols’ (\rN\u000bøº\u000fŁı\u0012\b\f),which must primarily have denoted sacriWcial meat rather thanother sorts of oVerings.Paul’sWrst letter to the Corinthians (1 Cor. 8–10) is aWrmerattestation of the problem of eating idol-meat in Christian commu-nities. That Paul refers to this problem is obvious from the terms heuses.91But this canonical letter is also full of problems. The bestsummary of the questions surrounding the text has been oVered byD. Newton, who also provides a review of the most recent scholarshipon the issue:92Broadly speaking, scholarship on 1 Corinthians 8–10 shares a commonconsensus regarding such issues as the limited nature of archaeologicalevidence, the signiWcant social element in many ancient cultic meals andthe need for further background research into such areas as continuity/discontinuity between Greek and Roman Corinth,93and the types, meaningsand perceived signiWcance of sacriWces and meals, plus their relationship todeity.

As we shall see, this step was taken by Tertullian, morethan a century later, since issues pertaining to idol-meat continued tobe discussed by Christian Fathers until very late.97A piece of indirect evidence relating to Christians and pagansacriWce comes from the account of Paul’s visit to Athens containedin Acts (17: 16–34). There, the author presents Paul as being motiv-ated to start his preaching by an altar dedicated to the UnknownGod. Independently of the historicity of this scene, E. Bickermannhas envisaged the possibility that the altar seen by Paul might havebeen erected by a God-fearer.98According to Bickermann, the needfor sacriWce must have been intensely felt by Gentiles, and conse-quently Jewish doctors of the Law, not opposing it, must havepermitted the building of Gentile altars to the Jewish God. Ingeniousas Bickermann’s view might be, it must remain a speculation.94A recent work stressing the Jewish roots of Paul’s uncompromising attitude toidol-food is Cheung (1999), esp. 299–302.95Newton (1998), 35. As regards Paul’s inconsistency, Newton himself thinks that1 Cor. 8 is on consumption of food, whereas 1 Cor. 10: 1–22 concerns one’s activeinvolvement in sacriWces: see Newton (1998), 390–1. Though this reading wouldserve my purposes, it is not veryWrmly based on the evidence. On the usual solutionto the problem, see ibid. 387. Cheung (1999), 297, does not see any inconsistency inthe two passages. More recently, Fotopoulos (2002) tries to reconcile the two con-tradictory passages by distinguishing between temple dining context and privatedining context.96Horsley (1978) says that what matters to Paul is not one’s individual conscious-ness, but one’s relations with others. According to the author, Paul ‘does notapproach the Corinthian situation with any concept of conscience’ (p. 589).97See Augustine’s letter to Publicola (CSEL34, letter no. 47, secs. 4 and 6).98Bickermann (1980), 345–6.Christians and Animal SacriWce239"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"To sum up the section onWrst-century Christians and pagansacriWce: explicit references to the act of pagan sacriWce as performedby Christians are missing from the evidence. More importantly, caseswhere Gentile Christians would be puzzled as to what form ofworship would beWt their God are also missing. The only relevantevidence concerns Christian participation in pagan celebrations. Thedecree in Acts 15 and Paul’sWrst letter to the Corinithians emphasizethe prohibition on eating idol-meat. This must imply that, to someChristians, the problem of participation in pagan feasts had not yetbeen solved.The undermining role of metaphor in Paul and the diVerenceof his language from that of Philo and the allegoristsEarly Christian language, as attested in Paul’s letters, incorporatedsacriWcial images and allusions to animal sacriWce. Of course, here weshould make clear that, as a Jewish Christian, Paul is recalling JewishsacriWce when he talks about the notions of ‘sacriWce’ and ‘temple’(see mainly the terms¼\u0011ı\t\bØand\u0007\u0006\u0003\u000eÆin 1 Cor. 5: 7–8). But thestriking characteristic of this tactic of incorporation which concernsus here is that these sacriWcial images and allusions were appliedto areas of reality which had not been linked to religion before.Recalling the terminology adopted in my theoretical approach tosacriWce (Ch. 1, sec. 2), where reality has been represented by what Ihave called thehorizontalline, it should be stressed once more that thecode of language is common to the whole line, that is, words easilymove along the whole of it. This can now explain why terms which upto Paul’s time corresponded to particular realms of the horizontalline, that is, space, instruments, and oVerings, started deWning otherrealms too, like human activities, values, and lifestyles. Withoutdenying the existence of Jewish Christians who observed the Templecult, we should notice how in Paul’s language several linguistic termsalong with determining the same entities as before, underwent a shift(\t\r\u0012Æ\u0005\bæ\u0006) towards other realms of reality. Metaphorical languagemeant that some sections of the line stayed inoperative at the practicallevel, but kept their functional role at the linguistic level. For instance,from Paul onwards terms such as ‘altar’ and ‘knives’ (space and240Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"instruments), or more generic ones such as ‘sacriWce’, stopped beingexclusively linked to something hitherto considered as sacriWcial, andwere applied to other sections of the horizontal line. These were: (a)acompletely new section, which centred on Jesus; and (b) other sections,whichhadtodomainlywithhumanactivities,values,andlifestyles.Thisis howChristian metaphorical sacriWcial languagecame into existence.Bearing in mind again our indicative depiction of a part of thehorizontal line, in the mind of a Christian like Paul reality would be asshown in Fig. D. Of course, the old (non-sacrifical) terms previouslyapplied to the sections on the right were not necessarily lost.In the terminology of linguistics, a sacriWcial metaphor would consistof thetenor, that is, the term which is to be clariWed, and thevehicle,that is, the subject which is applied to the tenor in order to clarify it.99AtWrst sight, in Paul’s sacriWcial metaphors which we are studyinghere, the notion of ‘sacriWce’ stood for thevehicle,so,apparently,whatthe author intended was to explain notions of the new religion (forinstance, Jesus) by using the image of sacriWce.However,thisway,asemantic turn was eVected: sacriWcial terms were reinterpreted, simplybecause what remained stable in these metaphors was not thetenorbutthevehicle. SacriWcial terms steadily occupied the vehicle-part.I think that by the use of Fig. D above one can give animal sacriWcethe primary place in a metaphor, but without distorting the texts inwhich sacriWce had the secondary place, that of thevehicle.Thuswedojustice to both our purposes and the evidence. Moreover, by thisWgure Iemphasize the fact that, in the mind of the user of a metaphor, at leastduring the time of its use, a part of reality stays inoperative, in this casethe reality represented in an animal slaughter.Let us now dwell a little on Paul’s sacriWcial metaphors. It isbeyond doubt that, when Paul assimilates Jesus to a sacriWcial victim,99This terminology is the most commonly used and was established byI. A. Richards in his workThe Philosophy of Rhetoric(New York, 1936).(as if inoperative in metaphorical language) —— space + instruments ——— offerings ————— Jesus ———— activities ———— values ———— lifestyles ——(terms hitherto linked to these sections moved )\u0002\u0002——————s a c r i f i c i a l t e r m s————————Fig D.The horizontal line of sacriWcial procedure in ChristianityChristians and Animal SacriWce241"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"he must have in mind Isaiah 53: 7. However, Paul goes further thanIsaiah 53, and speciWes what sort of sacriWcial victim Jesus hadsupposedly been. Thus, in Romans 3: 25 Jesus is assimilated to anexpiatory sacriWcial victim (ƒºÆ\u0003\u0012æØ\b\f),100whereas in 1 Corinthians5: 7–8 Jesus is called a Paschal victim (—\u0006\u0003\u000eÆ), with no clear spe-ciWcation of his religious function as such. Independently of thedegree of clarity in these metaphors, it is again worth stressing that,in Paul’s text, the above sacriWcial terms occupy the place of thevehicle clarifying the notion of ‘Jesus’. Paul uses them of Jesus. This ishow the linguistic shift towards another part of reality, that of Jesus’life, was eVected.Other shifts, towards other sections of the horizontal line (notnecessarily represented in Fig. D), were also eVected, as in the casewhere Paul talked of the human body by using terms hitherto linked tocult. To Paul, the bodies of Christian believers should be living sacriWces(Rom. 12: 1),101while elsewhere he calls them the Holy Spirit’s temple(1 Cor. 6: 19); the congregation as a whole is also described by him asGod’s Holy Temple (1 Cor. 3: 16–7, 2 Cor. 6: 16). The followingcenturies were to see a further expansion of sacriWcial terms to areaswhich had not been traditionally regarded as related to sacriWce,102andin fact the use of sacriWcial terms in the tenor-part of the metaphor.Paul was Philo’s younger contemporary. We cannot know whetherPhilo’s works were known among Jews in Jerusalem, but, whateverthe answer to this question, it is obvious that Paul’s method diVersfrom the Philonic allegorization of animal sacriWce. Paul’s languageresults from his adherence to a diVerentverticalline from the one100According to E. P. Sanders, this is a pre-Pauline formula, which proves thatJesus’ death was seen as an atoning sacriWce by Christians from very early on. But onthe other hand, according to Sanders, this metaphor should not lead us to draw theconclusion that Paul is against sacriWces in his letters. See Sanders (1999), 99 and 103,n. 19 (where alsohilaste ̄rionis interpreted). See also Manson (1945). Morris (1983),152–76, insists that words with this root should be translated by terms of the sameroot as ‘propitiation’ and not as ‘expiation’.101The same idea allegorically expressed inDe spec. leg. 1, 270.

Here it suYces to say that Jesus is a crucialelement in the vertical line connecting Christians to God.With no apparent intention to reinterpret animal sacriWce itself,Paul reinterpreted instead theWgure of Jesus and other areas of reality(for instance, the believer’s body) by applying to them terms hithertolinked to animal sacriWce. In contrast to this, Philo took animalsacriWce for granted, explicitly referred to it, and connected all itsparticular details with meaningful notions taken from both thehorizontal and the vertical lines of reality (see e.g.De spec. leg. 1,206–11, here p. 169).Paul’s metaphorical method also diVered from that of the rivals ofPhilo (usually called ‘allegorists’), who favoured the symbolic meaningof ritual against its practical observance. The allegorization made bythose Jewish scholars consisted in correlating point by point all theindividual elements of particular Law regulations to less material mean-ings. Although the Law is a fundamental component in his thought,Paul does not start from a particular set of regulations so as to prove andemphasize their symbolic meaning. On the contrary, we have seen that,at least in the evidence we have from his letters, Paul speaks compre-hensively of the Law as an intermediate stage before Jesus.By metaphor, the whole setting of a ritualistic animal slaughter isretained as an implicit framework of reference, but sacriWce is given awholly new meaning. For instance, in Romans 12: 1 (\u0007ÆæÆ\u0003\u0012B\u0003ÆØ \u0012a\u0003!\tÆ\u0012Æ \"\tH\f Łı\u0003\u0004Æ\f \u0011H\u0003Æ\f), Paul does not describe an animal victimwhich, when brought to the altar, should make Christians recall theirbodies. This technique would be a Philonic allegory. Instead, Paulattributes to the living human body the role of the victim.103So, thesettingofsomeoneoVeringsomethingtoGodremains thesame,buttheallusion to the sight of an animal and the gesture of the slaughter havebeen replaced by the allusion to the body. SacriWcial metaphor annulsthe materialsand objects current incult inAntiquity, buttransmitstheirrole to other areas of reality. It is as if a section of the horizontal line hasstopped functioning in favour of other sections or of new ones.103In his attempt to reconcile the body of a living Christian to an animal whichafter its slaughter would be dead, Paul uses the antithetical expression ‘livingsacriWce’.Christians and Animal SacriWce243"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Objectively speaking, by the use of sacriWcial metaphors the realityof animal sacriWce is put aside. Even if the recipients of the metaphor-ical sacriWcial message remain familiar with the basic terms of ananimal sacriWce, they begin to be alienated from the material worldof animals, blemished victims, cultic movements, physical contact, andsmells. This ends up as a religious language which undermines animalsacriWcial cult—mutatis mutandis, this is what Philo argued against(De migratione Abrahami92). I cannot support the view that the use ofmetaphors was one of the factors leading to the relinquishment ofanimal sacriWce by Christians. Of course, the use of sacriWcial meta-phors in Paul’s letters, the earliest Christian texts, should alert us tothink of metaphor as a very powerful mode of teaching. But in the end,the whole question ‘What cameWrst, metaphors, or abandonment ofanimal sacriWce?’ reminds one of the ‘chicken and the egg’; the fact isthat metaphorical language was perfectly compatible with the relin-quishment of animal sacriWce.A note on Jesus’ ‘eucharistic’ words at the Last SupperIn recent scholarship, the only work in which the importance ofsacriWcial metaphors is stressed is the book by Klawans.104The authordeals with metaphors in connection with the words of Jesus at the LastSupper. For this study I have accepted that, apart from atoning orcovenant connotations (‘for you’, ‘for many’, ‘new covenant’), thewords of Jesus at the Last Supper do not explicitly refer to animalsacriWce. Here I should add that Jesus speaks of his body and blood byusing sacriWcial allusions, but he does not refer to himself as a sacriW-cial victim. More importantly, Jesus does not seem to give JewishsacriWce a new meaning (or a further meaning, according to Klawans),but to interpret his death; so, in the underlying metaphor, the death ofJesus is thetenor(the subject which is to be clariWed) and sacriWce isthevehicle(what clariWes the tenor). But, even in this combination, thecorrelation of the notions ‘Jesus’ death’ and ‘sacriWce’ resulted in thenotion ‘sacriWce’ having taken on a new meaning.Klawans asserts that the words of Jesus at the Last Supper must beplaced in a Jewish sacriWcial context, must be read metaphorically,104Klawans (2006). See above Ch. 1, p. 18.244Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"but in no way should they be considered as a rejection of the Templecult. To Klawans, sacriWcial metaphors, just like allegories and par-ables (all literary modes well known to Jews), in no way supersede theTemple; they just transfer the sanctity of sacriWcial ritual to moreareas of life apart from the Temple; and, as Klawans asserts withreference to the words of Jesus at the Last Supper, ‘‘‘This too is divineservice’’ is what, and all, Jesus may have meant.’105It is worthdwelling on Klawans’ thesis for a while, simply because he is theonly scholar who deals with the issue of metaphors.Two points should be made regarding Klawans’ views. First, meta-phor and allegory must not be placed at the same level. As I have said,Paul’s metaphorical language diVered from both Philonic allegoriza-tion and the method of the ‘allegorists’. Contrary to the methodadopted by Philo, I have said that Paul (just as Jesus is attested tohave done on uttering the eucharistic words) does not take animalsacriWce as his starting point. Without dealing in detail with thetangible reality of Jewish ritual, Paul (like the Jesus of the eucharisticwords when he talks about his death) uses sacriWcial terms to deWneentities which had not been regarded as sacriWcial. And, in a waydiVerent from that of the ‘allegorists’, Paul does not aim at a system-atic allegorization of particular sacriWcial regulations in the Bible. Bynot dwelling on the sacriWcial realities of the sacred text, then, and bynot closely following their descriptions in it, Paul uses a mode ofexpression much more undermining than allegory. Alhough meta-phors do not constitute suYcient evidence for the supersession ofcult, at least one cannot deny that metaphors do not focus on thetangible reality of ritual, but go beyond that.The second point with regard to Klawans’ theory is the following:Klawans claims that: ‘SacriWcial metaphors operate on the assumptionof the eYcacy and meaning of sacriWcial rituals, and hope to appro-priate some of that meaning and apply it to something else.’106In fact,this thesis does stand when sacriWcial terms play thevehiclepart in ametaphor, as is the case with the (eucharistic) words of Jesus on hisdeath. However, it is not safe to share it, since entirely hypothetically itinserts in Jesus’ words (under the cover of ‘interpretation’) a term105Klawans (2006), 222.106Klawans (2006), 220.Christians and Animal SacriWce245"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"(‘too’), which does not exist in any version of the text handed down tous. Things become more complex if we try to apply the meaning ofthis term to the Greek text. If written texts have a meaning forhistorians, it is because historians respect and interpret them on thebasis of what is written, and not on the basis of personal likings.We can conclude that, in general, the New Testament leaves space formany assumptions, but is lacking in clear depictions as regards Jesus,early Christians, and animal sacriWce. More importantly, there is noabsolutely clear reference to the destruction of the Temple inad70 orto the end of Jewish sacriWcial cult there, something which leavesopen the question about the attitude ofWrst-century Christianstowards the event.No clear doctrine is set out as regards Jewish sacriWce, yet thenarrative indicates that pre-ad70 Christianity consisted of severalgroups. Among these, a signiWcant number of Jewish Christians were‘zealous for the Law’, so, presumably, they must have observedthe Temple cult. The event at Lystra, as described in Acts 14, showsPaul opposing the practice of animal sacriWce. But, apart from thisimportant event, there is no categorical pronouncement that Gentile,ex-pagan Christians must not sacriWce, either as participants in paganfeasts or as Christian worshippers. Rather, the abstinence of GentileChristians from pagan sacriWcial meat becomes an issue. The leadersof the Christian movement are generally against the consumption ofpagan meat, but the application of their advice cannot always havebeen possible to follow, as Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians shows.In theWrst century sacriWcialmetaphorsbegantocomeintouse,andthis change contributed to the alienation of worshippers from thetechniques of animal sacriWce. From then on, the functions once per-formed by animals would be performed within diVerent realms of reality.Second-century EvidenceThe Christian apologists against pagan animal sacriWceIn the second century the criticism of the apologists directed againstpagan animal sacriWce came to represent an independent teaching on246Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"the practice of oVering itself. Christian apologists did not just condemnthe fact that pagans worshipped gods diVerent from the Christian God,but they also explicitly objected to a practice of making oVerings totheir own God, a stance not evident in theWrst century. By their radicaldisapproval of pagan cultic modes, Christian apologists emphasizednot only the diVerent character of the Christian God, but, moreimportantly, their distinct way of perceiving the divine. As we shallsee later, the stress on this diVerent perception of God also governssecond-century Christian polemics against Judaism, and it diVerenti-ates Christian teachings from similar Old Testament teachings.Pagan sacriWce was mainly seen by the apologists as an oVering,and that is why their criticism of it did not concern only animalvictims, but also other materials, as Justin’s reference to wreaths(I Apol. 9), incense and liquids (II Apol. 5) shows. However, forreasons of rhetoric, Christian apologists preferred to stress the mostmorbid aspect of paganism, that is, the slaughter of an animal (seebelow on Tatian,Or. 23 and Athenagoras,Leg. 27).

(Tatian,Oratio4, my trans.)According to Justin, God is in need of nothing, but God gives peopleeverything (I Apol. 10.1). Christians cannot be accused of atheism,since they revere the Creator, whom they regard as being in need ofnothing except prayer.107Edibles that would be oVered to Him aregiven to the poor instead (ibid. 13.1).The point about ̈\re\u0010 I\f\r\f\u000b\r\u0010(the God who is in need of nothing)is also made by Athenagoras (Legatio13). The apologist claims that theperfect sacriWce to God is to be aware of His power to create theuniverse, which He governs with wisdom and skill. This would beenough for God, who is not in need of hecatombs and holocausts suchas those described by Homer, and ironically quoted by Athenagoras.108Man should oVer rational worship as a bloodless sacriWce.107Tertullian, explaining why Christians refuse to oVer sacriWce for the safety ofthe emperor, says that there is something more precious to oVer, and this is prayer:‘All this I cannot ask of any other but only of Him, from whom I know I shall receiveit, since He it is who alone gives and I am one to whom the answer to prayer is due,His servant, who alone worships Him, who for His teaching I am slain, who oVer toHim that rich and better sacriWce which He Himself commanded—I mean prayer,proceeding fromXesh pure, soul innocent, spirit holy. Not grains of incense worthone halfpenny, tears of an Arabian tree, not two drops of wine, not blood of aworthless ox longing to die, and on top of all sorts of pollution a conscienceunclean;—so that I wonder why, when among you victims are being examined bythe most vicious of priests, the breasts of the victims rather than of the sacriWcersshould be inspected’ (Apol. 30.5–6, Loeb tr.). For the same parallel between anunblemished victim and a pure soul, see Philo,De spec. leg. 1, 257–60.108The Homeric passage presents men as oVering sacriWces, votive gifts, libations,and fat in order to make gods forgive their trespasses, but the apologist does not makea point on this aspect:ŒÆd \u0012\bf\u0010 \tb\f Łı\u0003\u0004fi\u0019\u0003Ø ŒÆd \rP\u000eøºfiB\u0010 IªÆ\ffiB\u0003Øjº\bØ\u0013fiB \u0012\r Œ\f\u0004\u0003fi\u0019\u0012\r\u0007ÆæÆ\u0012æø\u0007H\u0003\u001a¼\fŁæø\u0007\bØjºØ\u0003\u0003\u000f\t\r\f\bØ;‹\u0012\r Œ\u0015\f \u0012Ø\u0010 \"\u0007\ræ\u0013Æ\u0004\u0019 ŒÆd I\t\u0006æ\u0012fi\u0019(Iliad9.499–501, cf.

Starting from thisassimilation, the apologists easily correlated animal sacriWce to dae-monic powers.Since Justin makes daemons responsible for giving pagan godstheir shape (I Apol. 9.1), it is to be expected that he would regarddaemons as even more eVective (II Apol. 5.3–5): to Justin, daemonicpower is the instigator of pagan ritual. Daemons, being the angels’spurious children, enslaved humankind by teaching them rituals ofoVering animals, incense, and liquids. They taught men corruptionand caused them every sort of grief. Even the poets and mythologistswere ignorant of the identity of daemons, and attributed all dae-monic actions to divine relatives of one god (Justin apparently meansZeus), to whom they gave names.Along the same lines, as part of his long exposition on the dae-monic nature of pagan gods (Leg. 18–30), Athenagoras emphasizesthat what makes men come and worship the idols is the power ofdaemons (Leg. 26): the latter absorb the blood of sacriWcial victims,and drive men mad by means of terrible actions such as incisions andcastrations. To Athenagoras, any powers emanating from statuesmust also be attributed to the inXuence of daemons: oracles andhealings cannot be the eVect of matter. How exactly do these powerscome about, then? InLeg. 27 Athenagoras gives an explanation whichreminds us of Justin’s daemonology, but which also alludes to psych-ology, and sounds like the theories of Plotinus; in this explanationanimal sacriWce is the ultimate cause of idolatry: when the soul, saysAthenagoras, is closely attached to material things, it has the tendencyto create illusions. The daemons take advantage of these illusionsand, entering men’s thoughts, they direct their illusions in such a wayas to make them seem to come from the images. The reason whydaemons do this is their greed for the fat and blood of victims, andtheir desire to deceive men.109Tatian does not correlate daemons to animal sacriWce, but,from another point of view, draws a shocking, morbid parallel:109Tatian also insists that the pagan gods are daemons (Or. 12, 14, 18), but, apartfrom the adjectiveº\u0004\u000e\f\b\u0010(Or. 12), which is allusive to animal sacriWce, no connectionis made between daemons and sacriWce.Christians and Animal SacriWce249"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"attacking gladiatorial shows, he assimilates the sacriWce of animals tothe murder of people in the arena: just as men oVer sacriWces in orderto eat meat, so they buy murderers of humans in order to feed theirsoul with the spectacle of bloodshed (Oratio23). The parallel mighthave sounded even more shocking to the apologist’s contemporaries,since it implies that there is nothing pious in a sacriWcial oVering;there is only one explanation for the existence of sacriWce, and that ispractical: meat-supply.The above selection of passages from the texts of the apologistsshows that Christian anti-sacriWcial thought came to be an inde-pendent theory on sacriWcial oVerings, and not just a part of Chris-tian opposition to idolatry. According to the Christian apologists: (a)(the real) God is in no need of things material; (b) pagan animalsacriWce was instigated by daemons; and (c) pagan animal sacriWcewas just an excuse for meat-supply.TheWrst point especially, that of a God in need of nothing(I\f\r\f\u000b\r\u0010), is an original Christian contribution, and constitutesthe kernel of the Christian perception of the divine. The principleof ̈\re\u0010 I\f\r\f\u000b\r\u0010had not been made explicit in any of the classic OldTestament anti-sacriWcial stances,110and, as we shall see, it alsounderlay second-century Christian hostility to Judaism.According to Lucian, the same point, namely, that the god (in thiscase, Athena) is not in need of sacriWces, was made by the Greekphilosopher Demonax (Lucian,Demonax11:\bP\u000bb\f ªaæ \u000b\rE\u0003ŁÆØ ÆP\u0012c\f\u0012H\f \u0007Ææ\u001aK\t\bF Łı\u0003ØH\f \"\u0007\rº\u0006\t\u0013Æ\f\b\f). Demonax had been accused ofnot oVering sacriWces, but his argument convinced his audience.None of the Christian apologetic texts, in which the same argumentis expressed by Christians, gives us a clue to the pagan reactions tothis argument. My overall impression is that the reaction of Greeks toChristian anti-sacriWcial preaching would not have been positive.Part of the explanation is to be found in the fact that, at least, peoplesuch as Demonax did not doubt the existence of the goddess Athena.In addition, we should take into account the position of a Demonaxin Greek society: he was a ‘philosopher’, with no impact on common110See 1 Sam. 15: 22, Isa. 1: 11–12, Jer. 7: 22–3, Hos. 6: 6, Amos 5: 25, Mic. 6: 6–8.In the Hatch–RedpathConcordance to the Septuagintthere is not one occurrence ofthe termI\f\r\f\u000b\r\u0010.250Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"practice. Christians, on the other hand, were followers of a newreligion, dangerously widespread; their lack of claims to a ‘past’made them suspected of being mere underminers, having no otherintention than that of subverting religious tradition.In sum, the aforementioned depreciative comments on pagan ani-mal sacriWces make evident a second-century Christian tendency toundermine animal sacriWcial worship per se: nowhere do the apologistsaccuse pagans of oVering sacriWces not to the real God, but rather to thepagan gods; criticism was directed at the very heart of pagan cult.Christians as community members: the evidence fromTertullian and PlinyThis short excursus is oVered in order to prove that second-centuryevidence for Christian attitudes to animal sacriWce is not conWned onlyto rhetoric, but also contains implications relating to concrete situ-ations. I am concerned with the way in which Christian faith couldinXuence the relation of converts to pagan ceremonies involvingsacriWces.TertullianPaul’s First Letter to the Corinthians does not give advice on theattitude which Christians should adopt during the sacriWcial stagespreceding a pagan feast. As we shall now see, this problem didconcern the polemical Tertullian (De idololatria16–17.3).Paul had given advice on the issue of eating idolothytes (foodoVered to idols), so he had referred to the situation after the accom-plishment of a sacriWcial slaughter. Tertullian gave advice on thepuzzling issue of the boundaries between mere attendance at apagan sacriWce and actual participation in it, so he dealt with thesituation preceding a sacriWcial slaughter. By using the term ‘con-science’ (\u0003ı\f\r\u0004\u000b\u0019\u0003Ø\u0010), Paul had referred both to the conscience of thepagan when facing Christians, and to the diVerent tendencies amongChristians themselves, the ‘weak’ and the ‘strong’. By ‘conscience’,Tertullian only referred to the conscience of the Christian whenfacing pagans (De idol. 13.6). Let us now take a closer look atTertullian’s advice.Christians and Animal SacriWce251"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Tertullian objects to the observance of pagan holidays by Chris-tians, either as an occasion of rejoicing or as an excuse forWnancialdealings with pagans (De idolatria, 13.2–5). But as regards paganceremonies taking place within a closer social circle, indeed, the verymoment of sacriWce taking place in these occasions, Tertullian re-commends the following scheme (ibid. 16–17.1):.Christians are allowed to attend some rituals, including be-trothals, weddings, and name-givings—despite the idolatrousaura surrounding these occasions.111.However, Christians should not attend these ceremonies if thereason for their invitation (titulus oYcii) is the sacriWce beingperformed. Of course, a Christian should prefer not even to seean idolatrous act, says Tertullian. But, since one cannot avoidliving in a pagan world, let Christian presence on these occa-sions be regarded as a service to the host and not to an idol.(That Tertullian hadanimal sacriWce in mind is obvious from areference to sacriWcial victims in ibid. 17.3.)112.In the case that a Christian is invited to assist as a priest andperform a sacriWce, he should not go, because otherwise hewould clearly render service to an idol. But neither should aChristian provide any other sort of assistance with regard to asacriWce, either in the form of advice or in the form of money orin any other way. Tertullian gives a brief summary of his advice:‘If I am invited because of a sacriWce and I attend, I shall takepart in idolatry; if a diVerent reason brings me into the presenceof a man who is performing a sacriWce, I shall be no more than aspectator of the sacriWce’ (ibid. 16.5, tr. Waszink–Van Winden)..TertullianWnally deals with the case in which Christian presenceat a sacriWce is obligatory, that is, the case of a slave when hismaster is sacriWcing, of a freedman when his patron is sacriW-cing, and of an oYcial when his superior is sacriWcing. Thefollowing axiom shows that Tertullian’s attitude is unchange-111De idol. 16.1. Waszink–Van Winden (1987), 248, attribute this ‘breath ofidolatry’ to the sacriWce which takes place, but Tertullian does not specify this.112Besides, as regards the invitation itself, Tertullian must have in mind casessimilar to those where an explicit reference to a sacriWcial meal is made (e.g. theinvitations of Sarapis with references to a\u000b\rE\u0007\f\b\f, see Gilliam (1976)).252Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"able: ‘But if someone hands the wine to a man who sacriWces, ifhe even assists by saying a word that is necessary for the sacriWce,he will be regarded as a minister of idolatry’ (ibid. 17.1, tr.Waszink–Van Winden).Tertullian is liberal as regards the presence of Christians at heathenfestivals,113but very strict as regards the involvement of Christianswith animal sacriWce, because he regards as participation even theslightest indirect contribution to a sacriWce (e.g. the utterance ofwords). To Christians following Tertullian’s advice, the limits be-tween mere attendance and participation would be very delicate.Tertullian also refers to the undertaking of civic functions byChristians (ibid. 17.2). He claims that a Christian may undertakesuch functions, and he lists some preconditions which would allowhim to do so (17.3). Thus, a Christian may exercise a public functionas long as:he does not oVer/preside over sacriWces;he does not make contracts concerning the supply of public victims;he does not give his authorization for the running of temples;he is not in charge of temple taxes;he does not fund/organize/preside over games;he does not announce festivals;he does not take oaths.(Some rules on how one should exercise power follow.) At leastthree of these preconditions are direct or indirect prohibitions ofinvolvement with animal sacriWce. The inscription from Oenoandaabout the Demostheneia (see Chapter 2, App. n. II, 19) would be agood example where these prohibitions could apply, in the case ofChristians having ceremonial duties.All the aforementioned circumstances dealt with inDe idololatriawould be an everyday reality in provincial cities. In all probability,Paul and Tertullian were not the only sources for Christians toconsult when they faced such problems.

Wecan assume that, with the spread of Christianity, the adoption oftactics similar to those contained in Paul’s and Tertullian’s letters wasalready changing the character of the Empire, by shaping theWnan-cial and religious character of the Roman provinces.PlinyIn fact, it seems that this change was conspicuous already before Tertul-lian: a witness to it was the younger Pliny, who was aware of theimplications of Christianization in Pontus. At the end of his letter tothe emperor Trajan, in which he sets out his actions concerning the‘problem’ of Christians, Pliny is proud to report that his intervention asprovincial governor was beneWcial for (pagan) religion:. . . people have begun to throng the temples which had been almost entirelydeserted for a long time; the sacred rites (sacra sollemnia) which had beenallowed to lapse (intermissa) are being performed again, andXesh ofsacriWcial victims (<carnem>victimarum)114is on sale everywhere, thoughup till recently scarcely anyone could be found to buy it (X.96.10, Loeb tr.).The situation alluded to here reminds us of Tertullian’s appeal toChristians not to provide for public sacriWcial victims, so one wouldassume that Pliny is reporting a real situation. However, A. N. Sherwin-White does not seem disposed to rely entirely on Pliny’s description ofthe revitalization of cults. According to this scholar, Pliny is reportingthe allegations of the accusers, that is, priests and tradesmen, who hadbeen most aVected by the increase in the number of Christians. That iswhy Sherwin-White regards Pliny’s report as exaggerated. According tothe same scholar, civic ritual would not suVer lack of provision ofoVerings; only the performance of individual or family rites wouldhave been aVected by the rise of the number of Christians. Paul’s adviceon the origin of meat (Sherwin-White’s reference is 1 Cor. 10: 27–9)must have had a very limited inXuence, he claims.115Actually, Paul does not prohibit the buying of sacriWcial meat in thepassage from 1 Corinthians to which Sherwin-White refers (he mighthave intended to refer to 1 Cor. 10: 1–22, but not even there does Paul114The wordcarnem(Xesh) is an emendation in the text.115Sherwin-White (1985), 709, 710.254Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"prohibit the buying of sacriWcial meat). On the other hand, since Pliny’sremark is related to the alleged decrease in the sale of meat because ofthe number of pagans who were converted to Christianity, and it isimpossible for us to know the exact proportion of converted pagans, Ithink we have no suYcient evidence for either refuting or supportingPliny’s testimony about the impact of Christianity on the sale ofsacriWcial meat in Pontus.Instead, the element to which I would like to draw the reader’sattention is the problems which Christianity could cause in a commu-nity when its members thought it natural to perform, or pay for, animalsacriWces. In other words, it is not the decrease in meat, but the decreasein interest in the ritual of sacriWce itself which the evidence obliges us totake note of (sollemnia intermissa, in Pliny’s passage). More speciWcally,the combination of the evidence drawn from Tertullian’sDe idololatria17.3 and from our study of ‘obligatory’ sacriWces(Ch. 2, sec. 4),indicates that Christians would be uncertain of how to act before thepossibility of participation in pagan sacriWces, and this issue wouldtouch on both the public and the private sphere of their lives.Thus, at the public level, civic legislation could occasionally requirethe oVering of an animal sacriWce by individuals. In cases wherecitizens were invested with civic oYces, Christians would presumablyhave had diYculties in performing their duties.116The same must haveapplied to Christian professionals belonging to groups whose mem-bers were obliged to oVer sacriWces (see the Coan examples).117At theprivate level, conventional rituals in the context of a small community,which were related to important moments in life (e.g. premaritalsacriWces), would have raised further diYculties for Christians.116One can cite many examples:Wrst, a Christian presumably could not be aprytanis: in Athens theprytaneiswere supposed to oVer sacriWces in the ̈\u000fº\b\u0010(Paus.Attica, V.1). Then, a Christian could not be agymnasiarchos, among whose dutieswere sacriWces to local heroes, like theK\fÆªØ\u0003\t\u000f\u0010to Aetolus, in Elis (Paus.Elis I, IV.4).Even more, a young Christian could hardly continue to be a member of thegymna-sion, given the involvement of theepheboiin numerous civic sacriWcial cults (forexamples, see above Ch. 2, sec. B.iii).117One mayWnd the possibility of a Christian athlete rather odd, but a Phrygianinscription of the 3rd c.adhas long been regarded as theWrst testimony about aChristian athlete. For the evidence, see Robert,HellenicaXI–XII, 423–5. This Chris-tian participated both in local and Italian games, and one can only speculate abouthis involvement in the cultic ceremonies conducted.Christians and Animal SacriWce255"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"The region where the intensity of the confrontation betweenChristianity and the ritual of animal sacriWce can be most convin-cingly illustrated is southern Asia Minor. Two examples, drawn froma pagan and a Christian source, show this clearly.The cases of the Lycian cities of Oenoanda and Dereko ̈y, withwhich we have dealt in Chapter 2 (see App. II, nos. 19 and 23respectively), have suYciently shown that at leastWnancial partici-pation in animal sacriWces could be obligatory. Especially as regardsthe civic sacriWce of the Demostheneia at Oenoanda, we have seenthat possible laxity inWnancial contribution on the part of aŒ!\t\u0019would result in the imposition of aWne on the person who was incharge of the sacriWcial oVerings required of it. Furthermore, hisname was to be made public, presumably along with that ofhisŒ!\t\u0019. It is plausible to imagine that the people of Oenoandawould have considered Christian families especially prone to giveoccasion for the setting up of such lists because of their refusalto sacriWce!The event described in Acts 14, about the preparation of a sacriWcewhich the Lycaonians would oVer to Paul and Barnabas, focuses onPaul’s unfavourable reaction to animal sacriWce. This is an importantindicator of the tension between common ritual practice of the timeand the attitude which Christians kept before it.Maybe, then, Pliny’s testimony about the decline in ceremonialactivities (sacra sollemnia diu intermissa), including animal sacriWces,applies better to southern Asia Minor than to Pontus itself.In the excursus above, the evidence from Tertullian and Pliny hasbeen combined with other evidence from southern Asia Minor inorder to make it clear that the anti-sacriWcial preaching of theapologists was not irrelevant to everyday life. Christian behaviourwithin a pagan community conWrmed that the change in the con-ception of the divine was not restricted to the theoretical argumen-tation of the apologists, but shaped real life. In what follows, we shallsee that the teachings of the apologists about a God in need ofnothing, and so about the inutility of sacriWces, governed the attitudewhich Christians maintained when brought to trial.256Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Christians prosecuted or persecuted by pagans:trials and martyrdomsAlthough there is plenty of evidence for Christians being brought totrial before pagan authorities, the exact procedure followed by paganmagistrates is not always clear. A common theme in the texts report-ing these trials is the exposure of the arrested Christians to the test of(animal?) sacriWce. In this section, I try to reconstruct the successionof events related to sacriWce and trials, and also make some com-ments on the attitude of Christians under trial.The succession of eventsTrialsTwo of the epistles contained in Pliny’s correspondence withTrajan (Ep. X.96–7), dated toward the end ofad110, are crucial toour study of the tests to which Christians were exposed. The one,written by Pliny, has been used earlier, because it contains hisreference to sacriWcial meat. Pliny sent this epistle (X.96) to Trajanin order to consult the emperor with regard to the policy he shouldadopt when people were accused before him of being Christians.Pliny states that he had never previously taken part in a trial ofChristians (X.96.1), but nonetheless he goes on to describe thecourse of action he followed (X.96.2–6).118Here I am not concerned with all the Christians who were tried byPliny, but only with those whose names had been on a list in ananonymouslibellus. From this category, Pliny dismissed those of theaccused who denied being or having been Christians, but heWrst madethem: (1) invoke the gods; (2) oVer wine and incense (ture ac vinosupplicarent) before the emperor’s statue; and (3) curse Christ.119In his response (X.97), Trajan points out that people who arebrought before the governor on the grounds of evidence must bepunished, except those who deny Christianity by invoking the gods(supplicando dis nostris).120In the latter case, past conduct should notbe taken into account. Trajan adds that anonymous pamphlets should118This means that Pliny had already acted. Wilken (1984), 22, attributes thisinconsistency either to the pressure which local magistrates exercised on Pliny or toPliny’s conWdence in the legitimacy of his actions.119Ep. X.96.5.120Ep.

Unfortunately, Trajan is not very speciWc about the exact formthat invocation should take, nor does he say whether Pliny’s threesteps (invocation–oVerings–cursing of Christ) were rightly chosen asa test for the recanting Christians.The reason why Pliny did not ask for an animal sacriWce fromthose recanting was not his disregard for it, but the great number ofthose accused (X.96.9). A series of animal sacriWces with the victimsprovided by the governor would have been an expensive proced-ure,123messy, and time-consuming! It therefore seems that, for theneeds of a trial, libation and incense-oVering were chosen by Pliny assubstitutes for an animal sacriWce, and not because they were thestandard procedure in everyday life. Besides, the fact that to Pliny themain act in cultic life was animal sacriWce is proved by his concludingremark, which, among the representative signs of aXourishing paganreligion, contains a reference to sacriWcial meat. Not only that, butPliny presents animal sacriWce as an important part of the economiclife of the provinces, and that is probably why he became interested inthe issue of Christians.Although Pliny is sometimes credited with the ‘discovery’ of theoVering-test described above, we can never be sure about the tacticsof his predecessors in his province or of Roman governors else-121This test of Pliny on Christians is usually called a ‘sacriWce-test’. See de Ste.Croix (1963), 19. See also Grant (1970), 14: ‘the requirement of sacriWce to the godswas introduced by Pliny and conWrmed by Trajan’.122As de Ste. Croix (1963), 18, has rightly pointed out. See also Millar (1973), 153.Besides, there was no point in applying the test to all Christians, since, as Plinyadmits, ‘none of these things . . . any genuine Christian can be induced to do’ (Ep.X.96.5, Loeb tr.).123Wilken (1984), 26, points out that pouring of wine and dropping of grain overan altar became popular because they were cheap.258Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"where.124A similar test had been used by Greeks in the context of alocal persecution of Jews at Antioch inad67.125In any case, Pliny’sletter is theWrst testimony for the application of the oVering-test inthe context of pagan persecutions of Christians.In sum, in the trials presided over by Pliny, libation worked as asubstitute for animal sacriWce, and it was used only as a proof of theaccused’s claim that he or she was not a Christian.MartyrdomsI now go on to examine how the requirement ofsacriWce is incorporated in the accounts of Christian martyrdoms.References to sacriWce occur in only three of the pre-DecianActaMartyrumdating to our period: theMartyrdom of Polycarp(c.mid-2nd c.), theActs of Justin and his Companions(c.mid 2nd c.), and thePassion of Perpetua and Felicitas(c.ad203).126Unfortunately, there isno way for us to know whether the sacriWcial terms occurring in thesetexts allude to animal sacriWce.127In theMartyrdom of Polycarptwo references to sacriWce are worthquoting: the Christian Quintus was convinced by the governor tooVer sacriWce (4.1), and Polycarp’s friends advised him to performthe sacriWces and be saved (8.2).The text of theActs of Justin and his Companionshas come to us inthree recensions, of which the shortest one has been proved byG. Lazzati128to be the original account. In this, there is no require-ment of sacriWce; however, the prefect’sWnal verdict is: ‘Those who124Wilken (1984), 27–8, where there are various suggestions about the ‘proven-ance’ of the idea, but again, Pliny is said to havediscoveredan eVective way todistinguish Christians from non-Christians.125Jos.BJVII.46, 50–1.126ThePassion of Perpetua and Felicitasdates to afterad200 (see Barnes (1968b),522), but, with theXexibility I have adopted in the case of Greek inscriptions and ofDe idololatria, it can be considered to be within our chronological limits.127A possible indication that the sacriWcial oVering required was not an animalsacriWce is the use of the termK\u0007ØŁF\u0003ÆØin some of the cases.\u001a ̄\u0007ØŁF\u0003ÆØis usually takenas denoting the oVering of incense.

Musurillo).In thePassion of Perpetua and Felicitas(6.3–4) Perpetua is asked tooVer sacriWce for the emperors, but she refuses. The interesting pointhere is that the question pertaining to thenomen(i.e. whetherPerpetua is a Christian) is asked after her refusal to oVer a sacriWce;her answer leads her to the beasts (6.5–6).The three martyrdoms cited above point to an evolution in thejudicial procedure since Pliny’s time, that is, sincead110. Theyindicate that an oVering was required of Christians as Christians,and not of those who had already refused thenomen(as in the case ofPliny’s trials). In other words, as scholars have pointed out, sacriWcewas used by pagan authorities as an opportunity for Christians torecant.129The policy adopted by Pliny, who had thought that ‘noneof these things [sc. sacriWce]...anygenuine Christian can be inducedto do’ (Ep. X. 96.5), was superseded. Perhaps the change towards amore coercive policy was instigated by the increase in the number ofprosecutions, which, in turn, had resulted from the increasing ab-sence of Christians from community rituals. If this hypothesis isright, one can even explain the succession of the questions posed toPerpetua. It is as if she is asked: ‘We have heard that you don’tparticipate in rituals. Show us if this is true by sacriWcing’. Then herrefusal to sacriWce is followed by the question: ‘Are you a Christian?’Having shown the role of the ‘sacriWce-test’ as a means of recantation,we are faced with two possibilities as regards the succession of eventsrelated to sacriWce and the trials of Christians:(a) The arrest of Christians was preceded by their refusal to oVer asacriWce (there might have been a provincial requirement ofsacriWce or just social pressure). After the arrest, the authoritiesagain asked Christians to sacriWce, in order to verify whether thedetained had refused to conform with the prevailing customs. It129Grant (1970), 15, says that the sacriWce-test was ‘originally introduced for thebeneWt of pagans or ex-Christians as a means by which they could purge themselvesof the charge that they were Christians’, whereas later it was used as a means ofachieving Christian recantation. On the basis of an unsafe interpretation of theActs ofJustin and his Companionsmade by him, Grant says that this change occurred at theend of the 2nd century.260Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"is likely that animal sacriWce was involved in theWrst rather thanthe second denial by Christians.(b) The refusal of Christians to sacriWce succeeded their arrest. Inthis case, the Christians were brought before the governor justfor thenomen, and were asked to make an oVering for theWrsttime during their trial. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that thisoVering would have been an animal oVering.The lack of evidence for the existence of an oYcial requirement ofsacriWce leads me to accept a combination of the two possibilitiesabove. Namely, I mainly accept that up toad200 Christians werenot brought to the authorities because of their refusal to sacriWce, butfor their being Christians (caseb); however, I have left open thepossibility that, afterad110, because of increased social pressure,Christians were expected to sacrifice (casea)anddidnotsuccumb,so, consequently, were persecuted for that. In general, I agree with thescholarly consensus that prosecutions before the time of Decius weremade for thenomen, but I have added a possible reason (socialpressure) for the change of the role of the ‘sacriWce-test’ into ameans of verifying accusations, and so into a means of recantation.A lost decree?Despite the admitted lack of attested sacriWcialrequirements preceding the arrest of Christians in the second century,I am obliged to examine the possibility of some counter-evidence.The signiWcance of a decree explicitly ordering sacriWce (and notjust of a rule of limited application, set out in a letter) has beenstudied recently by J. B. Rives.130According to this scholar, Decius’decision to issue a decree ordering the performance of sacriWce by allinhabitants of the Roman Empire led for theWrst time to a deWnitionof the religion of the Empire. This religion was not deWned by a deityor a dogma, Rives says, but by a speciWc cultic act: sacriWce.131As the130Rives (1999).131In a note (n. 91) in his article, Rives says that in the persecution of Decius ‘anydeity would do, even the god of the Christians, just so long as a sacriWce wasperformed’. Rives is basing this on a passage fromPassio Pionii(19.10): ‘do youlook to the air? SacriWce to it.’ I would not be so sure about Rives’ point. Thesurviving certiWcates of the Decian persecution speak of sacriWce to the ‘gods’(plural), so this necessarily implies the normal range of named pagan gods. SeeKnipWng (1923),passim. In the example fromPassio Pionii, the air as a god couldChristians and Animal SacriWce261"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"surviving certiWcates from the Decian persecution prove, the sacriWcerequired was that of an animal, since in the certiWcate the oVererstates that he or she has tasted of the victims.132Consequently, Rives’conclusion is particularly important for the purposes of this study.There is a possibility that a decree ordering sacriWce by all theinhabitants of the Empire was issued before Decius. This depends onthe dating of theActs of Carpus, Papylus, and Agathonice.133Areference to the emperor’s sacriWcial decree occurs both in theGreek and the Latin versions of theseActa:134› I\fŁ\u0002\u0007Æ\u0012\b\u0010 \rr\u0007\r\f·ŁF\u0003Æ\u0004 \u0003\r \u000b\rE·\bo\u0012ø\u0010 ªaæ KŒ\u0015º\rı\u0003\r\f › ÆP\u0012\bŒæ\u0006\u0012øæ. (sec. 11)Proconsul dixit: SacriWcate; ita enim iussit imperator. (sec. 2)However, theActamay belong either to the middle of the second centuryor to the time of Decius—the second dating seeming more probable.I would like to suggest that, if theActs of Carpus, Papylus, andAgathonicedate to the second century, and provided that the sacriWcialterms occurring in them denote animal sacriWce, the text might provideus with evidence for the existence of a pre-Decian decree makinganimal sacriWce the religious act of the Empire par excellence.135The attitude of Christians in the texts of trialsAs regards the attitude of the Christians who were asked to sacriWceduring their trial, we can note the following: in none of the recordedcases do Christians state that it is onlyto their owngod—and not tohave a name, and its attributes are speciWc. But the governor would hardly accept adeity with no name, such as the Christian god (Justin,II Apol. 6.1–3). A god, even ifrecently adopted, should be within the limits of a pagan’s conception of the divine.See the following section on ‘The attitude of Christians’.132For an example, see Rives (1999), 137, n. 13. Note also Cyprian’s mention ofthuriWcati(Ep. 55.2.1); Rives (ibid.) is uncertain about the translation of the term (doesit denote incense?), and the explanation for the possible diVerence in the oVering.133See Barnes (1968b), 514–15, (1968a), 45, 48.134Sec. 2 (Latin), secs. 4, 11, 45 (Greek).135Surprisingly, though, Barnes would not share this view: ‘The [sc. proconsul’s]order to sacriWce because the emperor has commanded it is scarcely more thananother mode of urging a return to Roman ways. And, in a sense, the emperor hadcommanded sacriWce: for he had ordained that an accused Christian who sacriWcedshould be set free.’ Barnes (1968a), 48. Here Barnes has in mind Trajan’s epistle toPliny. To what extent, however, would the emperors after Trajan consult his epistlesand consider them as a law-source?262Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"any other recipient—that they oVer sacriWces. The principle of a godbeing in need of nothing (I\f\r\f\u000b\r\u0010), which we have come across inthe apologetic texts, seems to have been applied by Christians even tothe most crucial moment, that of a trial.Similarly, in none of the martyrdoms do governors ask Christians tooVer a sacriWce to the Christian God; the Christian God was not like thepagan gods, who had names and attributes and were visible, nor likethe Jewish God, who had been recognized long ago as not having thecharacteristics of the pagan gods. A new god, who forbade his wor-shippers to attend the rituals of the other gods, was subversive. For thepagan governor, to ask a Christian to worship his or her God wouldhave been to admit the inferiority of the non-Christian gods.What is more important for the purpose of this study is the factthat the principle of ̈\re\u0010 I\f\r\f\u000b\r\u0010aVected not only the cases whereChristians addressed or were tried by pagans, but all the historicallyrecorded range of Christian cultic attitudes. The existing evidenceshows that Christians objected altogether to the practice of oVering,even with regard to Christian worship itself. The lack of altars inhonour of the Christian God was a well-known Christian character-istic, often quoted by pagan observers as a paradox. Thus, Celsusremarks that Christians\u0013ø\t\bf\u0010 ŒÆd Iª\u0006º\tÆ\u0012Æ ŒÆd \f\rg\u0010 ƒ\u000bæ\u0002\r\u0003ŁÆØ\u0005\r\u0002ª\rØ\f·, ‘we avoid the establishing of altars, statues, and temples’(Origen,Contra Celsum8.17, my trans.).136It is characteristic that even in later times, when we have evidence foranimal-slaughter in the framework of Christian feasts, the oVering ismade in honour of the local saint and not in honour of the ChristianGod.137The historically recorded cultic attitudes of Christians showthat an essential part of the Christian perception of the divine in thehistory of early Christianity was the principle of ̈\re\u0010 I\f\r\f\u000b\r\u0010.In this section I haveWrst tried to form as clear a picture as possible ofthe exact sequence of judicial and penal actions taken by pagan136See also Min.

I have concluded that, in this context,refusal to sacriWce was certainly an indicator of anti-conformism onthe part of Christians, but not the oYcially stated cause of theirarrest. So, the existing evidence still leaves open the following ques-tions concerning our period of study:(a) whether the absence of Christians from animal or any other formof sacriWce was one of the factors which made them conspicuous,and thus led to their arrest; and(b) whether compliance or non-compliance in animal or other formsof sacriWce always determined the condemnation of Christiansafter trial.Second, the attitude of Christians under trial has been examined.Their refusal to comply even with an oVering to their own, ChristianGod has led me to conclude that the Christian God was apparently bydeWnition perceived as in no need of things material ( ̈\re\u0010 I\f\r\f\u000b\r\u0010).This conclusion has been conWrmed by evidence external to trials andmartyrdoms, since the absence of altars from Christian cult was expli-citly pointed out by second-century pagans. In sum, the anti-sacriWcialteachings of the apologists have been seen to underlie everyday Chris-tian behaviour.The Christian apologists and Fathers on Jewish animal sacriWceAt the beginning of this section I must emphasize the fact that there isonly one surviving second-century Christian text wholly and speciW-cally dedicated to polemics against Jews, namely theDialogue withTrypho, in contrast to the number of surviving second-century Chris-tian apologies against paganism. This is to be expected, since, as wasnoted in the introductory section to this chapter, the religious system ofpaganism was interwined with the dominant web of power whichoYcially put Christians on trial, and this connection contributed tothe preservation of more texts from the side of anti-pagan apologetics.But, strikingly enough, Christian texts intended for internal use makeup for the absence of Christian anti-Jewish apologetics, since severalpassages from Christian catechetical texts concern the Christian per-ception of Judaism.264Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"The second-century Christian apologists are critical of JewishsacriWces. As in the case of the apologies addressing pagans, the principleof a God in need of nothing is present in Christian anti-Jewish polemicstoo. But the appeal to this principle is used by Christians as a means toreach another aim: that of making derogatory comments on Jews.The belief in Jesus as a dividing-line between past and present, whichwe have seen in Paul, continued to deWne the relation of second-century Christians to the Law. The clearest exposition of this relationis made in the following extract from Justin’sDialogue with Trypho:Nor do we consider that we have one God, and you another, but Him onlywho brought your fathers out of the land of Egypt . . . nor have we set ourhopes on any other (for there is none), but only on Him on whom you alsohave set yours, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Yet our hope is set onHim not by means of Moses nor by means of the Law; for then we shouldassuredly be doing the same as you.For in fact I have read, Trypho, that there is to be both aWnal Law and aDisposition that is superior to all others, which must now be observed by allthose who lay claim to the inheritance of God. For the Law given at Horeb isalready antiquated and belongs to you alone, but that other belongs to allmen absolutely. And a Law set over against a Law has made the one before itto cease, and a Disposition coming into existence afterwards has in likemanner limited any former one. And as an eternal andWnal Law was Christgiven to us, and this Disposition is sure, after which there is no law, orordinance, or command. (Dial. 11.1–2, tr. Williams)To say that the ideas evoked in the text above were conceived after the FalloftheTempleinad70 is unnecessary, since we have seen that Christiancriticism of the Law and the notion of a ‘new testament’ go back to Paul.Equally, to say that the passage above does not explicitly refer to sacriWcesis also unnecessary, because none of the other components of the Law areexplicitly mentioned either (e.g. circumcision or the Sabbath).Since Jesus changed the perception which Christians had of the Law,Christians had to redeWne the role of the Law in history. Paul’s belief inJesus made him see the Law from the perspective of preparation(\u0007ÆØ\u000bÆªøª\u000f\u0010, Gal. 3: 24). But the redeWnition made by second-centuryChristians is diVerent from that made by Paul. To the apologists andChurch Fathers of the second century, the role of the Law is deWned asforetelling the Christian ‘story’ and as resulting from God’s concessionto the undisciplined character of the Jews.Christians and Animal SacriWce265"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Thus, in the framework of the second-century polemical attitudeto the Jews, two elements are prominent in Christian criticism ofJewish sacriWces: the emphasis on the preWguring role of JewishsacriWcial customs; and the promulgation of the notion ‘idolatry’ inconnection with the notion ‘Jewish sacriWces’, either to make adegrading comparison of Judaism with paganism, or to prove thatJews are by nature prone to idolatry.These two points were never explicitly made in the prophetic textsof the Old Testament. The assertion about the shadowy substance ofthe Law, and the mere parallel between idolatry and Jewish sacriWces,could not but have sounded blasphemous to pious Jews. Conse-quently, both points diVerentiate second-century Christian teachingsfrom prophetic teachings, and reveal the negative attitude of second-century Christians towards Jewish sacriWces.There follow some examples illustrating theWrst point, namely, thepreWguring allegorizations made by Christians in second-centurytexts. According to Justin, the Paschal lamb was a preWguration ofChrist, and the smearing of the houses with its blood symbolized thesmearing of the souls of Christians with Jesus’ blood. God alsoordained that the Paschal lamb should only be slain in Jerusalem,because Christ was to suVer there, and, after His Passion, Jerusalemwas to be captured, and every sacriWce was to cease (Dial. 40.1–2).The order for the particular way of roasting the Paschal lamb was apreWguration of the Cross of the Passion (40.3). Similarly, the pro-cedure for treating the two kids on the Day of Atonement wasordered as a preWguration of Christ in His two presences, the onewhen He was rejected, and the other at the time of His future comingto Jerusalem (40.4–5).138Even more detailed allegorizations with reference to sacriWcialritual are contained in theEpistle of Barnabas:What then does he say in the Prophet? ‘And let them eat of the goat which isoVered in the fast for all their sins.’ Attend carefully,—‘and let all the priestsalone eat the entrails unwashed with vinegar.’ Why? Because you are going138One must note that apart from sacriWces Justin allegorizes further elementsdrawn from the Mosaic Law. SeeDial. 41.1 on the oVering of grainXour (¼the breadof communion); 41.4 on the rite of circumcision; 42.1–3 on the twelve bells of theHigh Priest’s robe (¼the apostles).

That Justin tendsto oVend the Jews by appealing to their supposedly innate negativecharacteristics is mainly shown by his appeal to what he calls Jewish‘hard-heartedness’ and ‘ungratefulness’, qualities which relate tocharacter rather than to speciWc events.143Besides, Justin’s belief ininnate negative qualities is made obvious in the phrasing he uses inDial. 92.4:‰\u0010 I\rd \u0005Æ\u0004\f\r\u0003Ł\r ª\rª\r\f\u0019\t\u0015\f\bØ(‘as indeed you do alwaysappear to have been’, my trans.).Apart from his appeal to supposedly innate negative Jewish qual-ities, Justin tries to refer to facts, but these are not always easy toWnd,so he generally talks about unspeciWed ‘sins’ (±\tÆæ\u0012\u0004ÆØ) of the Jews,and presents them as an explanation for God’s giving of the Law. Theonly speciWc events which Justin presents as evidence to illustrate the‘bad’ Jewish character are the episode of the golden calf, and alsochild-sacriWces. More speciWcally, Justin says that sacriWces (andsabbath) were ordered through Moses after the episode of the goldencalf, because God wanted to divert Jewish piety (oVerings) from idolsto Himself. But the Jews continued being idolatrous, and they evenoVered their children to idols (Dial. 19.5–6).Within this polemical exposition by Justin, we come across theprinciple that God is in no need of sacriWces:(a)In the same way He commanded oVerings because of the sins of your people,and because of their idolatries, and not because He was in need of such.(22.1, tr. Williams)(b)He ever cries out the same things, because of your hard-heartedness andunthankfulness towards Him; in order that even so you may some time143Recalling that Justin talks on behalf of Gentile Christians (Dial. 26–9, 53, 92.4,117.4), it is easy to understand that the notion of ‘hard-heartedness’ is a ghost whichhe initially creates in order to interpret why Gentiles turned to Christianity whereasJews did not (Dial. 44.1–2, 68.1), and which he subsequently projects onto the past.Christians and Animal SacriWce269"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"repent and please Him, and may neither sacriWce your children to de-mons . . .

(67.8, tr. Williams, slightly modiWed)Thus even the building of the Jerusalem Temple was reluctantlyaccepted by God, but only as a means to prevent Jews from idolatry:He therefore neither receives sacriWces from you, nor commanded you to dothem originally as being Himself in need of them, but only because of yoursins, for even the temple, which is called the Temple in Jerusalem, Heacknowledged as His house or court, not as Himself being in need of it,but that even by paying attention to it you should not commit idolatry.(22.11, tr. Williams, slightly modiWed)145Extending Paul’s teaching on justiWcation by faith (Rom. 4), on theredundancy of the Law after Jesus (Rom. 10: 4), and on the import-ance of a new testament (2 Cor. 3: 6), Justin demarcates the period inwhich the Law was valid, namely, after Abraham (circumcision),more fully after Moses (sabbath-keeping, feasts, and sacriWces), butcertainly before Jesus. Jewish hard-heartedness was the reason for theLaw being temporarily observed, but Jesus is the new law and testa-ment. The second of the following passages comes as a conclusion toJustin’s long list of preWgurations contained in the Jewish Law (Dial.40–2); these preWgurations were all made real in the ‘Jesus story’ andmade the Jewish Law invalid since the new law, Jesus, has come:Now if we do not acknowledge the soundness of these arguments, we shallWnd ourselves falling into absurd ideas, either that it is not the same Godwho was in the time of Enoch, and of all the other (saints) who neither hadcircumcision after theXesh nor kept either sabbaths or the other commands,for it was Moses who ordered these things to be done; or else that He has notdesired that all mankind should always practise the same acts of righteous-ness. And to acknowledge this seems ridiculous and silly. But we mustacknowledge that it is because of the fault of sinful men that He who is144See alsoDial. 46.6.145On the same point, seeDial. 92.4.270Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"ever the same has given these and suchlike commandments, and mustdeclare that He loves men, and knows all beforehand, and is in want ofnothing, and is righteous and good.

Yousee that Nature does not idle nor keep sabbath. Abide as ye have been born.For if before Abraham there was no need of circumcision, and before Mosesnone of keeping the sabbath, and of festivals, and of oVerings, neither in likemanner is there any need now, after the Son of God, Jesus Christ, has beenborn according to the will of God without sin by the virgin who was of theseed of Abraham. For Abraham himself when in uncircumcision was justiWedand received blessing, on account of the faith with which he believed God, asthe (passage of) Scripture indicates. (23.1–4, tr. Williams)As therefore circumcision began with Abraham, and with Moses sabbathand sacriWces and oVerings and feasts, and it has been proved that these wereappointed because of the hardness of the heart of your people, it was thusrequisite that they should cease, in accordance with the will of the Father, atthe coming of Him who was born Son of God by means of the Virgin whowas of the race of Abraham and the tribe of Judah and David, even Christ,who also was proclaimed as about to come as an everlasting Law and newDisposition for the whole world. . . (43.1, tr. Williams)It is important that in both passages Justin stresses the continuity ofthe new with the old tradition, since Jesus’ origin goes back toAbraham through the Virgin from the tribe of Judas and David.This continuity makes it easier for Justin to claim that, just as thedivine will (\u0013\bıº) gave the Law, so was Jesus born by divine will, inorder to put an end to the Law.146Thus, the earliest attestation of the Christian claim that sacriWcesshould stop after Jesus is contained in Justin’s work, though we canonly imagine whether this statement was the result of Justin’s aware-ness that the Temple had fallen inad70. It is not easy to decide when146See alsoDial. 92.2, where Justin correlates the Law with the expulsion of theJews from Jerusalem. At another point Justin places Gentiles along with the righteousJews; to Justin, both groups are deWnitely going to gain God’s inheritance, even ifGentiles do not observe sabbath-keeping, circumcision, and feasts (Dial. 26.1). Forthis selective Christian ‘alliance’ with Jews, Justin must have been based on Paul’scomment in Rom. 4: 23–4, as is also obvious fromDial. 92.3–4.Christians and Animal SacriWce271"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"the claim that Jesus made sacriWces redundant wasWrst expressed byChristians. However, it is all the more striking that it is conspicuouslypresent in second-century Christian literature, though the Temple hadbeen demolished long ago. Thus, according to a fourth-century cit-ation from the second-century apocryphalGospel of the Ebionites,thisclaim is even projected onto Jesus himself. (The Ebionites were aJewish-Christian sect whose roots possibly date to theWrst century.)147‘I am come to do away with sacriWces, and if ye cease not fromsacriWcing, the wrath of God will not cease from you’ (in Epiphanius,Haer. 30.16.5). This Jesus is not only against sacriWces, but also infavour of vegetarianism: ‘[the disciples:] Where wilt thou that weprepare for thee the passover?...[Jesus:] Do I desire with desire atthis Passover to eatXesh with you?’ (ibid. 30.22.4).TheEpistle of Barnabasalso insists on the futility of sacriWces(ch. 2). To the author, the Old Testament Law ordering sacriWces wasabolished:‘...inorderthatthenewlawofOurLordJesusChrist,whichis without the yoke of necessity, might have its oblation not made byman’ (Ep. of Barn. II.6, Loeb tr.). The assimilation of the Law to a yokegoes back to Paul (Gal. 5: 1–2), and is also used by Justin (Dial.53.4).Despite modern scholarly attempts to emphasize theWnancial burdenwhich the Law might have represented to Jews,148I think it is notnecessary to interpret the term ‘yoke’ inWnancial terms only. Thewords\u000b\bıº\r\u0004ÆandI\f\u0006ªŒ\u0019,usedbyPaulandthewriteroftheEpistleto Barnabasrespectively, might indicate another kind of burden, ratherrelated to the worshipper’s feelings of duty before God than to his or herWnances. All in all, we cannot be sure if one of the reasons why Jews wereconverted to Christianity was their problematic relation to the Law.Surprisingly enough, along with the second-century Christianopposition to sacriWces, the image of the Temple service is vivid inthe minds of Christians. There is an inconsistency between therealization of the loss of the Temple and the strong feeling that it isstill there. Justin himself describes the Paschal sacriWce in the presenttense ‘for when the sheep is being roasted itis roastedarranged infashion like the fashion of the cross, for one spitis piercedstraight147On this group, see Wilson (1995), 148–52.148Rowland (1985), 40 (onWnances), 41 (on obsolescence of the cult in the 1st c.).272Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"from the lower parts to the head, and one again at the back, to whichalso the paws of the sheepare fastened’(Dial. 40.3, tr. Williams, myemphasis). Of course, it could be argued that this passage is not atrustworthy proof of the actuality which the issue of Temple sacriWcestill had, since it is talking about Paschal sacriWce, which could alwaystake place outside of the Temple.149But such an argument is madeinvalid by the following admission of Trypho, which is remarkablydiVerent from Philo’s description of Passover: ‘for we are aware, asyou said, that it is not possible to slay a passover-sheep elsewherethan in Jerusalem, nor to oVer the goats that were commanded at theFast, nor, in short, all the other oVerings’ (Dial. 46.2, tr. Williams).Consequently, we are to conclude that, despite the realization of theFall of the Temple, the reality of its cult was still etched on bothChristian and Jewish minds.On the other hand, Trypho’s admission of the impossibility ofanimal oVerings is not made in a tone of lamentation, somethingwhich indicates that some Jews did not think of the loss of the Templeinad70 as something permanent (the mishnaic authors wouldbelong here). And a noteworthy reference in theEpistle of Barnabasshows that even Christians were aware of a project concerning therebuilding of the Temple: ‘Furthermore he says again, ‘‘Lo, they whodestroyed this temple shall themselves build it.’’ That is happeningnow. For owing to the war it was destroyed by the enemy; at presenteven the servants of the enemy will build it up again’ (Ep. of Barn.XVI. 3–4, Loeb tr.).150Some Jews might have lived with the dream ofseeing the Temple rebuilt, but, as we shall see below, Christians hadalready started seeing sacriWce at another level, namely the meta-phorical one.To sum up the evidence on second-century Christians and Jewishanimal sacriWce: the material studied above has shown second-centuryChristians taking a more clearly hostile attitude towards JewishsacriWce than in theWrst century. It is likely, but not provable, thatthe material reXects the Christian attitude taken after the Fall of149See my analysis of Philo,De spec. leg. 2, 145–9, in Chapter 4. Could it be thatJustin had in mind Paschal sacriWces taking place out of the Temple or in theDiaspora?150The passage is not without problems, either textual or of meaning. For a shortbut almost exhaustive survey, see Wilson (1995), 131–6.Christians and Animal SacriWce273"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"the Temple inad70, an event clearly referred to in Christian texts. Thedestruction of the centre of Jewish sacriWcial cult must have been seenby Christians as a sign of divine preference, and thus have givenChristian anti-Jewish rhetoric a strong argument.The principle of ̈\re\u0010 I\f\r\f\u000b\r\u0010, present in Christian texts writtenagainst pagans, also deWnes Christian rhetoric against Jews, but it isnow incorporated in the strong anti-Jewish polemics of the secondcentury. In this framework, the Jewish Law is contrasted to Jesus,who is the new Law and the limit between past and present, betweenthe obsolete Judaism and new Christianity. According to the Chris-tian argumentation, the new Law did not ask for animal sacriWces.The old Law had done so in order to preWgure the coming of Jesus,and to prevent the idolatrous Jews from oVering sacriWces to idolsinstead of to God.Especially the latter point gives the Jerusalem Temple a role ofsubstitute for idolatrous sacriWcial institutions. In fact, Christianrhetoric went further and made Jewish sacriWces totally comparableto pagan ones. This contextualization of Jewish with pagan sacriWcesis a new addition to the Old Testament criticism of sacriWces.More undermining metaphorsThere is no space here for an exhaustive presentation of the issue ofChristian sacriWcial metaphors, which continued to be used down tothe second century. What I rather seek to stress is that, while Chris-tian rhetoric undermined the material reality of animal sacriWce, itcontinued to be shaped by the experience of Jewish worship, even ifthe Temple had long fallen.151The most characteristic use of substitution of Jewish sacriWcialimages is made in the Epistle to the Hebrews. There, the use ofsacriWcial allegories based on Jewish ritual reaches its peak, andthat is why the inherent symbolisms leave the dating of the documentstill uncertain.152The allegorical interpretation of Jewish sacriWcialritual made in this text laid the foundations on which metaphorical151This wasWrst done by Paul; cf. 1 Cor. 5: 7:\u0012e \u0007\u0006\u0003\u000eÆ -\tH\f \"\u0007bæ -\tH\f K\u0012\u0002Ł\u00194æØ\u0003\u0012\u000f\u0010.

In the epistle, Jesus is thereal High Priest (4: 14–6: 20; 7: 1–10:18). The writer mainly emphasizesthe expiatory function which the death of Jesus the High Priest fulWlled,and which he assimilates to the sacriWce oVered on the Day of Atone-ment (Heb. 9: 1–10:18). This sacriWce of Jesus happened once and forall (K\u0005\u0006\u0007Æ\u0017, 10: 10), and its expiatory function cannot be performed byany other cultic means: ‘For if we wilfully persist in sin after havingreceived the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacriWcefor sins, but a fearful prospect of judgement, and a fury ofWre that willconsume the adversaries’ (Heb. 10: 26–7, NRSV).Clement of Rome also talks about Jesus as a sacriWcer and a victim,a High Priest and a\u0003ø\u0012æØ\b\f(the latter term presumably alluding toPhilo’s ‘preservation oVering’). Here one notes the shift which ren-ders the sacriWcial term (\u0003ø\u0012æØ\b\f) thetenorof the metaphor, and‘Jesus’ thevehiclewhich interprets the tenor:`o\u0012\u0019 - ›\u000b\u000f\u0010;IªÆ\u0007\u0019\u0012\b\u0004;K\ffiw \roæ\b\t\r\f \u0012e \u0003ø\u0012æØ\b\f M\tH\f;\u001a)\u0019\u0003\bF\f 4æØ\u0003\u0012\u000f\f;\u0012e\fIæ\u000eØ\ræ\u0015Æ \u0012H\f \u0007æ\b\u0003\u0005\bæH\f -\tH\f...(ICl.

Lake, slightly modiWed)In some examples, allegory and metaphor cannot be clearly dis-tinguished from one another, as in the following extract from Clem-ent of Rome’sWrst Epistle to the Corinthians, where Clement’sintention is an appeal to institutional order. Clement strengthenshis argument by drawing examples from Jewish cultic life (ICl. XL–XLI). It is a puzzling question how far Clement’s Corinthian readerswere acquainted with Jewish cult, but this issue does not seem to havediscouraged him. Interestingly enough, he uses the present tense.Let each one of us, brethren, be well pleasing to God in his own rank, andhave a good conscience, not transgressing the appointed rules of his minis-tration, with all reverence. Not in every place, my brethren, are the dailysacriWces oVered or the free-will oVerings, or the sin-oVerings (±\tÆæ\u0012\u0004Æ\u0010)and trespass-oVerings (\u0007º\u0019\t\t\rº\r\u0004Æ\u0010), but only in Jerusalem; and there alsothe oVering is not made in every place, but before the shrine, at the altar, andthe oVering isWrst inspected by the High Priest . . .

Even if not in the passages containing the images of Jewishcult, Clement does not forget to stress the Christian principle, whichhe strengthens by combining it to Old Testament teachings:%\u0007æ\b\u0003\u000b\r\u0010;I\u000b\rº\u0005\b\u0004;› \u000b\r\u0003\u0007\u000f\u0012\u0019\u0010 \"\u0007\u0006æ\u000e\rØ \u0012H\f ±\u0007\u0006\f\u0012ø\f·\bP\u000bb\f \bP\u000b\r\fe\u0010\u000eæefi\u0011\rØ \rN \tc \u0012e K\u0017\b\t\bº\bª\rE\u0003ŁÆØ ÆP\u0012fiH.(ICl.

In theDialogue with TryphoJustin quotes at length fromOld Testament prophecies and Psalms (Dial. 22), in order to justifyhis insistence on the redundancy of sacriWces.154A completely new realm of reality, to which Christians appliedsacriWcial terms, is that of the recently born Christian cult. In thesecond century it seems that an attempt was being made on the partof Christians towards the establishment of purely cultic entities,which would ‘replace’ those realms that were non-functional tothem, those of altars and animals. Thus sacriWcial terms were usedof the cultic act of communion. The following extract from Justin isone of the few important passages which talk speciWcally aboutcommunion as a sacriWcial oVering, and in fact with the notion ofsacriWce in the tenor part of the metaphor, as is the case in laterliturgical texts.

(Dial. 41. 3, my tr.)These and other examples drawn from Christian catecheticaltexts156show that, after Paul’s letters, metaphors based on the ritualof Jewish animal sacriWce do not suddenly recur in second-centuryanti-Jewish polemics. Christian metaphorical language relating tosacriWce, deployed from the beginnings of the Christian movement,continued to develop gradually.157As I have said with regard to Paul’smetaphors, this linguistic phenomenon contributed to the dissoci-ation of audiences and congregations from the material and expi-atory connection with animals.But, most importantly, we have seen that the writers of earlycatechetical works deployed images drawn from the Temple cult,without thinking them inappropriate. We have seen Clement stress-ing the principle of ̈\re\u0010 I\f\r\f\u000b\r\u0010, but, in a diVerent passage, he usessacriWcial metaphors based on Jewish cultic images. In other cate-chetical texts the language of Christian supersession (explicit andabounding in Justin’sDialogue with Trypho) is less explicitly pre-sent.158With the evidence as it stands, one can only wonder whetherthese cases point to a diVerent degree of intensity in Christiancriticism of Jewish sacriWce, or only to the conWdent accommodationof the Jewish cultic code into Christian language. In other words,would these metaphors have been used, if the Temple had still beenstanding in the second century, and to what degree would thenegative disposition toward all kinds of sacriWce be evident?This question becomes more urgent when we come across somesecond-century traditions which depict scenes of pre-ad70 conXictbetween Jews and Christians because of the attitude of the latter156Ignatius,Ad Rom.

Thus, the apocryphalGospel of Peter(mid-2ndc.) presents the early Christians as persecuted by the Jews, becausethe latter considered Christians to be hostile toward the JewishTemple:159‘But I mourned with my fellows, and being wounded inheart we hid ourselves, for we were sought after by them as evildoersand as persons who wanted to setWre to the Temple. Because of allthese things we were fasting and sat mourning and weeping nightand day until the sabbath’ (Gospel of Peter7.26–7, on the events afterJesus’ burial). Perhaps it would not be irrelevant to stress here that innone of the works of Christian eschatology is the spatial notion of aTemple for sacriWces present.160To conclude this examination of the second-century evidence, it wouldseem that, in contrast to theWrst century, when Christians did not havea clear doctrine regarding Jewish sacriWce, and only referred to idolmeatbut not particularly to pagansacriWce, the second century isricher in evidence for a Christian attitude towards sacriWce.Christians perceived God as being in need of nothing. This was themain weapon against both their pagan and Jewish adversaries in thesecond century. That is why, in theWrst case, Christians did notchoose to direct pagan devotion to the real God by suggestingsacriWces to Him, and, in the second, they boldly equated JewishsacriWces with pagan sacriWces. However, despite theWery anti-Jewishpolemics, the—real or literary—memory of the Temple cult con-tinued to shape the metaphorical sacriWcial language of Christians.The rhetoric deployed in Christian texts has its counterpart in theeveryday life of Christians. Second-century pagans stress the absenceof altars from Christian cult, and it is certain that problems ofChristian participation in pagan rituals did arise in communities,159See also the imaginary setting in the Coptic gnosticApocalypse of Peter(2nd–3rd c.), in Hennecke–Schneemelcher, vol. 2, p.72: ‘But when he [¼Jesus] said this,I saw (in a vision) the priests (take counsel) and the people run towards us withstones as if to slay us. And I was afraid that he would die.’160See theWnal vision in Rev. 21: 1–22: 5. Another Christian Apocalyptic work,dating to Trajan’s reign and classiWed as apocryphal,the Book of Elchasai, despite itstopical attachment to prayer in the direction of Jerusalem (Epiph.Haer. 19.3.5),contains the following negative stance regarding sacriWces: ‘He rejects sacriWces andpriestly rites as being alien to God and never oVered to God at all according to thefathers and the law’, ibid. 19.3.6 f.278Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"and caused suspicions which led to the prosecution of Christians.The attitude maintained by Christians on trial is also consistent withthe anti-sacriWcial teachings, although the Christian refusal to oVeran animal (or other) sacriWce was probably not the oYcially statedcause of their arrest. The exact role of sacriWce in the judicial pro-cedure directed by pagan governors remains unclear.SacriWces were not oVered by Christians, but the notions related tothe Jewish sacriWcial system were frequently used by them to denoteother sections of the horizontal line—for instance, institutionalorder. More importantly, metaphorical sacriWcial language began tobe used of the Christian cult itself.It seems that Christians came to be against the act of oVering initself, even as a sign of honour to a recipient other than God. It isalong these lines that Justin remarks that the only concrete accus-ation brought against Christians is that the latter do not worship thesame gods as Greeks, neither do they oVer libations and animalsacriWcesto the dead(I Apol. 24). In comparison with the surround-ing Mediterranean religions, where the predominant element in cultwas that of the oVering, the objection to the idea of the oVering wasindeed a cultic revolution on the part of Christians.C. ANATTEMPTATACONCLUSIONPresenting the evidence for pre-ad70 Christians, it is evident that theopposition of Christians to pagan animal sacriWce and sacriWcial meatis explicitly obvious from theWrst century onwards (Acts 14: 8–18, and1 Corinthians). The issue of sacriWce oVered by Gentile Christians tothe Christian God does not really arise inWrst-century sources.With regard to the relation of pre-ad70 Christians to JewishsacriWce, scholarly interpretations are more diYcult. In this bookwe have come to realize that the place where Christians are presentedas having delivered their preaching, namely the Temple, was evi-dently an area essentially characterized by sacriWcial activity. Theevents leading to the expulsion of Christians from Jerusalem remainunclear to us, although among these Stephen’s speech must havebeen pivotal, since it is presented as taking place just before theChristians and Animal SacriWce279"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"expulsion. Stephen’s speech was regarded as directed against theTemple and Jewish customs; in all probability, the notion of ‘cus-toms’ must have included the customary Jewish sacriWces.Paul, too, was accused of being against Jewish customs, and hispresence in the Temple described in Acts 21 was thought of by theelders as a way to disprove these accusations. But Paul’s oVering of asacriWce in the Temple seems very diYcult to interpret, in view of thefacts that several groups of Christians coexisted in Jerusalem, eachregarding the Mosaic Law diVerently, and that Paul himself con-sciously avoided synchronizing Jesus and the Law in his letters.Apart from Paul’s case, our evidence for pre-ad70 Christianparticipation in the Temple sacriWcial cult is based only on anexsilentioargument, although, apparently, Jewish Christians ‘zealousfor the Law’ must have oVered sacriWces. On the other hand, sacriW-cial metaphors are present already in Paul’s letters, and they areoriginal.161Most importantly, the role of sacriWcial metaphors can-not but have served to undermine the reality of animal sacriWce,since, in metaphors, some parts of reality having to do with animalswere put aside in favour of other parts of reality, or of new ones, suchas, for instance, Jesus the man, or a person’s life dedicated to God.In the second century Christian apologists explicitly express theirobjection to all kinds of sacriWce. The principle that God needsnothing ( ̈\re\u0010 I\f\r\f\u000b\r\u0010), a completely new axiom, is repeatedlystated, and governs the Christian attitude towards both pagans andJews, whereas pagan observers note the lack of altars in honour of theChristian God. Because of the polemical character that Christianad Judaeosliterature exhibited in that period, the principle of ̈\re\u0010I\f\r\f\u000b\r\u0010is underplayed in favour of strongly derogatory commentson Jews and their Temple, which, however, was no longer there.Second-century Christian writers, when addressing their congre-gations, use images of and allusions to the Jewish Temple. Along withthese images, metaphorical sacriWcial language keeps being used. Infact, a metaphor by Justin has made us see that, at the same time asthe Eucharist was being established as a Christian cultic act, itsmetaphorical analogy to sacriWce was in the process of beingWxed.161With the main one being the Paschal metaphor used of Jesus’ death: 1 Cor. 5: 7.280Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"In the following centuries this purely cultic entity would replace theentities of altars and animals.Second-century references and allusions to the Temple prove thatChristian writers do not take into account the Jewish or paganbackground of their readers. In fact, when the apologists refer toJudaism they do not diVerentiate between Jerusalem Jews, DiasporaJews, and God-fearers, and there is not one mention of writers suchas Philo or Josephus. Second-century Christians see Judaism in thesame way as they see paganism: as a single unit.However, the question of background relates not only to theaddressees of Christian writers, but also to the writers themselves.Not much is known about the personality of each of the second-century Christian writers, nor do Christian texts help us to drawconclusions on their writers. More importantly, the texts of Chris-tians do not leave space for us to guess anything about the way inwhich Christians transformed themselves from oVerers of animalsacriWce to ardent opponents of it.In sum, the evidence for the sacriWcial beliefs of the groupsconstituting the early body of Christian believers is as follows:As regardsJerusalem and Jewish Christians: pre-ad70 evidence isinconclusive as regards their involvement in the Temple cult. All weknow is that some Jewish Christians were ‘zealous for the Law’, andsome other Christians constituted a diVerent group from them.Those ‘zealous for the Law’ must have been closely attached to theTemple and its cult. No speciWc mention of post-ad70 JewishChristians is made in the evidence in this context.The beliefs ofDiaspora Jewish converts, and their expectationswhen they became Christians, remain unclear, either in the pre-ad70 period or after it.Gentile Christians: in theWrst century, they are advised by theirleaders to avoid eating sacriWcial meat. Second-century attestationsshow that Christians abstained from the whole procedure of sacriWce,both to pagan gods and to their own God. Christian avoidance ofoVering sacriWce caused problems to the everyday life of Christians inpagan cities, and played an important role in their being condemnedby the pagan authorities.Christians and Animal SacriWce281"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"God-fearers: the question which still remains unanswered is the wayin which God-fearers could move from environments where pagansacriWces were practised to synagogue environments, where catech-esis used examples from Jewish sacriWces (independently of theTemple destruction inad70), and from this to Christian environ-ments, with the latter being so multifarious in their composition andattitudes to Judaism.Assuming that the recipient of a hypothetical Christian animalsacriWce would apparently be the same as the God worshipped in theJerusalem Temple, the most important question remaining open iswhy Christianity emerged as a religion with no attachment to anysort of altars, either the Jewish one or others. However, a questionsuch as ‘why did Christians not oVer animal sacriWces right from thebeginning of their existence as a sect?’ is not valid. Only in the secondcentury is the lack of altars (apparently to the Christian God) pointedout by pagan observers. Besides, the vagueness of the evidencesurrounding the relation of pre-ad70 Christians to the Templedoes not allow us to form any idea about the proportion of Chris-tians involved in the Temple cult. Consequently, we can only retro-spectively shape our question and ask whether traces of the Christianopposition to sacriWce can be detected in the earliest evidence.The answer is that these traces do exist. Beginning from the leastreliable relevant traces, one could draw the reader’s attention to thetestimony of Epiphanius, where, as we have seen, the reported sayingof Jesus is ‘I am come to do away with sacriWces’. While acknowledgingthe many layers of tradition covering this saying, I should stress thatthis legacy stems from an Ebionite environment, that is, a Jewish-Christian sect whose origins might lie in theWrst century. As such, itindicates that, in all probability, among the many groups which madeup Jewish Christianity there were Christians who expressed doubtsabout sacriWcial cult in the Temple, although we cannot knowwhether these doubts were expressed beforead70. It would be evenmore tempting to wonder whether the aforementioned saying goesback to Jesus—but this question would be posed in vain.As we have seen, further traces can be drawn from the text of Acts.The example of Christians such as those around Mnason (Acts 21)allows us to assume that, among the multifarious early Jerusalem282Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Christians, there were those who did not feel as closely attached tothe Temple as the so-called ‘zealous for the Law’.Next, we have traces drawn from the Christian response to Juda-ism, even though not explicitly connected to sacriWce. Thus, we knowthat some of the early Christians—including Paul—adopted a newway of seeing the Mosaic Law, because they saw the Law throughJesus and his death. The exact path which this reading of the Lawfollowed is not traceable, but I believe that it has its roots in the directcontact of Jesus with his disciples and caused a crucial change to thevertical line of the sacriWcial mechanism. It is reasonable to relate thisChristian reading of the Law through Jesus and his death to theexplicit second-century Christian attitude, that the Jewish Law wastemporary and was annulled through Jesus since the time he died. Inthis context the Law is given the function of preWguring facts fromthe ‘Jesus story’.There are traces of a further sphere of discourse, whose clear andcontinuous presence from the beginning of Christianity makes onesuspect that it is not incompatible with opposition to sacriWce. This istheWeld of sacriWcial metaphors, whose use, steadily repeated andexpanded from theWrst to the second century, undermined the veryheart of sacriWcial experience: by sacriWcial metaphors, audienceswere led to see a completely diVerent sacriWcial reality from the onethey had known, and the new reality had nothing to do with animals,their appearance, touch, smell, even their taste (though, in the lastcase, we cannot know on which scale Christianity inXuenced meat-eating). Of course, it is not to be denied that in theWrst century (aswe have seen, this applies to the second century as well) any meta-phorical allusions to sacriWce derived from the Jewish sacriWcialcontext.Even if distant and dissimilar, theWrst-century signs of independ-ence from animal sacriWce should not be underplayed: these mustconstitute our bridge to the second century, which is characterized bya uniformity as regards the refusal of Christians to oVer animalsacriWces.In Christianity, theWnal change in ritual which was obvious in thesecond century amounted to a full-scale transformation. Keeping toour terminology, I would say that it consisted in the practical, but notlinguistic, abolition of a section of thehorizontalline of the sacriWcialChristians and Animal SacriWce283"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"system and in the focusing on another section of it. Whereas in theGreek and Jewish systems man’s condition and the speciWc occasiondetermined—and were expressed through—the choice of victimand the nature of the sacriWce, in Christianity man’s condition wascommunicated to God directly, without a victim being the mediatoron the path to God. Before the establishment of the cultic act ofChristian communion, the focus of Christianity was on humanactions and life attitudes. And it was a feature original to Christianitythat the abolition of the animal victim was not necessarily connectedto vegetarianism, at least in the form of Christianity which prevailedin the following centuries.Of course, in the following centuries one sees exceptions to thisalienation from animals in religion,162but it is important to note thatthese do not involve the Christian God as a recipient of sacriWces.From another point of view, these exceptional instances shouldrather cause scholars to ponder on the multiple layers underlyingthe development of Christianity into a religion with no altars foranimal sacriWce.162See n. 137 in this chapter.284Christians and Animal SacriWce"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"7ConclusionsAs promised in Chapter 1, here I shall try to analyse in a ratherdifferent way the evidence for Greek, Jewish, and Christian animalsacrifice in the period 100bc–ad200. This analysis will be conductedaccording to the scheme presented in section 2 of Chapter 1: on thebasis of it, we shall see whether the meeting of three religions resultedin ritual changes. Thus, the hermeneutic method used in Chapters 2to 6 has as its counterpoint a search for semiotic changes.I should remind the reader that, according to the model presentedin section 2 of Chapter 1, sacrifice is the worshipper’s way to ap-proach the recipient of the sacrifice, and is a mechanism consisting oftwo lines, oneverticaland the otherhorizontal. The vertical lineconcerns the relation between the offerer of sacrifice and its recipient,a relation which is expressed in several codes of beliefs shared byworshippers, theological and philosophical. These beliefs are com-municated to people through the code of language.The code of language is also the main code through which thenotions of thehorizontalline are communicated. The horizontal lineconcerns the practical realms from which the particulars for ananimal sacrifice are drawn: the worshipper’s society, the space andthe materials, the animal or other offerings, the human activities,values, and lifestyles. Each of the above can be represented in asection of the horizontal line, except for language, which movesalong the whole line, and thus makes easy the interchange of wordsbetween several realms, a mechanism from which metaphor derives.Any change in the vertical line, that is, in the relation of the wor-shipper to the recipient of sacrifice, results in radical changes in thehorizontal line, that is, in new cultic codes. However, minor changes"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"can take place in the horizontal line without any change in thevertical line (religious beliefs) preceding them.Below, we shall see that what caused a ritual revolution on the partof Christianity was a change in the vertical line. However, as regardsGreek paganism and Judaism, our survey of the evidence has shownthat neither of them went through a change in the vertical line(beliefs).Especially as regards Greek religion, a passage from Dionysiussuggests that, in the few cases where changes occurred in Greek ritual,no deliberate change in religious interests was the cause, but ratherthe passing of time.As regards Judaism, the non-biblical details contained in the textof Josephus consisted rather in minor additions to or variations inthe biblical cultic rules, and not in the adoption of a different set ofbeliefs. The same applies to the Mishnah, whose existence did notundermine the Bible, since it consisted of many additions and spe-cifications of the biblical rules. The Mishnah did not foster a newreligious system, but better delineated the old one; its compilationwas not a change in the vertical line (new beliefs), but an importantchange in the horizontal line (variation in method) of the Jewishsacrificial system. However, the mishnaic rules were never followedin practice, because the Mishnah was written afterad70.Finally, Philo’s conceptual scheme by which he connected sacrifi-cial reality with ethical meanings gave a new dimension to thebiblical rules, but, as Philo himself stressed, his intention was notto change the Jewish ways of approaching God. Philo’s allegoriza-tions simply connected different realms corresponding to both thevertical and the horizontal lines of the sacrificial mechanism. On thebasis of the available evidence, we cannot know whether his teachinghad a more radical impact on Jews and Jewish Christians, and sowhether it affected the very heart of animal sacrificial worship.As noted in Chapter 1, in this book I have dealt mainly with thehorizontal line of animal sacrifice, that is, the objective historicalreality of the Greek and Jewish sacrificial cults and, by extension, ofChristianity. With regard to the horizontal line of Greek animalsacrifice, we have seen that Greeks adopted many different animalsacrificial practices, which on the one hand depended on local tradi-tions, and on the other, on the Greek peculiarity of differentiating286Conclusions"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"the victim’s properties according to its recipient (god(dess), hero).In civic ritual, animal sacrifice usually served as the central channel ofinteraction between city and individual, both in its role as a sign ofpiety and as a means of feeding the population. Along with theseaspects, the offering of an animal sacrifice could also be an inner needfelt by the worshipper, or an obligation either officially imposed oncitizens by state authorities or socially expected to be performed byindividuals.The peculiarity of the horizontal line in the Jewish sacrificialsystem is that, in the Jerusalem Temple, animal sacrifices—bothpublic and private—were always carried out by priests. However,the occasion of Passover might have given Jews the opportunity tocarry out an animal slaughter themselves. The limited variety inJewish sacrificial practice—that attested beforead70 and not thatof the Mishnah—depended on the offerer’s intention (honour, grati-tude, deletion of a moral mistake). The example of Philo’s teachingshas shown that Diaspora Jews were familiar with the concept ofsacrifice, and that a considerable number among them would haveconnected the code of the ritual killing of animals with philosophicaland theological meanings. And so long as the evidence is notdetailed, we cannot confirm theories which present the distancebetween Diaspora Jews and the Temple as a factor helping earlyChristians to form a metaphorical sacrificial vocabulary.1By thesame token, I reject a similar theory regarding the distance betweenTemple and Gentile communities as the reason which made Pauloblige Gentile Christians to abandon all forms of sacrifice and choosethe Eucharist instead.2Since Christianity started as a Jewish sect in the Graeco-Romanworld, its study has been placed in the horizontal line of the Jewishsacrificial system, and thus in the framework of the Temple. But oneshould also look for possible deviations from this framework—forinstance, Christian altars. The first Christian converts, either pagansor Jews, came to Christianity from environments in which peoplewere familiar with the procedure of animal sacrifice; however, inthe second century we come across explicit statements, expressed by1Burkert (1983), 8.2Klawans (2006), 221.Conclusions287"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"both pagans and Christians, that Christians chose not to makeofferings to their God, especially not animal sacrifices. While oneshould admit the multiplicity of early Christian groups and, accord-ingly, the variety in their cultic practices, there is no point in question-ing the fact that, by the second century, Christians were known tohave adopted a ritual radically different from the one current at theirtime. So the horizontal line of the concept of sacrifice in Christianitywas very different from the surrounding concepts.By the second century Christians had radically changed the ritualcodes of their times by practically moving away from the sections ofthe horizontal line corresponding to altars, instruments of slaughter,and animals. They only kept the names of these realities and appliedthem to other sections of the horizontal line, and to a new onecentred on Jesus. In Christianity, the animal and the different partsof its body, along with the symbolisms and portents included in it,ceased to be used in ritual.3Gestures and images pertaining to animalsacrifice, of which historical necessity deprived the Jews, and whichmishnaic rabbis tried to keep alive, were finally abandoned by Chris-tians as a result of a conscious choice. At the practical—although notat the linguistic—level Christians objected to all forms of sacrifice.Of course, only the following centuries would witness ritualchanges on a major scale, caused by the Christian relinquishmentof animal sacrifice: given the pre-eminence of paganism in theRoman Empire, abstinence from the ‘standard’ ritual of animalsacrifice would be more strongly felt in the Empire as a whole thanin places only where Jewish Christians lived. For instance, what wasreally going to be lost would be the officially maintained festivals andceremonies in a landscape shaped by Graeco-Roman religious archi-tecture. Altars outside temples or in the open, and roads along whichsacrificial processions used to pass, would be replaced by other visualfeatures, which would be used in the framework of a new calendar.It is worth considering whether the changes brought about byChristianity had serious implications on sections of the horizontalline other than worship alone, that is, on financial and social rela-tions. As regards any financial changes caused by the abandonment3To pagans, the loss would be particularly felt in the field of splanchnoscopy,whose code continued to be understood in the period studied in this book.288Conclusions"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"of animal sacrifice, I think it is rather unwise to assume that theemergence of Christianity resulted in a crisis in animal husbandryand the economy related to it, as the unique testimony of Pliny mightlead us to think. Meat-traders could equally well sell meat other thansacrificial,4even if this would mean that, in the chain of exchanges,priests would cease being the intermediaries between traders ofanimals and meat-traders. My personal impression is that, after aperiod of ‘depression’ in the sale of sacrificial meat, butchers wouldstart dealing in meat from animals slaughtered in secular contexts.(The only remaining question concerns the exact profession of thosecarrying out the slaughter. But, again, this is all hypothetical.) In-deed, it would make more sense to say that abstinence from animalsacrifice reduced the expenses of cities and individuals, and thus,instead of creating a financial crisis, helped people face financialdifficulties.5Although one cannot deny the general social changes broughtabout by the adoption of Christianity, I think it would also be unwiseto expect social changes specifically caused by the Christian aban-donment of animal sacrifice. In this book I have stressed that theevidence on this specific issue is not direct, and concerns onlycommunities whose Christian members resisted civic legislation onsacrifice or a social ethos of sacrificing, an attitude possibly resultingnot only in the social isolation of these members, but also in theirpunishment by the authorities: I have thus tried to sketch the mainlines of a possibly difficult encounter between observant pagans andChristians forsaking ancestral cultic modes.In the long term, to an external observer, the most easily perceivedimplication of Christianity in the area of the Mediterranean wouldnot be financial or social changes, but the abrogation of the old culticways.4Paul, in his First Letter to the Corinthians, makes us understand that meat placedon a table or sold in a market could have been other than sacrificial. Only then doesthe wordI\fÆŒæ\u0004\f\b\f\u0012\r\u0010make sense (1 Cor. 10: 25, 27). Even the letter of Pliny (Ep.X.96) does not exclude the possibility that non-sacrificial meat was sold; Pliny justpoints out that the flesh ofvictims(meaning sacrificial victims) had stopped beingavailable.5Mitchell (1999), 127, makes the same remark with regard to the cult of TheosHypsistos.Conclusions289"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"EPILOGUE: A SUGGESTION CONCERNING THE REASONSFOR THE CESSATION OF ANIMAL SACRIFICEAs I pointed out in the Introduction to this book, and also concludedin the last chapter, the question of ‘why’, regarding Christian oppos-ition to animal sacrifice, is only partly valid, because (a) explicitevidence for this opposition only concerns the second century; and(b) there are indications that Jewish Christians in Jerusalem did notimmediately stop offering sacrifices in the Temple.The question of ‘why’ being difficult to answer, some readers ofthis book may still feel that our historical journey was worth attempt-ing. During it, we have managed to acquire a picture of the varietyencompassed in the issue of animal sacrifice in the first and secondcenturies of Christianity: Gentile Christians might have encounteredproblems in their social relations, in case they decided to relinquishthe pagan code of ritual to which they had adhered; some DiasporaJewish Christians might have been familiar with Philo’s analysis ofanimal sacrifice, others might have regarded the Christian preachingas a preferable solution to the dilemma between Philo’s analysis andthat of the allegorists; God-fearers might have been surprised todiscover that Christianity was giving space to the relinquishment ofJewish sacrifice, whose details they had just started to learn. This isindeed a great variety, and it could perhaps be proved to have beengreater, if we had more evidence.For all this, demanding readers of this book might not be contentwith the journey; they will ask for answers. Acknowledging theurgency of the questionwhy, if animal sacrifice was of such primeand universal importance, Christians should have rejected thisparticular practice, I shall here ponder this question in relation tofirst-century Christianity, since, as we have seen in the last chapter,traces of opposition to sacrifice may date back to the first century.According to the view I have taken as regards the mechanism in asacrificial system, and which was analysed in the first chapter, anychange in theverticalline has results in thehorizontalone, that is, theline of the offerer’s objective reality. Consequently, if we observe aradical change in the horizontal line, we must look for its cause in the290Conclusions"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"vertical line of the sacrificial procedure, the one linking offerer andrecipient. The vertical line will give us the answer to the question of‘why’, when they did, Christians abandoned animal sacrifice.The religion of Christianity did not result from an evolutionaryprocess. Focusing on worship, the most vital part of religion, thepresent book makes it obvious that neither Greek religion nor Juda-ism had begun to decline when Jesus appeared. Christianity emergedunexpectedly from the well-functioning Jewish religious environ-ment, and spread rapidly within the well-functioning pagan religiousenvironment. This sudden historical change must have manifesteditself in the form of sudden changes experienced in the lives ofindividuals.In pagan religion one cannot help acknowledging the historicalimportance of powerful experiences by which the worshipper feelscloser to a god. Such were the experiences of Aelius Aristides, or theApuleian hero Lucius. Similar experiences in the contexts of Judaismand Christianity should not be considered as the concern only oftheologians. I strongly believe that it is time thathistoriansstartedacknowledging the importance of powerful experiences in Judaismand Christianity.For this reason, here I leave aside the early Christians who camefrom pagan environments, because (a) theirs was not the first contactwith Jesus, (b) even after their conversion to Christianity they seem tohave linked concerns about sacrificial practices to their relation withtheir pagan past rather than to any cultic forms within Christianity.Even second-century Christian evidence points to a consideration ofthe notion of ‘sacrifice’ as of a ‘paganizing’ habit, and also to theabstinence of Christians from offering pagan sacrifices (let aloneChristian ones, which are not even mentioned!) So, the attitude ofearly Gentile Christians could not but have been anti-sacrificial aslong as they linked paganism to sacrifice.Keeping to the Jewish context, then, we notice that the newreligion of Christianity offered not a multitude of divine beings butone central figure, Jesus, and this figure had a human shape. Thedirect relation of the first disciples to Jesus, a man who publicly statedthat he had a religious mission, must have constituted a very power-ful experience. The variety in the historical records concerning Jesus,independently of the degree of their reliability, at least testifies toConclusions291"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"such a powerful experience.6This experience concerned what in thisbook has been called the vertical line of the sacrificial procedure. Inother words, Jesus became the person through whom the disciplesdefined their relation to God, although the impact of this powerfulexperience on each of the disciples must have been different.Paul did not see Jesus in person. However, he often insists onhis God-sent visions,7so he appeals to another kind of powerfulexperience, that of his ‘personal’ contact with the divine sphere. ToPaul, these visions defined his own vertical line through which heapproached God. It is also noticeable that the writer of Acts seeks toconnect Paul with the layers of Christian tradition which are closestto Jesus. Thus, Mnason, around whom Paul and a Christian group ‘notzealous for the Law’ gathered, was an ‘early disciple’. Also, the report ofPaul’s vision in Damascus contains an identification-statement ofthe voice speaking to Paul as being that ofJesus (not ‘God’). It is not,then, improbable that the text of Acts contains hints at a traditionwhich perceived Paul as having connected his visions with the figure ofJesus.The powerful experience of Jesus’ presence among the twelvedisciples, and that of Paul’s divine visions, with the possibility ofthe latter being connected with Jesus by Paul himself, apparentlycaused a change in the conception of God which these particularJews had previously possessed. This inner change was broughtabout by their direct or indirect contact with Jesus, and it was notof the same nature for each one of them. In my own view, it seemsvery probable that some of the disciples, and Paul also, havingexperienced this contact, felt an inner change which made themfocus on things quite different from their ancestral cultic ways.The emphasis of the evidence on the existence of several Christiangroups, with different degrees of attachment to the ancestralJewish tradition, makes even more trustworthy the possibility ofthe existence of a Christian group whose members felt that aninner change led them away from Jewish customs. Moreover, thecases of Mnason and Paul, as presented in the text of Acts, leave6H. von Campenhausen has stressed the air of ‘authority’ emanating from Jesus’presence. See von Campenhausen (1969), 1–11.71 Cor. 15: 8, 2 Cor. 12: 1–6. See also Acts, 9: 1–7, 22: 17.292Conclusions"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"space for the hypothesis (expressed here with reservation) that thecloser a person was or felt to the presence of Jesus, the easier he foundit to detach himself from ancestral modes.As the differences among the groups of early Christians have led usto assume, the disciples’ personal contact with Jesus did not cause thesame powerful experience to everyone, and, what is more, when thedifferent powerful experiences were communicated to new Christianproselytes they did not have the same impact on everyone. The figureof Jesus maintained an important role in all streams of the Christiantradition, but this did not solve the problem of the place which theLaw would acquire in relation to Jesus. Especially those Christians‘zealous for the Law’ must have had great difficulty in considering theLaw as a secondary link to God, which is why they wholeheartedlyparticipated in the sacrificial cult.In sum, I believe that the powerful experience which some Jewshad from contact with Jesus, either in his life or in a vision, resultedin a new apprehension of God which, in turn, led to an exceptionalchange in cultic semiotics, namely, the tendency to abolish ancestralcustoms. Surprisingly enough, and maybe with the event of the Fallof the Temple having contributed to this, this change in culticsemiotics came to be the rule in the second century, so that in theend Christianity meant the abolition of sacrifice. I must admit,though, that this theory depends on the weight one gives to thestep(s) leading from contact with Jesus to the new apprehension ofGod, something which we can never be clear about.Two factors must be connected with the crucial change in theapprehension of God felt by some early Christians. The first is theritual policy of the man Jesus himself. As we have seen, Jesus isreported to have taken the Temple for granted and to have been tothe Temple, but is not reported to have praised the Temple and itsworship. Thus, just as some Christians could continue the practice ofoffering sacrifices in the Jerusalem Temple, others could easily inter-rupt (or even cease?) this practice. And the respective Christiangroups would not come into conflict, unless someone from onegroup overtly denounced the others. That is why Jerusalem Chris-tians attached to the Temple could peacefully coexist with Christianswho were not known as especially attached to it, until the day Paulcame to the city (Acts 21).Conclusions293"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"The second factor is the inconsistency of the metaphorical sacri-ficial code used by early Christians. In early Christian writings dif-ferent meanings are given to the term ‘sacrifice’, which extend overmany sections of the horizontal line, from the life of Jesus to theactivity of preaching8and the principle of philanthropy.9Even if weaccept the existence of Christians who abided by the Jerusalem cult,these differences must have resulted from the various (one might sayspasmodic) attempts of early Christians to reconsider, re-evaluate,reinterpret, and, in some cases, replace animal sacrifice.Christians continued to elaborate—not always consistently—themetaphorical sacrificial vocabulary which they had established beforead70, and to expand the metaphorical use of the notion ‘sacrifice’ byapplying the term to areas of life (that is, sections of the horizontalline) which had not been considered as sacrifices before. This phe-nomenon was as subversive of the hitherto standard ritual in Judaismand Mediterranean paganism, as it was creative in terms of linguisticpossibilities.On the other hand, the use of sacrificial metaphors might seem adiscrepancy subverting the whole cultic transformation which Chris-tianity brought about: for instance, despite the distance from the realsacrificial gestures and particulars, the Christian metaphor of a Lambsymbolizing Jesus continued to be deployed.Most importantly, despite the uncompromising attack of the sec-ond-century apologists on the idea of ‘offering’, at times there was arevival of the ‘lost’ aspects of the horizontal line, and thus we evencome across sacrificial feasts in honour of local saints.10Why did Christians continue to use sacrificial language even aftertheir message had been understood and spread? Why did they comeback to the ritual code of acts conducted in an animal offering? Atfirst sight, this might show that Christianity started life by claiming82 Cor. 2: 14–16:(fiH\u000bb ̈\rfiH \u000e\u0006æØ\u0010 \u0012fiH \u0007\u0006\f\u0012\b\u0012\r ŁæØÆ\t\u0013\r\u0002\b\f\u0012Ø -\tA\u0010 K\f \u0012fiH 4æØ\u0003\u0012fiHŒÆd \u0012c\fO\u0003\tc\f \u0012B\u0010 ª\f!\u0003\rø\u0010 ÆP\u0012\bF \u0005Æ\f\ræ\bF\f\u0012Ø \u000bØ\u001a-\tH\f K\f \u0007Æ\f\u0012d \u0012\u000f\u0007fiø:‹\u0012Ø 4æØ\u0003\u0012\bF\rPø\u000b\u0004ÆK\u0003\tb\f \u0012fiH ̈\rfiH K\f \u0012\bE\u0010 \u0003ø\u0011\b\t\u0015\f\bØ\u0010 ŒÆd K\f \u0012\bE\u0010 I\u0007\bººı\t\u0015\f\bØ\u0010:\bx\u0010 \tb\fO\u0003\tcŁÆ\f--\u0006\u0012\bı \rN\u0010 Ł\u0006\fÆ\u0012\b\f;\bx\u0010 \u000bbO\u0003\tc \u0011øB\u0010 \rN\u0010 \u0011ø\f.9Heb. 13: 16:\u0012B\u0010 \u000bb \rP\u0007\bØ\u0004Æ\u0010 ŒÆd Œ\bØ\fø\f\u0004Æ\u0010 \tc K\u0007ØºÆ\fŁ\u0006\f\r\u0003Ł\r:\u0012\bØÆ\u0002\u0012ÆØ\u0010 ªaæŁı\u0003\u0004ÆØ\u0010 \rPÆæ\r\u0003\u0012\rE\u0012ÆØ › ̈\r\u000f\u0010.10For these feasts, see Ch. 6, n. 137.

Andthis would mean that Christians were defeated in their choice totransform ritual.Looked at in a different way, though, this Christian deployment ofsacrificial codes of language might indicate that Christians becamemore confident, and consequently more open to the tactic of pre-serving a certain sacrificial code in matters religious as a link withboth Greek and Jewish cultic traditions. After all, the metaphor‘Lamb–Jesus’ was too conventional to encapsulate the whole previ-ous range of victims and meanings. But if that is the case, when didChristians feel certain that their message had been sufficiently andsteadily communicated, so that they could adopt this tactic (i.e.before or afterad70)?Perhaps, despite the Christian originality in worship, the conceptof a creature put to death for a religious purpose was so stronglyetched onto the collective unconscious that Christians did not dareto obliterate it. What remains incontrovertible is that, with thespread of Christianity, animal sacrifice ceased to be considered asthe standard ritual practice in the Graeco-Roman Mediterranean.Conclusions295"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Bibliography1.
