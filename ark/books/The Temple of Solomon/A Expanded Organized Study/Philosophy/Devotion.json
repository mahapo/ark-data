Fifteen writers drenched to the marrow of their bones in devotional work. In onc sense, to be devoted is to be utterly consumed. In another sense, it is to be confronted. This is an invitation to dare to drink. Devoted is an important hook, not for the superficially shock­ing intensity of spiritual practice which transgresses from passive adoration into cutting, fucking and shooting up. There are also more tender acts in these pages which require at least as much attention. The power resides in the experience that is communicated from a direct connection with the spirit world. Devotion is about establishing and deepening that connection. We know that reading this will be for many of you a trans­formative experience. Placing this many votive candles together makes a conflagration. Devoted is a book that has been difficult to write. Devotion requires an uncommon degree of honesty. we must destroy ourselves to create. In Japanese swordsmanship there is a pro­cess known as 'breaking the mirror and polishing the stone', this is the way of devotion. The devotee must be flayed. The surface image destroyed and the stone worn smooth. The swordsman is also the artist facing a blank canvas. We need first to create this empty space, this swept circle. Only by cleaning the ego, removing what we think we know. can we encounter true art. The words in this hook have been hard won. Devotion establishes connection and then teaches direct from the source. It is here that new material bursts into life, granting us revelations, visions, and life changing experiences. Fresh threats to orthodoxy. It destroys power structures built around received truths. It replaces doubt with gnostic certainty. It brings both evolution and revolutionary progress. If you are not one of the bold, brave or crazy, then perhaps you have not been chosen, yet."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Devoted With occult bookshelves looking more like autopsy reports, we are proud to anno unce that gather ed here arc new voices, here is the magickal revival. These radically different voices and styles all attest that Pan is not dead, and neither is Sabalon, Ishtar, Hecate , Ulith, Dionysos, Tiamat, Loki, the tantric Yoginis, the Lwa, the Spirits of goetia. Regardless o f your tradition or practice, there is much to learn here from the living. As well as di scovering and bringing fo rth Significant new writers, we have also included those who are belter kno wn figures in both witchcraft and magick. This is a groundbreaking collection of writing. Devotion brings tough questions. Having sworn non serviam, can we then meet divinity on our knees? Or do we meet divin-ity hawltishly eye to eye? What does it mean to be pressed back and possessed on the grave dirt? Can we become as gods? It co uld be argued that witchcraft still leads magick in devo-tional practice. Prayer and psalm magic was of course a staple of cunning-craft , the means and methods of the old pagan world surviving through Christianity and folk practices. These are simple and effective methods often overlooked by the typically over -intellectual adherents o f high ceremonial magick. There are workers in witchcraft whose craft is exemplary, who magickians would do well to listen to. There is much to learn on bo th sides of Ule hedge. Witchcraft and magick have been divided despite a common heritage. Let us acknowledge that both magick and wider witchcraft have a common source, which is not Aleiste r Crowley; it springs from experience o f the numinous, from contact with other worlds. Devoted deliberately steps across the divide, the writers within these pages deftly evade classification as the label of magickian or wilch is blurred in actual praxis. To begin shifting the boundades, we are delighted to publish a piece o n Ishtar by the highly respected Levannah Mo rgan, two essays on Hecate by male witches and of course, the bloody truths of Lilith by Charlotte Rodgers. Imroduaion Devotion has often been neglected in the Western magickal tradition. Magick is in recovery from the rational attempts of well-meaning Victo rians. Their Gods were still very much in the O lympian mould and showing prominent casting marks. Are these lurching golems our divinities, moving unsteadily out of' a Chdstian hangover ? Sho uld we be so afraid of o ur spirits that we fo rget how to converse with them other than shouting them d own in poor Hebrew? If you have not considered d evotion, it is worth reme m-bering that this was th e primary rnagickal method of Dr John Dee. Perhaps the prayers offered by Dee, and heard by th e Angels, have been neglected by magickians due to their Christian savo urj but this has not prevented prayer being central to every other spiritual tradition. Devotion and prayer are important keys to unlock both Enochian and the grimoires , mo re so than the much vaunted pentagram ritual. Some still consider the grimoires to be a garbled irrelevant mess, at worst dismissing them in newspeak as • o ld aeon'. The reprints of the grimoires which have gained such po pularity in the last five years will need to be followed by more unlocking of th eir secrets if they are to be more than vanity purchases. A devoti onal practice is o ne such key, ,suffUSing rigorous scholarship with living blood, as Jake Stratton-Kent clearly d emonstrates in an essay born fr om his long serving work with the Grimorium Verum. The grimo ircs are a vital testimony to continuing spirit work in the West. Devoted is a challenging book, especially for those playing at hopscotch fad magick.

You will not read 'stand here, say this, do that', because devotion is not in the wooden repetition of ritual. Playing devil's advocate in his essay to the idea of devotion itself, is George J Sieg, because to truly know ourselves we must challenge even our most deeply held assumptions and examine our beliefs in a critical light. Devotion often brings us not what we thought we sought. Richard Ward exemplifies this in his Grail quest, a pure heart in a world vicious with cynicism. Devoted makes it abundantly clear that we are changed by these experiences of the numinous. Stephen Grasso, from the perspective of New Orleans Voodoo, talks of us becoming 'two-headed doctors'. The devotee comes to exist in both worlds. One reason we chose to bind this book in safTron and black is in memory of the penitents who were stigmatised by being forced to wear saffron crosses stitched to their clothing.

Devotion is such a personal thingj the givi.ng of one's all, freely and unconditionally, is something I find difficult to explore through the written word in readily explainable terms. This in itself leads me to question that devotion, not in respect to its reality or validity. but my abiJjty to convey it, as it is by nature beyond words, or rather, I find words inadequate to express the true essence of it. It is beyond even faith. for despite the two being interlinked, faith is ultimately, unnecessary for devotion. It may start with a single act, but is no solitary act of magickal prowess, no matter how great. It extends far beyond the temple precinct or confines of the sacred space, and is not IimHed by any set of carefully constructed rituals at auspicious times and places. It is not bound to creed, colour, or sex, In fact, it is not limited by anything. It is an all encompassing way of life fashioned from love, a journey of discovery and wonder that never ends, constantly evolving the psyche of the self, and in the present sense, a never ending quest for the perpetuation"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Devoted and manifestation of deity. Therein perhaps, is the answer to my own personal and self-imposed paradox. I have, therefore, elected to attempt sharing some of the flavour of the frag­mentary journey which has lead me to this point, in truth, as She would wish it. For writing about the Red Goddess is a devotional act in itself, a perpetuation of Her glory in the world. I list no pages of carefully crafted magickal actions, for however well intentioned, and successful or otherwise, this is not the place to allow any fit of accidental hubris or overt reflection of the self. It is purely deSigned to reflect Her glory and Her glory alone. To that end, I shall communicate only the begi'Uling of my journey to give a perspective to the judicious reader. The end is, perhaps, to forever remain unwritten, for there is no end to true devotion. SEED As I write my mind drifts, recalls the journey, the time She first called to me-the hesitant genesis in late 200 1. My interest in Babalon at that time was cursory at most, and based purely on Her portrayal as a cog within the thelemic macrune rather than as a deity in Her own right. I was engaged on a psychiC and magickal quest, pertaining to a ritual chalice once owned by Aleister Crowley. Despite the fact that the ultimate goal of the venture was the physical retrieval of the aforementioned cup, after over two years of searching, it was evident that this would not come to pass in the obvious way that myself and my erstwhile colleagues had hoped. FollOWing the complex series of psychic clues coupled with the enactment of related ritual did reveal a number of physical artefacts, but not the grand prize we had all longed for. It did, however. and far more importantly on a personal note, open a channel of communication with Babalan. In hindSight, I kick myself for not realising the true nature of the quest at the time as I was swept along in pursuit of the material rather than the divine. The discovery of strange Seeking the Chalice of Ecstasy landscape geometry based on the seven-pointed star and a physical location to serve as Her Chapel of Abominations were the seed of a grail quest that far transcended the material world. It was one which had given me the merest hint of what might Ue behind the veil and sowed a seed that would take me on a voyage of discovery of what the grail was to Her, and the deep­er understanding of Her mystery. DEVOTION The intense first period of serious devotional ritual to Babalon took shape in early January in 2003. As had become my way of dealing things, any personal need for change could be exacted more easily through an immersion in magick. My life was at a point of nux where that was needed, and my instinct told me that the next step of illumination could only be found through Her. I knew little of Her true nature at that point, all I in­stinctively knew was that Her way was love. I already had the ritual tools which I knew in my heart wouJd serve me well. The satyr candle sticks that only seemed to suit red, the work lamp for Her single flame, the carnelian ring, the scrying ball on its scorpion taiJs; all the items that had made their way into my possession in 2002, and from the moment I first held them, seemed to scream to be consecrated to Her. The time for that had arrived. I created a wand for evocation, and the altar was built. The stage was thus set. In my literary pursuit of Babalon, I had been drawn to the workings of Jack Parsons, and borrowed the basic template of his ritual structure of the Sabalon Working, adding a few twists of my own and adding a reading of rus gorgeously evocative poem Narcissus as an opening gambit. It was the point of no return, when I would take the Fool's leap of faith from the precipice, a would-be twenty first century Parl.ifal. I was ready to begin the journey, and through union with the Red Goddess, attempt to glimpse, through unconditional love and devotion, ,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Devoted the myriad serpentine paths of Her glory. I wasn't even sure what I expected from my endeavours in terms of a tangible result, perhaps nothing, as devotion is surely its own reward. The only thing I knew for certain was that I was devoting myself to Babalon, and just wanted to be embraced in Her love, learn Her ways, to pierce the veil of Her mystery. I longed to taste the true mystery of the grail. I was falling in love with a Goddess, and wanted to manifest her magnificence in the world in whatever small way I could. REFLECTIO AND EXPANSIO The journey has not always been easy, the serpentine paths often leading to the necessary confrontation of doubts and fears, but always She has been with me. Whether in the pre-prepared sacred space or the woodland grove, the littered urban streets or the myriad corridors of dream, I sensed Her, without and within. I have learned from Her through magickal communion, and from Her terrestrial avatars and devotees that have also played their part, often in the most obtuse and at first unfathomable of ways, but always enabling further steps on the eternal road to. be taken. I will always look back with gratitude at the wondrous gifts She has given. The astral communications that caused the quantum leaps in understanding, and the personal transformation in my mindset that has seen me emerge from the cocoon of relative darkness and into the scarlet tinted light of illumination. She turned pen into sword that cut deliciously deep, carefully kindled the once dying embers of the soul into a blaze of new life, forever gladdening the heart. She will always be with me, as not a day goes by without some reflection of the Red Goddess.

My eyes arc more open. I see subtle eman­alions wherever I look, no longer just looking and not seeing, both within the macrocosm and the microcosm. I can only marvel in wonder at it all. Only by inner change had I begun to understand the mysteries without. As Crowley had noted, albeit under the usual misogynistic gloss, She is the mirror in which to deeper understand and interpret the Self. For Her I will forever give blood, sweat, tears as I did those years ago, and whatever else She asks of me, for such is the way it should be. She calls, and Her subjects heed that call. The chariot bearing the true grail blazes through purple skies, triumphant in the new dawn, for Her time is now. FOR HER.

The Ishtar Gate of Babylon is in the Pergamon Museum in the communist East, the other side of the Wall. First there is a journey on the U-Bahn through abandoned ghost stations in the East where guards with machine guns stand on deserted twilight platforms, then the ritual ordeal of the GDR border controls at Friedrichstrasse. They certainly know how to keep you tense and nervous here. It is February. Icy wind and freezing rain and 'Iuiet, relentlessly grey streets. The huge Pergamon Museum is a warm, light oasis in the GDR desert. I don't really know what the Ishtar Gate is; a few clay bricks or an arch, perhaps. From the Ishear Diaries The Ishtar Gate is massive. It is the entire processional way, the gate, and part of the city walls of Babylon, looted by a Kaiser in the late nineteenth century. A party of mainly black American Gis from one of the bases in the West are milling around the processional way. I have never seen a bunch of big men so jumpy, unsure of themselvesj on enemy territory. 'Ma'am, what is Ishtar?' one asks me. 'She was the great Goddess of Babylon, the Queen of Heaven', I reply. 'The devil city in the bible? The Whore of Babylon? Bad stuff.' he says and ushers the others away. I have the place to myself. The Whore of Babylon. Bad stulf. Very good. They will sometimes tell you that the Ishtar Gate is not worth bothering with, too restored and reconstructed. Ignore them. Endless blue tiles the colour of the night sky just after sunset, rows oflions (the Beast ready for his Goddess), dragons and bulls worked into them. Orange, black and white tiles in geometric patterns create entoptic visions on the back of my eyelids. As I walk up the processional way to the gate, I,htar comes through. Hundreds of Her nowe ... , white and gold against the blue, imprint themselves onto my brain again and again. My breathing has become very deep and slow and I am aware that I am walking differently. I have become reverent and somehow more graceful, drawn by a will which is mine and not mine through the gate, into the dty, into Ishtar's temple, like a priestess. As I walk through the blue gate, Ishtar hits me like a wall of force, an immense psycho-sexual charge. Something like music-bass notes so low I can't hear them, only feel their vibrations-is courSing through me. I sit there for a couple of hours, to the consternation of dour museum attendants, feeling as iff am encased in a golden, glowing cocoon. I have been back many times and found this always to be a very effective gateway to Ishtar. All that is necessary is to surrender to it. Since the Wall came down there is no real ordeal any more, just the usual mush of capitalism. Walk up out of the U-Bahn at Friedrichstrasse.

Out of love and the pain of separation we forge an intense psychic link which is instant and total.

They merge into one thing completely then there are a series of elemental visions: flying together on feathered leather wings though a cold, starlit night sky, diving into the depths of the sea, standing in a fire which docs not burn, buried deep in dark, dripping caverns. We each write down our accounts of this and post them to the other. They are identical in a way which shocks both of us. What is going on here, Ishtar? Over several months we visit the temple From the Ishtar Diaries once a week. Each time Ishtar and Tammuz are invoked. Some­times she comes through violently. Always there is the passionate merging of the two. Sometimes this feels physical, erotic; other times it has no physicality but is spirit, force, energy. These psychic invocations, meetings are always exhaust­ing but in the temple there is a calm stillness, and a sense that we have both always been there. To begin with we make our invocations based on the Inanna/Ishtar hymns. As we go deeper they become frecform, rull of personal imagery. He tells me Isht.r is the dark night sun within, that when we invoked for the first time he felt !.ike a burning sun. He sees a crossroads and Ishtar is one of the roads, the road he walks. She is a ploughed field. She is a we.1I or cold water and he is a Hon who drinks from the well. When T ammuz comes into him he becomes the tall cedar tree of the hymns, looking out over the forest canopy. He is a fire which dances. She is honey and she is bitterness, sweetness and the taste of burning. After a long time, we can be together. We can make all the things that until now have been psye.hic \"a' in the physical world.

Peter Redgrove Inanna, Qyeen oj Heaven and Earth: Her stories and hymnsfromSumer Diana Wolkstein and Samuel Noah Kramer GOETIC DEVOTIONS JAKE �TRATTON-KENT My magical work concerns goetic processes, and involves a strong devotional aspect while dealing with spirits of the earth and the underworld. This does not imply that I am a Satanist, but that my approach to the spirits difTers from medieval demonology and the later derivatives. TIle ancient Greek word soeteia is understood in different ways in modern times. Some reflcct its dcvalued status in classical and medieval culture, others the exaggerated importance of the Coctia of Solomon, both creating a stereotyped impression of actual goetia. In essence however, goetia is the archaic root of a great deal of spirit work in Western magic, and a principal and venerable ancestor of modern ritual magic. In classical antiquity the term goetia generally referred to rituals of an earlier phase of culture, or practices renecting them. It dealt particularly with the spirits of the underworld or of the earth, as opposed to 'heavenly' or ouranian deities and entities. These ranged from ghosts and demons to deities such as Demeter, Hades and Persephone. My understanding of such work shares with many African Traditional Religions the idea that God is a remote and unapproachable ngure largely un­concerned with the material universe. To varying degrees much the same applies to other celestial beings. The chthonic spirit's on the other hand are approachable, and practical magical relationships may readily be formed with them. Where these relationships are long term a definite rapport is formed. Maintaining this relationship involves cultie activities on the part of the magician, such as the making of olTerings on a regular basis. Is this worship? To answer this involves a simple exerci!ie in semantics. It is Significant that in Christian marriage vows the phrase 'with my body I thee worship' is used partner to partner."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Devoted If we examine the word we find that worship derives from the same rOOt as worth, worthiness etc. So if we wish to use the word worship it must be understood that it represents the recognition of the spirits' partnership with the magician, and does not diminish the magician in relation to them. In fact in several convergent traditions relevant to this approach the posture of kneeling while communicating with spirits is strictly forbidden. When not standing or moving, a squatting or seated posture is appropriate. IMAGES Trad.itionally, and practically, one of the best ways to com­municate with spirits involves images of them placed in a suitable shrine. A cabinet with cupboard space below and shelves abovc is a very suitable basis for such a shrine. Images typically take two forms, one is a clay head, and the other is a statuette. Preferably these will be hand made and consecrated, although an Ellegua head may be obtained from a Botanica or suitable mail order supplier. Instructions for consecrating clay may be found in the Key cif Solomon. In many cases, whether a statuette or \" head is chosen, the image will contain various items, be they appropriate herbs, seven coins or other things. In some cases the image may be bought or adapted, so long as it is appropriate to the entity concerned. An installation ceremony should also be performed, and the position on the shrine carefully chosen, for example selecting the height of shelf for each image according to the rank of each individual spirit. RITUAL Aside from routine prayers and conjurations, the essential aspect of ritual with a household shrine consists of offerings. These will generally consist of fire and water, as well as food if appropriate. By fire is meant candles and incense, and by water Goeric Devotions fresh water. Some spirits require these daily, others weekly, and this can be ascertained by divination, or performed according to traditional procedure. Candles are generally offered in thanks for a favour, while water and incense are ofTered more regularly to maintain the link and feed the spirits. A good idea when performing such ofTerings to goeti spirits is to consecrate the water and fire in the name of the ruler of the e elements in the hierarchy concerned. Suitable songs or incantations are an appropriate adjunct to all such offerings. Be aware that spirits' likes and dislikes dmerj some for instance do not like water, and others may prefer other drinks. orne may also prefer tobacco to incense. SACRIFI E Beyond some general comments the process of blood sacrifice is outside the remit of this essay. This is for various reasons, not least of all being the controversial nature of such rites in modern Western socicty. This aside, even such traditions rd­evant to the practice or goetia where such rites are accepted, differentiate sacrifice of chickens from four-footed animals, the latter requiring initiation or at the very least expericnce. uch a distinction makes sense, as chickens arc relatively simple and lowly offerings, while goats or other animals require a skilled hand to avoid suffering. Ncvertheless, this rule I>crta.ins mainly to more agrarian societies, and no general rules can be offered herein. Thc reader must make their own informed decisions regarding this aspect of sacrificial ritual. Only generalised statements may be made about offerings of food. Western examples may be found in such works as the Key if Solomon (Book II, eh. XXII of the Mathers edition), or the Picalrix. Food offerings relevant to other traditions, such as Santeria, may be researched in many modem works. Very often particular entities have particu.lar preferences, such as popcorn and seven types of beans for Omolu; othcr food offerings may 17"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Devoted be deduced from systems of corresponCiences, such as hot foods for martial and square saffron cakes for jovial entities. These aspects aside, there are other aspects of sacrifice that can be usefully discussed. Goetic rites in classical Greece drew upon more archaic traditions, and in various ways these are still implicit or explicit in the tradition as it survives today. In the Christian period the term 'goetia' often indicated suspect magical practices connected again to older traditions, those surviving from paganism. Consequently, goetic offerings and rites were-and still are-often deeply conservative in nature. For example, offerings of wine, a comparatively recent innovation in classical times, were not made to older chthonic deities. Barley beer. or some older form, was preferred, the feeling being that the older rites should be retained for certain kinds of entity, many of whom have precise parallels in modern goetic work. Although the specific example given above may not hold true for the entities with whom the modern conjurer works, similar cases and attitudes very well may. As a part of my own work for instance, I make a pOint of buying up old coins to serve as offerings. Although most of these are pre-metric English pennies, I also keep some exotic coins, whether foreign or unusual in some way. These are employed in .various ways: as permanent offerings on a ritual shrine, or as sacrifice fees, paid by burying in the earth when collecting items from outdoors at various appropriate locations. These 'obsolete' sacrifices reflect the fact that some of the spirits are old, whether spirits of the dead from an earLier time, or gods and nature spirits of earlier phases of culture, whether our own or other's. These coins of course involve a sacrifice in several respects: not only has modem money been earned and spent to obtain them, but very often specific journeys have been made, and time and energy expended, in order to exchange modern currency for older coins. On the other hand modern coins, such as two pence coins, may serve perfectly well on occasion. They may be pressed into the earth when a chance find is made, or offered to a more .0 Gaelic Devotions recent ghost. Similarly, they may be offered even to older entities, so long as these recognise coins in general as viable currency. Offerings of coins on a shrine, or on other special occasions to a particular spirit, may well involve larger payments. For example a number associated with the spirit may determine the number of coins. INTERMEDIARY ENTITIES IN GOETIe RITUAL Another consideration of great importance is the presence in many spirit hierarchies of an intermediary spirit who must be dealt with first in order to contact the others. This may well influence the structure of offerings as well as conjuration. Generally the intermed.iary spirit must be worked with first, in order for offerings to reach other spirits on the shrine. In my ritual work I am in COnstant contact with the inter­mediary spirit of the Grimorium Verum, whose name is Scirlin. He is the focus of a good deal of ritual. and the recipient of frequent offerings. In many respects Sci.rlin acts in the same way as the 'Holy Guardian Angel' in other supposedly trans­cendental systems. His role is also very similar to important intermediary spirits in African Traditional Religions, as well as Ganesha in Hinduislll, and so forth. There are several devotional aspects to this frequent contact. Some of these are true of other spirits as well, but are naturally emphasised in this particular relationship. One example is that Sdrlin possesses property, in the form of gifts and offerings of a permanent nature. He also has a special incense offering, which has to be prepared separately and kept 'in stock' in order lor my goetic work as a whole to proceed. lbe position of his image is at the centre of the spirit shrine, and is seated on a large marble pentacle, surrounded by various items belonging to the spirit. Among these are dedicated divination tools, whkh Iq"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Devoted may only be used with this particular spirit, and which are strongly in tune with him. WORK There is a useful expression in Mexican witchcraft or Brujeria that has no direct counterpart in modem 'Western' occultism. The expression is mia labores, which literally means 'my chores', but refers to routine magical work such as cleaning the sanctuary and the performance of routine prayers and spells. There are equivalent duties in goetic practice, and their per­formance has a strongly devotional aspect. Regular cleaning of ritual tools and the workspace or shrine is prominent among them, and the use of a special wash is a feature goctia also shares with New World religions and magical systems such as Brujeria and Hoodoo. In work with the Grimorium Verum the 'Holy Water' is sprinkled .,vith an aspergiJlus made from three herbs, but a large infusion of these same herbs in boiling water forms a useful wash for 'mia labores'. Naturally the items to be cleaned should be dusted or wiped before sprinkling or being doused in this infusion. Similarly, the polishing of ritual metalware should precede re-cpnsecration rituals and so forth. The performance of routine prayers and spells is another aspect of mia lahores. Although rarely mentioned in manuals, it is an important staple of the pursuit of goetia as an everyday vocation. In Verum work (and also in several versions of the Key of Solomon) there is a 'routine' prayer that should be recited in the lead up to any and all magical operations. Assuming the grimoire is the background or inspiration for your magical work as a whole, this prayer will be said every day. In addition, the regular oITerings and conjurations that accompany them are an aspect of mia labores. The same is true of rituals of consecr­ation-which it should be eviclent are not only to be performed when a given ritual item is first made, but repeated on a regular basis. Goetic Devotions Similarly, the holy water sprinkler, which is made of three herbs as said earlier, should be regularly replenished on a Wednesday under a waxing moon. Then the instruments should be gathered on the altar and collectively blessed, sprinkled and perfumed with the appropriate incense. In general all such work can usefully be preceded by a ritual bath, also using procedures from the grimoirc, or appropriate substitutes. Additionally, as goetic work has a vocational aspect, or is an integrated part of a magical lifestyle, routine prayers and spells can include ritual baths on a regular basis. This is but one aspect of making mag­ical ritual a part of daily activities. Other aspects of mia labores and the pursuit of a goetic vocation involve the physical environment. To i1Justrate, when­ever I move home, which in recent years has been fairly fre<Juent, one of my first actions is to explore the area thor­oughly. In particular, I am on the lookout on such excursions for the location of nearby crossroads, as many as possiblej for cemeteriesj particular trees and plants; for watercourses, both streams and rivers. Watercourses are important for provision of differing types of water as defined in ritual, and also potentially for clay, useful in making images and vessels. Crossroads are important for the disposal of ritual ephemera, be they residues of operations, or the spells themselves. When disposing of something at a cross­roads it is important to consider whether you wish the effect of the spell to remain with you, or to be distant from you, as this determines which side of the crossroads it is put. Crossroads are also important locations for various offerings and even some conjurations. Cemeteries are useful for a variety of reasons, and are places I visit fairly fre<Juentiy. Once again, my activities should not be confused with Satanism, particularly the variety that embraces any form of \\'andalism. Cemeteries are the abodes of spirits the magician wishes to be on good terms with, and mislTeating their home is unlikely to have such an effect. On the contrary, I often pay a ritual fee on entering a cemetery, and also pay the spirits if"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Devoted I take anything away with me or if I bring something with me and leave it behind. As mentioned earlier. I keep a good supply of old coins for ritual purposes, and a visit to the cemetery is likely to be preceded by going to the cabinet in which these coins are kept. My access to the place is also accompanied by a little cleaning up, and a good deal of discretion, including both my behaviour and my appearance. You may onc day see someone slowly walk.ing around a cemetery, dressed conventionally and behaving respectfully. Perhaps they are looking keenly at various graves and tTees, even at the ground in front of them. Occasionally they may glance around before picking things up, some but not all of which end up in the bin. The chances are you are looking at a goetic magician. The cycle of rituals and the routine of magical chores is an important aspect of the pursuit of goetia as a vocation. This cycle is the basis of empowerment of the magician, the instru· ments, and particularly, of the spirit agencies that underpin the more spectacular magical work that is more commonly spoken of, but whose reliance on the adoption of a magical life based on devotion and actual work is too often left unsaid.

And contrary to what somc may think, this is for the best. It could have been another-the brides and grooms of god all marry a unique love. But my Beloved came to me in the form of a leopard and a vine, and I am full. Uke the pages of ancient abbey manuscripts, my relationship with myself, with the word, became illuminated, and it was his wet breath and his gold leaf that coated my skin and was burnished with his hands until it shone. And it was under the lip of this shining that poetry came to me again, an old but changed friend, writhing with some new life, insisting that I take dictation from the mourning doves and the long grasses. We who are devoted say unto our Magnillcent Ones: 'I ofTer myself. ' Dionysos took me, at my word. And now my words, which may be the most distilled part of the small 'I' that worships That Which Moves Through All Things, arc lit like votary candles in supplication, desire, service, bliss, and praise of him, that dark-eyed Lusios who comes in the night and liberates the bird in my throat, trapped by fear. It remains a holy and personal revelation; that the poems, the words, all words, are my prayers, and on them I can walk for the rest of my life towards my Beloved. It has given me a choosy tongue, and I am learning again how to speak, and how to dream. Of course, according to the books, Dionysos is not the god of poetry. That particular honor falls in the lap of my Beloved's golden half-brother.

But that is where he lives, there where it is difficult as much as where it is perfect-and I will continue our conversation even if it means staining my fingers with ink until the end of me. So it is that poetry is the language through which I speak with my god. Poetry is, also, the language by which the gods speak to us, in our own voices there is nothing that exists on the human tongue that rivals it, except perhaps when it is set to music. The human mind breaks down in the presence of god. like­wise in the presence of poetry. All nat and salt-less convention is made shell�shocked in the realm of gods and poems-all rules shattered, all expectations void. Play is a constant, lamentation is a must. Patterns form and break away; rhyme schemes reveal something hinted at in tides or in hives of bees. Poetry is the language of god.

It is a terror and a duty, something awful and wonderfu1. A poet can abandon their task and refuse the gift, but their lives will be less sweet for it. The same can be said of the call towards god and the work it implies. The lighting of candles, the giving of gifts, the dancing, it all lives in the meat of the word as much as it lives in the figs and the barley. The poetry i, not the oITering. I am. The poetry is not the god, but he lives there. Poetry is the place where we are met and matched, where I am lost and remade. Like any good method of myst­icism, it is many things at once, and most of them connicted. Poetry is that which houses the Sufi's borzokh, the infinitesimal and most scintillating point of existence, the horizon star. The liminal, the both-and. It is the cause and the cure, the puzzle and its answer, the offering and that which receives. Some may make distinctions--devotional poetry, lyric poetry, form poetry, modem poetry-but it doesn't matter. A poem that works exists for that purpose. To work. If it bestirs, then it has completed its mission. Docs it thrust itself like a hand into your chest? Then it has succeeded.

Where does Aphrodite buy her shoes? This is the level of debate with which many commentators seek to scrutinise the curious activity of speaking to invisible entities. There is a sense that, for deities to exist at all, they must either exist as larger-than-life physical beings who can step in and help you out-a bit like the relationship between Jimmy Olsen and Superman. Or else they must be entirely internal psychological constructs, imaginary fr iends that may give some level of comfort to those who believe in them, but have no objective validity whatsoever outside of a believer's crazed fa ntasy life. Yet this activity of speaking with Gods and Spirits is so ancient and ubiquitous, throughout even the modern world, that an inquiring mind might wonder why? What is the attraction? What is the appeal? Why do we as a species still attempt to communicate with invisible things, when both science and modern society tell us we are merely participating in a self-directed fantasy life. What is the purpose of this activity and what does it provide us with, that we should seemingly nout all common sense and the established wisdom of the day to have these quiet conversations with Gods and Spirits? What's going on with that? Why haven't we left this practice behind as a species? Why do we continue to carry this strange behaviour with us into the twenty-first century? Why does it mean so much to us? We fight bloody wars over it. We kill one another and lay waste to each other's lands. We overcome impossible odds and survive orcleals in its name. Why?

But can the religious impulse of our species really be so conveniently explained away with such a banal bit of pop psychology? Is that all it comes down to? A convoluted and creative way for us to enact the compulsive punishment and reward scenarios that have been imprinted on us from child­hood? Is there nothing else going on beyond small, terrified humanity erecting fa nciful images in front of its eyes to avoid looking at the cold and barren immensity of space? Perhaps we can only speculate about these matters, or at best get into fights and abuse each other over what is objective truth and what is confabulation. Passions can run high on either side of a religious debate, and it is a row that's been going on for thousands of years without a glimmer of resolution or common ground to be had. Efforts to look at the religious impulse within humankind are rarely approached without bias, and all participants tend to either have a personal agenda to support, a vested interest to fu rther or an axe to grind in one direction or another. Hence a phenomena that is so central to the living experience of religious people throughout the world is written ofT as unscientific hokumj and the survival strategies developed by our ancestors for understanding and engaging with the conditions of life on earvl, are either swallowed wholesale as \\.1nexamined dogma or scoffed at as the backwards delusions of primitive and uneducated minds. Yet strategy or delusion, the reljgious beliefs of our ancestors have fund­amentally shaped the very fa bric of the culture and society we find ourselves living within. While the religiOUS lives of those with whom we share the planet, be they world leader or extremist zealot, continue to inspire as much war, bloodshed and bigotry as they inspire love, compassion and hope. This is a phenomena that is not going to go away any time soon. Nobody seems capable of looking this particular beast in the eye to find out what it's made of. The scientist can never convince the priest that God does not exist. The priest can never duplicate the emotional content of a lifelong relationship with the spiritual world in laboratory conditions. It seems that The A-lj'stcries the experience of confrontation with the Divine cannot be easily or readily dissected with the instruments of rational scientific enquiry. It persists beyond all attempts to critique or examine its nature through the lens of agnostic materialism. But the desk bound shipping clerk will never comprehend the ocean like the sailor, and the sailor will never fa thom the majestic waves like the ood fish. For a magician-someone who has made it their business to look into these areas with an objective mind-there is perhaps no greater task on the horizon than to fu rther the collective understanding of the mystical and religious impulse. Perhaps nobody else is better equipped to grapple with the ontolOgical dilemmas of the species than the person who has devoted their life to comprehending things that aren't supposed to be reali and nobody more likely to report back valuable data than the person who has made it their business to extract practical uses out of seemingly preposterous ideas. A magician is a specialist, charged with the role of getting their feet wet and their hands dirty in areas that most sensible people try their best to avoid even thinking about for any length of time. We blunder courageously into the locked rooms of the heart, stroll down haunted internal corridors of bone and mirror, and make ourselves at home in the stark wilderness of ourselves, all in the hope that we might catch a stolen glimpse of cosmic thigh behind the veil of everyday things. Whatever it is that might sit beyond the waking world of chips and beer, nine-to-five jobs and shagging, it's the job of the magician to jump in and try to suss it out. Now it might be the case that all of these things we call Gods and Spirits exist in a way that is entirely concurrent with contemporary scientific fmdings. Perhaps there is an explanation for this experience that does not rely on any supernatural jiggery-pokery. It is possible that all can be explained in terms of archetypal forces moving in the collective unconscious, or perhaps this phenomenon is merely an extern­alisation of our own bodily processes-the mysteries of our"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Devoted body projected outwards and perceived as a dialogue with something separate to us. It's also possible that such explan­ations are just a comforting pseudo-science to make what are essentially bat-shit crazy ideas seem more palatable. Or indeed, it may be the case that Gods and Spirits really do have some form of objective existence, perhaps as emergent forces erupting like an artificial intelligence from the emotional landscape of our Hving experience and assembling the tTappings of personality and self-awareness out of all that we pour towards them. Or some combination of all these ideas, or something completely ditTerent. A magician doesn't necessarily have to have all of the answers to these 'luestions; slhe must simply pose them and be prepared to face the conse'luences of this curiosity. It is enough to observe that there is a phenomena that many people experience in a very real way, but which is not supposed to exist, and to then set about systematically exploring this phenomena on its own terms in order to see what happens. The task of a magician is less about assembling some kind of water­tight unshakeable vision of how the universe fits together and functions, so much as it is to explore these areas and make careful note of anything that occurs as a result, with specific emphasis on how these findings may be useful, transformative or empowering in practical real world terms. I don't know for sure what the answers are to any of the questions that are raised by my practice. I don't really believe that the answers will ever be known in any empirical sense. I refer to matters of God and Spirit as 'The Mysteries' precisely because of this unknowable quality that permeates aU direct dealings in this area. What I can do, however, is attempt to give an account of my own journeys into far ofT places. I can tell you what I have done and where it has taken me, the experiences I have had and what they have meant to me, what I have learned and how I have grown from it, and why I continue to walk with Spirits and get up to strange behaviour with handfuls of dirt, The Mysteries bottles of rum and strange symbols drawn out in cornmeal on the floor. I have c1iscovered that if I perform certain actions I can create an experience in myself that fe els an awful lot like very real direct contact with an invisible entity quite apart from myself. There is a specific series of actions that I can perform to create this experience, that arc derived from the traditional magical formulae of the culture whose deities I am attempting to contact. When I perform these actions I always get com­parable results. I can do this elaborately during eight hour rituals with a high altar and loads of props and sensory stimuli, or I can do it in five minutes by the roadside with a bottle of rum and some smokes. I always access the same emotional space when I do this stuff and have the same overwhelming sense of contact and communion with a specific personality separate from myself. My own reports of interacting with these entities are ex­tremely similar to the reports of other people who have performed the same actions for themselves and yielded more or less identical results. There is a consistency of personality in the contacted deity that holds up not just from session to session of my own practice, but seemingly from the experiences of mHlions of other totally unconnected people all over the world. I have introduced other people to the practice and they have gone off and reported entirely congruous accounts of the personalities in question-in remarkable detail-without any prompting or involvement all. my part beyond giving them the bare bones of the practice and leaving them to it.

The experience of interacting with one deity fT om a pantheon is entirely different from interacting with another. Contact with deities is a very physical sensory experience and the presence of each individual personality has its own unique taste or flavour. It puts me in mind of the phenomenon of synaesthesia, a medical condition where people can hear colours and taste sounds. Deity contact engages all of the senses. It is not something that takes place on a purely intellectual level. The presence of a deity or spirit is something that you can feel quite phYSically and tangibly, and with time you come to immediately recognize the characteristic signature of individual deities when they tum up. The unique complex of emotion and response that being in their presence stirs within you. It feels like being immersed in a field of data, or stepping into a pool of sensory information. It's something that you feel at a non-verbal instinctive level and hence it cannot easily be described or pinned down using language. Yet however difficult it may be to adequately express in words, there is something to this. Whatever its empirical nature, this is a very real phenomena that a person can exper­ience by following certain steps, and it's something that human beings have always done in one form or another, all over the world from the dawn of time to the present moment. Here is something worth observing, modelling and attempting to understand. Something that is worth bearing all of the stigma associated with the practice of magic for, the chance to fa thom something precious and \\'ital to the species that has been overlooked. This is frontier excavation. A mining for something that has always been with us and has always played a role in the The Mysteries development of our consciousness and our civilisation, yet remains hidden and occulted. However, such exploration cannot be performed from the safety of your armchair. You cannot simply dip your toe in these waters and come away with any meaningful understanding of what is taking place. You can't experience anything of the internal process that I am describing-and the impact of haVing this sort of stulT as an active force in your li� from a distance, you have to be fully invested and involved in what is happening. Otherwise your perspective on the ebb and flow of communion with spirits is akin to someone in a lab coat making notes on some fa ntastic sex that other people are having on the opposite side of a two-way mirror. You won't get it. What you will see and feel as a detached, clinical onlooker, and what is happening to the people you are observing in the moment of passion are in no way equivalent. There is no halfway house with this stuff. You have to be right there in the moment, and prepared to appreciate everything that happens on its own terms. Critical distance and healthy scepticism can come later, and are essential if you are to excavate the gold from the various odd encounters and strange happenings that you are inviting. It can be easy for the impressionable, the paranoid and the mentally unstable to go totally ofT the deep end through exposure to the radically altered worldvicw that some of these encounters can leave you with. A strong hold on reality and a down-to-earth approach to everything that happens are often the most important magical weapons you can carry with you into this territory. But when you are standing in the boneyard at midnight pouring drinks for the Dead, you had better be entirely committed to what it is you are doing and be capable of fully accepting the integrity of the particular reality that you have entered into. This ability to walk between worlds, where you learn to move flu.idly between your waking life and its concerns, and the Magician's territory of spirits, signs and portents, is the basic skiJi of the magic that I have learned and which I practice. In"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Devoted New Orleans Voodoo, there is a term for a Magician who operates in this way. They call them 'two-headed doctors' I because they have one head for the day-to-day world and one head for the world of spirit-and are potent and capable in both domains. It's a useful way of looking at it. One of the reasons why the Crossroads and its Spirits are so important and so central to Voodoo is due to the literal transition between worlds and between realities that is required to operate magic at this level. You are either prepared to make the necessary leap into the unknown, or you are not. I'm not trying to sell you anything. However you respond to my account of magic is entirely your affair. What I'm trying to do is explain-in as clear language as possible--why I have dealings with Gods and Spirits, what it fe els like, what it does for me, and how I feel the practice has benefited my understanding of and ability to respond to the challenges of my own existence and the world that I exist within. More than a decade of serious exploration in this area has convinced me that, beyond the tourist bullsmt of new age crystals and the surface conjure of chaos sigils, there is a reality to magic and spirit work that is profoundly valuable and should not be overlooked and ridiculed simply because it is not understood. Chemistry, math­ematics, engineering, cartography, astronomy, biology, physics, and countless other diSciplines were originally aspects of magic before their core principles were understood. and many of the earliest proponents of these disciplines also practiced what we still consign to the inconvenient, pejorative waste bin labelled 'magic' today. I don't think it's too unreasonable a proposition to entertain the notion that there are areas of human experience that have been \\vTitten ofT as 'magic', but which could yet yield valuable fruit. When I speak to deities, it does not feel like a fabricated conversation with a subroutine of my own brain. It does not feel like my internal dialogue wearing a fancy dress costume. Many people subscribe to a psychological model of magic, as it is a great deal more di gestible a paradigm for the modem The Mysteries person than any of the alternatives. I initially approached my work with entities from this perspective myself, but the para­meters of this model and my experiences with traditions such as Voodoo began to diverge so radically that I was forced to abandon the happy comfort zone that it presents. One of the things that characterises Voodoo is that deity communication is a two-way street. When you get it working, it feels as if you are haVing a conversation with something that does not appear to be merely a part of you given a different name. It strongly feels as if you have something ejse on the other side of the psychic telephone Line with its own history, language, temperament, likes, dislikes and personal agenda. Another personality. very different from your own, that you have established a degree of rapport and communion with. In Haiti, the Lwa, the Spirits of Voodoo, are called 'Les lnvisibles', as they are considered living personalities that do not have physical bodies-apart from when they possess their devotees. This is the nature of their existence. You can't point to them in a room, they are intangible and invisible, yet you can get their attention and establish a kind of dialogue. Importantly, they will not necessarily respond to your attempts at communication in the way that you would anticipate. And this, for me, is perhaps the key factor that made me sit up and pay attention to what was emerging out of my practice. You are not in the driving seat 100 percent of the time, faking it until you make it and making it up as you go along. The results you get rarely follow your expectations about what might happen. The unexpected and the unpredictable rules in this domain. You can never prejudge exactly how an encounter with the Gods is going to go. It is never a scripted performance with a predetermined result that you simply enact. It is a participatory process. There may be a fa voured routine that you use to get you into contact with whoever it is you are trying to contact, but once that dialogue is established, the rest of it can go in any direction. There have been many occasions when I've gone out to the crossroads with a clear idea in mind"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Devoted of what I intended to do, and had that totally fall apart in the light of the fe edback I received after contact was established. It's all about the fe edback and the two-way flow of communication between you and something other than you. Voodoo is about bringing yourself before the presence of a certain mystery-be it the crossroads, the boneyard, the forest, the sea, the thunderstorm, the ri ver or whatever it is you are seeking communion with-and then absorbing a response from all of the stimuli around you. Soaking up the roll of the ocean, the taste of the salt air, the anticipation of lightning, the quiet pulse of the nowing river, the messages and signals that come to you when you stand at a roadside, overheard conversation, sudden interruptions, weird messages on the side of buses, odd items left at significant places that seem to carry strange meaning. It's about taking in all of these sensory stimuli and processing them through your nervous system, as a dialogue. Yet even this doesn't quite cover it, when you place yourself before the mysteries in this manner, it is as if you are opening up a dialogue with the roots of your own being-the deep and primal sources of organic life, animal instinct, and human struggle. One perspective on deities and Spirits is that they are our ancestral memories, the ancestral powers of the species if you will, what we are made of as human beings, the deep and primal movers and shakers that dictate our inherited behaviour and direct us to respond to stimuli in one way or another. In Haiti, it is thought that each person inherits their own Lwa From their fa mily line. If your fa ther was strong with Ogun and your mother was mighty with Erzulie Dantor, you may in tum inherit the qualities of these deities yourself as a facet of your genetic heritage. Something that has been handed down from generation to generation. Be it the enduring indefatigable cauldron of iron in your fa ther's belly that gave him the strength to work hard seven days a week in order to put food on his family'S table and keep a roof over their heads. Or the fierce tenacity of the Single mother with a knife between her teeth, The Mysteries doing whatever she has to do to protect and fend for ber children. Or the sharp eyes and hunting instinct of the provider, who knows the forest like the back of his hand and whose arrow always finds its target. Or the dream of beauty that inspires yearning in our heart, the vision of perfection that we strive to make real, and the sense of magic, wonder and enchantment that makes the day-to-day grind of our lives worth living. These are the powers that we have inherited from our ancestors-not laser beams from the eyes or the power to walk through walls-but the fundamental survival skills that our earl­iest forbears developed on the slow evolutionary crawl to their place in the food chain. The strengths, skills and aptitudes that have got us this fa r, and are as relevant and vital to 21 st century living as they were on the day that we stood upright and started walking on two legs. Conditions on planet Earth have not changed so much, and the qualities we rely on for our continued survival are simply modern iterations of the same imprinted ancestral resources that have adapted themselves to the circum­stances of our age. The needs of today are not quite the same as the needs of two thousand, or even one hundred years ago, but we meet those challenges with the same inherited drives, refined or sublimated according to the necessity of the present. When things go awry in our lives and our core needs of food and shelter are threatened, it is our deep rooted animal survival instincts that come to the fore to face the problem. If we find ourselves in physical danger, the fight or night response that kicks in is the same impulse that drove our monkey grandfather to pick up a stone and cave in the head of his monkey aggressor. These primal resources within ourselves are the powers of Voodoo, and the Lwa are the living embodiments of all that we have in our corner as human beings struggling to survive on a piece of rock noating in space. Deity work is a way of explOring, understanding and harnessing these ancestral powers, yet it is also a way of com­prehending the mysteries of nature. It is a way of relating to"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Devoted nature, a lens for interacting with that which is all around us and a medium for attempting to understand our place within the universe. This magical line of enquiry does not need to exist in aggressive dichotomy with our scientific understanding of the universe. The two modes of exploration both yield different forms of data and can be complimentary-just as a scientific understanding of paint and canvas, the motor functions of an artist's hand and the biology of the eye do not entirely describe a Picasso and our response to it. For instance, you can lenow intellectually that the Moon is a barren chunk of rock orbiting our planet. It's up there. You've seen film footage of square-jawed American geezers in space­suits standing on it. You sometimes catch a glimpse of it in the sky as you go about yOUT business, and might even be moved for a moment by its beauty, but within our culture we are not encouraged to really relate to it in any way or consider it as anything other than dead matter without meaning. Our culture's relationship with the Moon is largely akin to the relationship we might have with the luminous advertising hoardings at Piccadilly Circus. We do not pay it much atten­tion, or observe and explore our mental, emotional and physical responses to its changing currents, whatever they may be. It might as well· be a street lamp for all the attention we pay it. Magic is a language and a lens for exploring our relationship and responses to facets of nature such as the Moon. You participate in a very real and very specific stratum of human experience when you go out as a witch beneath the full Moon and feel the lunar glow against the back of your head, somehow infiltrating strange channels of your brain. Unlocking forgotten places within, waking up hidden animistic currents of being. You can feel it in your body, a visceral response to ·the night, all of your senses alert and your instinct sharp. There's a tangible electricity in the air, an excitement that you're sharing in that moment with wild foxes and feral animals all responding to the Moon in the same way. The bark and howl of domestic dogs suddenly recalling the buried animal within, never far from the The Mysteries surface, and giving their own bestiaJ tribute to the radiant orb that owns the night. In that moment there is nothing more magical than simple animal awareness, feeling the Earth beneath your feet, the luminous Moon above, and an immediate kinship with all things that come out at night. Abandoning the artificiaJ restraints of personality and social role, and feeling kinship with spiders and toads, moths and bats, and all things of nature. It feels like coming home-this animistic way of being-and its effects are instantly replenishing. Gradually, you begin to adjust to the lunar cycle and feel its waxing and waning currents as a phYSical and emotional tide to which all things are subject whether they realize it or not. Like adjusting the dial on a radio, or bringing a picture into clear focus, your inner life slowly becomes attuned to these subtle oscillations between the pregnant fu llness of the Moon, and the cruel and barren period when it is dark. Magic deals in this area between nature and consciousness. These deep and resonant experiences of nature are ours to have, by day and by night. The tum of the seasons, the course of the Sun, the phases of the Moon, the wind that blows through the trees, the majestic green that gives and gives, the plants we eat and which provide our medicine, the iron we take from the earth to make our tools and create our civilization out of dust, the life giving river that soothes and nourishes, the vast expanse of the sea out of which all life once crawled, the tempestuous storm that cracks open the sky with a clap of thunder and a bolt of lightning, the freshness of our experience and perception of beauty, the beating heart inside every one of us, our love and oneness, and the sword of division that keeps us apart and at odds with one another, our ancestors and the chain of being that stretches through time like a branching tree, and the one pulse of life that belies all things.

Magic looks from a theoretical vantage point outside of time, and perceives all of human life as a vast and sprawling fleshy tree, with its roots in the primordial soup of existence and the tips of its branches manifesting in the consciousness of the living. We branch like a tree, a river or a bloodstream. It is perhaps only our limited perception that creates the illusion that human life is not a Single branching organism, living and breathing with the pulse of life, and that itself a part of everything else in nature. One great process of growth through time from the mjcrobial to the immense. We treat the nature that surrounds us as a commodity to be exploited, something to be pillaged for our purposes, a dwincl· ling resource to be fought over or an inanimate whore that will keep her mouth shut and take it. We hardly even notice nature most of the time, or pay attention to its unfolding. Such is our disinterest that the churning and teeming mysteries of lif e that constantly enfold us, even in the most barren urban environ­ment, are blocked out and reduced to a cardboard cut·out. A placeholder in our imagination that's never given our full attention. There's never a moment when the numinous visionary mag­ic of the world is ever more than a hair's breadth away, but we habitually turn from it. It's hard fo r us to keep it in mind, too big and weird a proposition, so we only take in a fraction. Enough to navigate by and accomplish our survival. We behave as if nature is a lifeless film set. Dead scenery for us to move about in, inert and of no consc<Juence to us. It is a fallacy that's sharp corrected whcn the winds howl through our cities and reduce them to rubble, when the great waters rear up and consume everything in their path; <JuickJy and suddenly in a flash flood, tidal wave or broken levy. or slowly and surely as the waters rise and gradually take back our coastlines. Magic encourages an understanding of our place in nature, as an integral and important part of nature, no difTerent from a The M)'rrer;es tree or an ant, a rabbit or a magpie. Its practice reveals the intimate relationship between the landscape of nature in all its infinite variety, and our own living human nature and all that it can encompass. With this vision we see the river that courses through our cities-bringing beauty, sanitation and refresh· ment-as a Goddess. We recognize her winding tributaries and turbulent currents in our own nature, reflected in our changeable emotions, the free flowing currents of our heart, the coursing path of our desires. The dams and blockages that interrupt its healthy flow are made all too clear, but we're heartened that the river is unstoppable and in time aJl these hindrances will be washed away. MagiC inhabits the stann. It doesn't participate in the British preoccupation for bitching about the rain. It lives in the thunder and fire that tears through the sky. This is our passion, our own thunder and fire, and its sudden flash lights up the night sky in our moments of raging abandon. We inhabit this mystery every time we're consumed by fire ourselves, a passionate act, an unstoppable impulse, a sudden eruption of sound and fury. The vision or magic respects this force of nature that battles through the sky, striking the Earth where it will. It seeks to grasp this double·headed axe that cuts both ways, capable or terrible destruction but the very motivating force of our lives, the fire in our belly and the heat of our passion. Magic stops to smell the roses and is witness to a world of beauty in the blossoming of every flower. Bright coloured petals unfold in slow motion to announce the naked joy of being alive in the world, like unwrapping a present on Christmas morning, nature does its striptease.

In the radiance of every flower, blessed by rain, nourished by light, the morning dew a mirror for its vanity, we see a reflection of our own being. The joy of our hearts, our love and happiness and the delight of our senses, each blossom a living talisman of the freshness of our perception. In a burst of colour and scent we're gi ven a vision of the absolute and hear a siren song to embrace the wonder of being alive with all five senses--cosmic organs through which we may drink from the infinite majesty of the garden. The knife that cuts is no less a holy mystery. Our ancestor was the first monkey that picked up a bone and smashed in the skull of .nother rough ape; from there we fo llow Kubrick and fast fo rward to a spacecraft exploring the stellar reaches of the wliverse. We dig iron out of the ground, and with our ingenuity fashion it into tools and give shape to our wildest im agination. All OUT technologies, however sophisticated, from blunt hammer to quantum computer, are the children of that first bone implement. Our heritage is a bloody one. There is iron in our blood. Without thi s power of iron our chances of survival would be as tenuous as any other feral creature strug­gling to get some meat between its teeth where it can. Our civilizations are built on bones, toil and labour. The vision of magic doesn't shirk from this uncomfortable truth but beholds the hand that carries the knife. The same steel in a murderer's hand that slides in through the ribs and slices away life, is the life giving scalpel in the hand of a surgeon that cuts away disease and heals the sick. The sword of division creates differences between us, but it's this principle of discernment to separate one thing from another that permits us to build and create our manufactured world and aU its marvels and terrors. It is the wisdom of the knife that keeps us fTom cutting our fingers. When you take up a tool without awareness, you invite The MJ sleries disaster. If you lose sight of what you are dOing, loosen your grip on the handle, or make a slip in the wrong direction, you risk the destruction of all that you've laboured fo r. Your tools are suddenly no longer being used to shape a better future, and you may find yourself the hand that skewers babies for democracy or the architect of a factory for murder. There is no room for error with the mysteries of iron. It's not a time to fa ll asleep or defer responsibility, when you have the sword in your hand and have been hacking and slashing for generations. Obliterating bowltiful forests that are essential for our survival, razing to the ground natural medicine cabinets that could still yield undiscovered cures for every ill, dumping poison and filth in the water supply, caging and torturing animals with mechanized proficiency, brutalizing the landscape with concrete abominations belching horror and sickness into heaven. Our civilization is in the driving seat of a metal vehicle hurtling at 200 miles per hour (lawn the motorway, and we're busy talking on the phone and touching up our make-up in the rear vicw mirror.

I have always found that the syn­chronicity of the universe can keep even something so blatant hidden in plain view from the magician until the last necessary second, or when the timing is absolutely correct. Certain stretches of the beaches of southern Spain have a surpriSingly desolate beauty about them in wintertime and being only a short walk from my home they are an appealing location for my nocturnal workings. Having prepared myself for the rite I made my way to the beach. As I approached the gate that lead Love in the Darkness directly onto the empty sands my mind focussed on the task at hand, the invocation of Hecate to God-form assumption. I glanced down and there sat at the exit gate like some custodian of the doonvay to another realm was the largest toad 1 have ever seen. Conversation was kept to a brief 'hello' as I passed through the gate making my way to the chosen ritual place, clearing a space and casting my circle as is custom of the Arte. This is where everything changed. The years of yearning, the solitary practice and the childhood witchcraft-all fe ll into place. The Goddess took form, over and within me. My rite was not conducted as I had initially envisaged it happening. Hecate had her own more important agenda. She decided my rite could wait, as the teachings She had for me advanced far past my own plan for the evening. The Goddess took over the rite altering the direction of the ritual and learning. directing my own act­ions in the process. Even though I wore her like skin and her energies nowed through and around both my physical and subtle bodies, I could still see Hecate, Her blazing green eyes, jet black hair and high set cheekbones. This was not the crone of Christian demonisation; this was a mature woman of immense beauty. Her age was almost impossible to tell-thirty-fivc, forty-five, fifty? I did not get too much time to muse this over, my thoughts interrupted as Hecate spoke. The words came fTom my mouth produced by my vocal cords but it was not my voice, Close your eyts, child. Her voice came out of my mouth but also resonated through my mind. Following her instruction, I dosed my eyes, I felt her arms wrap around me and I was gone, skywards, like a missile. This was like no astral projection I had ever experienced and was just a taste of what was to come. Hecate showed me a realm of possibilities, and spanning fTom them other possibilities. This first journey with Hecate lasted pOSSibly fo rty minutes-the return to my body, a parting courtesy and the dissipation of the Goddess' energy signified the end of the rite. I was left in no doubt as to the conclusion of the evening's events; the doorway"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Devoted onto the path of ascent not only beckoned, it was well and truly open. Less than a week from the night of this working I began to receive 'visits' from Hecate. The surprising thing was that a great many were in the afternoon. I would know when she was coming, as the vibration of the whole room would shift up very powerfully. Hecate made the eastern waH of my sitting room a fo cal point for her afternoon visits which at times were bord­ering on fu ll manifestation. The whole wall would blur with energy and become almost malleable as she approached. Hecate's transmissions would fo llow the arrival of the Goddess Herself: powerful downloads, a series of rites, workings and the methods to use. This was our daytime work and I never knew when she would come. That is the thing about opened door­ways-they swing both ways. At night, I would make my way to the beach for a more traditional fo rm of meeting. I would honour Hecate with the love and respect that a Goddess deserves, conducting rites, workings and true Witchcraft; but sometimes the simplicity of a small prayer, an offering and a listening meditation would be our routine. During these listening meditations I realised the identity of the powerful. lady from the spirit realms who I had been told about. I saw, fe lt and knew in my very be.ing that She had been there my whole life. The Lady of night and the woodlands who I spoke to as a child, though I did not know Her true name, was no longer held in the 'imaginary friend' file undcr which my adult psychology had placed her in later years. She was very real and always had been. When I looked back, I saw Hecate in my life at many important crossroads. She had been there through­out, guiding, persuading. and aiding. How could I not have seen it before? It seemed so blatant, but then perhaps I was not meant to work it all out. Until now. There is an old saying: When the student is ready, the teacher will appear. I knew from our communications and fe lt within my heart that Hecate wanted me to dedicate myself to Love in [he Darkness Her. In case I hadn't quite got the message and fo r reasons known only to Herself, the Goddess chose a very good fr iend of mine-an incredibly psychiC woman that I had known for several year and bombarded her with messages until the lady fe lt compelled to kindly but firmly inform me of this via a telephone conversation, and could I please 'get on with it' so she could have some peace. My dedication was simple and, like my entire practice, solitary. The surprising thing was the results I felt in reciprocation. My witch power, my intuition and my energi es all increased conSiderably within a matter of days. I was rapidly learning and, as those others who are devoted to Hecate will attest, this Goddess is not a subtle Lady given to half measures. She leaves naught to ambiguity or doubt. Several days onward from my dedication, the intensity and speed with which Hecate gave Her teachings began to go right through the gears. It seemed the Goddess knew both exactly which teachings She wanted to give me and those which I wished to learn. These were given in the form of what I can only describe as high speed downloads or transmissions. As the afternoon visits and teachings continued I learned more. During these meetings I was never quite sure which plane of existence we worked on I such was the power and energy being transmitted during these daylight sessions that boundaries seemed to blur-which plane were we on? Was I on Hers, or was She on mine? During one such meeting. Hecate stood in etheric manifestation, Her green eyes vibrating energy; I do not know what came over me but I reached out, a relatively inexperienced young human being trying to make physical contact with a Goddess; desperately trying to calm and control my mind from blowing it. Is She here? Or is this the point of two planes merging. if only briefly? Hecate watched with a silent, knowing smile as I extended my right hand toward Her, my index finger reaching out to­ward Her hand, and I touched the tip of Her etheric index finger. A wave of energy shot through my body like an ecstasy wreathed ten times over in radiant gold. I was almost over-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Devoted whelmed as the energy ran through me. A smile and a few kind parting words later and the meeting was over, leaving me to contemplate the surreal after-efTect of such contact. To keep silent is a good law, but flexibility in the search of occult knowledge is a necessary one. I had to share this with someone lest I burst or go mad. 1 confided in the psychic fr iend who had previously relayed confirmation of one of Hecate's messages. After listening in amazed silence, she had but a few words of advice, 'Be careful Mark, that is only the tip of her finger!' I denied not knowing what she was implying and received only 'Hmmm' in response. I had to know more. This was the occult, the search for hidden knowledge. I classed myself as a dedicated student of Hecate but I was also enthralled and fascinated. It seemed a big step--initiating intimate contact with the Goddess-but the funny thing was 1 knew exactly how to go about it. Where did I know this fr om? Who put that idea in my head? Who gave me the gnosis of sexual magick connection to other beings? I did not have to wait long to find out. And the details of the requisite rites, applications and results of this practice? Far more than a fingertip. This new intimacy was not without practical application, as I was to find out. Hecate could now change me. With each per­sonal meeting She ran powerful energy through me, charging me with its power, making adjustments to its flow through my chakras, piercing and opening the chalcras themselves and having a crystalline effect upon my subtle bodies. Gateways to other dimensions opened as Hecate ran Her power through me, the current bringing with it the gnosis of Her teachings and works. Huge spheres of knowledge-containing energy surged through and into the very energy points that joined my many selves, lifting my awareness as they flowed. Once the initial adjustments had been made, I knew I could begin to find some of the answers to the many questions that had arisen fr om the previous experiences. Together we have unlocked some of the cellular memories of my former selves. Love in the Darkness Knowledge, memories and rites from past lives, as well as the overview of these lives and the occult practices that went through them, began to surface. Hecate, knowing all this information, had wanted me to remember it, to release it, to re-member and, in some cases, re-use it. I cannot claim to be a hereditary witch but J have released what could be called in­herited knowledge that has been stored in both cellular memory hanks and spiritual archives. This ancient knowledge is to be brought now to the twenty-first century, alongside the other teachings and rites that have been given to me by the Goddess, and applied. Hecate taught me the art of shape-shifting, but not in a con­ventional way. She introduced me to a rite, actually more of a summoning, in which I can call one of the Goddess' wolf spirits. I prepare myself as for any rite, connect to Hecate and initiate the call through Her to the powerful wolf spirit I wish to work with. Once called, the wolf spirit would arrive in very short ti me, rarely needing more than three calls. The spirit would enter me, much as the Goddess would, but with a vastly diff­erent effect. An awakening of atavistic power would ensue, building to what can only be described as a hulk-like crescendo. This tornado of feral rage and power had to be harnessed, which was an immense exercise in control. Once under my control, the atavistic power and the wolf spirit within me yielded some very pleasing results. As well as having my senses elevated to those of a wolf, I was able to direct this energy at will out­wardly toward my aura creating an immediate and potent shape-shift. The ability to create a body shifted to that of a wolf revealed a very effective method of astral travel. I later learned Hecate's reasoning behind the teaching when I began, upon Her sug­gestion, to explore the nightside of the Tree of Life-traversing in shifted form was easier than my normal mode of astral travel. I have learned that my Dark Goddess has great power over many such animal and elemental spirits."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Devoted While both our afternoon and nocturnal meetings continued, Hecate diversilled my schooling by opening gateways both in me and the universe itself. The energy channelled through my subtle bodies and very being by the Goddess was initiatory, lifting my consciousness and allowing access to places that I hitherto did not know existed. Along the way the Dark Lady would bestow upon me gifts-some were spiritual objects that held great significance, while others were symbols and glyphs like 'The Universal Gateway'. Great importance was placed by the Goddess on this. When She first introduced me to this gateway I did not fully understand or appreciate its significance until I became lost and disorientated on one inter-dimensional journey and Her words regarding this particular gateway echoed in my mind. Realising its relevance, I used it to return to my normal state of being. These gateways to other realms, the glyphs that illustrate their significance and the many pathways upon which they all become relevant are such jewels of knowledge. Hecate taught me things I would never have thought possible had I not experienced them myself, but then She is the keeper of the keys to the Universe and a powerful initiator upon the path of spiritual ascent. During my tours of the Universe I never lost my passion fo r the traditional ways of the Craft. I fe lt such love both towards and reciprocated from the Goddess, and so happy was my path in this life that I decided to fu lly initiate myself to Hecate for all time. You could say it was a joint decision, but it was an action whose outcome would reaffirm in many ways my view that Hecate, although a Goddess that loves and lIercely protects Her children, is the powerful Queen of Hell, Heaven and Earth that she is renowned to be and is far from a molly-coddler. As mentioned earlier, the open door swings both �\\'ays and the Dark Goddess will not always knock first when She is coming through. A suitable evening for initiation was planned, the necessary provisions made, and yet another adventure on the beach at midnight undertaken. Never before have I ever seen a bat on Love in the Darkness this stretch of beach, let alone have one fly at head height re­peatedly through and around my cast circle as I put forward my petition for full initiation to Hecate for all time. As with all my rites, the initiation was direct yet fi lled with spiritual passion and heartfelt intent. I thought that it went well, and figured I would receive some confirmation within a short time. I was not wrong. In my many workings I had become accustomed to channelling Hecate directly; the ability to channel Her mes­sages was apparent quite early in my progress and became a focal point of my working. I was now well acquainted with the methods of possession trance or trance mediumship as anyone terrified of the 'p' word would prefer to call it. It had only been a matter of days since my initiation to Hecate. I was sitting on the terrace enjoying the latter part of the day with my family who were visiting when I felt the vibration through and around my very being ,hift up dram­atically. She was coming, internally and very qUick.ly. Oh no, not in front of my mother. The Sight of me channelling The Queen of Hell through my body, along with my voice and face changing, may have spooked even my understanding family. Hecate had not come through unannounced so powerfully before, so I did what anyone else would do under the circumstances-unable to make it to a desolate location to commune with the Goddess of Witchcraft, and with family around. I locked myself in a darkened room. Once inside, I relaxed and let go of myself knowing that Hecate was on the threshold, waiting, and this was probably the result she wanted anyway. I cannot recall experiencing, on any occasion ever, a vibration this immense and powerful, nor can I recall before or since ever seeing an entire room morph into what can only be described as a Qliphotic realm. This happened in seconds and had I not been prepared by many other powerful workings with my Dark Goddess then it may have tipped me mentally over the edge. However. had I not been ready then perhaps it would not have happened. The Qlipha was soon revealed; and the process from there?"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Devoted That is between Hecate and I. Suffice to say that the Goddess gave me Her own powerful version of a very traditional initiation. It is worth noting here that every single person will have a different experience for their own initiation. For instance, if you have never before seen or experienced a Qlipha it is highly unlikely that you will be exposed to one in such a way. The Goddess needs many different types of people for many different tasksj hence all their experiences will be different. Once I returned from Hecate's initiation, I again exper­ienced dramatic changes in my energies, rites and workings-in short my witch power shot up. I now knew beyond any doubt that my petition was well and truly accepted. This was however, only the beginning, what you may call 'laying the foundations' in preparation for the Great Work. Now that Hecate had Her student prepared She introduced me to more in-depth teaching. Alongside my now very regular witchcraft practices and nocturnal workings I was encouraged and enthused to learn, and follow through to practice, the evocation of other entities. Our system of evocation was really nothing more than a standard goetic practice, infused with Hecate's energy and a couple of safety techniques brought forth by the Godd�ss Herself. Several well-known entities became strong working companions, some only in the realms of evocation whilst others were both evoked and, at a later date, channelled. The mere presence of the Dark Goddess, Her en­ergy flowing through me was undoubtedly the greatest safety measure that I could have in this work. Before many evocations I could feel and sometimes see Hecate, Her presence generating great energy in the area, to serve both as protection and to assist in the evocation itself. Not all the entities I have worked with have been met through actual evocationj some have been en­countered because Hecate quite obViously brought them to other workings, and both myself and the Dark Goddess learned early on that if She was going to introduce another entity to the working then announcing it beforehand is probably a good Love in the Darkness idea. We came to this conclusion after an early, slightly start­ling experience (for me, that is) with a demOnic-looking entity, albeit of a benign nature and sent for my protection, arriving uncalled to full physical manifestation at the beach. The teachings, learning and beautiful communion between us continued and eventually Hecate made it plain to me what she wanted in return for her patience as teacher, friend, mentor and lover-another voice in the world, another counterweight in the balancing and now of the magickal revival, a revival that is, after all, to aid the return of the knowledge to the people. Each time I have channelled Hecate's messages, each time I have carried out Her work, communed with Her or felt the current of Her Goddess energy flow through me, I am left in the absol­ute knowledge that Queen of Hell, Heaven and Earth She may be, dark Goddess She may also be, but beneficiary to those who choose to walk Her path, those with the courage to face the dark, She most definitely is. Throughout our journey Hecate has guided me through the darkness, both in other realms and in myself, imparting along the way the knowledge of magick, rite and ritual and the tools of self discovery. I feel honoured to be Her student, this is a labour of Love; the Great Goddess tells me we have decades of work together, so I feel my future is one of happiness. More recently as She stood before me in Her etheric beauty on the beach after midnight, Hecate presented me with the latest and most Significant of gifts and instructions on how to use them: TakeJrom me the torch J carry in each hand Child, these two are Jo r you.

However, dust now settles in these places, and I have felt alone and lost although I know slhe is with me, part of me, bound tied and stained and sated in a bundle of potentialities. I started my investigations into this particular godless form (the outer format may be gendered according to individual experience and perceptions but proverbial knowledge, com­munion and communication leads beyond such limitation-for myself and my love anyway) when I was asked to join a group which had a reactive ritual of initiation. This ritual went through the proverbial denials and defilements of that which is conventional, and required me to pact myself to that which is outside mainstream perceptions of what is right, true and correct. BE GOOD. BE VIGILANT. BEHAVE! Prior to this I had spent several years working on dccon· ditioning myself from intellectual, religious and emotional indoctrination through ritualised creative acts in a very systematic manner, so I was surprised when I reacted so strongly-I threw up--to the idea of affiliating with an angel demonised by the mainstream Church. Something so obvious, so unsubtle that could chum my guts and whisper long forgotten fears of judgements and damnations. The need to push, probe and pursue further the cause of such a reaction was obviously necessary. So I did push, probe and pursue, and thus I met Lilith. Initially it was an intellectual and exploratory perusal, looking at she who had become a fe minist banner bearer, Goth pin-up girl and alternative Madonna. Blood Pact I used trance, mirrors, blood pacts, research, channelling into clay, servitors, dream work and sex work; and as I did I peeled ofT the layers fr om both of us. The crunch came when I was asked to help a woman whose child had been repeatedly raped by her partner over the years, and who believed this now ex-partner was still magickally attacki ng them both. I rarely do occuJt orientated work for people and am very wary arowld those that consider themselves to be under magickal attack so I explored both her and my own motives and aims thoroughly before I agreed to help. I also talked to Lilith in depth. I did the basic work myself then I handed the case over to my dark lover, she of the lost children. I judged not, she did and she destroyed the destroyer. During the most intense part of my two years working directly with her I had flood after flood afler flood, outpourings of water fTom both inside and outside my house. Three washing machines broke down dramatically, pipes outside my house burst; the upstairs flat had a deluge that poured through my ceiling. My bath, and toilet and sink all burst pipes at various times. I destroyed my channelled images and effigies, the images of Lilithj I locked one in a box with a mirrored inside and burned, buried and drowned others. I tried repeatedly to banish her before I realised we were inseparably joined. Love razes and illuminates; devotion to love means stripping away aspects of self that are conditioned to perceive in a certain way. This is no gentle and easy thing. The troubadours dedkated themselves to concepts of a divine love but love is not about highlighting the clean, tidy and beautifully lit. Love is about everything.

I have, from the first, fe lt a need to channel results from my magickal work into creating an art form.

Israel Regardie said that anyone who is serious about magickal practise should undertake some form of psychotherapy as well. To some extent, practical magickal work does result in a stripping away of selves and behaviours, and part of this stripping away is a constant revision of boundaries­leading us to consider what is taboo, and thus, what needs to be challenged.

This explor­ation has encompassed, among other lhings, utilising ritualised sigilisation through tattoo, piercings and scari.flcation, and in depth exploration of the use of body fluids in ritual. Being a long term adherent of the hermetic doctrine 'as above so below', as well as being a palmist-the lines on the hands dictate the persona, and the persona in tum dictates the shape, structure and lines of the hands-it seemed natural for me to look at deliberately imprinting scars and patterns upon my own body in keeping with changes that I desired to occur. As a follow on from this I decided to do more in·depth research into menstruation, and various parts of the woman's cycle and its possible spiritual and magickal app�ication. This study was initially spurred on due to my dissatisfaction with the other, often male, viewpoints which J had encountered. I charted my own cycJe and then I drew up questionnaires which were completed by a variety of women from different practises and geographical areas. Later, out of curiosity, I did some research into men's cycles and brieny touched on those of Taboo and Blood Rites a person who had gone through gender reaSSignment-but that is another story. The results of these explorations I summarised in terms of a woman being a battery, the energy of which could be used in various ways at different times of the month. J noticed that some women I interviewed spoke of starting to menstruate, out of their nonnal cycle, at the commencement of rituals. I thought it seemed that as a woman's magickal experience increases so does the awareness of her body and its potentiality, whether this is registered conSciously or not. The first three days of menstruation is the time when she gives out the greatest amount of energy, but is, paradoxicaJly, at her most vulnerable. The kick-starting of her menses for a specific mag­ickal purpose may be seen as making of herself the ultimate sacrifice-herself in entirety. From this I moved on to experiment with using different types of blood in magickal practise. I alternated feeding servo itors and god-forms with both menstrual and venous blood, and found that venous blood proved more than a little problematic and created a helluva lot of trouble that took a long time for me to sort out. Most so called primitive cultures view venous blood as holding the life-force and lineage, but not menstrual blood, though the menstruating woman herself can be seen to contain great power. Intellectually, I could argue with these perspect­ives but my own experiences would tend to agree with them. I acknowledge there are sexual and spiritual transform­ational practices that effectively use menstrual blood and the power believed to lie therein. ('ve debated with a fe w people over the differences between these substances and whilst I can agree with those who have pointed out, regarding the nature of sacrifice. that the import of the sacrifice ties oft in the perspective of the giver, it must, however, be borne in mind that those that live in other realms desire life above all, and venous blood is a life-force that once given can prOVide a link between the worlds. And a bloody hard link it is to sever too­no pun intended."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Devoced Blood deities are djfficult to deal with, whatever the source of blood-and the emotional attachment connected with the blood in question always needs to be borne in mind. As a woman gets older, for instance, her menstruation may hold with it associations with the ageing process, perhaps failed attempts at pregnancy, which would be detrimental if not acknowledged and dealt with before any ritual commences. If there is no awareness of these emotional attachments, the blood can act as a magnet to related 'negative' entities. The occasional treat of venous blood, if alternated with other offerings, is manageable, dependant upon the circum· stances, although in some situations I found I was compelled to bleed myself more and more often; analysis and self awareness showed me that I was not becoming an inveterate self harmer. but that whkh I was feeding was becoming increasingly vorac· ious and as it gained power. One series of ritualised creative works I did was oriented around flOWing residual, religious indoctrination that I had been subjected to as a child into a series of clay dolls; baptising the dolls in various ways, including with blood, so I could reshape the conditioning into something more progressive and less restrictive. On one level these workings were incredibly effect· ive, on anoth'er they were dangerous, very problematic in the long term, and years on are still creating problems. However, I do not regret this huge learning curve, and what was one of the most exhilarating creative and magickal times of my life. Working with blood has led me to have many animated discussions, as well as some very heated arguments, over differ­ences between the use of venous blood and menstrual blood in sacrifice. I have perfected recipes for cakes of Iigh.t, built gate­ways between the worlds that were best left closed, and created magickal children that become teenage magickal monsters. Ironically, my own menstrual cycle went haywire when I was working with menstrual blood, and later, my own blood was contaminated with an illness, that in modern societal tenns, has made me unclean and taboo. Taboo and Blood Rices I could explain this away as coincidence, or as punishment for not following the rules, for being careless or disrespectful, and I can view it as my subconscious realiSing what was about to happen to me physically and so dictating the direction my magickal practice should follow.

Before the Indo-European migrations south from their lost homeland, their primal sages were said to have heard primordial sounds that .echoed the cosmic laws springing from absolute consciousness itself. This wisdom, enshrined as the Vedos, knew no disparity between the personal will and the divine objective except as a matter of deficiency and degree. The cosmic forces whose numinous power emanated duty (dharma) into the consciousness of the Indo-Europeans in accordance with rla, the 'right' order of cosmic law, were no more distinct from these sages themselves than the beating of the heart and the breathing of the lungs are separate from the organism's whole will to live. Their absence, anrta, was no more a positive force of wrong than sleep is a violent intrusion of a 'force of uncon· sciousness' into the waking mind. Rather, the forces of rLa themselves prOVided the substance and subsistence of the manifest matrix of consciousness, itself originally unmanifest, Ethical Devolion uncreated, ungenerated by anything save its own absolute reality. The ultimate polarity of this archaic tradition, between the two poles of the existent and the non-existent, was not dualism but rather binary opposition, more akin to the two phases of dao than to the 'light' and the 'darkness' of the Iranian tradition. Thus, it would still be dualistic to say that the dharma or the original Indo-Europeans as received and transmitted by the primordial sages comprised their duty to 'themselves', for unlike in later times, there was no disparity in the primal age between numinous consciousness and the 'self'. Rather there were only the people, their ancestral divinities, and the sovereign deities who reigned over all through and by means of their magical power. These sovereign spirits' immortal person­alities preSided over the rta and were honoured as the divine progenitors of a people who knew themselves to be divine. Just as the rites had to be rightly perrormed in order to uphold and maintain rta, so adherence to dharma supported the social order itself as a harmonious manifestation of the cosmic one. Between 'natural' and 'social' law was distinction but not disparity, as dharma sprang from rta and rta defined and limited dharma. Thus the devotion ascribed to the holiest priests, the most heroic warriors, the most dedicated craftsmen, and the most loyal servants, was simultaneously impersonal, in being directed toward the .principles characterizing the entire social order, and self-interested, in being inseparable from the sustenance and advancement of the individual himself. This 'individual' was both a particular entity and a particular instance of a universal prinCiple. manifest through its particular category: As a member of a particular class or 'caste', the individual manifested cosmic law within the social order in the fulfilment of the specific duties of his or her role. The same ethos was remanifest ages later in the Roman concept of pietas, which perfectly expressed the combination of 'devotional' duty to ancestral tradition, with a pious reverence for the social order it establishes and supports. Two poles thus supported, Q,"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Devoted and in tum were supported by, the noble devotion charact· erising the archaic Indo· European society. These two poles were the absolute supremacy of the cosmic order personified in the supreme spiritual sovereign who embodied the social law, and the individual right and power embodied in the autonomous and immortal rishi, the sage whose omniscient understanding of rta and dhanna freed him from all but self.imposed constraint and let his consciousness engage in action without bondage to cause and effect. Simultaneously, the consciousness which had overcome its own limitations partook of the general and the particular, not without strife, but rather fuelled by strife and nourished by it. In this way, the warlike and fractious Indo· European culture Simultaneously preserved its own identity, and the integrity of its membership. even when later confronted with radical changes in its location and environment. Yet this use of polarity and binary opposition also contained the potentiality for its own rupture into dualism. The Iranians, unique amongst the Indo.Europeans, proceeded from trying to maintain rta to upholding asha, from 'right' order to 'reality' itself. Anrta became instead DrUB, a terrifying, diabolical betray. al of that which was regarded as real. The dreamless sleep of unconsciousness, periodically eroding the ecstatic consciousness of rta, became instead the horrific nightmare of 'The Lie', ceaselessly trying to devour The Truth and digest it to feed Her monstrous children. No longer was right action an expression of subtle wisdom or even adherence to the doctines set forth by the ancestral sages and their deities. Rather, it was taken as a moral choice to believe in the 'Truth' of reality, since inruv. idual choice could be moral, and in accord with asha, it could also be immoral and become 'endowed with the Lie'. Thus began the epic saga of good versus evil, vainly thought by moralists to comprise all of mythology, and radically innuencing subsequent mystical, reBgious, and esoteric theories of de· votional practice. The Iranian dualism depended on identifying with the moral choice of 'good thoughts', 'good words' and 'good deeds', and Ethical Devotion all these were defined as involving adherence to a universal moral system set in equal, dualistic opposition to a Drujic 'system' of immorality. The former was believed to lead to physical immortality in a monotheistic paradise in which aU variety and darkness would be abolishedj the latter was thought to lead to torture in hell followed by extermination. All this would happen after an apocalyptic final battle at the end of linear time, when the world would be 'renovated' and made perfect, for all eternity. This concept has endured into the present time, mainly because it was adopted by the Jews subsequent to their Iranian liberation from Babylonian exile, ensuring that these beliefs would live on into subsequent ages. Likewise, this also ensured that the conflation of moral duty with devotion would also be exacerbated by its combination with the personalized devotion characteristic of Semitic religions, whether polytheist, henotheist, or monotheist. Thus, in all the traditions marked by the transmission of this personalized mora) dualism I devotional mysticism has been characterized by the abolition of the devotee's personality and faculty of conscious choice, either in 'union' with the divine object of devotion, or in subjection to it. The perverse consequences of this development perpetuate sclf·destructive religion and mysticism, and these unfortunate results can be summarized by a polarity of twin deviations: the rejection of devotion to duty itself, even in the archaic forms of Roman pietas or Indo· European dharma, by duaHstic religious, mystical, and esoteric practitioners who do not wish to obliterate themselves in the fires of personal monotheism i and the practice of personal devotion to adversaries of the mono­theistic deity, under the premise that this is somehow less sdf· destructive. While adherence to ethical forms binding together the social and cosmic orders has little in common with the passionate moral identification characteri7jng the dualistic systems and distinguishing them from their polar counterparts, compara· tively few esoteric practitioners in the post-monotheist, post-.,"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Devoted dualist ages bother to make such a distinction. Thus, those who reject the universalist notion of divine commandments, and the dualist notion of universal morality, also tend to reject the very concepts of ethical and dutiful action ven though it is only through reference to an amoral ethos that moralism can actually be refuted without resorting to relativism or nihilism. Of course, the morally dualistic, monotheistic society is certainly unlikely to promote a social order in accord with the natural order, or concern itself with how either, or both, of those are brought into accord with a divine cosmic order that facilitates rather than consumes or obliterates consciollsness. Trans­gression of the social order is a likely corollary of genuine esotericism in such a society, as well as a probable result of authentic devotion to duty, either to traditional ancestral forms or to the cosmic principles which produce them. Similarly, a cosmic order that promotes the enhancement and victory of consciousness over its own decadent tendencies toward collapse back into undifferentiated slumber may also appear to be trans­gressive of a 'natural' order. Since devotion to 'nature' alone is therefore a self-destructive, decadent dissolution of conscious­ness, the post-monotheist social reality offers no ethos of consciousness toward which devotion and duty may be upheld. This leaves the practitioner stranded in a wasteland of pOintless post-modern relativism or a wilderness of arbitrary affections and affectations. By misapplying devotion to a profane social order masquerading as ancestral sacraHty, monotheism drives unwary mystics into the misidentification of the sacred cosmic order with nature alone. This often results in either thoroughly decadent pantheism, or in total anticosmism in which con­sciousness is deracinated and turned against its own absolute substrate in a sort of nihilistic, suicidal veneration of frivolity and 'absolute personal liberty' for its own sake: the worship of Chaos. Such a disposition could not be considered devotion to the 'self or the personal ego, because, as deviant as such self­directed mysticism may be, it postulates an expedjent con­trivance toward which the will to duty can be dedicated, thus Ethical Devotion providing a reference point for the consciousness. Those who maintain neither an orientation of duty toward authentic cosmic order nor even the limited personal consciousness of the divinised self, have no direction at all with which to orient themselves in the voids of absolute consciousness. In ensuring that they are free from misplaced piety and erroneous association with the relative, they also ensure they are free fTom any absolute standard, and so have no defence against being overwhelmed by the bleak numinosity of the unconscious void. Ultimately the result of duaHstic devotion, whether myst­ical, religiOUS, or esoteric, is hardly different when its sub­jection to moralism is replaced with unifying subjection to the beloved. This seems to be most prominently the case when the beloved is an adversary to a monotheistic deity, or a personif­ication of Nature. The womb of a goddess becomes a more accessible gate of Chaos through which the self-consciousness of the devotee may be extirpated in an ecstasy of love, horror) pain, pleasure, or some other passion. The favoured 'pagan', 'heathen', or daimonic figure becomes a substitute for the monotheistic deity itself, receiving sacrifices and setting down injunctions which divide the devotee from his or her own consciousness or worse, associate it to the patron being. eventually inspiring either dissolution through final union, or rejection of the consciousness itself in favour of a newly fortified ego. The attempt to reverse the efl'ects of exposure to moral dualism and monotheistic personification is fraught with difHculty, as the mystic's sense of self begins to collapse into undifferentiated chaos when forced to entirely disidentify even from the binary reality of self and other, and entirely associate with its own conception of the cosmic forces. Although this may not deter the ascetic renunciate, who eschews aLI worldly action and cognition in favour of transcendent reunion with the frac­tured unity, the esoteric practitioner also seeks self-existent autonomy yet remains in a society no longer harmonious with nature or with the sacred cosmic order. Likewise, in contrast to"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Devoted the monist ascetic, the religious devotee at best seeks the gnosis of divine consciousness within the immanent, manifest reality instead of beyond it. Both desire not blissful union but instead seek perfectly objective, omniscient perception of totality beyond the confines even of the cosmic hierarchy itself, and an immortal identity preserved from absorption into the abyss of chaos. Such practitioners must both conceive of the Singularity of divine consciousness as total unity and distinguish themselves from it as singular, sole and uniclue. This presents the appear­ance of a paradox which would normally drive the practitioner toward monism or monotheism: either absorption into unity or subjection to the concept of its personality. One solution would be radical detachment from all conditional association through denial of any essential unity of self, while also rejecting nihilism. Of course, with no essential self to liberate, the ex­tinction of desire becomes accessible only to the renouncer of all apparent, phenomenal and immediate reality. Just as the ascetic monist, the seIness mystic can only achieve liberation through renunciation. In contrast to this dissolution of self through renunciation, the proper practice of authentic devotion actively supports the preservation of distinct, Singular self-consciousness. This prac­tice is exemplified by the path of dedication to supreme Unity I conceived of as immanent in all beings yet beyond them, dedication with the intent to become totally distinct from It, free to identify solely with the Singularity of consciousness becoming its own supreme Unity. In this sense, the devotee discerns the Supreme both within and beyond the self, yet eschews attachment to or identification with It. Through devotion to duty within the cosmic order, duty fulfilled while exercising the detached disinterest of one unconcerned with the relative and its consequences, the practitioner experiences the distinction of the relative from the absolute, the manifestation or the multiplicity from the Unity, with the liberated per­spective of the Supreme itself. By cultivating de\\'otion to the Ethical Devol-ion supreme, Singular principle of consciousness, and thereby trans­gressing all boundaries of profane society and natural order in dedication to the sacred cosmic duty the Supreme establishes, the devotee achieves not only mystical liberation from attachment to the whole cosmic order itself, but also achieves Supl'\"eme consciousness both immanent and tl'\"anscendent. In maintaining an ethos of detached devotion to the supreme principle of cosmic order, the devotee overcomes decadence and corrup tion-fl'\"ee from profane society and natural order alike: Conscious.

So, fr om the beginning of my journey I found myself at a crossroads between East and West; I guess I'm not the only one who has passed through. After all, this East/West approach lies at the heart of Theosophy, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the OTO and so on. Some call this current Typhonian, I call it Tankhem. All these magical styles' work are crossovers between the ideas of late Egyptian and early 'tantrik' magick. I wandered in, and eventually out, of Crowley's old order, the (Typhonian) OTO-where I was left to devise my own foundation practice. This was slow work, but did deliver to me a mysterious pictogram which I now recognise as an Egyptian Hieroglyph. During this time I remember sitting in the BodJeian Library, enjoying the magnificently privileged \"few fT om the Indian Institute Library, across the rooftops of the Old Library, where several muses stand guard. This little library was my muse, Every morning I walked up the stairs, passing the statues and portraits of the oriental scholars I so admired, but also framed talismans and mystical games.

Mokshsa meaning liberation, because he was the trans· lator of the Veda into English, a language actually understood by a good many Hindus. Thus the masses were able to read their own scriptures, and this is liberation.

Just a few months earlier a fr iend took me to visit a witch in a remote Welsh farmstead. She read my horoscope and introduced me to the I China. As I was starting out in magick, I framed the question as to how I would fare in my mystical quest. The result was the very same hexagram and seal of AMOOKOS, the Arcane and Magical Order of the Knights of Shamballa. It felt like coming home. I didn't research the peculiarities of AMOOKOS. I took it all on fa ith. Tantra is a very cultic thing. One tends to see things from the perspective of one's cult. You don't really have to know the content of every tantrik grimoire-each is a complete practice in itself. The same goes fo r magick-you don't have to know everything-if you fmd something that works, why look fu rther? Our lineage came via a proto-hippie called Dadaji, who had initially wanted to be a pupil of Aleister Crowley. But when they met he was told to get himself to India. He took Old Crow at his word and arrived just after independence and became a wandering Sadhu, spending the rest of his life in India until his death in 1989. However, he never forgot hi s connection with Crowley and later I in the mid 1970s, he remade contact with diSciples of Kenneth Grant in the UK, and with them fo unded an East/West version of the Kaula sect which survives today under the name AMOOKOS. Before Dadaji, AMOOKOS traced its roots back to a late classical period fisherman called Matsyendranath. I recognised a kindred spirit and he too became one of my ancestors. Kiss cfthe Yoaini In AMOOKOS we start each ritual with the fo llowing invocation: I honour the line cf innumeroble Nathas, and cast a circle c1 Droaon's alow. Which perhaps tells you how important our connection to the ancestors is. One of the meanings of the clan structure is that the adept chooses his or her ancestors. Some trace their roots back to royalty but I prefer the nobility of labour. My ancestors are all of humble origins, fishermen who have an eye to the stars. May I remind you that Ammonius Saccas, the fo under of Nco-Platonism was an Alexandrian dockworker as well as a philosopher. Matsyendranath lived more than thirteen hundred years ago but he is far from the oldest of my kin. He fo unded his own magical style known as the Yogini Kaula. With such kin, AMOOKOS turned out to be a very important cult. Let me digress to tell you that it is nonnal nowadays to recognise three stages in the development of T antra. The earliest stage is called Kula, which means clan or family. This is contemporary with the hennetic or pagan magic of the classical world. It shares many fe atures, for example the clan structure, The Kulas are said to be extremists in their magick, very in your face-rituals in graveyards, orgies, that sort of thing. To gi ve you a flavour, when ·we were discussing this in a recent e-Iist, an adept known as Lalita Mataji made the fo llowing post: OriainaJIy tontro was a way Jo r a very brave 'hero' to seduce and bribe his way into the company cif the Dakini I yoainis.

Kaula comes next and is a development of Kula. It is mellower, more discreet. It is a secret SOCiety. Meetings took place on the new or full moon in isolated circles within the forest. Some practices (but which some?) are internalised-thus the circle in the forest could also be the chilia in the body. The Kaulas were pretty much the inventors of kundalini yoga. Over ti me, even the Kaula gets more and more refined, or watered down if you prefer. The final stage is purely internal, and that is what is known as Tantra. This is pretty much synonymous with mainstream Hinduism. In writing, I try to echo my ancestral voices. So I wrote a little book, Tantra Sadhana. If you ask someone to define magick these days they trot out the same old Crowley cliche. My muses, being more practical, suggested I focus on what people actually do. Turns out there are eight characteristic activities of tantra. Eight is a very Significant number in Kaula lore. The eight are: Sadhana Mantra Mandala or Yantra Mudra Nyasa Dhyana PUjOl (especially sexualised rites) initiation J'm not going to repeat what is in the books, though I'm told there are some very idiosyncratic things there, including an opening rite with material from the Greek Magical Papyri. It surprised even me when a reviewer said he understood why it was there but did not approve of the version J had used. So it can't be all wrong can it? So how did that come about? One of the dominant voices of my ancestors is connected with Seth, the Egyptian god of ambiguity. The way I hear him has always been radically different to almost everyone eJse. To me he speaks an international language, one which combines ancient hieroglyphs with the Greek vowels. It combines the Egyptian power of the word with an Orphic power of sound. And much of this same 'language' was transferred to, or found a home in India. When Matsyendranath, the founder of the Kaula sect was compiling his tantrik grimoire, he was totally aware of the importance of vowels as the 'magicaJ soul' of the alphabet. He created a system of eight vowels that is extremely close to the classical model. Matsyendranath, using a simpler vernacular, has: A as in but I as in fit U as in put R as in purdy L as in table Ai as in bite Om as in rope Au as in fo und My own Kaula circle was called Hamsa. the in and the out breath. But this is also the Sanskrit word for a swan or goose. It reminds me of our speciaJ relationship with the bird kingdom, especially water fowl. We also associated them with various aspects of the soul. In folklore it is the stork that delivers the newborn babe.

In Plato one"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Devoted reads that when a soul is reborn, it takes night on the wings of a swan. We combined the consonants Ham or Sa, with the eight vowels and that was our magical language. The eight represents the eight fundamental Yoginis or fe male spirits of Tantrism. The Simplicity of the Kaula approach suits my temperament, which is perhaps why it called to me in the first instance. I have always communed with my spirit guides, the Yoginis, using a freefonn vowel song or chaos language rather than more formal, VictOrian-style invocation. This brings me to the topic of Puja, meaning ritual, and probably what is the most distinctive thing about T antra. Everyone has heard of its extreme rituals and sexual magick or tantrik sex. In fact, there are two big themes in Kaula, sex and death. Hence the fa mously gory, or 'Gorean', images of the Goddess Kali, so beloved of western adepts. Although I must admit, fingers crossed, she has never appeared that way to me. Despite my long time devotion to rughtside spirits of one sort or another, my initial fa ith in their benign aspect has almost always been born out. As I connected with the folk of Egypt and South Asia I began to wonder whether these ancestors of mine were really that into the gods of the so-called 'great culture'. The relationsNp seemed quite distant and it began to make me question my own beliefs. Spirits, elements and Yoginis seem to be universal phenomena and a good deal less remote than the great gods of the temple. The AMOOKOS adept Lalita Mataji enjoyed a laugh at the expense of those: KauJa Boddesses, divine half-human female beinBs who spend their rime kiJ/inB and eatinB babies, drinkinB liquor, kula flUids and eatinB wild meat. Some of the Yoginis are indeed disease entities, which especially affiict children, but most are tree goddesses, or bird and animal Kiss of the rOBini entities; some may well be connected with abortion; some are vampires, called the Akhw in the Egyptian tongue or Vaitala in Sanskrit. In medieval Europe they become the incubi and succubi. I had been introduced to a species of occult beings that defied geographical and indeed historical boundaries. It soon became clear that traffic with all these entities often has a sexual component. Sexuality in ancient Egypt could be as unconventional as that found in the Kaula rites. This is a good corrective to those with a phallocratic personality. Kaula sex­uality has a strong oral component. This fa cilitates the process of fluid gnosis-from the Yogini, the guru or some other intermediary to the would-be adept. The fluid is a special food. The constellation Ursa Major is and always has been very magical. That's true for both Egyptian and Kaula lore, where it is called Saptarishi, the seven sages. Out on the Hamsa meadow I drew down the constellation using a ritual of my own creation. A Yogini came and gave me a cake. If you want to seduce someone, you bake them a cake. It is a process as old as Ufe itself. Perhaps from the beginning of time, food has been the mediating principle of magick. Food, the secret key to magick in all traditions at all times. According to Hindu intelJectual tradition, everything is food. When we die we are consumed in the funeral pyre or digested in the warm earth just as we, during our Lifetime, consumed other organisms in the fire of our stomachs.-One Hindu great god I do relate to is proletarian Ganesha. The living avatars of the god Ganesha are hand red by their trainers. Symbolically, we Kaulas worship Ganesha with offer­ings of turmeric yellow balls of sugary sweetness known as ludoos. They have a sinister secret. I know they are symbolic embryos. Put directly into the elephant's mouth, one can release colossal power.

These days I would not even try to invoke them under a cloud. Although they are called Yogini, the yoga they practice is of a very primal variety, a rew basic poses, but 'no need for crucifixion'. They are all about the original meaning of yoga which I would say has nothing to do with the old cliche of 'union' or 'yoke'.

You do need to begin with the lore; you need to make a friend of it and visit it often, always letting it guide you, teach you and advise you. But you can't make yourself a slave to itj you have to learn about the Gods and Wights from the Gods and wigh by letting Them into your life. There are plenty of scholarly texts and analyses out there. This is something a bit different. I am not going to ofTer lengthy what-I-reckon speculations based on theoretical correspondences between various dimly understood 'god fo rms' arrived at by adding up the letters of their names and taking away the price of a tin of tomatoes. This is about what happens when you put down your books, prepare to let go of your armchair: theories, and go out to meet the Gods on Their own tenns. This is the voice of devotion. Things have always been fraught between myself and my God. for a long time I put this entirely down to mistakes I made when I was younger. J still reckon that the consciousness I interact with was quite genuinely angry with me, on a personal level, because I turned my back on Loki when He first came to me and didn't accept Him into my life until ten years later. It was not so much the duration (the Gods do not reckon time as we do-a decade isn't even the blink of an eye to them) as my reasons for doing it that caused the strife. I betrayed my God, it is true. But that isn't the whole storYi the reasons fo r the fr iction are deeper than that. It has taken me a long time to understand. He jsflre. You can argue the toss if you want and we could go back and forth for a bit, you with your 'there's nothing in the Eddas ... ' and me with my Scandinavian younger lore and Lokabrenna, but really, why bother? Think about the ways in which you burn. Think of the hungry chemistry in you that takes the sunlight buried in your food and fires it into living flesh; think of the way your impulse to act can be a pile of coals in your belly, low or blazing, depending on the nature of the urge. Think of the electrical impulses dancing from neuron to muscle. Think of the way your heart races in love, or in rage, or in joy. Think of the heat in your pulse running from chest to fingertips and toes. racing along each limb, burning in your cheeks; that which colours, enlivens, sets us dancing---the heartfire. Loki is present in all these things. Fire is fluid. It dances and flows from one place to the next. It hunches low one minute, leaps up the next. Fire is fickle, warming you on a cold night or stripping everything you own from you and leaving you bare in the ashes. But more than that: think of all the ways we talk about flames, and burning. She's a hot-tempered one. He's n'!Y new flame. It was a heated arBument. That BUY makes me so hot. We talk about Hghting a fire under some­one, getting all fired up, burning desire, burning love. When Loki has withdrawn from me, I've burned from nothing, blistering with the lightest heat. I have been cut ofT fT om sources of heat and flame, left out in the cold. I once sat on the floor with the trappings from His harrow in a box before me, swearing I was going burn it all one piece at a ti me, only to have match after match refuse to light until my resolve flickered and died likewise. And when He is close I have fe lt that fire on my skin, pouring over me like a liqUid, seen candles leap up on"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Devoted the harrow, held hot metal trays fresh from the oven unharmed. I've put my hand into the flame and come through not just unscathed, but transformed. So yeah, Loki is fire. You can argue the toss, we can go back and forth, but I've danced with that heat in my blood. October 2007. I am shivering in the cold New England air, clutching at my friend's arms; J'm not even trying to stop crying any more, or to cover my chest with my arms. Everything I've got is going on staying on my feet under the waves of pain and shame. My paper-thin tolerance for the former was exhausted after the first couple of strokes, and that was a long time ago now. I don't know why He has requested this particular ordeal. If it had been up to me I'd have taken off into the Catalan Pyrenees to offer some austerity or ordeal on my own, sorted things out by myself. I am used to sorting things myself. Loki is present. Sort of. Half-in-half-out of the body of a young male shaman. It's hard for me to assess the depth of the possession�I have no experience to go on, and assessing anything is difficult at this point�so I am taking my cues from the more exp�rienced people around me. I can feel that Loki is present; whether or not He's ensconced in a human body, I can feel Him near me somewhere, and that's enough for me. Also present around the fire pit is a mixed gathering of spirit workers. I'd expected one or two witness, people known to me and trusted. Instead there are a dozen people, half of whom I barely know. The instructions are very Simple. Stand there, under the lash, until you feel like you've taken enough. For a normal healthy adult, it would be a reasonable request. But I'm not healthy, not by a long chalk, and the whole set-up has cracked open one of the dark places inside me and sent me tumbling down into it. I can't know it but I've been here for a couple of hours now, give or take a few breaks to warm up by the fire. I am cold, tired, hurting, ashamed. I want it to stop, need it to stop, but every time I try to get the words out that black place in my heart opens up again and says Not Enouah. Every blow, every cutting comment from the horsed God, everything just gelS sucked up and devoured. The lash falls again, and then again, and then my legs give way. I stand, saying, 'I'm fme! J'm okay!' But I am not okay. I don't know when to stop. I don't know how to stop. I am where I'm supposed to be, cold under the blows as the real people gather by the fire to mock, and my God turns His back on me. It is not enough. It will never be enough. It is our stories that shape us. Not solely the events themselves, but the narratives we construct around them, the patterns that we create as we try to make sense of it all. Stories can govern the paths that are open to us, the jobs we take, the clothes we wear. Stories can even shape the flesh. I have experienced this myself, watching other people brought low by conditions that I found merely inconvenient, and vice-versa. Often, both people were me at different times. We can make great changes in our lives by changing those stories, by rewriting the script-it is the most primal form of magic. ObViously, there are limjtations to how much stuff you can switch outi we cannot choose every­thing that happens to us. Much of the time though, we can choose what we do with it. The narrative can be undone and rewoven around the hard facts like water flowing around rocks. This goes a hundred times for our dealings with the Gods. They are boned with sacred truths and then fleshed with narr­ative. It is through stories we know Them, through legends and tales that They come down to dance among us, and it is through the stories we tell ourselves that our relationships with Them are given shape and substance. We cannot make such out of whole cloth, because the Gods are Hving beings with Their own drives, desires, natures and agendas; but still, it is the yarns we spin that weave the patterns of our fellowship."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Devoted For a long time, this was my story: I grew up in a lapsed-Catholic household, where atheism and a marked scorn for organised religion went hand-In-hand with a sort of misty-eyed affection for paganism. I got into magic as a little kid, starting by trying to manipulate the world by thinking really hard, and working up to actual ritual by age eight. My first proper spell was a flying spell requiring an hallucinogenic ointment; thankfully whatever providence looks after preteen witches prevented me from finding any Wolfsbane-apparently granny-bonnets, though part of the same Ranunculus family, do not enable night in proto-witches. Make a nOle of that. I put milk and sweet things out for fairies, 1 experimented with dowsing and automatic writing and divination, 1 talked to the plants in my patch of garden. I had more failures than successes, but there was always just enough of the latter-and enough random weirdness-to keep me coming back for more. Due to my rather isolated background, 1 was always a solitary magician. Never joined any groups, fellowships, or cov­ens. Even when 1 eventually met a few other self-identified magicians I never really worked with them, maintaining my wholly solo practice for years. In my early twenties, I started to feci drawn to the runes and the Gods of the North as a focus for my magic and nebulous spirituality. I had a powerful experience in which Loki seemed to begin speaking to me, where I literally heard voices calling me to worship Him. Initially, I was enchanted and all set to throw myself into the experience, but allowed myself to be knocked off the path by certain people in my life who encouraged me to doubt the validity of what was happening­to regard myself as mad rather than spirit-touched: Instead of accepting the gift I was being ofTered, I panicked and fled. For a year I buried myself in the most rigorous scepticism, rejecting anything connected with magic; then, as I slowly pulled out fyom the pit and re-embraced the hidden world, into a stubbornly non-theistic brand of chaos magic. Man-made servitors and eregores, pop-culture figures-these were all I needed. No Gods. No spirits. Although I resolutely refused to conceptualise these as having any objective reality, preferring to think of them as thought forms, I still felt ill at ease with colonising someone else's belief system and grabbing ofT hunks for my own entertainment. The only deities I felt 'belonged' to me were the Gods of the North, and-although I'd have denied it if you had asked me-I was hiding from Them. Eventually though, I was bold enough to start weakening the barriers I'd put up. First were my 'guides', two gentle spirits who surfed in on the back of my Reilci attunement to help with that side of my work, and to get me used to spirit-contact generally. They did not ask that I believe in their objective reality, so I had no problem adjusting to the.ir presence. Then I got into ancestor worship, in a non-denominational sort of way. Initially I slipped it past the internal censor by parsing it as a kind of gothed-out suitheism, self.worship got up in boneyard drag. By 'worshipping my ancestors' I was simply worshipping everything that made me me--worshipping myself. That comforting model became less and less sustainable as I realised that some of the Dead were talking back. On the edge of sleep I would hear and see them; I would learn things that J hadn't known before. I felt as if I'd dipped my toe into a nice warm bath and suddenly found myself up to my neck in the ocean, vast and deep and strange. And then in 2005 Loki showed up. It was the same as before. The chanting voices, as if I was overhearing a ritual in progress, loud in my ears. Nothing I did would shut it OUl, nothing I listened to or read could distract me for more than a few seconds. In the end there was nothing 1 could do except give myself up to it. After a while the chanting stopped, but I found myself sinking deeper and deeper into the visionary experience."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Devoted In my mind's eye 1 saw fire, rearing horses, a hall fu ll of shadowy figures, while my physical eye saw golden runes flying past almost too fast to catch. Through it all 1 was powerfully conscious of Loki Himself, standing at my shoulder, demanding that I listen to Him, demanding to know why 1 had rejected His gifts. The experience seemed to go on fo rever, although in reality I doubt it was more than half an hour. I was overloaded and knew I was heading for a seizure, so I lay down on the bed. When 1 came round fr om the fit, the visions were gone and so was Loki. This time, though, things were different. Whilst I was still a solitary magician, the advent of the internet meant that I had contacts who could help and who rallied round. Granted, when I went public with what had happened I got plenty of the same crap I'd had the first time-I couldn't pOSSibly have exper­ienced genuine spirit contact, I was either lying or sick or crazy-as various overheated egos got their noses put out of joint. Older and slightly more savvy, I was able to tune it out and listen to the people who actually had something meaningful to add. Based on their input, I decided to set up a rite to talk to Loki and find out what the deal was. If you are a magician, this is what you do. When They come to you, no m<!-tter how volatile, how scary, how unexpected, or what preconceptions you have about Them, you have to step up and deal. Once you make the decision to set your feet on the path, once you really embrace magic, you have little conscious control over where it takes you. Something else, something higher than your conscious mind, takes over and starts running the show. You don't get handed what you desire, because desire is fickle and often works in conflict with itself and your overall well-being. I was not exactly thrilled at the thought of performing a Loki working after my difficult experience in the past; even if I had not had that experience, the fact was that Gods in general, and Loki in particular, just didn't go with my stuff. I was a fa irly quiet, almost over-cautious mage, given much to kitchen-Lokoeisn witchery, simple spells and the healing arts, so dealing with a notoriously volatile, wild, unknowable being such as Loki was several miles outside my comfort zone and counting. But magic, if it's working right, will do that-hurl you outside that zone, throw you for a loop. Magic speaks to ail the places inside you that are broken, to your blind spots, to your Achilles' heel. It will take you where you need to go to fix up the cracks and open the windows. Despite dabbling in Northern magic all those years previously, I knew very Jjttle about the Gods and wights--half understood and poorly remembered snatches of data from books that wasted no more than a handful of lines on each God and were themselves woefully ill-informed. And although I was learning fa st, reading everything I could lay my hands on, I had little idea how to put together a meaningful and appropriate ritual. If you come from a Western magical background there is always the temptation to just break open the high ceremonial, Thelema or Wicca derived rites and plug Whoever's talking to you into that. HeM is how you do maSie, after alii even the elite chaote who has turned his back on the fusty hidebound ways of Crowley and co. will still plug the Fantastic Four into the LBRP without batting an eyelid. It's not always a good idea though. Personally, I do not believe that all systems are automatically compatible with Western High Ceremonial gear. HeM js a beautiful system, whole and valid in its own right, but that does not make it the ur·system into which all pantheons can be slotted. In particular, there are certain incompatibiHties be· tween HCM and the NT cosmology which make this kind of kludge undesirable. You end up lOSing too much of the ri chness and mystery. I discovered that rites put together by other Lokeans did exist-I was particularly taken by the work of Alice Karlsdottir and Selvarv Stigard, who had crafted some wonderful workings-but none of them seemed quite right for the situation at hand. It seemed important to find my own way. I"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Devoted ended up taking advice from a fTiend who'd had conversations with Odin within a Vodoun fr amework. This had gone well and we figured that the same kind of ritual might suit Loki. The ritual outline was fairly Simple: cook a meal as an offering, set up an altar with appropriate colours and symbols, lay on some booze, honour the God with music, songs or chants, and see what happens. The first step was to create an icon of Loki for the altar. I don't paint or draw with any real skill, but I can do a passable blodgy acrylic. It was the first time I'd seriously buckled down to create a piece of spiritual artwork, and the experience turned out to be an odd one. I fo und that the process of painting seemed to trigger somethjng strange in me. I was struck with an overwhelming need to move, stretching and pacing up and down the flat. I got very hot, almost fe verish; in between bouts of movement I lay down on the cool floor tiles. I found myself craving meat; I don't eat meat usually, so there was none in the house. I ended up crouched on the floor by my painting eating tuna out of the can. It's not a terribly good painting when all is said and done, but the act of creating it was a very powerful experience. I had worked my hardest, and the piece seems to have been acceptable. The next. day I woke late from some eerie dream of a forested place, and running wolves. The sun had been shining through the branches and I had spoken to someone, agreed to something I couldn't remember. Uneasy. Later, I went shop­ping for ritual gear; as advised, I tried to allow myself to be guided by the God and my own spirits as to what I should get. I ended up coming home with red paper, a satin cushion cover which was all I couJd find for an altar cloth, piles of red, pink and orange tea lights, a big reel cinnamon-scented pillar candle, several cans of strong double-malt lager, tuna steaks, and a carton of carrot-coloured vegetable soup. I was getting poked for a bottle of strong spirits, but couldn't 'hear' precisely what kind so I went \\vith a bottle of brandy. I later worked out that this was an error-Loki likes absurdly sweet liqueurs in silly Lokaeisn colours, strong coffee, energy drinks, spiced rum, cheap beer, orange Tang or, to be contrary, a good Single malt Scotch. Still, liquor is liquor and He didn't seem to mind. I set up a little altar on top of a chest of drawers, plaCing two white candles at the back to clear the air before I got started, and arranging the Iiule tea lights in a circle round it. The Loki icon was propped against the wall. I had a silver-plated ritual cup to use for the libations, and some bowls for offerings. I was directed to poach the tuna in the lager beer, which is nicer than it sounds, anell warmed up the soup. Incidentally, this kind of food is somewhat at odds with the sweets and junk fo od He generally asks fo r. I think this is because I was to end up dealing with a more serious fa ce of Loki than most people do. I put on some music, then sat myself by the makeshjft altar and set to. I used a box of matches as a rattle while reading off quotes from the £dcJas that mention or describe Loki, throwing in my own kennings or tides I'd discovered onHne. When I fe lt as if things had warmed up enough, I cracked open one of the beers, took a good swig, then placed the can on the altar as an offering. I took a small bite or the ro od, then put Loki's portion in the offering bowl. I poured a cup of hot soup, took a small sip, then placed the rest with the other offerings. I poured a little of the brandy into the offering cup. Ignoring the voice at the back or my head that told me what a ro ol I was being, that nothing would happen, I kept on hailing Loki, toasting Him, bigging Him up. inviting Him to be present and enjoy the offerings I'd prOVided. And it worked. Slowly, as the minutes crept by, the air in the room changed. I wasn't on my own in the flat anymore. There was a profound, palpable sense of presence. The hair on the back of my neck and on my arms began to stand on end, I began to feel hot and cold all over, afraid. Nothing I'd ever done had ever gone like this before. What had I got myselr into?

Put Jour paw into the.f1ame, lillIe wolf There was no compulsion in the words. It was an invitation, not a command. I think I said that I was not an animal, I was not a wolf, had nothing to do with wolves, but I put my hand in the flame anyhow. It burned. I snatched it away. It burned when I put it back, and it burned when I put it back again; and then the flame was like silk along my skin as I moved my hand through it. I would still bum, but it took longer and longer. I started to lose myself in the fire, and then He asked fo r more brandy, and told me to fetch my knife. The ritual dagger had been bought some weeks previous to the visionary episode. It was a Silly mass-produced paperknife with a tackily ornate handle and a blade that would have flinched away weeping from a pat of butter. I'd bought it precisely because it was stupid, and cheap, and kitschy, a fitting bit of ritual kit fo r a modern mage who didn't really take any of this magic lark too seriously.

I was saying goodbye to something in that moment, goodbye to screwing around, to pretending not to care about the things that were precious to me, to treating my practice like a bad joke instead of an adventure. You can say it was a cruel or an ugly thing to ask, but it wasn't, not really. It was a valuable lesson, offered in a way that was immediate and lasung. He was communicating with me in a powerful, visceral way that I would understand and retain: This is your crcifr.. These art four tools. Everythina should befit Jo r Jour use. Your knife should be sharp. You deserve no less. I flung the knife away, or maybe He did. It stuck in the plaster then fe ll to the Ooor. I picked it up. He asked, once again, for brandy, I gave Hjm brandy, and He told me to drink some more to that I would need it. I did. The blade blackened in the flame. The skin inside my elbow melted away from the edge as the runes took shape, three Gebo runes in a line, burned flesh and soot, a little shaky because it was hard to keep still. Understand, I could have stopped at any ti me; there was no pressure, no threat. Just-this is what you do, this is what you do next. It was work that we were doing together. After the runes, everything becomes a blur.

It's a shambles-my clothes are in a pile on the floor, the altar is piled with offeringsj some of the tea lights, worryingly, are still burning. low and blue in their metal cups.

Without my glasses on it's hard to read the time in the corner of the screen. Half past four. The last I recall it must have been around midnight. What happened? What the Hel happened? I pick up the heap of clothes. There's an empty tea light cup nearby, wax spattered on some of the fa bric, and, when I check, wax on me too. It becomes clear that at some point in the proceedings I must have poured at least one whole melted tea light over my bare skin. I have no memory of this. f pick away some of the remaining wax, and look in confusion at the unmarked skin. I've been okay up until now, but this is the breaking point. I put out the candles, find an unopened can of beer, and shiver back to the bedroom to drink it before collapsing again in to a pounding, uneasy doze. It's my understanding that the African Powers will not possess a solitary individual. Possession is a community affair, accom· plished to bless the congregation, to share knowledge and offer healing, prophesy and wise counsel. There's no pOint riding a person who is all alone-who would one speak to? Loki, on the other hand, will jwnp in your head just to raid your fridge. Of course, i� the absence of witnesses or a note saying 'Loki woz ere, thanks for the beer' , 1 have no idea if what I experienced that ni ght was fu ll possession. It would explain the time loss (I'd put away a fa ir bit of alcohol but not nearly enough to cause a four hour blackout), although so would a lot of other things. Later on, I was to understand the purpose of the heat resistance work-it has now become a major part of my practice-but at the time I felt that I'd been placed at physical risk for no discernable reason, and was very shaken up. I had to throwaway some of the clothes I was wearing because I couldn't stand to put them on again. The experience haunted me for a long time afterwards. In all, I am inclined to read it as a fu ll possession-something akin to taking your new car for a , \" Lokaeign spin. I didn't sufTer any lasting hann, although it did take me a while to get over the uncanniness of it all. For days to fo llow, I felt as if I were carrying the God in my heart, a constant sense of presence, half·in half·out. Runic signs were everywhere f looked, in the cracks in the pavement, in the clouds, in the veins of a marble floor, in the branches of trees. The world around me seemed freighted with messages, which, if I had the wit to read them, would send me into an ecstasy of wisdom. For days, f burned. Then one morning I woke up and it had all stopped. The world crashed back to normal. The runes were gone, the presence was gone, and it was as if someone had reached into my soul and ripped a chunk out of it. The desolation was incredible, the worst comedown of my life. I fe lt weak and sick. I tried to get some perspective, treat it like just another ritual, but I couldn't let it go. Although the whole experience had shaken me up, it was also exhilarating. I was torn between hoping that it was all over, that whatever I'd done had closed the door, put every­thing in order and back to normal, and praying that it wouldn't end. Everything I'd known or thought I'd know about magic, the Gods, the world and my place in it had been razed to the ground, but I felt as. if my magic was blossoming in a way it never had before. It could all have been a delusionj my misfiring brain overloading and throwing up a convincing but ultimately false set of impressions. Or worse-it could all have been real, but I had proved insufficient somehow and had been rejected. Two weeks after the initial rite I was struggling to come to terms with the idea that this might have been a one off for whatever reason, when the contact was resumed.

But most of Them have not appeared to mej I get shown things sometimes, but it's like a video clip rather than an interview. As for the enmity between Loki and the other Gods, it either doesn't exist in the way one might expect it to, as between Loki and Thor, or I have been instructed not to get involved. I've got plenty of fighting on my hands down herej it is not my place to involve myself in Their conflicts. Instead, I ponder the strife as a sacred mystery and seek to understand it. And I was refigured. I am still being refigured. This would sometimes happen during my sleep-I'd suddenly find myself overwhelmed with tiredness and unable to stay awake no matter what I did, and then wake up to find my sense of myself subtly altered. At times the process would be accompanied by visions, even sensations. Hela tore ofT my right cheek. Odin plucked out my left eye once, blew on it, sucked on the optic nerve like a seamstress sucking on a piece of .thread, then replaced it (my Sight was better thereafter). He ripped out my guts, and His wolves gnawed at my bones. I was devoured wholesale by a brood of fe male monsters, then piped back into being by Loki in the form of a woman using one of my own fe murs as a nute. I have been gifted with jewellery you cannot Lokaeign see, but that I can fe el, and which responds to the presence of the spirits by growing warm or heavy. I have been marked about my fa ce so that when I fare forth I am recognisable as one of Theirs. On the back of my neck, at the base of the skull, They cut a window for the spirits to enter and ride my head. Loki Himself cracked open my chest one day and tore my heart out. There was no pain, only a wTenching sorrow, heart­ache. It was a ruined looking thing, that heart, like half burned meat left to go rotten, but He ate it in long slow bites, as if it was good. Then He reached down and took up a handful of rich earth, with green grass in it and bright flowers, and He shaped it with blood sUck fmgers, put it in my chest and flicked it to make it beat. In this way He made for me a new heart, bigger and more lOVing than the one before, which I like much better. I am a stronger being than I was, much richer in good things. Though I haven't really gone through the full shamanic death yet; it's in the post, They're waiting on it, making sure I am whole enough to come home again when 1 do. As things stand, I might not find my way back. So I am not a shaman, not yet. But I've begun. There are schisms in the practice of the Northern Tradition in modern times, great cracks and fissures opening up and diViding heathendom. The ground shakes and splits along fa ult lines in unpredictable places. Some obsess over the strictest recon­struction, trying to turn back the clock to a thousand years ago, instead of trying to find the Gods in the modern world and letting Them express Their mysteries through what is around us today. Some fixate on race, insisting in the fa ce of all the evidence that the Gods should only be approached by people of northern European descent. Some develop a gnawing need to strip out any hint of mysticism from their practice, proclaiming even simple prayer to be either Christian or Wiccan. If you are given to direct contact work of any kind, you are an outcast. Worst of aU is the unmentionable practice of possession, which, they will insist, has no place in heathen worship.

Although Loki is counted amongst the /£sir, He originated outside Their garth. Loki is a Jotun, one of a different race. The word 'Jotun' is usually translated as giant, and most literary readings of the Eddas focus on the eschatology, on that final battle where the IEsir and Vanir will battle the Jotnar at the end of the world. The giants are portrayed as monsters-wild, violent, chaotic, deadly, the enemies of men and Gods alike. However, a look at other sources seems to indicate that in fact at least some of the Jotnar would have been the recipients of worship by pre·Christian heathens. The experiences of modem spirit workers, heathens and other pagans would seem to bear this out, with more and more people reporting spiritual contact with Jotun·kind. This stuff about chaotic evil giants versus lawful Gods is perfectly adequate for students of �terature, fiction writers, role· play garners and whatnot, but as a heathen spirit worker I find it is more sensible to simply consider Etin· kind as a third tribe of Gods. I will say' here that you should not necessarily seek out the Jotnar, because unlike the IEsir and Vanir They are not all concerned with human affairs and may not look upon your interference kindly. Some, like Hela, are intimately connected with and interested in humanity and can be approached much like the IEsir. Some are very terrible, like the wolf horror Fenrir; but even Fenrir has lessons to teach us and His proper place in the Web of Wyrd. Some of Them are simply the spirits of wilder nature, out beyond the regions that arc habitable to humans. The mountain devours the unwary traveller. Generally speaking, if you don't have business with the Jotnar you don't have business with the Jotnar, and if you do have business, you'll know. \". Lokaeisn And Loki Himself? Surely He is named amongst the lEsir, Odin's blood brother, and venerable therefore, whatever His crimes? No. You'll be informed that Loki is a Jotun, an evil spirit, a Nordic Satan. Even those who pay lip service to the idea that Loki is holy and worthy of reverence, finding this a convenient platform for anti· Christian diatribes and smug self­congratulation, will not really honour Him and will ostradse and defame His people. A Lokean can never hope to have 'face' in the conventional sense. To be a dedi cant of Loki is to be dodgy, not quite right, not to be trusted. In heathendom stereotypes abound, not helped by the fact that a lot of Lokeans have bought into those same stereotypes and seek to inhabit them.

There was an old Scandinavian folk·cuslom where children threw their milk teeth into the fire, petitioning Loki for a new one. 'Here is a gold tooth for a bone tooth'. I joke about how my Odin devoted friends are worshipping Father Christmasj I'm worshipping the Tooth Fairy. But what is worship? For many-myself included, one the navour of the word worship seems antithetical to everything that magic is. It conjures lip ugly images. Mindless grovelling before something invisible, perhaps indifferent, non·existent or even hostile; submission to an arbitrary order, sacrificing one's Will to the will or selr-proclaimed holy men. But this is not what worship means. Worship is simply lI'eorthscipc, to give worth to. True worship can never imprison, never enslave, because it is a full expression of the self in relation to the holy, to the Mysteries of the universe around us as mediated by the Gods and wights. Worship in the Northem tradition is an interactive process, thanks to the law of 'a Gift demands a Gift'. But this is not a mere transaction, like for like, goods for go.ld. It is an exchange of understanding, an exchange of consciousness, between the votary and the living intelligences that are the spirits. The object of one's worship is like a reflective surfacei whatever light you pour onto it from yourself will be focused and radiated back onto you. You enrich each other, just as any friends enrich each other. Nor is worship about wrapping a comforting gannent of lies and self-serving delusion about you. Offering worship and haVing faith do not equal looking for a free ride or an ethical 'out' when things get complicated. Faith is a skill . It is not simply given to you whole and complete and in need of no further cultivation. You have to hone it, work on it, practice it, every Single day. You have to labour at it, work it like earth or metal, dig and build and file and smash until your hands bleed. You have to make it, like food or art, like love. Faith is not the walls. It is the window, the Wind Eye, the opening that lets you look out into the storm. It's not a warrior who fights your fights for you, it is the force that vivifies your own muscle and nerve and puts the sword in your own hand. It is not the giver of gifts, it is your own generosity magnified and given impetus. Faith takes what is finest in you and further refmes it. There is a divide between where I started and where I am now, between pure sorcery and something else. You can get a long way towards the other side with logiC and rationalism, but not all the way. No matter how obseSSively you rewrite the equation, you cannot get rid of the little x in middle. No matter how many experiences the Powers send your way-visions, dreams, mad midnight happenings where the laws or physics seem to crack like the sugar on a crema catahln-no matter how many others may be waving at you from the further cliff, you cannot walk across a solid stretch of Reason to get there, each stone finn and steady beneath your fe et, each step assured. No, to get there, you will have to take that nying leap out into the unknown and hope like buggery that you're doing the right thing. There can be a weight of inevitability about that jump, as the number of mental back nips you have to do to maintain a secular interpretation of what is happening to you increases, and the desire to touch the void rises with the energy you must expend. A lot of people mistake this moment, the moment when you have to put more work into preserving your atheism than you can sustain, for a rational choice. But you cou1d keep resisting almost indefinitelYi the breaking of your resistance does not change the ract that you still took that leap. And there is nothing wrong with that. I have less respect for the man or woman of faith who insists 'my choice was one hundred per cent rational' than I do for the person 'who admits that somewhere in there is the vertiginous x of a leap of faith.

Once you get there, you discover that this one leap was not the end. The more work you do from this perspective, the more you interact with your Gods and the more They respond, the easier it gets, the more your faith is shored up. That little worm of doubt, though--it never goes away, nor should it. The doubt is your ally against fa naticism and madness, helping you to maintain flexibility and adaptability in your deaJings with the Powers. But this does mean that at times you will have to make that leap again from time to time, to cope with the inevitable shifts and uphea\"als of a mortal life and the changes that your relationship with the Gods will go through o\"er the years, and to remain steady when the doubt rises up and threatens to overwhelm you.

In the lore, going berserk means entering a hideous battle frenzy in which one's whole body can change, becoming prodigiously strong, immune to normal weapons and to fire. The berserks are described as wild and terrible, slaughtering indiscriminately. This gets put down to all kinds of things, from alcohol to amanita muscaria to the inventive minds of the old skalds and the later scholars who set down their words. But the berserkergang is very real. It is one manifestation of a kind of transcendent state, an ecstatic trance nicknamed the aana', the going. There arc a lot of variations, depending on the stimuli used to enter the state. And you don't need magic mushrooms or mead to get into it, either. Before my conversion, I had entered gangr a fe w times spontaneously, either via tremendous psychological or physical pressure, or by being placed in trance and then aCcidentally lTiggered. I had a very strong nonviolent outlook so fo und these states horrible to contemplate; J spent a lot of time and effort trying to suppress that side of me. But you cannot be Loki's and hide from yourself. I found the gangr coming over me during my devotions. I might drag myself home, reluctantly set up a devotional rite with every intention of going through the motions and crawling into bed as soon as I could, only to find myself dancing uncontrollably for three or four hours, burning with the presence of my God. I might suddenly he compelled to pick up bits of loose charcoal in my fingertips, marvelling as I held them unburned fo r several seconds at a time. Partly because of my background and inclinations, and partly because of the stimuli I use, my gangr manifests diffe rently to somej I am far less likely to become violent than to dance up a storm, run ofT into the woods, or paint five pictures simultaneously.

It brings a beast to the surfaccj the rcd-in-tooth-and-c1aw parts you want to keep hidden from yourself. Loki is a shapeshifter, taking many dilTerent fo rms. He is also a revealer of painful truths. This aspect of the gangr naturally connects me to Him. There are other points of connection too. Loki ate the heart of the thrice burned Etin-witch Gullveig and gave birth from it, mothering a brood of flag troll women, ogresses, witches. Thus Loki is the Mother of Witches-and the gangr is an act of witchcraft.

I have paid shild from my previous errors, and now I have made this concrete gesture of commitment and love. I am making regular devotions, doing the re'luired work as I understand it. More, I have begun to find a sense of community. There is one loose group of spirit workers and shamans in the States with whom I'm building bridges. There are the UK based magicians, for whom I've started to become a contact in the world of heathenry; and in the US, a group of people who practice the berserkergang and related altered states as a martial and spiritual discipline, for whom I can function as a priest of Loki. And then one day I wake up, and He's there, not playful, not calm and abstracted, but raging. Torrents of meaningless sounds, spitting and snarling. I catch the odd word. Traitor. I receive vivid images of my own mutilation and death. As the days pass, the things I see begin to manifest as pain in my body. I can't hear any of the other Gods or spirits, I can't hear anything but that furious torrent. Days drag into a week, two weeks, and I can feel my mind going. This is it, this is where I find out that the others have been right all along, that Loki is evil and inimical, that He has just been toying with me ... What if He is a demon, what if They all are? I deal with the impulse to give in to these thoughts by making a concerted effort to step up my devotions. I ask colleagues for help, get various suggestions. Nothing seems to work. Eventually the din stops and things return to normal, but I am shaken. I have come through, but it fe els like a close thing, and still I don't know why. The Gods are not just extra powerful men and women, some long-lived monster Mafia exploiting Their superior wisdom and strength to oppress mortals.

The cemetery. Wonder. Joy. Grief. Home. The crossroads. The brewing of drink, and the growing of crops. DanCing at a wedding, danCing at a funeral. Order. Chaos. Wisdom. War. The raising of a child, the honing of a weapon. The Gods are all of these things and many more, given consciousness and living form so that we may better know them and understand them. Take Thor. Before I converted I simply didn't know much about loyalty, or value steadfastness, or perceive the courage involved in hard work and reliability. Through communing with Thor, I have begun to learn in a way I could not have learned from an abstract idea. I begin to see Thor in the world around me, in the men and· women who do His work in this world, who embody the things He is. I have become more steadfast, stronger, more industrious myself. If you speak to Freyja and your heart is cold, if you speak to Freyja and yet you hate women, despising them as whores or bitches, you will have a cold and lonely time of it as She packs up Her mysteries and turns Her bright face from you.

Tried to act with honesty, but in this process in flesh, both learning and mistaking who She and I were in the embrace. This has been my alchemy, my fe tishised nigredo. Dressing Babalon as the most immediate body to honour, in the meditation of never saying no. I do not regret a single instant or lover taken, yet I have learned that I could not fuck everyone to knowledge, let alone myself. The crazed black cracks to reveal a molten bloody heart. I cut deeper into myself, deeper into devotion. Discover what Love really is. Find Sabalon before the seducer becomes seduced by the surfaces forever. The beloved is not an abstract. We cannot project her as a patina on the'world, for in penetrating we are penetrated. The rose heart shot through with barbed arrows. I am all undone ... vith Love. The much vaunted state of detachment kills the subtle alchemy of true union. This is for beginners, trying to control their sexual response, and a relic of cultures and times when woman was seen as less than human. Know now that nothing can exist in isolation. That the true self can only be found by sacrificing all, over and again. Repeat and deepen, step beyond the bounds. How can the lover of Sabalon treat the beloved as a whore for hire, thrown back out onto the street after the dispassionate act? She asks the hardest thing, Love. The destroyer of all. I know the name of my beloved in the world. Her tremor shock, the way her eyes flare and throw out. The cascade of The AmJortas Wound synchronicities and recriminations from her lips, the doubts. All the confused storms of where divinity begins and where it ends. Yet Love has found us both out, and there is no respite. Open, wounded, bloody and ecstatic with the dance which is Sabalon. She is here for us all. Blood is the clarity that Babalon demands. Because for all the fucking and fe asting there must be confrontation, and yes, sacrifice. Devotion demands the impossible. Again and again She asks you to confront. To offer Her that most terrible of gifts, Love. Sabalon is a Goddess of War and Love and we win all fa ll on the battlefield. What matters is how we live. We must make the ritual gestures of Love. Find our own fierce ways. Engineer encounters with knives and ropes and silk sheets and alleyways. Recognise Her face when She appears rather than rush after the next illusory thrill. Her scar demands attention, it whitens now into a moon smooth raised keloid become an erogenous zone, draws the hand and eye. Has the divine fascination healed into it, the touch-me-touch-me-not of eroticism. But this is a scar that never truly heals.

I have a wild way about me coming from a path that culls the innocence of the soul and although I cannot tell it in whole, let no one doubt that I am a true witch. I have rejected works from great masters, even if they are long famed for their worth. My teachings began for me at my birth with a cunning raven in the rafters. That onc image now forms the foundation upon which sits everything I have done. all that I am to do or have begun. From the raven I have validation. She is the heart of all that I see and is the light I seek out in the void. She is the warmth of love I can't avoid and the darkness I cloak around me. This is from where I stand to shake these bones at all who have inclination to hear and stomach. I do not adhere to the safe ways. Experience comes at personal cost. There is no heart set at a half measure which could come near to knowing my pleasure of feeling found when accepting a loss. From the litter I am the runt, the middle child with attention to seek. That is how it is in a family full of lame quarrel, where five children do nothing but squabble and vie for the attention and rightful bliss. I escaped this and was thought deaf for years. Not just to Sibling slander or sniping, but phYSically too, which was frightening for a mother no stranger to her tears. I was prodded and tested and they found I could hear very well if I wanted. This acute isolation was granted by a skill of mind, at age five, profound. I speak of an odd age in my journey. I did not know I was sworn as a Witch.

It was of no surprise when Pan came fl Tst to this boy born as a magickal tool, setting his feet on the path as the Fool. Pan had the strength and he gave me the thirst to feel the depths of my tissue and bone, the limits of my intoxication and strength to live through his jubilation in the simple fact that the Earth is our home. This lesson must be the first to be taught and is generally the first forgotten. like most I took his gifts and turned rotten at the core; drunk until I fucked or fought, snorted, smoked, joked or cried at my own sins until 1 prayed my life would not be long. That pure ideal I had of magick, gone. The path painted by writers, a lost thing. Some painted the dream of pure connection while others would speak of the golden Ught. I wanted this and yet I was in a fight with a dwnb drunk full of self rejection. I could not walk on the paths of others, and the church had claimed my older brothers. I had just my mother to ask for proof that this journey led to something sweeter. She would tell this drunk young fool no such thing because life Can be a violent thing. I had to survive. A Uberator born through the hell called up to surround me. I was supposed to meet a point through Pan that opened me up to the truth that can open one's eyes to the way to be free. This was why the Christians called him Satan-they could not see the gifl beneath this ruination he promised on heath, in forest, in glen and city. I talk of Pan, but he was just half of the power at work in this young fool. The other half was too subtle Cloaked to pull me by my hair, to get me drunk and laugh. My name had been given to Her and She waited for the moment to show her card. Believe, the journey to Her is not hard but it can be impossible to see. She is the silhouette seen in a dream that you arrogantly give a face to. She will not come to the cocksure boy-blue whose daily actions make his morals scream. She wants you to know who you are inside and for you to be that in the waking world. She cares not for masks or for gold coins held. From Her eye there is nothing you can hide. But here is the beautiful paradox, because that mask and coin are yours to use and She will hide from those who do not use the gifts at hand to make it through the flock. A witch should be a tool in magick's hand, a tool dual-edged and balanced on a spike. A witch is balancing in a state of nothing sure-where balance itself is the only sure thing you can rely on. When life is like this She is right there with you, smiling behind you as you blunder, a head full of wonder . To reach this stage blows your heart asunder. This is the stage of life we die to find. Pan was first to find me, but by Her choice. His task was to befriend me and he won, then to break me, yet still to love a son that would now care to listen to his voice. He stood for me to see him full of life and while I kept my eyes locked I ignored the books that would soon have made this witch bored of the dream of my magick curing strife. He took my tinted Sight and made me blind, so that I was lost and brimming with doubt. I spun on the spike impaled, unaware that She stood smiling behind. Have you ever been lost for wisdoms sake? Did you spin like a church's weathervane caught in a gale, not to be still again? At the crossroad, which road would you now take? I will teU you that the right road is wrong.

The raven, the darkness, a power greater than 1 could know from any dry text, presented to show the goodness in the dark that light blinded. How ineffectual light had been that day against souls intent on teasing my mind into madness. Light makes us become blind and I remember the lesson to this day.

It may be that my love for the poetic word, for painting and dance, is born of the savagery they spring from. A perpetually exotic land which cannot be traversed by reason, the unmapped Outside the Temple terrain where we are defenceless, where preconceptions and expectations can only hinder us. A land which is always in a ferment of destruction and creation, that which pulses behind the veil filling us with thoughts and desire of itself. A perverse nature led me and lost me there. I do believe that our natures are in a constant state of becoming, that existence is precarious and beautiful, fragile and indestructiblej that one can abandon oneself before the gods do; that one can choose the path one walks, but in looking back see that the way was inevitable.

Outside the Temple Sweat opens the surface of the skin, inviting a metabolic ex­change between inner and outer. The body and mind relax, one is moved more by spirit and the hidden unfathomed depths of one's being than by the mind's games and machinations. End1ess repetition of exercises hones the body; the critical socially­aware mind is numbed and discarded. In butoh training there is no mirror-barrier to impede the natural movements of the body, no narcissistic or self-conscious appraisal of external form. There should be no space for a voice to intercede between impulse and action. The conditioned, tamed, social body is undone through training, and by the application of these principles in daily life with a ruthless and passionate desire.

Kabuki was originally wrillen with the ideographs for song, (lance and prostitute but, under a stimng moral atmosphere, the ideograph for skill stood in for prostitute.
