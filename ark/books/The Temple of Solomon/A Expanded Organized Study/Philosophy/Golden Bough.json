Farewell to NemiPrefaceTHE PRIMARY aim of this book is to explain the remarkable rule which regulated thesuccession to the priesthood of Diana at Aricia. When I first set myself to solve the problemmore than thirty years ago, I thought that the solution could be propounded very briefly,but I soon found that to render it probable or even intelligible it was necessary to discusscertain more general questions, some of which had hardly been broached before. Insuccessive editions the discussion of these and kindred topics has occupied more and morespace, the enquiry has branched out in more and more directions, until the two volumes ofthe original work have expanded into twelve. Meantime a wish has often been expressedthat the book should be issued in a more compendious form. This abridgment is an attemptto meet the wish and thereby to bring the work within the range of a wider circle ofreaders. While the bulk of the book has been greatly reduced, I have endeavoured to retain"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"its leading principles, together with an amount of evidence sufficient to illustrate themclearly. The language of the original has also for the most part been preserved, though hereand there the exposition has been somewhat condensed. In order to keep as much of thetext as possible I have sacrificed all the notes, and with them all exact references to myauthorities. Readers who desire to ascertain the source of any particular statement musttherefore consult the larger work, which is fully documented and provided with a completebibliography.In the abridgment I have neither added new matter nor altered the views expressed in thelast edition; for the evidence which has come to my knowledge in the meantime has on thewhole served either to confirm my former conclusions or to furnish fresh illustrations ofold principles. Thus, for example, on the crucial question of the practice of putting kings todeath either at the end of a fixed period or whenever their health and strength began tofail, the body of evidence which points to the wide prevalence of such a custom has beenconsiderably augmented in the interval. A striking instance of a limited monarchy of thissort is furnished by the powerful mediaeval kingdom of the Khazars in Southern Russia,where the kings were liable to be put to death either on the expiry of a set term orwhenever some public calamity, such as drought, dearth, or defeat in war, seemed toindicate a failure of their natural powers. The evidence for the systematic killing of theKhazar kings, drawn from the accounts of old Arab travellers, has been collected by meelsewhere.[1] Africa, again, has supplied several fresh examples of a similar practice ofregicide. Among them the most notable perhaps is the custom formerly observed inBunyoro of choosing every year from a particular clan a mock king, who was supposed toincarnate the late king, cohabited with his widows at his temple-tomb, and after reigningfor a week was strangled.[2] The custom presents a close parallel to the ancient Babylonianfestival of the Sacaea, at which a mock king was dressed in the royal robes, allowed toenjoy the real king’s concubines, and after reigning for five days was stripped, scourged,and put to death. That festival in its turn has lately received fresh light from certainAssyrian inscriptions,[3] which seem to confirm the interpretation which I formerly gave ofthe festival as a New Year celebration and the parent of the Jewish festival of Purim.[4]Other recently discovered parallels to the priestly kings of Aricia are African priests andkings who used to be put to death at the end of seven or of two years, after being liable inthe interval to be attacked and killed by a strong man, who thereupon succeeded to thepriesthood or the kingdom.[5][1] J.

How far the facts point to an early influence ofAfrica on Italy, or even to the existence of an African population in Southern Europe, I donot presume to say. The pre-historic historic relations between the two continents are stillobscure and still under investigation.Whether the explanation which I have offered of the institution is correct or not must beleft to the future to determine. I shall always be ready to abandon it if a better can besuggested. Meantime in committing the book in its new form to the judgment of the publicI desire to guard against a misapprehension of its scope which appears to be still rife,though I have sought to correct it before now. If in the present work I have dwelt at somelength on the worship of trees, it is not, I trust, because I exaggerate its importance in thehistory of religion, still less because I would deduce from it a whole system of mythology; itis simply because I could not ignore the subject in attempting to explain the significance ofa priest who bore the title of King of the Wood, and one of whose titles to office was theplucking of a bough—the Golden Bough—from a tree in the sacred grove. But I am so farfrom regarding the reverence for trees as of supreme importance for the evolution ofreligion that I consider it to have been altogether subordinate to other factors, and inparticular to the fear of the human dead, which, on the whole, I believe to have beenprobably the most powerful force in the making of primitive religion. I hope that after thisexplicit disclaimer I shall no longer be taxed with embracing a system of mythology which Ilook upon not merely as false but as preposterous and absurd. But I am too familiar withthe hydra of error to expect that by lopping off one of the monster’s heads I can preventanother, or even the same, from sprouting again. I can only trust to the candour andintelligence of my readers to rectify this serious misconception of my views by acomparison with my own express declaration.J. G. FRAZER.1 BRICK COURT, TEMPLE, LONDON,June 1922.I. The King of the Wood1. Diana and VirbiusWHO does not know Turner’s picture of the Golden Bough? The scene, suffused with thegolden glow of imagination in which the divine mind of Turner steeped and transfiguredeven the fairest natural landscape, is a dream-like vision of the little woodland lake ofNemi— “Diana’s Mirror,” as it was called by the ancients. No one who has seen that calmwater, lapped in a green hollow of the Alban hills, can ever forget it. The two characteristic"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Italian villages which slumber on its banks, and the equally Italian palace whose terracedgardens descend steeply to the lake, hardly break the stillness and even the solitariness ofthe scene. Diana herself might still linger by this lonely shore, still haunt these woodlandswild.In antiquity this sylvan landscape was the scene of a strange and recurring tragedy. On thenorthern shore of the lake, right under the precipitous cliffs on which the modern village ofNemi is perched, stood the sacred grove and sanctuary of Diana Nemorensis, or Diana ofthe Wood. The lake and the grove were sometimes known as the lake and grove of Aricia.But the town of Aricia (the modern La Riccia) was situated about three miles off, at thefoot of the Alban Mount, and separated by a steep descent from the lake, which lies in asmall crater-like hollow on the mountain side. In this sacred grove there grew a certain treeround which at any time of the day, and probably far into the night, a grim figure might beseen to prowl. In his hand he carried a drawn sword, and he kept peering warily about himas if at every instant he expected to be set upon by an enemy. He was a priest and amurderer; and the man for whom he looked was sooner or later to murder him and holdthe priesthood in his stead. Such was the rule of the sanctuary. A candidate for thepriesthood could only succeed to office by slaying the priest, and having slain him, heretained office till he was himself slain by a stronger or a craftier.The post which he held by this precarious tenure carried with it the title of king; but surelyno crowned head ever lay uneasier, or was visited by more evil dreams, than his. For yearin, year out, in summer and winter, in fair weather and in foul, he had to keep his lonelywatch, and whenever he snatched a troubled slumber it was at the peril of his life. The leastrelaxation of his vigilance, the smallest abatement of his strength of limb or skill of fence,put him in jeopardy; grey hairs might seal his death-warrant. To gentle and pious pilgrimsat the shrine the sight of him might well seem to darken the fair landscape, as when a cloudsuddenly blots the sun on a bright day. The dreamy blue of Italian skies, the dappled shadeof summer woods, and the sparkle of waves in the sun, can have accorded but ill with thatstern and sinister figure. Rather we picture to ourselves the scene as it may have beenwitnessed by a belated wayfarer on one of those wild autumn nights when the dead leavesare falling thick, and the winds seem to sing the dirge of the dying year. It is a sombrepicture, set to melancholy music—the background of forest showing black and jaggedagainst a lowering and stormy sky, the sighing of the wind in the branches, the rustle of thewithered leaves under foot, the lapping of the cold water on the shore, and in theforeground, pacing to and fro, now in twilight and now in gloom, a dark figure with aglitter of steel at the shoulder whenever the pale moon, riding clear of the cloud-rack, peersdown at him through the matted boughs.The strange rule of this priesthood has no parallel in classical antiquity, and cannot beexplained from it. To find an explanation we must go farther afield. No one will probablydeny that such a custom savours of a barbarous age, and, surviving into imperial times,stands out in striking isolation from the polished Italian society of the day, like a primaevalrock rising from a smooth-shaven lawn. It is the very rudeness and barbarity of the customwhich allow us a hope of explaining it. For recent researches into the early history of manhave revealed the essential similarity with which, under many superficial differences, thehuman mind has elaborated its first crude philosophy of life. Accordingly, if we can show"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"that a barbarous custom, like that of the priesthood of Nemi, has existed elsewhere; if wecan detect the motives which led to its institution; if we can prove that these motives haveoperated widely, perhaps universally, in human society, producing in varied circumstancesa variety of institutions specifically different but generically alike; if we can show, lastly,that these very motives, with some of their derivative institutions, were actually at work inclassical antiquity; then we may fairly infer that at a remoter age the same motives gavebirth to the priesthood of Nemi. Such an inference, in default of direct evidence as to howthe priesthood did actually arise, can never amount to demonstration. But it will be moreor less probable according to the degree of completeness with which it fulfils the conditionsI have indicated. The object of this book is, by meeting these conditions, to offer a fairlyprobable explanation of the priesthood of Nemi.I begin by setting forth the few facts and legends which have come down to us on thesubject. According to one story the worship of Diana at Nemi was instituted by Orestes,who, after killing Thoas, King of the Tauric Chersonese (the Crimea), fled with his sister toItaly, bringing with him the image of the Tauric Diana hidden in a faggot of sticks. Afterhis death his bones were transported from Aricia to Rome and buried in front of the templeof Saturn, on the Capitoline slope, beside the temple of Concord. The bloody ritual whichlegend ascribed to the Tauric Diana is familiar to classical readers; it is said that everystranger who landed on the shore was sacrificed on her altar. But transported to Italy, therite assumed a milder form. Within the sanctuary at Nemi grew a certain tree of which nobranch might be broken. Only a runaway slave was allowed to break off, if he could, one ofits boughs. Success in the attempt entitled him to fight the priest in single combat, and if heslew him he reigned in his stead with the title of King of the Wood (Rex Nemorensis).According to the public opinion of the ancients the fateful branch was that Golden Boughwhich, at the Sibyl’s bidding, Aeneas plucked before he essayed the perilous journey to theworld of the dead. The flight of the slave represented, it was said, the flight of Orestes; hiscombat with the priest was a reminiscence of the human sacrifices once offered to theTauric Diana. This rule of succession by the sword was observed down to imperial times;for amongst his other freaks Caligula, thinking that the priest of Nemi had held office toolong, hired a more stalwart ruffian to slay him; and a Greek traveller, who visited Italy inthe age of the Antonines, remarks that down to his time the priesthood was still the prize ofvictory in a single combat.Of the worship of Diana at Nemi some leading features can still be made out. From thevotive offerings which have been found on the site, it appears that she was conceived ofespecially as a huntress, and further as blessing men and women with offspring, andgranting expectant mothers an easy delivery. Again, fire seems to have played a foremostpart in her ritual. For during her annual festival, held on the thirteenth of August, at thehottest time of the year, her grove shone with a multitude of torches, whose ruddy glarewas reflected by the lake; and throughout the length and breadth of Italy the day was keptwith holy rites at every domestic hearth. Bronze statuettes found in her precinct representthe goddess herself holding a torch in her raised right hand; and women whose prayers hadbeen heard by her came crowned with wreaths and bearing lighted torches to the sanctuaryin fulfilment of their vows. Some one unknown dedicated a perpetually burning lamp in alittle shrine at Nemi for the safety of the Emperor Claudius and his family. The terra-cottalamps which have been discovered in the grove may perhaps have served a like purpose for"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"humbler persons. If so, the analogy of the custom to the Catholic practice of dedicatingholy candles in churches would be obvious. Further, the title of Vesta borne by Diana atNemi points clearly to the maintenance of a perpetual holy fire in her sanctuary. A largecircular basement at the north-east corner of the temple, raised on three steps and bearingtraces of a mosaic pavement, probably supported a round temple of Diana in her characterof Vesta, like the round temple of Vesta in the Roman Forum. Here the sacred fire wouldseem to have been tended by Vestal Virgins, for the head of a Vestal in terra-cotta wasfound on the spot, and the worship of a perpetual fire, cared for by holy maidens, appearsto have been common in Latium from the earliest to the latest times. Further, at the annualfestival of the goddess, hunting dogs were crowned and wild beasts were not molested;young people went through a purificatory ceremony in her honour; wine was broughtforth, and the feast consisted of a kid cakes served piping hot on plates of leaves, and applesstill hanging in clusters on the boughs.But Diana did not reign alone in her grove at Nemi. Two lesser divinities shared her forestsanctuary. One was Egeria, the nymph of the clear water which, bubbling from the basalticrocks, used to fall in graceful cascades into the lake at the place called Le Mole, becausehere were established the mills of the modern village of Nemi. The purling of the stream asit ran over the pebbles is mentioned by Ovid, who tells us that he had often drunk of itswater. Women with child used to sacrifice to Egeria, because she was believed, like Diana,to be able to grant them an easy delivery. Tradition ran that the nymph had been the wifeor mistress of the wise king Numa, that he had consorted with her in the secrecy of thesacred grove, and that the laws which he gave the Romans had been inspired bycommunion with her divinity. Plutarch compares the legend with other tales of the loves ofgoddesses for mortal men, such as the love of Cybele and the Moon for the fair youths Attisand Endymion. According to some, the trysting-place of the lovers was not in the woods ofNemi but in a grove outside the dripping Porta Capena at Rome, where another sacredspring of Egeria gushed from a dark cavern. Every day the Roman Vestals fetched waterfrom this spring to wash the temple of Vesta, carrying it in earthenware pitchers on theirheads. In Juvenal’s time the natural rock had been encased in marble, and the hallowedspot was profaned by gangs of poor Jews, who were suffered to squat, like gypsies, in thegrove. We may suppose that the spring which fell into the lake of Nemi was the trueoriginal Egeria, and that when the first settlers moved down from the Alban hills to thebanks of the Tiber they brought the nymph with them and found a new home for her in agrove outside the gates. The remains of baths which have been discovered within the sacredprecinct, together with many terra-cotta models of various parts of the human body,suggest that the waters of Egeria were used to heal the sick, who may have signified theirhopes or testified their gratitude by dedicating likenesses of the diseased members to thegoddess, in accordance with a custom which is still observed in many parts of Europe. Tothis day it would seem that the spring retains medicinal virtues.The other of the minor deities at Nemi was Virbius. Legend had it that Virbius was theyoung Greek hero Hippolytus, chaste and fair, who learned the art of venery from thecentaur Chiron, and spent all his days in the greenwood chasing wild beasts with the virginhuntress Artemis (the Greek counterpart of Diana) for his only comrade. Proud of herdivine society, he spurned the love of women, and this proved his bane. For Aphrodite,stung by his scorn, inspired his stepmother Phaedra with love of him; and when he"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"disdained her wicked advances she falsely accused him to his father Theseus. The slanderwas believed, and Theseus prayed to his sire Poseidon to avenge the imagined wrong. Sowhile Hippolytus drove in a chariot by the shore of the Saronic Gulf, the sea-god sent afierce bull forth from the waves. The terrified horses bolted, threw Hippolytus from thechariot, and dragged him at their hoofs to death. But Diana, for the love she boreHippolytus, persuaded the leech Aesculapius to bring her fair young hunter back to life byhis simples. Jupiter, indignant that a mortal man should return from the gates of death,thrust down the meddling leech himself to Hades. But Diana hid her favourite from theangry god in a thick cloud, disguised his features by adding years to his life, and then borehim far away to the dells of Nemi, where she entrusted him to the nymph Egeria, to livethere, unknown and solitary, under the name of Virbius, in the depth of the Italian forest.There he reigned a king, and there he dedicated a precinct to Diana. He had a comely son,Virbius, who, undaunted by his father’s fate, drove a team of fiery steeds to join the Latinsin the war against Aeneas and the Trojans. Virbius was worshipped as a god not only atNemi but elsewhere; for in Campania we hear of a special priest devoted to his service.Horses were excluded from the Arician grove and sanctuary because horses had killedHippolytus. It was unlawful to touch his image. Some thought that he was the sun. “But thetruth is,” says Servius, “that he is a deity associated with Diana, as Attis is associated withthe Mother of the Gods, and Erichthonius with Minerva, and Adonis with Venus.” Whatthe nature of that association was we shall enquire presently. Here it is worth observingthat in his long and chequered career this mythical personage has displayed a remarkabletenacity of life. For we can hardly doubt that the Saint Hippolytus of the Roman calendar,who was dragged by horses to death on the thirteenth of August, Diana’s own day, is noother than the Greek hero of the same name, who, after dying twice over as a heathensinner, has been happily resuscitated as a Christian saint.It needs no elaborate demonstration to convince us that the stories told to account forDiana’s worship at Nemi are unhistorical. Clearly they belong to that large class of mythswhich are made up to explain the origin of a religious ritual and have no other foundationthan the resemblance, real or imaginary, which may be traced between it and some foreignritual. The incongruity of these Nemi myths is indeed transparent, since the foundation ofthe worship is traced now to Orestes and now to Hippolytus, according as this or thatfeature of the ritual has to be accounted for. The real value of such tales is that they serveto illustrate the nature of the worship by providing a standard with which to compare it;and further, that they bear witness indirectly to its venerable age by showing that the trueorigin was lost in the mists of a fabulous antiquity. In the latter respect these Nemi legendsare probably more to be trusted than the apparently historical tradition, vouched for byCato the Elder, that the sacred grove was dedicated to Diana by a certain Egerius Baebiusor Laevius of Tusculum, a Latin dictator, on behalf of the peoples of Tusculum, Aricia,Lanuvium, Laurentum, Cora, Tibur, Pometia, and Ardea. This tradition indeed speaks forthe great age of the sanctuary, since it seems to date its foundation sometime before 495B.C., the year in which Pometia was sacked by the Romans and disappears from history.But we cannot suppose that so barbarous a rule as that of the Arician priesthood wasdeliberately instituted by a league of civilised communities, such as the Latin citiesundoubtedly were. It must have been handed down from a time beyond the memory ofman, when Italy was still in a far ruder state than any known to us in the historical period.The credit of the tradition is rather shaken than confirmed by another story which ascribes"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"the foundation of the sanctuary to a certain Manius Egerius, who gave rise to the saying,“There are many Manii at Aricia.” This proverb some explained by alleging that ManiusEgerius was the ancestor of a long and distinguished line, whereas others thought it meantthat there were many ugly and deformed people at Aricia, and they derived the nameManius from Mania, a bogey or bugbear to frighten children. A Roman satirist uses thename Manius as typical of the beggars who lay in wait for pilgrims on the Arician slopes.These differences of opinion, together with the discrepancy between Manius Egerius ofAricia and Egerius Laevius of Tusculum, as well as the resemblance of both names to themythical Egeria, excite our suspicion. Yet the tradition recorded by Cato seems toocircumstantial, and its sponsor too respectable, to allow us to dismiss it as an idle fiction.Rather we may suppose that it refers to some ancient restoration or reconstruction of thesanctuary, which was actually carried out by the confederate states. At any rate it testifiesto a belief that the grove had been from early times a common place of worship for many ofthe oldest cities of the country, if not for the whole Latin confederacy.2. Artemis and HippolytusI HAVE said that the Arician legends of Orestes and Hippolytus, though worthless ashistory, have a certain value in so far as they may help us to understand the worship atNemi better by comparing it with the ritual and myths of other sanctuaries. We must askourselves, Why did the author of these legends pitch upon Orestes and Hippolytus in orderto explain Virbius and the King of the Wood? In regard to Orestes, the answer is obvious.He and the image of the Tauric Diana, which could only be appeased with human blood,were dragged in to render intelligible the murderous rule of succession to the Aricianpriesthood. In regard to Hippolytus the case is not so plain. The manner of his deathsuggests readily enough a reason for the exclusion of horses from the grove; but this byitself seems hardly enough to account for the identification. We must try to probe deeperby examining the worship as well as the legend or myth of Hippolytus.He had a famous sanctuary at his ancestral home of Troezen, situated on that beautiful,almost landlocked bay, where groves of oranges and lemons, with tall cypresses soaring likedark spires above the garden of Hesperides, now clothe the strip of fertile shore at the footof the rugged mountains. Across the blue water of the tranquil bay, which it shelters fromthe open sea, rises Poseidon’s sacred island, its peaks veiled in the sombre green of thepines. On this fair coast Hippolytus was worshipped. Within his sanctuary stood a templewith an ancient image. His service was performed by a priest who held office for life; everyyear a sacrificial festival was held in his honour; and his untimely fate was yearly mourned,with weeping and doleful chants, by unwedded maids. Youths and maidens dedicated locksof their hair in his temple before marriage. His grave existed at Troezen, though the peoplewould not show it. It has been suggested, with great plausibility, that in the handsomeHippolytus, beloved of Artemis, cut off in his youthful prime, and yearly mourned bydamsels, we have one of those mortal lovers of a goddess who appear so often in ancientreligion, and of whom Adonis is the most familiar type. The rivalry of Artemis andPhaedra for the affection of Hippolytus reproduces, it is said, under different names, therivalry of Aphrodite and Proserpine for the love of Adonis, for Phaedra is merely a doubleof Aphrodite. The theory probably does no injustice either to Hippolytus or to Artemis. For"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Artemis was originally a great goddess of fertility, and, on the principles of early religion,she who fertilises nature must herself be fertile, and to be that she must necessarily have amale consort. On this view, Hippolytus was the consort of Artemis at Troezen, and theshorn tresses offered to him by the Troezenian youths and maidens before marriage weredesigned to strengthen his union with the goddess, and so to promote the fruitfulness of theearth, of cattle, and of mankind. It is some confirmation of this view that within theprecinct of Hippolytus at Troezen there were worshipped two female powers named Damiaand Auxesia, whose connexion with the fertility of the ground is unquestionable. WhenEpidaurus suffered from a dearth, the people, in obedience to an oracle, carved images ofDamia and Auxesia out of sacred olive wood, and no sooner had they done so and set themup than the earth bore fruit again. Moreover, at Troezen itself, and apparently within theprecinct of Hippolytus, a curious festival of stone-throwing was held in honour of thesemaidens, as the Troezenians called them; and it is easy to show that similar customs havebeen practised in many lands for the express purpose of ensuring good crops. In the storyof the tragic death of the youthful Hippolytus we may discern an analogy with similar talesof other fair but mortal youths who paid with their lives for the brief rapture of the love ofan immortal goddess. These hapless lovers were probably not always mere myths, and thelegends which traced their spilt blood in the purple bloom of the violet, the scarlet stain ofthe anemone, or the crimson flush of the rose were no idle poetic emblems of youth andbeauty fleeting as the summer flowers. Such fables contain a deeper philosophy of therelation of the life of man to the life of nature—a sad philosophy which gave birth to atragic practice. What that philosophy and that practice were, we shall learn later on.3. RecapitulationWE can now perhaps understand why the ancients identified Hippolytus, the consort ofArtemis, with Virbius, who, according to Servius, stood to Diana as Adonis to Venus, orAttis to the Mother of the Gods. For Diana, like Artemis, was a goddess of fertility ingeneral, and of childbirth in particular. As such she, like her Greek counterpart, needed amale partner. That partner, if Servius is right, was Virbius. In his character of the founderof the sacred grove and first king of Nemi, Virbius is clearly the mythical predecessor orarchetype of the line of priests who served Diana under the title of Kings of the Wood, andwho came, like him, one after the other, to a violent end. It is natural, therefore, toconjecture that they stood to the goddess of the grove in the same relation in which Virbiusstood to her; in short, that the mortal King of the Wood had for his queen the woodlandDiana herself. If the sacred tree which he guarded with his life was supposed, as seemsprobable, to be her special embodiment, her priest may not only have worshipped it as hisgoddess but embraced it as his wife. There is at least nothing absurd in the supposition,since even in the time of Pliny a noble Roman used thus to treat a beautiful beech-tree inanother sacred grove of Diana on the Alban hills. He embraced it, he kissed it, he lay underits shadow, he poured wine on its trunk. Apparently he took the tree for the goddess. Thecustom of physically marrying men and women to trees is still practised in India and otherparts of the East. Why should it not have obtained in ancient Latium?Reviewing the evidence as a whole, we may conclude that the worship of Diana in hersacred grove at Nemi was of great importance and immemorial antiquity; that she was"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"revered as the goddess of woodlands and of wild creatures, probably also of domestic cattleand of the fruits of the earth; that she was believed to bless men and women with offspringand to aid mothers in childbed; that her holy fire, tended by chaste virgins, burnedperpetually in a round temple within the precinct; that associated with her was a water-nymph Egeria who discharged one of Diana’s own functions by succouring women intravail, and who was popularly supposed to have mated with an old Roman king in thesacred grove; further, that Diana of the Wood herself had a male companion Virbius byname, who was to her what Adonis was to Venus, or Attis to Cybele; and, lastly, that thismythical Virbius was represented in historical times by a line of priests known as Kings ofthe Wood, who regularly perished by the swords of their successors, and whose lives werein a manner bound up with a certain tree in the grove, because so long as that tree wasuninjured they were safe from attack.Clearly these conclusions do not of themselves suffice to explain the peculiar rule ofsuccession to the priesthood. But perhaps the survey of a wider field may lead us to thinkthat they contain in germ the solution of the problem. To that wider survey we must nowaddress ourselves. It will be long and laborious, but may possess something of the interestand charm of a voyage of discovery, in which we shall visit many strange foreign lands,with strange foreign peoples, and still stranger customs. The wind is in the shrouds: weshake out our sails to it, and leave the coast of Italy behind us for a time.II. Priestly KingsTHE questions which we have set ourselves to answer are mainly two: first, why hadDiana’s priest at Nemi, the King of the Wood, to slay his predecessor? second, why beforedoing so had he to pluck the branch of a certain tree which the public opinion of theancients identified with Virgil’s Golden Bough?The first point on which we fasten is the priest’s title. Why was he called the King of theWood? Why was his office spoken of as a kingdom?The union of a royal title with priestly duties was common in ancient Italy and Greece. AtRome and in other cities of Latium there was a priest called the Sacrificial King or King ofthe Sacred Rites, and his wife bore the title of Queen of the Sacred Rites. In republicanAthens the second annual magistrate of the state was called the King, and his wife theQueen; the functions of both were religious. Many other Greek democracies had titularkings, whose duties, so far as they are known, seem to have been priestly, and to havecentered round the Common Hearth of the state. Some Greek states had several of thesetitular kings, who held office simultaneously. At Rome the tradition was that the SacrificialKing had been appointed after the abolition of the monarchy in order to offer the sacrificeswhich before had been offered by the kings. A similar view as to the origin of the priestlykings appears to have prevailed in Greece. In itself the opinion is not improbable, and it isborne out by the example of Sparta, almost the only purely Greek state which retained thekingly form of government in historical times. For in Sparta all state sacrifices were offeredby the kings as descendants of the god. One of the two Spartan kings held the priesthood ofZeus Lacedaemon, the other the priesthood of Heavenly Zeus."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"This combination of priestly functions with royal authority is familiar to every one. AsiaMinor, for example, was the seat of various great religious capitals peopled by thousands ofsacred slaves, and ruled by pontiffs who wielded at once temporal and spiritual authority,like the popes of mediaeval Rome. Such priest-ridden cities were Zela and Pessinus.Teutonic kings, again, in the old heathen days seem to have stood in the position, and tohave exercised the powers, of high priests. The Emperors of China offered public sacrifices,the details of which were regulated by the ritual books. The King of Madagascar was high-priest of the realm. At the great festival of the new year, when a bullock was sacrificed forthe good of the kingdom, the king stood over the sacrifice to offer prayer and thanksgiving,while his attendants slaughtered the animal. In the monarchical states which still maintaintheir independence among the Gallas of Eastern Africa, the king sacrifices on the mountaintops and regulates the immolation of human victims; and the dim light of tradition revealsa similar union of temporal and spiritual power, of royal and priestly duties, in the kings ofthat delightful region of Central America whose ancient capital, now buried under the rankgrowth of the tropical forest, is marked by the stately and mysterious ruins of Palenque.When we have said that the ancient kings were commonly priests also, we are far fromhaving exhausted the religious aspect of their office. In those days the divinity that hedges aking was no empty form of speech, but the expression of a sober belief. Kings were revered,in many cases not merely as priests, that is, as intercessors between man and god, but asthemselves gods, able to bestow upon their subjects and worshippers those blessings whichare commonly supposed to be beyond the reach of mortals, and are sought, if at all, only byprayer and sacrifice offered to superhuman and invisible beings. Thus kings are oftenexpected to give rain and sunshine in due season, to make the crops grow, and so on.Strange as this expectation appears to us, it is quite of a piece with early modes of thought.A savage hardly conceives the distinction commonly drawn by more advanced peoplesbetween the natural and the supernatural. To him the world is to a great extent worked bysupernatural agents, that is, by personal beings acting on impulses and motives like hisown, liable like him to be moved by appeals to their pity, their hopes, and their fears. In aworld so conceived he sees no limit to his power of influencing the course of nature to hisown advantage. Prayers, promises, or threats may secure him fine weather and anabundant crop from the gods; and if a god should happen, as he sometimes believes, tobecome incarnate in his own person, then he need appeal to no higher being; he, the savage,possesses in himself all the powers necessary to further his own well-being and that of hisfellow-men.This is one way in which the idea of a man-god is reached. But there is another. Along withthe view of the world as pervaded by spiritual forces, savage man has a different, andprobably still older, conception in which we may detect a germ of the modern notion ofnatural law or the view of nature as a series of events occurring in an invariable orderwithout the intervention of personal agency. The germ of which I speak is involved in thatsympathetic magic, as it may be called, which plays a large part in most systems ofsuperstition. In early society the king is frequently a magician as well as a priest; indeed heappears to have often attained to power by virtue of his supposed proficiency in the blackor white art. Hence in order to understand the evolution of the kingship and the sacredcharacter with which the office has commonly been invested in the eyes of savage orbarbarous peoples, it is essential to have some acquaintance with the principles of magic"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"and to form some conception of the extraordinary hold which that ancient system ofsuperstition has had on the human mind in all ages and all countries. Accordingly Ipropose to consider the subject in some detail.III. Sympathetic Magic1. The Principles of MagicIF we analyse the principles of thought on which magic is based, they will probably befound to resolve themselves into two: first, that like produces like, or that an effectresembles its cause; and, second, that things which have once been in contact with eachother continue to act on each other at a distance after the physical contact has beensevered. The former principle may be called the Law of Similarity, the latter the Law ofContact or Contagion. From the first of these principles, namely the Law of Similarity, themagician infers that he can produce any effect he desires merely by imitating it: from thesecond he infers that whatever he does to a material object will affect equally the personwith whom the object was once in contact, whether it formed part of his body or not.Charms based on the Law of Similarity may be called Homoeopathic or Imitative Magic.Charms based on the Law of Contact or Contagion may be called Contagious Magic. Todenote the first of these branches of magic the term Homoeopathic is perhaps preferable,for the alternative term Imitative or Mimetic suggests, if it does not imply, a consciousagent who imitates, thereby limiting the scope of magic too narrowly. For the sameprinciples which the magician applies in the practice of his art are implicitly believed byhim to regulate the operations of inanimate nature; in other words, he tacitly assumes thatthe Laws of Similarity and Contact are of universal application and are not limited tohuman actions. In short, magic is a spurious system of natural law as well as a fallaciousguide of conduct; it is a false science as well as an abortive art. Regarded as a system ofnatural law, that is, as a statement of the rules which determine the sequence of eventsthroughout the world, it may be called Theoretical Magic: regarded as a set of preceptswhich human beings observe in order to compass their ends, it may be called PracticalMagic. At the same time it is to be borne in mind that the primitive magician knows magiconly on its practical side; he never analyses the mental processes on which his practice isbased, never reflects on the abstract principles involved in his actions. With him, as withthe vast majority of men, logic is implicit, not explicit: he reasons just as he digests his foodin complete ignorance of the intellectual and physiological processes which are essential tothe one operation and to the other. In short, to him magic is always an art, never a science;the very idea of science is lacking in his undeveloped mind. It is for the philosophic studentto trace the train of thought which underlies the magician’s practice; to draw out the fewsimple threads of which the tangled skein is composed; to disengage the abstract principlesfrom their concrete applications; in short, to discern the spurious science behind thebastard art.If my analysis of the magician’s logic is correct, its two great principles turn out to bemerely two different misapplications of the association of ideas. Homoeopathic magic is"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"founded on the association of ideas by similarity: contagious magic is founded on theassociation of ideas by contiguity. Homoeopathic magic commits the mistake of assumingthat things which resemble each other are the same: contagious magic commits the mistakeof assuming that things which have once been in contact with each other are always incontact. But in practice the two branches are often combined; or, to be more exact, whilehomoeopathic or imitative magic may be practised by itself, contagious magic willgenerally be found to involve an application of the homoeopathic or imitative principle.Thus generally stated the two things may be a little difficult to grasp, but they will readilybecome intelligible when they are illustrated by particular examples. Both trains of thoughtare in fact extremely simple and elementary. It could hardly be otherwise, since they arefamiliar in the concrete, though certainly not in the abstract, to the crude intelligence notonly of the savage, but of ignorant and dull-witted people everywhere. Both branches ofmagic, the homoeopathic and the contagious, may conveniently be comprehended underthe general name of Sympathetic Magic, since both assume that things act on each other ata distance through a secret sympathy, the impulse being transmitted from one to the otherby means of what we may conceive as a kind of invisible ether, not unlike that which ispostulated by modern science for a precisely similar purpose, namely, to explain howthings can physically affect each other through a space which appears to be empty.It may be convenient to tabulate as follows the branches of magic according to the laws ofthought which underlie them: Sympathetic Magic (Law of Sympathy) | ------------------------------- |  | Homoeopathic Magic Contagious Magic (Law of Similarity) (Law of Contact)I will now illustrate these two great branches of sympathetic magic by examples, beginningwith homoeopathic magic.2. Homoeopathic or Imitative MagicPERHAPS the most familiar application of the principle that like produces like is theattempt which has been made by many peoples in many ages to injure or destroy an enemyby injuring or destroying an image of him, in the belief that, just as the image suffers, sodoes the man, and that when it perishes he must die. A few instances out of many may begiven to prove at once the wide diffusion of the practice over the world and its remarkablepersistence through the ages. For thousands of years ago it was known to the sorcerers ofancient India, Babylon, and Egypt, as well as of Greece and Rome, and at this day it is stillresorted to by cunning and malignant savages in Australia, Africa, and Scotland. Thus theNorth American Indians, we are told, believe that by drawing the figure of a person insand, ashes, or clay, or by considering any object as his body, and then pricking it with asharp stick or doing it any other injury, they inflict a corresponding injury on the personrepresented. For example, when an Ojebway Indian desires to work evil on any one, he"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"makes a little wooden image of his enemy and runs a needle into its head or heart, or heshoots an arrow into it, believing that wherever the needle pierces or the arrow strikes theimage, his foe will the same instant be seized with a sharp pain in the corresponding part ofhis body; but if he intends to kill the person outright, he burns or buries the puppet,uttering certain magic words as he does so. The Peruvian Indians moulded images of fatmixed with grain to imitate the persons whom they disliked or feared, and then burned theeffigy on the road where the intended victim was to pass. This they called burning his soul.A Malay charm of the same sort is as follows. Take parings of nails, hair, eyebrows, spittle,and so forth of your intended victim, enough to represent every part of his person, and thenmake them up into his likeness with wax from a deserted bees’ comb. Scorch the figureslowly by holding it over a lamp every night for seven nights, and say:“It is not wax that I am scorching,It is the liver, heart, and spleen of So-and-so that I scorch.”After the seventh time burn the figure, and your victim will die. This charm obviouslycombines the principles of homoeopathic and contagious magic; since the image which ismade in the likeness of an enemy contains things which once were in contact with him,namely, his nails, hair, and spittle. Another form of the Malay charm, which resembles theOjebway practice still more closely, is to make a corpse of wax from an empty bees’ comband of the length of a footstep; then pierce the eye of the image, and your enemy is blind;pierce the stomach, and he is sick; pierce the head, and his head aches; pierce the breast,and his breast will suffer. If you would kill him outright, transfix the image from the headdownwards; enshroud it as you would a corpse; pray over it as if you were praying over thedead; then bury it in the middle of a path where your victim will be sure to step over it. Inorder that his blood may not be on your head, you should say:“It is not I who am burying him,It is Gabriel who is burying him.”Thus the guilt of the murder will be laid on the shoulders of the archangel Gabriel, who is agreat deal better able to bear it than you are.If homoeopathic or imitative magic, working by means of images, has commonly beenpractised for the spiteful purpose of putting obnoxious people out of the world, it has also,though far more rarely, been employed with the benevolent intention of helping others intoit. In other words, it has been used to facilitate childbirth and to procure offspring forbarren women. Thus among the Bataks of Sumatra a barren woman, who would become amother, will make a wooden image of a child and hold it in her lap, believing that this willlead to the fulfilment of her wish. In the Babar Archipelago, when a woman desires to have"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"a child, she invites a man who is himself the father of a large family to pray on her behalf toUpulero, the spirit of the sun. A doll is made of red cotton, which the woman clasps in herarms, as if she would suckle it. Then the father of many children takes a fowl and holds itby the legs to the woman’s head, saying, “O Upulero, make use of the fowl; let fall, letdescend a child, I beseech you, I entreat you, let a child fall and descend into my hands andon my lap.” Then he asks the woman, “Has the child come?” and she answers, “Yes, it issucking already.” After that the man holds the fowl on the husband’s head, and mumblessome form of words. Lastly, the bird is killed and laid, together with some betel, on thedomestic place of sacrifice. When the ceremony is over, word goes about in the village thatthe woman has been brought to bed, and her friends come and congratulate her. Here thepretence that a child has been born is a purely magical rite designed to secure, by means ofimitation or mimicry, that a child really shall be born; but an attempt is made to add to theefficacy of the rite by means of prayer and sacrifice. To put it otherwise, magic is here blentwith and reinforced by religion.Among some of the Dyaks of Borneo, when a woman is in hard labour, a wizard is calledin, who essays to facilitate the delivery in a rational manner by manipulating the body ofthe sufferer. Meantime another wizard outside the room exerts himself to attain the sameend by means which we should regard as wholly irrational. He, in fact, pretends to be theexpectant mother; a large stone attached to his stomach by a cloth wrapt round his bodyrepresents the child in the womb, and, following the directions shouted to him by hiscolleague on the real scene of operations, he moves this make-believe baby about on hisbody in exact imitation of the movements of the real baby till the infant is born.The same principle of make-believe, so dear to children, has led other peoples to employ asimulation of birth as a form of adoption, and even as a mode of restoring a supposed deadperson to life. If you pretend to give birth to a boy, or even to a great bearded man who hasnot a drop of your blood in his veins, then, in the eyes of primitive law and philosophy, thatboy or man is really your son to all intents and purposes. Thus Diodorus tells us that whenZeus persuaded his jealous wife Hera to adopt Hercules, the goddess got into bed, andclasping the burly hero to her bosom, pushed him through her robes and let him fall to theground in imitation of a real birth; and the historian adds that in his own day the samemode of adopting children was practised by the barbarians. At the present time it is said tobe still in use in Bulgaria and among the Bosnian Turks. A woman will take a boy whomshe intends to adopt and push or pull him through her clothes; ever afterwards he isregarded as her very son, and inherits the whole property of his adoptive parents. Amongthe Berawans of Sarawak, when a woman desires to adopt a grownup man or woman, agreat many people assemble and have a feast. The adopting mother, seated in public on araised and covered seat, allows the adopted person to crawl from behind between her legs.As soon as he appears in front he is stroked with the sweet-scented blossoms of the arecapalm and tied to a woman. Then the adopting mother and the adopted son or daughter,thus bound together, waddle to the end of the house and back again in front of all thespectators. The tie established between the two by this graphic imitation of childbirth isvery strict; an offence committed against an adopted child is reckoned more heinous thanone committed against a real child. In ancient Greece any man who had been supposederroneously to be dead, and for whom in his absence funeral rites had been performed, wastreated as dead to society till he had gone through the form of being born again. He was"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"passed through a woman’s lap, then washed, dressed in swaddling-clothes, and put out tonurse. Not until this ceremony had been punctually performed might he mix freely withliving folk. In ancient India, under similar circumstances, the supposed dead man had topass the first night after his return in a tub filled with a mixture of fat and water; there hesat with doubled-up fists and without uttering a syllable, like a child in the womb, whileover him were performed all the sacraments that were wont to be celebrated over apregnant woman. Next morning he got out of the tub and went through once more all theother sacraments he had formerly partaken of from his youth up; in particular, he marrieda wife or espoused his old one over again with due solemnity.Another beneficent use of homoeopathic magic is to heal or prevent sickness. The ancientHindoos performed an elaborate ceremony, based on homoeopathic magic, for the cure ofjaundice. Its main drift was to banish the yellow colour to yellow creatures and yellowthings, such as the sun, to which it properly belongs, and to procure for the patient ahealthy red colour from a living, vigorous source, namely, a red bull. With this intention, apriest recited the following spell: “Up to the sun shall go thy heart-ache and thy jaundice:in the colour of the red bull do we envelop thee! We envelop thee in red tints, unto long life.May this person go unscathed and be free of yellow colour! The cows whose divinity isRohini, they who, moreover, are themselves red (rohinih)—in their every form and everystrength we do envelop thee. Into the parrots, into the thrush, do we put thy jaundice, and,furthermore, into the yellow wagtail do we put thy jaundice.” While he uttered thesewords, the priest, in order to infuse the rosy hue of health into the sallow patient, gave himwater to sip which was mixed with the hair of a red bull; he poured water over the animal’sback and made the sick man drink it; he seated him on the skin of a red bull and tied apiece of the skin to him. Then in order to improve his colour by thoroughly eradicating theyellow taint, he proceeded thus. He first daubed him from head to foot with a yellowporridge made of tumeric or curcuma (a yellow plant), set him on a bed, tied three yellowbirds, to wit, a parrot, a thrush, and a yellow wagtail, by means of a yellow string to thefoot of the bed; then pouring water over the patient, he washed off the yellow porridge, andwith it no doubt the jaundice, from him to the birds. After that, by way of giving a finalbloom to his complexion, he took some hairs of a red bull, wrapt them in gold leaf, andglued them to the patient’s skin. The ancients held that if a person suffering from jaundicelooked sharply at a stone-curlew, and the bird looked steadily at him, he was cured of thedisease. “Such is the nature,” says Plutarch, “and such the temperament of the creaturethat it draws out and receives the malady which issues, like a stream, through theeyesight.” So well recognised among birdfanciers was this valuable property of the stone-curlew that when they had one of these birds for sale they kept it carefully covered, lest ajaundiced person should look at it and be cured for nothing. The virtue of the bird lay notin its colour but in its large golden eye, which naturally drew out the yellow jaundice. Plinytells of another, or perhaps the same, bird, to which the Greeks gave their name forjaundice, because if a jaundiced man saw it, the disease left him and slew the bird. Hementions also a stone which was supposed to cure jaundice because its hue resembled thatof a jaundiced skin.One of the great merits of homoeopathic magic is that it enables the cure to be performedon the person of the doctor instead of on that of his victim, who is thus relieved of alltrouble and inconvenience, while he sees his medical man writhe in anguish before him. For"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"example, the peasants of Perche, in France, labour under the impression that a prolongedfit of vomiting is brought about by the patient’s stomach becoming unhooked, as they callit, and so falling down. Accordingly, a practitioner is called in to restore the organ to itsproper place. After hearing the symptoms he at once throws himself into the most horriblecontortions, for the purpose of unhooking his own stomach. Having succeeded in the effort,he next hooks it up again in another series of contortions and grimaces, while the patientexperiences a corresponding relief. Fee five francs. In like manner a Dyak medicine-man,who has been fetched in a case of illness, will lie down and pretend to be dead. He isaccordingly treated like a corpse, is bound up in mats, taken out of the house, anddeposited on the ground. After about an hour the other medicine-men loose the pretendeddead man and bring him to life; and as he recovers, the sick person is supposed to recovertoo. A cure for a tumour, based on the principle of homoeopathic magic, is prescribed byMarcellus of Bordeaux, court physician to Theodosius the First, in his curious work onmedicine. It is as follows. Take a root of vervain, cut it across, and hang one end of it roundthe patient’s neck, and the other in the smoke of the fire. As the vervain dries up in thesmoke, so the tumour will also dry up and disappear. If the patient should afterwardsprove ungrateful to the good physician, the man of skill can avenge himself very easily bythrowing the vervain into water; for as the root absorbs the moisture once more, thetumour will return. The same sapient writer recommends you, if you are troubled withpimples, to watch for a falling star, and then instantly, while the star is still shooting fromthe sky, to wipe the pimples with a cloth or anything that comes to hand. Just as the starfalls from the sky, so the pimples will fall from your body; only you must be very carefulnot to wipe them with your bare hand, or the pimples will be transferred to it.Further, homoeopathic and in general sympathetic magic plays a great part in themeasures taken by the rude hunter or fisherman to secure an abundant supply of food. Onthe principle that like produces like, many things are done by him and his friends indeliberate imitation of the result which he seeks to attain; and, on the other hand, manythings are scrupulously avoided because they bear some more or less fanciful resemblanceto others which would really be disastrous.Nowhere is the theory of sympathetic magic more systematically carried into practice forthe maintenance of the food supply than in the barren regions of Central Australia. Herethe tribes are divided into a number of totem clans, each of which is charged with the dutyof multiplying their totem for the good of the community by means of magical ceremonies.Most of the totems are edible animals and plants, and the general result supposed to beaccomplished by these ceremonies is that of supplying the tribe with food and othernecessaries. Often the rites consist of an imitation of the effect which the people desire toproduce; in other words, their magic is homoeopathic or imitative. Thus among theWarramunga the headman of the white cockatoo totem seeks to multiply white cockatoosby holding an effigy of the bird and mimicking its harsh cry. Among the Arunta the men ofthe witchetty grub totem perform ceremonies for multiplying the grub which the othermembers of the tribe use as food. One of the ceremonies is a pantomime representing thefully-developed insect in the act of emerging from the chrysalis. A long narrow structure ofbranches is set up to imitate the chrysalis case of the grub. In this structure a number ofmen, who have the grub for their totem, sit and sing of the creature in its various stages.Then they shuffle out of it in a squatting posture, and as they do so they sing of the insect"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"emerging from the chrysalis. This is supposed to multiply the numbers of the grubs. Again,in order to multiply emus, which are an important article of food, the men of the emutotem paint on the ground the sacred design of their totem, especially the parts of the emuwhich they like best to eat, namely, the fat and the eggs. Round this painting the men sitand sing. Afterwards performers, wearing head-dresses to represent the long neck andsmall head of the emu, mimic the appearance of the bird as it stands aimlessly peeringabout in all directions.The Indians of British Columbia live largely upon the fish which abound in their seas andrivers. If the fish do not come in due season, and the Indians are hungry, a Nootka wizardwill make an image of a swimming fish and put it into the water in the direction fromwhich the fish generally appear. This ceremony, accompanied by a prayer to the fish tocome, will cause them to arrive at once. The islanders of Torres Straits use models ofdugong and turtles to charm dugong and turtle to their destruction. The Toradjas ofCentral Celebes believe that things of the same sort attract each other by means of theirindwelling spirits or vital ether. Hence they hang up the jawbones of deer and wild pigs intheir houses, in order that the spirits which animate these bones may draw the livingcreatures of the same kind into the path of the hunter. In the island of Nias, when a wildpig has fallen into the pit prepared for it, the animal is taken out and its back is rubbedwith nine fallen leaves, in the belief that this will make nine more wild pigs fall into the pit,just as the nine leaves fell from the tree. In the East Indian islands of Saparoea, Haroekoe,and Noessa Laut, when a fisherman is about to set a trap for fish in the sea, he looks out fora tree, of which the fruit has been much pecked at by birds. From such a tree he cuts astout branch and makes of it the principal post in his fish-trap; for he believes that, just asthe tree lured many birds to its fruit, so the branch cut from that tree will lure many fish tothe trap.The western tribes of British New Guinea employ a charm to aid the hunter in spearingdugong or turtle. A small beetle, which haunts coco-nut trees, is placed in the hole of thespear-haft into which the spear-head fits. This is supposed to make the spear-head stickfast in the dugong or turtle, just as the beetle sticks fast to a man’s skin when it bites him.When a Cambodian hunter has set his nets and taken nothing, he strips himself naked, goessome way off, then strolls up to the net as if he did not see it, lets himself be caught in it,and cries, “Hillo! what’s this? I’m afraid I’m caught.” After that the net is sure to catchgame. A pantomime of the same sort has been acted within the living memory in ourScottish Highlands. The Rev. James Macdonald, now of Reay in Caithness, tells us that inhis boyhood when he was fishing with companions about Loch Aline and they had had nobites for a long time, they used to make a pretence of throwing one of their fellowsoverboard and hauling him out of the water, as if he were a fish; after that the trout orsilloch would begin to nibble, according as the boat was on fresh or salt water. Before aCarrier Indian goes out to snare martens, he sleeps by himself for about ten nights besidethe fire with a little stick pressed down on his neck. This naturally causes the fall-stick ofhis trap to drop down on the neck of the marten. Among the Galelareese, who inhabit adistrict in the northern part of Halmahera, a large island to the west of New Guinea, it is amaxim that when you are loading your gun to go out shooting, you should always put thebullet in your mouth before you insert it in the gun; for by so doing you practically eat thegame that is to be hit by the bullet, which therefore cannot possibly miss the mark. A"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Malay who has baited a trap for crocodiles, and is awaiting results, is careful in eating hiscurry always to begin by swallowing three lumps of rice successively; for this helps the baitto slide more easily down the crocodile’s throat. He is equally scrupulous not to take anybones out of his curry; for, if he did, it seems clear that the sharp-pointed stick on whichthe bait is skewered would similarly work itself loose, and the crocodile would get off withthe bait. Hence in these circumstances it is prudent for the hunter, before he begins hismeal, to get somebody else to take the bones out of his curry, otherwise he may at anymoment have to choose between swallowing a bone and losing the crocodile.This last rule is an instance of the things which the hunter abstains from doing lest, on theprinciple that like produces like, they should spoil his luck. For it is to be observed that thesystem of sympathetic magic is not merely composed of positive precepts; it comprises avery large number of negative precepts, that is, prohibitions. It tells you not merely what todo, but also what to leave undone. The positive precepts are charms: the negative preceptsare taboos. In fact the whole doctrine of taboo, or at all events a large part of it, would seemto be only a special application of sympathetic magic, with its two great laws of similarityand contact. Though these laws are certainly not formulated in so many words nor evenconceived in the abstract by the savage, they are nevertheless implicitly believed by him toregulate the course of nature quite independently of human will. He thinks that if he acts ina certain way, certain consequences will inevitably follow in virtue of one or other of theselaws; and if the consequences of a particular act appear to him likely to prove disagreeableor dangerous, he is naturally careful not to act in that way lest he should incur them. Inother words, he abstains from doing that which, in accordance with his mistaken notions ofcause and effect, he falsely believes would injure him; in short, he subjects himself to ataboo. Thus taboo is so far a negative application of practical magic. Positive magic orsorcery says, “Do this in order that so and so may happen.” Negative magic or taboo says,“Do not do this, lest so and so should happen.” The aim of positive magic or sorcery is toproduce a desired event; the aim of negative magic or taboo is to avoid an undesirable one.But both consequences, the desirable and the undesirable, are supposed to be broughtabout in accordance with the laws of similarity and contact. And just as the desiredconsequence is not really effected by the observance of a magical ceremony, so the dreadedconsequence does not really result from the violation of a taboo. If the supposed evilnecessarily followed a breach of taboo, the taboo would not be a taboo but a precept ofmorality or common sense. It is not a taboo to say, “Do not put your hand in the fire”; it isa rule of common sense, because the forbidden action entails a real, not an imaginary evil.In short, those negative precepts which we call taboo are just as vain and futile as thosepositive precepts which we call sorcery. The two things are merely opposite sides or poles ofone great disastrous fallacy, a mistaken conception of the association of ideas. Of thatfallacy, sorcery is the positive, and taboo the negative pole. If we give the general name ofmagic to the whole erroneous system, both theoretical and practical, then taboo may bedefined as the negative side of practical magic. To put this in tabular form: Magic | ---------------------- | | Theoretical Practical (Magic as a (Magic as a"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"pseudo-science) pseudo-art)  | ----------------- | | Positive Magic Negative Magic or Sorcery or TabooI have made these remarks on taboo and its relations to magic because I am about to givesome instances of taboos observed by hunters, fishermen, and others, and I wished to showthat they fall under the head of Sympathetic Magic, being only particular applications ofthat general theory. Thus, among the Esquimaux boys are forbidden to play cat’s cradle,because if they did so their fingers might in later life become entangled in the harpoon-line.Here the taboo is obviously an application of the law of similarity, which is the basis ofhomoeopathic magic: as the child’s fingers are entangled by the string in playing cat’scradle, so they will be entangled by the harpoonline when he is a man and hunts whales.Again, among the Huzuls of the Carpathian Mountains the wife of a hunter may not spinwhile her husband is eating, or the game will turn and wind like the spindle, and the hunterwill be unable to hit it. Here again the taboo is clearly derived from the law of similarity.So, too, in most parts of ancient Italy women were forbidden by law to spin on thehighroads as they walked, or even to carry their spindles openly, because any such actionwas believed to injure the crops. Probably the notion was that the twirling of the spindlewould twirl the corn-stalks and prevent them from growing straight. So, too, among theAinos of Saghalien a pregnant woman may not spin nor twist ropes for two months beforeher delivery, because they think that if she did so the child’s guts might be entangled likethe thread. For a like reason in Bilaspore, a district of India, when the chief men of avillage meet in council, no one present should twirl a spindle; for they think that if such athing were to happen, the discussion, like the spindle, would move in a circle and never bewound up. In some of the East Indian islands any one who comes to the house of a huntermust walk straight in; he may not loiter at the door, for were he to do so, the game would inlike manner stop in front of the hunter’s snares and then turn back, instead of being caughtin the trap. For a similar reason it is a rule with the Toradjas of Central Celebes that noone may stand or loiter on the ladder of a house where there is a pregnant woman, for suchdelay would retard the birth of the child; and in various parts of Sumatra the womanherself in these circumstances is forbidden to stand at the door or on the top rung of thehouse-ladder under pain of suffering hard labour for her imprudence in neglecting soelementary a precaution. Malays engaged in the search for camphor eat their food dry andtake care not to pound their salt fine. The reason is that the camphor occurs in the form ofsmall grains deposited in the cracks of the trunk of the camphor tree. Accordingly it seemsplain to the Malay that if, while seeking for camphor, he were to eat his salt finely ground,the camphor would be found also in fine grains; whereas by eating his salt coarse heensures that the grains of the camphor will also be large. Camphor hunters in Borneo usethe leathery sheath of the leaf-stalk of the Penang palm as a plate for food, and during thewhole of the expedition they will never wash the plate, for fear that the camphor mightdissolve and disappear from the crevices of the tree. Apparently they think that to washtheir plates would be to wash out the camphor crystals from the trees in which they areimbedded. The chief product of some parts of Laos, a province of Siam, is lac. This is aresinous gum exuded by a red insect on the young branches of trees, to which the little"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"creatures have to be attached by hand. All who engage in the business of gathering the gumabstain from washing themselves and especially from cleansing their heads, lest byremoving the parasites from their hair they should detach the other insects from theboughs. Again, a Blackfoot Indian who has set a trap for eagles, and is watching it, wouldnot eat rosebuds on any account; for he argues that if he did so, and an eagle alighted nearthe trap, the rosebuds in his own stomach would make the bird itch, with the result thatinstead of swallowing the bait the eagle would merely sit and scratch himself. Followingthis train of thought the eagle hunter also refrains from using an awl when he is lookingafter his snares; for surely if he were to scratch with an awl, the eagles would scratch him.The same disastrous consequence would follow if his wives and children at home used anawl while he is out after eagles, and accordingly they are forbidden to handle the tool in hisabsence for fear of putting him in bodily danger.Among the taboos observed by savages none perhaps are more numerous or importantthan the prohibitions to eat certain foods, and of such prohibitions many are demonstrablyderived from the law of similarity and are accordingly examples of negative magic. Just asthe savage eats many animals or plants in order to acquire certain desirable qualities withwhich he believes them to be endowed, so he avoids eating many other animals and plantslest he should acquire certain undesirable qualities with which he believes them to beinfected. In eating the former he practises positive magic; in abstaining from the latter hepractises negative magic. Many examples of such positive magic will meet us later on; hereI will give a few instances of such negative magic or taboo. For example, in Madagascarsoldiers are forbidden to eat a number of foods lest on the principle of homoeopathic magicthey should be tainted by certain dangerous or undesirable properties which are supposedto inhere in these particular viands. Thus they may not taste hedgehog, “as it is feared thatthis animal, from its propensity of coiling up into a ball when alarmed, will impart a timidshrinking disposition to those who partake of it.” Again, no soldier should eat an ox’s knee,lest like an ox he should become weak in the knees and unable to march. Further, thewarrior should be careful to avoid partaking of a cock that has died fighting or anythingthat has been speared to death; and no male animal may on any account be killed in hishouse while he is away at the wars. For it seems obvious that if he were to eat a cock thathad died fighting, he would himself be slain on the field of battle; if he were to partake ofan animal that had been speared, he would be speared himself; if a male animal were killedin his house during his absence, he would himself be killed in like manner and perhaps atthe same instant. Further, the Malagasy soldier must eschew kidneys, because in theMalagasy language the word for kidney is the same as that for “shot”; so shot he wouldcertainly be if he ate a kidney.The reader may have observed that in some of the foregoing examples of taboos themagical influence is supposed to operate at considerable distances; thus among theBlackfeet Indians the wives and children of an eagle hunter are forbidden to use an awlduring his absence, lest the eagles should scratch the distant husband and father; and againno male animal may be killed in the house of a Malagasy soldier while he is away at thewars, lest the killing of the animal should entail the killing of the man. This belief in thesympathetic influence exerted on each other by persons or things at a distance is of theessence of magic. Whatever doubts science may entertain as to the possibility of action at adistance, magic has none; faith in telepathy is one of its first principles. A modern advocate"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"of the influence of mind upon mind at a distance would have no difficulty in convincing asavage; the savage believed in it long ago, and what is more, he acted on his belief with alogical consistency such as his civilised brother in the faith has not yet, so far as I amaware, exhibited in his conduct. For the savage is convinced not only that magicalceremonies affect persons and things afar off, but that the simplest acts of daily life may doso too. Hence on important occasions the behaviour of friends and relations at a distance isoften regulated by a more or less elaborate code of rules, the neglect of which by the one setof persons would, it is supposed, entail misfortune or even death on the absent ones. Inparticular when a party of men are out hunting or fighting, their kinsfolk at home are oftenexpected to do certain things or to abstain from doing certain others, for the sake ofensuring the safety and success of the distant hunters or warriors. I will now give someinstances of this magical telepathy both in its positive and in its negative aspect.In Laos when an elephant hunter is starting for the chase, he warns his wife not to cut herhair or oil her body in his absence; for if she cut her hair the elephant would burst the toils,if she oiled herself it would slip through them. When a Dyak village has turned out to huntwild pigs in the jungle, the people who stay at home may not touch oil or water with theirhands during the absence of their friends; for if they did so, the hunters would all be“butter-fingered” and the prey would slip through their hands.Elephant-hunters in East Africa believe that, if their wives prove unfaithful in theirabsence, this gives the elephant power over his pursuer, who will accordingly be killed orseverely wounded. Hence if a hunter hears of his wife’s misconduct, he abandons the chaseand returns home. If a Wagogo hunter is unsuccessful, or is attacked by a lion, heattributes it to his wife’s misbehaviour at home, and returns to her in great wrath. Whilehe is away hunting, she may not let any one pass behind her or stand in front of her as shesits; and she must lie on her face in bed. The Moxos Indians of Bolivia thought that if ahunter’s wife was unfaithful to him in his absence he would be bitten by a serpent or ajaguar. Accordingly, if such an accident happened to him, it was sure to entail thepunishment, and often the death, of the woman, whether she was innocent or guilty. AnAleutian hunter of sea-otters thinks that he cannot kill a single animal if during his absencefrom home his wife should be unfaithful or his sister unchaste.The Huichol Indians of Mexico treat as a demi-god a species of cactus which throws theeater into a state of ecstasy. The plant does not grow in their country, and has to be fetchedevery year by men who make a journey of forty-three days for the purpose. Meanwhile thewives at home contribute to the safety of their absent husbands by never walking fast,much less running, while the men are on the road. They also do their best to ensure thebenefits which, in the shape of rain, good crops, and so forth, are expected to flow from thesacred mission. With this intention they subject themselves to severe restrictions like thoseimposed upon their husbands. During the whole of the time which elapses till the festival ofthe cactus is held, neither party washes except on certain occasions, and then only withwater brought from the distant country where the holy plant grows. They also fast much,eat no salt, and are bound to strict continence. Any one who breaks this law is punishedwith illness, and, moreover, jeopardises the result which all are striving for. Health, luck,and life are to be gained by gathering the cactus, the gourd of the God of Fire; butinasmuch as the pure fire cannot benefit the impure, men and women must not only remain"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"chaste for the time being, but must also purge themselves from the taint of past sin. Hencefour days after the men have started the women gather and confess to Grandfather Firewith what men they have been in love from childhood till now. They may not omit a singleone, for if they did so the men would not find a single cactus. So to refresh their memorieseach one prepares a string with as many knots as she has had lovers. This she brings to thetemple, and, standing before the fire, she mentions aloud all the men she has scored on herstring, name after name. Having ended her confession, she throws the string into the fire,and when the god has consumed it in his pure flame, her sins are forgiven her and shedeparts in peace. From now on the women are averse even to letting men pass near them.The cactus-seekers themselves make in like manner a clean breast of all their frailties. Forevery peccadillo they tie a knot on a string, and after they have “talked to all the fivewinds” they deliver the rosary of their sins to the leader, who burns it in the fire.Many of the indigenous tribes of Sarawak are firmly persuaded that were the wives tocommit adultery while their husbands are searching for camphor in the jungle, thecamphor obtained by the men would evaporate. Husbands can discover, by certain knots inthe tree, when the wives are unfaithful; and it is said that in former days many womenwere killed by jealous husbands on no better evidence than that of these knots. Further, thewives dare not touch a comb while their husbands are away collecting the camphor; for ifthey did so, the interstices between the fibres of the tree, instead of being filled with theprecious crystals, would be empty like the spaces between the teeth of a comb. In the KeiIslands, to the southwest of New Guinea, as soon as a vessel that is about to sail for adistant port has been launched, the part of the beach on which it lay is covered as speedilyas possible with palm branches, and becomes sacred. No one may thenceforth cross thatspot till the ship comes home. To cross it sooner would cause the vessel to perish. Moreover,all the time that the voyage lasts three or four young girls, specially chosen for the duty, aresupposed to remain in sympathetic connexion with the mariners and to contribute by theirbehaviour to the safety and success of the voyage. On no account, except for the mostnecessary purpose, may they quit the room that has been assigned to them. More than that,so long as the vessel is believed to be at sea they must remain absolutely motionless,crouched on their mats with their hands clasped between their knees. They may not turntheir heads to the left or to the right or make any other movement whatsoever. If they did,it would cause the boat to pitch and toss; and they may not eat any sticky stuff, such as riceboiled in coco-nut milk, for the stickiness of the food would clog the passage of the boatthrough the water. When the sailors are supposed to have reached their destination, thestrictness of these rules is somewhat relaxed; but during the whole time that the voyagelasts the girls are forbidden to eat fish which have sharp bones or stings, such as the sting-ray, lest their friends at sea should be involved in sharp, stinging trouble.Where beliefs like these prevail as to the sympathetic connexion between friends at adistance, we need not wonder that above everything else war, with its stern yet stirringappeal to some of the deepest and tenderest of human emotions, should quicken in theanxious relations left behind a desire to turn the sympathetic bond to the utmost accountfor the benefit of the dear ones who may at any moment be fighting and dying far away.Hence, to secure an end so natural and laudable, friends at home are apt to resort todevices which will strike us as pathetic or ludicrous, according as we consider their objector the means adopted to effect it. Thus in some districts of Borneo, when a Dyak is out"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"head-hunting, his wife or, if he is unmarried, his sister must wear a sword day and night inorder that he may always be thinking of his weapons; and she may not sleep during the daynor go to bed before two in the morning, lest her husband or brother should thereby besurprised in his sleep by an enemy. Among the Sea Dyaks of Banting in Sarawak thewomen strictly observe an elaborate code of rules while the men are away fighting. Some ofthe rules are negative and some are positive, but all alike are based on the principles ofmagical homoeopathy and telepathy. Amongst them are the following. The women mustwake very early in the morning and open the windows as soon as it is light; otherwise theirabsent husbands will oversleep themselves. The women may not oil their hair, or the menwill slip. The women may neither sleep nor doze by day, or the men will be drowsy on themarch. The women must cook and scatter popcorn on the verandah every morning; so willthe men be agile in their movements. The rooms must be kept very tidy, all boxes beingplaced near the walls; for if any one were to stumble over them, the absent husbands wouldfall and be at the mercy of the foe. At every meal a little rice must be left in the pot and putaside; so will the men far away always have something to eat and need never go hungry. Onno account may the women sit at the loom till their legs grow cramped, otherwise theirhusbands will likewise be stiff in their joints and unable to rise up quickly or to run awayfrom the foe. So in order to keep their husbands’ joints supple the women often vary theirlabours at the loom by walking up and down the verandah. Further, they may not cover uptheir faces, or the men would not to be able to find their way through the tall grass orjungle. Again, the women may not sew with a needle, or the men will tread on the sharpspikes set by the enemy in the path. Should a wife prove unfaithful while her husband isaway, he will lose his life in the enemy’s country. Some years ago all these rules and morewere observed by the women of Banting, while their husbands were fighting for the Englishagainst rebels. But alas! these tender precautions availed them little; for many a man,whose faithful wife was keeping watch and ward for him at home, found a soldier’s grave.In the island of Timor, while war is being waged, the high-priest never quits the temple; hisfood is brought to him or cooked inside; day and night he must keep the fire burning, for ifhe were to let it die out, disaster would be fall the warriors and would continue so long asthe hearth was cold. Moreover, he must drink only hot water during the time the army isabsent; for every draught of cold water would damp the spirits of the people, so that theycould not vanquish the enemy. In the Kei Islands, when the warriors have departed, thewomen return indoors and bring out certain baskets containing fruits and stones. Thesefruits and stones they anoint and place on a board, murmuring as they do so, “O lord sun,moon, let the bullets rebound from our husbands, brothers, betrothed, and other relations,just as raindrops rebound from these objects which are smeared with oil.” As soon as thefirst shot is heard, the baskets are put aside, and the women, seizing their fans, rush out ofthe houses. Then, waving their fans in the direction of the enemy, they run through thevillage, while they sing, “O golden fans! let our bullets hit, and those of the enemy miss.” Inthis custom the ceremony of anointing stones, in order that the bullets may recoil from themen like raindrops from the stones, is a piece of pure homoeopathic or imitative magic; butthe prayer to the sun, that he will be pleased to give effect to the charm, is a religious andperhaps later addition. The waving of the fans seems to be a charm to direct the bulletstowards or away from their mark, according as they are discharged from the guns offriends or foes."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"An old historian of Madagascar informs us that “while the men are at the wars, and untiltheir return, the women and girls cease not day and night to dance, and neither lie downnor take food in their own houses. And although they are very voluptuously inclined, theywould not for anything in the world have an intrigue with another man while theirhusband is at the war, believing firmly that if that happened, their husband would be eitherkilled or wounded. They believe that by dancing they impart strength, courage, and goodfortune to their husbands; accordingly during such times they give themselves no rest, andthis custom they observe very religiously.”Among the Tshi-speaking peoples of the Gold Coast the wives of men who are away withthe army paint themselves white, and adorn their persons with beads and charms. On theday when a battle is expected to take place, they run about armed with guns, or stickscarved to look like guns, and taking green paw-paws (fruits shaped somewhat like amelon), they hack them with knives, as if they were chopping off the heads of the foe. Thepantomime is no doubt merely an imitative charm, to enable the men to do to the enemy asthe women do to the paw-paws. In the West African town of Framin, while the Ashanteewar was raging some years ago, Mr. Fitzgerald Marriott saw a dance performed by womenwhose husbands had gone as carriers to the war. They were painted white and worenothing but a short petticoat. At their head was a shrivelled old sorceress in a very shortwhite petticoat, her black hair arranged in a sort of long projecting horn, and her blackface, breasts, arms, and legs profusely adorned with white circles and crescents. All carriedlong white brushes made of buffalo or horse tails, and as they danced they sang, “Ourhusbands have gone to Ashanteeland; may they sweep their enemies off the face of theearth!”Among the Thompson Indians of British Columbia, when the men were on the war-path,the women performed dances at frequent intervals. These dances were believed to ensurethe success of the expedition. The dancers flourished their knives, threw long sharp-pointedsticks forward, or drew sticks with hooked ends repeatedly backward and forward.Throwing the sticks forward was symbolic of piercing or warding off the enemy, anddrawing them back was symbolic of drawing their own men from danger. The hook at theend of the stick was particularly well adapted to serve the purpose of a life-savingapparatus. The women always pointed their weapons towards the enemy’s country. Theypainted their faces red and sang as they danced, and they prayed to the weapons topreserve their husbands and help them to kill many foes. Some had eagle-down stuck onthe points of their sticks. When the dance was over, these weapons were hidden. If awoman whose husband was at the war thought she saw hair or a piece of a scalp on theweapon when she took it out, she knew that her husband had killed an enemy. But if shesaw a stain of blood on it, she knew he was wounded or dead. When the men of the Yukitribe in California were away fighting, the women at home did not sleep; they dancedcontinually in a circle, chanting and waving leafy wands. For they said that if they dancedall the time, their husbands would not grow tired. Among the Haida Indians of the QueenCharlotte Islands, when the men had gone to war, the women at home would get up veryearly in the morning and pretend to make war by falling upon their children and feigningto take them for slaves. This was supposed to help their husbands to go and do likewise. If awife were unfaithful to her husband while he was away on the war-path, he wouldprobably be killed. For ten nights all the women at home lay with their heads towards the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"point of the compass to which the war-canoes had paddled away. Then they changed about,for the warriors were supposed to be coming home across the sea. At Masset the Haidawomen danced and sang war-songs all the time their husbands were away at the wars, andthey had to keep everything about them in a certain order. It was thought that a wife mightkill her husband by not observing these customs. When a band of Carib Indians of theOrinoco had gone on the war-path, their friends left in the village used to calculate asnearly as they could the exact moment when the absent warriors would be advancing toattack the enemy. Then they took two lads, laid them down on a bench, and inflicted a mostsevere scourging on their bare backs. This the youths submitted to without a murmur,supported in their sufferings by the firm conviction, in which they had been bred fromchildhood, that on the constancy and fortitude with which they bore the cruel ordealdepended the valour and success of their comrades in the battle.Among the many beneficent uses to which a mistaken ingenuity has applied the principle ofhomoeopathic or imitative magic, is that of causing trees and plants to bear fruit in dueseason. In Thüringen the man who sows flax carries the seed in a long bag which reachesfrom his shoulders to his knees, and he walks with long strides, so that the bag sways to andfro on his back. It is believed that this will cause the flax to wave in the wind. In the interiorof Sumatra rice is sown by women who, in sowing, let their hair hang loose down theirback, in order that the rice may grow luxuriantly and have long stalks. Similarly, inancient Mexico a festival was held in honour of the goddess of maize, or “the long-hairedmother,” as she was called. It began at the time “when the plant had attained its fullgrowth, and fibres shooting forth from the top of the green ear indicated that the grain wasfully formed. During this festival the women wore their long hair unbound, shaking andtossing it in the dances which were the chief feature in the ceremonial, in order that thetassel of the maize might grow in like profusion, that the grain might be correspondinglylarge and flat, and that the people might have abundance.” In many parts of Europedancing or leaping high in the air are approved homoeopathic modes of making the cropsgrow high. Thus in Franche-Comté they say that you should dance at the Carnival in orderto make the hemp grow tall.The notion that a person can influence a plant homoeopathically by his act or conditioncomes out clearly in a remark made by a Malay woman. Being asked why she stripped theupper part of her body naked in reaping the rice, she explained that she did it to make therice-husks thinner, as she was tired of pounding thick-husked rice. Clearly, she thoughtthat the less clothing she wore the less husk there would be on the rice. The magic virtue ofa pregnant woman to communicate fertility is known to Bavarian and Austrian peasants,who think that if you give the first fruit of a tree to a woman with child to eat, the tree willbring forth abundantly next year. On the other hand, the Baganda believe that a barrenwife infects her husband’s garden with her own sterility and prevents the trees frombearing fruit; hence a childless woman is generally divorced. The Greeks and Romanssacrificed pregnant victims to the goddesses of the corn and of the earth, doubtless in orderthat the earth might teem and the corn swell in the ear. When a Catholic priestremonstrated with the Indians of the Orinoco on allowing their women to sow the fields inthe blazing sun, with infants at their breasts, the men answered, “Father, you don’tunderstand these things, and that is why they vex you. You know that women areaccustomed to bear children, and that we men are not. When the women sow, the stalk of"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"the maize bears two or three ears, the root of the yucca yields two or three basketfuls, andeverything multiplies in proportion. Now why is that? Simply because the women knowhow to bring forth, and know how to make the seed which they sow bring forth also. Letthem sow, then; we men don’t know as much about it as they do.”Thus on the theory of homoeopathic magic a person can influence vegetation either forgood or for evil according to the good or the bad character of his acts or states: forexample, a fruitful woman makes plants fruitful, a barren woman makes them barren.Hence this belief in the noxious and infectious nature of certain personal qualities oraccidents has given rise to a number of prohibitions or rules of avoidance: people abstainfrom doing certain things lest they should homoeopathically infect the fruits of the earthwith their own undesirable state or condition. All such customs of abstention or rules ofavoidance are examples of negative magic or taboo. Thus, for example, arguing from whatmay be called the infectiousness of personal acts or states, the Galelareese say that youought not to shoot with a bow and arrows under a fruit-tree, or the tree will cast its fruiteven as the arrows fall to the ground; and that when you are eating water-melon you oughtnot to mix the pips which you spit out of your mouth with the pips which you have putaside to serve as seed; for if you do, though the pips you spat out may certainly spring upand blossom, yet the blossoms will keep falling off just as the pips fell from your mouth,and thus these pips will never bear fruit. Precisely the same train of thought leads theBavarian peasant to believe that if he allows the graft of a fruit-tree to fall on the ground,the tree that springs from that graft will let its fruit fall untimely. When the Chams ofCochinchina are sowing their dry rice fields and desire that no shower should fall, they eattheir rice dry in order to prevent rain from spoiling the crop.In the foregoing cases a person is supposed to influence vegetation homoeopathically. Heinfects trees or plants with qualities or accidents, good or bad, resembling and derivedfrom his own. But on the principle of homoeopathic magic the influence is mutual: theplant can infect the man just as much as the man can infect the plant. In magic, as I believein physics, action and reaction are equal and opposite. The Cherokee Indians are adepts inpractical botany of the homoeopathic sort. Thus wiry roots of the catgut plant are so toughthat they can almost stop a plowshare in the furrow. Hence Cherokee women wash theirheads with a decoction of the roots to make the hair strong, and Cherokee ball-playerswash themselves with it to toughen their muscles. It is a Galelareese belief that if you eat afruit which has fallen to the ground, you will yourself contract a disposition to stumble andfall; and that if you partake of something which has been forgotten (such as a sweet potatoleft in the pot or a banana in the fire), you will become forgetful. The Galelareese are alsoof opinion that if a woman were to consume two bananas growing from a single head shewould give birth to twins. The Guarani Indians of South America thought that a womanwould become a mother of twins if she ate a double grain of millet. In Vedic times a curiousapplication of this principle supplied a charm by which a banished prince might berestored to his kingdom. He had to eat food cooked on a fire which was fed with woodwhich had grown out of the stump of a tree which had been cut down. The recuperativepower manifested by such a tree would in due course be communicated through the fire tothe food, and so to the prince, who ate the food which was cooked on the fire which was fedwith the wood which grew out of the tree. The Sudanese think that if a house is built of thewood of thorny trees, the life of the people who dwell in that house will likewise be thorny"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"and full of trouble.There is a fruitful branch of homoeopathic magic which works by means of the dead; forjust as the dead can neither see nor hear nor speak, so you may on homoeopathic principlesrender people blind, deaf and dumb by the use of dead men’s bones or anything else that istainted by the infection of death. Thus among the Galelareese, when a young man goes a-wooing at night, he takes a little earth from a grave and strews it on the roof of hissweetheart’s house just above the place where her parents sleep. This, he fancies, willprevent them from waking while he converses with his beloved, since the earth from thegrave will make them sleep as sound as the dead. Burglars in all ages and many lands havebeen patrons of this species of magic, which is very useful to them in the exercise of theirprofession. Thus a South Slavonian housebreaker sometimes begins operations by throwinga dead man’s bone over the house, saying, with pungent sarcasm, “As this bone maywaken, so may these people waken”; after that not a soul in the house can keep his or hereyes open. Similarly, in Java the burglar takes earth from a grave and sprinkles it roundthe house which he intends to rob; this throws the inmates into a deep sleep. With the sameintention a Hindoo will strew ashes from a pyre at the door of the house; Indians of Peruscatter the dust of dead men’s bones; and Ruthenian burglars remove the marrow from ahuman shin-bone, pour tallow into it, and having kindled the tallow, march thrice roundthe house with this candle burning, which causes the inmates to sleep a death-like sleep. Orthe Ruthenian will make a flute out of a human leg-bone and play upon it; whereupon allpersons within hearing are overcome with drowsiness. The Indians of Mexico employed forthis maleficent purpose the left fore-arm of a woman who had died in giving birth to herfirst child; but the arm had to be stolen. With it they beat the ground before they enteredthe house which they designed to plunder; this caused every one in the house to lose allpower of speech and motion; they were as dead, hearing and seeing everything, butperfectly powerless; some of them, however, really slept and even snored. In Europesimilar properties were ascribed to the Hand of Glory, which was the dried and pickledhand of a man who had been hanged. If a candle made of the fat of a malefactor who hadalso died on the gallows was lighted and placed in the Hand of Glory as in a candlestick, itrendered motionless all persons to whom it was presented; they could not stir a finger anymore than if they were dead. Sometimes the dead man’s hand is itself the candle, or ratherbunch of candles, all its withered fingers being set on fire; but should any member of thehousehold be awake, one of the fingers will not kindle. Such nefarious lights can only beextinguished with milk. Often it is prescribed that the thief’s candle should be made of thefinger of a new-born or, still better, unborn child; sometimes it is thought needful that thethief should have one such candle for every person in the house, for if he has one candle toolittle somebody in the house will wake and catch him. Once these tapers begin to burn,there is nothing but milk that will put them out. In the seventeenth century robbers used tomurder pregnant women in order thus to extract candles from their wombs. An ancientGreek robber or burglar thought he could silence and put to flight the fiercest watchdogsby carrying with him a brand plucked from a funeral pyre. Again, Servian and Bulgarianwomen who chafe at the restraints of domestic life will take the copper coins from the eyesof a corpse, wash them in wine or water, and give the liquid to their husbands to drink.After swallowing it, the husband will be as blind to his wife’s peccadilloes as the dead manwas on whose eyes the coins were laid."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Further, animals are often conceived to possess qualities of properties which might beuseful to man, and homoeopathic or imitative magic seeks to communicate these propertiesto human beings in various ways. Thus some Bechuanas wear a ferret as a charm, because,being very tenacious of life, it will make them difficult to kill. Others wear a certain insect,mutilated, but living, for a similar purpose. Yet other Bechuana warriors wear the hair of ahornless ox among their own hair, and the skin of a frog on their mantle, because a frog isslippery, and the ox, having no horns, is hard to catch; so the man who is provided withthese charms believes that he will be as hard to hold as the ox and the frog. Again, it seemsplain that a South African warrior who twists tufts of rat’s hair among his own curly blacklocks will have just as many chances of avoiding the enemy’s spear as the nimble rat has ofavoiding things thrown at it; hence in these regions rats’ hair is in great demand when waris expected. One of the ancient books of India prescribes that when a sacrifice is offered forvictory, the earth out of which the altar is to be made should be taken from a place where aboar has been wallowing, since the strength of the boar will be in that earth. When you areplaying the one-stringed lute, and your fingers are stiff, the thing to do is to catch somelong-legged field spiders and roast them, and then rub your fingers with the ashes; that willmake your fingers as lithe and nimble as the spiders’ legs—at least so think theGalelareese. To bring back a runaway slave an Arab will trace a magic circle on theground, stick a nail in the middle of it, and attach a beetle by a thread to the nail, takingcare that the sex of the beetle is that of the fugitive. As the beetle crawls round and round,it will coil the thread about the nail, thus shortening its tether and drawing nearer to thecentre at every circuit. So by virtue of homoeopathic magic the runaway slave will bedrawn back to his master.Among the western tribes of British New Guinea, a man who has killed a snake will burn itand smear his legs with the ashes when he goes into the forest; for no snake will bite himfor some days afterwards. If a South Slavonian has a mind to pilfer and steal at market, hehas nothing to do but to burn a blind cat, and then throw a pinch of its ashes over theperson with whom he is higgling; after that he can take what he likes from the booth, andthe owner will not be a bit the wiser, having become as blind as the deceased cat with whoseashes he has been sprinkled. The thief may even ask boldly, “Did I pay for it?” and thedeluded huckster will reply, “Why, certainly.” Equally simple and effectual is the expedientadopted by natives of Central Australia who desire to cultivate their beards. They prick thechin all over with a pointed bone, and then stroke it carefully with a magic stick or stone,which represents a kind of rat that has very long whiskers. The virtue of these whiskersnaturally passes into the representative stick or stone, and thence by an easy transition tothe chin, which, consequently, is soon adorned with a rich growth of beard. The ancientGreeks thought that to eat the flesh of the wakeful nightingale would prevent a man fromsleeping; that to smear the eyes of a blear-sighted person with the gall of an eagle wouldgive him the eagle’s vision; and that a raven’s eggs would restore the blackness of the ravento silvery hair. Only the person who adopted this last mode of concealing the ravages oftime had to be most careful to keep his mouth full of oil all the time he applied the eggs tohis venerable locks, else his teeth as well as his hair would be dyed raven black, and noamount of scrubbing and scouring would avail to whiten them again. The hair-restorer wasin fact a shade too powerful, and in applying it you might get more than you bargained for.The Huichol Indians admire the beautiful markings on the backs of serpents. Hence when a"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Huichol woman is about to weave or embroider, her husband catches a large serpent andholds it in a cleft stick, while the woman strokes the reptile with one hand down the wholelength of its back; then she passes the same hand over her forehead and eyes, that she maybe able to work as beautiful patterns in the web as the markings on the back of the serpent.On the principle of homoeopathic magic, inanimate things, as well as plants and animals,may diffuse blessing or bane around them, according to their own intrinsic nature and theskill of the wizard to tap or dam, as the case may be, the stream of weal or woe. InSamaracand women give a baby sugar candy to suck and put glue in the palm of its hand,in order that, when the child grows up, his words may be sweet and precious things maystick to his hands as if they were glued. The Greeks thought that a garment made from thefleece of a sheep that had been torn by a wolf would hurt the wearer, setting up an itch orirritation in his skin. They were also of opinion that if a stone which had been bitten by adog were dropped in wine, it would make all who drank of that wine to fall out amongthemselves. Among the Arabs of Moab a childless woman often borrows the robe of awoman who has had many children, hoping with the robe to acquire the fruitfulness of itsowner. The Caffres of Sofala, in East Africa, had a great dread of being struck withanything hollow, such as a reed or a straw, and greatly preferred being thrashed with agood thick cudgel or an iron bar, even though it hurt very much. For they thought that if aman were beaten with anything hollow, his inside would waste away till he died. In easternseas there is a large shell which the Buginese of Celebes call the “old man” (kadjâwo). OnFridays they turn these “old men” upside down and place them on the thresholds of theirhouses, believing that whoever then steps over the threshold of the house will live to be old.At initiation a Brahman boy is made to tread with his right foot on a stone, while the wordsare repeated, “Tread on this stone; like a stone be firm”; and the same ceremony isperformed, with the same words, by a Brahman bride at her marriage. In Madagascar amode of counteracting the levity of fortune is to bury a stone at the foot of the heavy house-post. The common custom of swearing upon a stone may be based partly on a belief thatthe strength and stability of the stone lend confirmation to an oath. Thus the old Danishhistorian Saxo Grammaticus tells us that “the ancients, when they were to choose a king,were wont to stand on stones planted in the ground, and to proclaim their votes, in order toforeshadow from the steadfastness of the stones that the deed would be lasting.”But while a general magical efficacy may be supposed to reside in all stones by reason oftheir common properties of weight and solidity, special magical virtues are attributed toparticular stones, or kinds of stone, in accordance with their individual or specific qualitiesof shape and colour. For example, the Indians of Peru employed certain stones for theincrease of maize, others for the increase of potatoes, and others again for the increase ofcattle. The stones used to make maize grow were fashioned in the likeness of cobs of maize,and the stones destined to multiply cattle had the shape of sheep.In some parts of Melanesia a like belief prevails that certain sacred stones are endowedwith miraculous powers which correspond in their nature to the shape of the stone. Thus apiece of water-worn coral on the beach often bears a surprising likeness to a bread-fruit.Hence in the Banks Islands a man who finds such a coral will lay it at the root of one of hisbread-fruit trees in the expectation that it will make the tree bear well. If the result answershis expectation, he will then, for a proper remuneration, take stones of less-marked"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"character from other men and let them lie near his, in order to imbue them with the magicvirtue which resides in it. Similarly, a stone with little discs upon it is good to bring inmoney; and if a man found a large stone with a number of small ones under it, like a sowamong her litter, he was sure that to offer money upon it would bring him pigs. In theseand similar cases the Melanesians ascribe the marvellous power, not to the stone itself, butto its indwelling spirit; and sometimes, as we have just seen, a man endeavours topropitiate the spirit by laying down offerings on the stone. But the conception of spirits thatmust be propitiated lies outside the sphere of magic, and within that of religion. Wheresuch a conception is found, as here, in conjunction with purely magical ideas and practices,the latter may generally be assumed to be the original stock on which the religiousconception has been at some later time engrafted. For there are strong grounds forthinking that, in the evolution of thought, magic has preceded religion. But to this point weshall return presently.The ancients set great store on the magical qualities of precious stones; indeed it has beenmaintained, with great show of reason, that such stones were used as amulets long beforethey were worn as mere ornaments. Thus the Greeks gave the name of tree-agate to a stonewhich exhibits tree-like markings, and they thought that if two of these gems were tied tothe horns or necks of oxen at the plough, the crop would be sure to be plentiful. Again, theyrecognised a milkstone which produced an abundant supply of milk in women if only theydrank it dissolved in honey-mead. Milk-stones are used for the same purpose by Greekwomen in Crete and Melos at the present day; in Albania nursing mothers wear the stonesin order to ensure an abundant flow of milk. Again, the Greeks believed in a stone whichcured snake-bites, and hence was named the snake-stone; to test its efficacy you had only togrind the stone to powder and sprinkle the powder on the wound. The wine-colouredamethyst received its name, which means “not drunken,” because it was supposed to keepthe wearer of it sober; and two brothers who desired to live at unity were advised to carrymagnets about with them, which, by drawing the twain together, would clearly preventthem from falling out.The ancient books of the Hindoos lay down a rule that after sunset on his marriage night aman should sit silent with his wife till the stars begin to twinkle in the sky. When the pole-star appears, he should point it out to her, and, addressing the star, say, “Firm art thou; Isee thee, the firm one. Firm be thou with me, O thriving one!” Then, turning to his wife, heshould say, “To me Brihaspati has given thee; obtaining offspring through me, thyhusband, live with me a hundred autumns.” The intention of the ceremony is plainly toguard against the fickleness of fortune and the instability of earthly bliss by the steadfastinfluence of the constant star. It is the wish expressed in Keats’s last sonnet:Bright star! Would I were steadfast as thou art—Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night.Dwellers by the sea cannot fail to be impressed by the sight of its ceaseless ebb and flow,and are apt, on the principles of that rude philosophy of sympathy and resemblance which"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"here engages our attention, to trace a subtle relation, a secret harmony, between its tidesand the life of man, of animals, and of plants. In the flowing tide they see not merely asymbol, but a cause of exuberance, of prosperity, and of life, while in the ebbing tide theydiscern a real agent as well as a melancholy emblem of failure, of weakness, and of death.The Breton peasant fancies that clover sown when the tide is coming in will grow well, butthat if the plant be sown at low water or when the tide is going out, it will never reachmaturity, and that the cows which feed on it will burst. His wife believes that the bestbutter is made when the tide has just turned and is beginning to flow, that milk whichfoams in the churn will go on foaming till the hour of high water is past, and that waterdrawn from the well or milk extracted from the cow while the tide is rising will boil up inthe pot or saucepan and overflow into the fire. According to some of the ancients, the skinsof seals, even after they had been parted from their bodies, remained in secret sympathywith the sea, and were observed to ruffle when the tide was on the ebb. Another ancientbelief, attributed to Aristotle, was that no creature can die except at ebb tide. The belief, ifwe can trust Pliny, was confirmed by experience, so far as regards human beings, on thecoast of France. Philostratus also assures us that at Cadiz dying people never yielded up theghost while the water was high. A like fancy still lingers in some parts of Europe. On theCantabrian coast they think that persons who die of chronic or acute disease expire at themoment when the tide begins to recede. In Portugal, all along the coast of Wales, and onsome parts of the coast of Brittany, a belief is said to prevail that people are born when thetide comes in, and die when it goes out. Dickens attests the existence of the samesuperstition in England. “People can’t die, along the coast,” said Mr. Pegotty, “except whenthe tide’s pretty nigh out. They can’t be born, unless it’s pretty nigh in—not properly borntill flood.” The belief that most deaths happen at ebb tide is said to be held along the eastcoast of England from Northumberland to Kent. Shakespeare must have been familiarwith it, for he makes Falstaff die “even just between twelve and one, e’en at the turning o’the tide.” We meet the belief again on the Pacific coast of North America among theHaidas. Whenever a good Haida is about to die he sees a canoe manned by some of his deadfriends, who come with the tide to bid him welcome to the spirit land. “Come with us now,”they say, “for the tide is about to ebb and we must depart.” At Port Stephens, in New SouthWales, the natives always buried their dead at flood tide, never at ebb, lest the retiringwater should bear the soul of the departed to some distant country.To ensure a long life the Chinese have recourse to certain complicated charms, whichconcentrate in themselves the magical essence emanating, on homoeopathic principles,from times and seasons, from persons and from things. The vehicles employed to transmitthese happy influences are no other than grave-clothes. These are provided by manyChinese in their lifetime, and most people have them cut out and sewn by an unmarriedgirl or a very young woman, wisely calculating that, since such a person is likely to live agreat many years to come, a part of her capacity to live long must surely pass into theclothes, and thus stave off for many years the time when they shall be put to their properuse. Further, the garments are made by preference in a year which has an intercalarymonth; for to the Chinese mind it seems plain that grave-clothes made in a year which isunusually long will possess the capacity of prolonging life in an unusually high degree.Amongst the clothes there is one robe in particular on which special pains have beenlavished to imbue it with this priceless quality. It is a long silken gown of the deepest bluecolour, with the word “longevity” embroidered all over it in thread of gold. To present an"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"aged parent with one of these costly and splendid mantles, known as “longevity garments,”is esteemed by the Chinese an act of filial piety and a delicate mark of attention. As thegarment purports to prolong the life of its owner, he often wears it, especially on festiveoccasions, in order to allow the influence of longevity, created by the many golden letterswith which it is bespangled, to work their full effect upon his person. On his birthday,above all, he hardly ever fails to don it, for in China common sense bids a man lay in alarge stock of vital energy on his birthday, to be expended in the form of health and vigourduring the rest of the year. Attired in the gorgeous pall, and absorbing its blessed influenceat every pore, the happy owner receives complacently the congratulations of friends andrelations, who warmly express their admiration of these magnificent cerements, and of thefilial piety which prompted the children to bestow so beautiful and useful a present on theauthor of their being.Another application of the maxim that like produces like is seen in the Chinese belief thatthe fortunes of a town are deeply affected by its shape, and that they must vary accordingto the character of the thing which that shape most nearly resembles. Thus it is related thatlong ago the town of Tsuen-cheu-fu, the outlines of which are like those of a carp,frequently fell a prey to the depredations of the neighbouring city of Yung-chun, which isshaped like a fishing-net, until the inhabitants of the former town conceived the plan oferecting two tall pagodas in their midst. These pagodas, which still tower above the city ofTsuen-cheu-fu, have ever since exercised the happiest influence over its destiny byintercepting the imaginary net before it could descend and entangle in its meshes theimaginary carp. Some forty years ago the wise men of Shanghai were much exercised todiscover the cause of a local rebellion. On careful enquiry they ascertained that therebellion was due to the shape of a large new temple which had most unfortunately beenbuilt in the shape of a tortoise, an animal of the very worst character. The difficulty wasserious, the danger was pressing; for to pull down the temple would have been impious,and to let it stand as it was would be to court a succession of similar or worse disasters.However, the genius of the local professors of geomancy, rising to the occasion,triumphantly surmounted the difficulty and obviated the danger. By filling up two wells,which represented the eyes of the tortoise, they at once blinded that disreputable animaland rendered him incapable of doing further mischief.Sometimes homoeopathic or imitative magic is called in to annul an evil omen byaccomplishing it in mimicry. The effect is to circumvent destiny by substituting a mockcalamity for a real one. In Madagascar this mode of cheating the fates is reduced to aregular system. Here every man’s fortune is determined by the day or hour of his birth,and if that happens to be an unlucky one his fate is sealed, unless the mischief can beextracted, as the phrase goes, by means of a substitute. The ways of extracting the mischiefare various. For example, if a man is born on the first day of the second month (February),his house will be burnt down when he comes of age. To take time by the forelock and avoidthis catastrophe, the friends of the infant will set up a shed in a field or in the cattle-foldand burn it. If the ceremony is to be really effective, the child and his mother should beplaced in the shed and only plucked, like brands, from the burning hut before it is too late.Again, dripping November is the month of tears, and he who is born in it is born to sorrow.But in order to disperse the clouds that thus gather over his future, he has nothing to dobut to take the lid off a boiling pot and wave it about. The drops that fall from it will"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"accomplish his destiny and so prevent the tears from trickling from his eyes. Again, if fatehas decreed that a young girl, still unwed, should see her children, still unborn, descendbefore her with sorrow to the grave, she can avert the calamity as follows. She kills agrasshopper, wraps it in a rag to represent a shroud, and mourns over it like Rachelweeping for her children and refusing to be comforted. Moreover, she takes a dozen ormore other grasshoppers, and having removed some of their superfluous legs and wingsshe lays them about their dead and shrouded fellow. The buzz of the tortured insects andthe agitated motions of their mutilated limbs represent the shrieks and contortions of themourners at a funeral. After burying the deceased grasshopper she leaves the rest tocontinue their mourning till death releases them from their pain; and having bound up herdishevelled hair she retires from the grave with the step and carriage of a person plungedin grief. Thenceforth she looks cheerfully forward to seeing her children survive her; for itcannot be that she should mourn and bury them twice over. Once more, if fortune hasfrowned on a man at his birth and penury has marked him for her own, he can easily erasethe mark in question by purchasing a couple of cheap pearls, price three halfpence, andburying them. For who but the rich of this world can thus afford to fling pearls away?3. Contagious MagicTHUS far we have been considering chiefly that branch of sympathetic magic which maybe called homoeopathic or imitative. Its leading principle, as we have seen, is that likeproduces like, or, in other words, that an effect resembles its cause. The other great branchof sympathetic magic, which I have called Contagious Magic, proceeds upon the notion thatthings which have once been conjoined must remain ever afterwards, even when quitedissevered from each other, in such a sympathetic relation that whatever is done to the onemust similarly affect the other. Thus the logical basis of Contagious Magic, like that ofHomoeopathic Magic, is a mistaken association of ideas; its physical basis, if we may speakof such a thing, like the physical basis of Homoeopathic Magic, is a material medium ofsome sort which, like the ether of modern physics, is assumed to unite distant objects and toconvey impressions from one to the other. The most familiar example of Contagious Magicis the magical sympathy which is supposed to exist between a man and any severed portionof his person, as his hair or nails; so that whoever gets possession of human hair or nailsmay work his will, at any distance, upon the person from whom they were cut. Thissuperstition is world-wide; instances of it in regard to hair and nails will be noticed later onin this work.Among the Australian tribes it was a common practice to knock out one or more of a boy’sfront teeth at those ceremonies of initiation to which every male member had to submitbefore he could enjoy the rights and privileges of a full-grown man. The reason of thepractice is obscure; all that concerns us here is the belief that a sympathetic relationcontinued to exist between the lad and his teeth after the latter had been extracted from hisgums. Thus among some of the tribes about the river Darling, in New South Wales, theextracted tooth was placed under the bark of a tree near a river or water-hole; if the barkgrew over the tooth, or if the tooth fell into the water, all was well; but if it were exposedand the ants ran over it, the natives believed that the boy would suffer from a disease of themouth. Among the Murring and other tribes of New South Wales the extracted tooth was"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"at first taken care of by an old man, and then passed from one headman to another, until ithad gone all round the community, when it came back to the lad’s father, and finally to thelad himself. But however it was thus conveyed from hand to hand, it might on no accountbe placed in a bag containing magical substances, for to do so would, they believed, put theowner of the tooth in great danger. The late Dr. Howitt once acted as custodian of the teethwhich had been extracted from some novices at a ceremony of initiation, and the old menearnestly besought him not to carry them in a bag in which they knew that he had somequartz crystals. They declared that if he did so the magic of the crystals would pass into theteeth, and so injure the boys. Nearly a year after Dr. Howitt’s return from the ceremony hewas visited by one of the principal men of the Murring tribe, who had travelled some twohundred and fifty miles from his home to fetch back the teeth. This man explained that hehad been sent for them because one of the boys had fallen into ill health, and it was believedthat the teeth had received some injury which had affected him. He was assured that theteeth had been kept in a box apart from any substances, like quartz crystals, which couldinfluence them; and he returned home bearing the teeth with him carefully wrapt up andconcealed.The Basutos are careful to conceal their extracted teeth, lest these should fall into the handsof certain mythical beings who haunt graves, and who could harm the owner of the toothby working magic on it. In Sussex some fifty years ago a maid-servant remonstratedstrongly against the throwing away of children’s cast teeth, affirming that should they befound and gnawed by any animal, the child’s new tooth would be, for all the world, like theteeth of the animal that had bitten the old one. In proof of this she named old MasterSimmons, who had a very large pig’s tooth in his upper jaw, a personal defect that healways averred was caused by his mother, who threw away one of his cast teeth by accidentinto the hog’s trough. A similar belief has led to practices intended, on the principles ofhomoeopathic magic, to replace old teeth by new and better ones. Thus in many parts ofthe world it is customary to put extracted teeth in some place where they will be found by amouse or a rat, in the hope that, through the sympathy which continues to subsist betweenthem and their former owner, his other teeth may acquire the same firmness and excellenceas the teeth of these rodents. For example, in Germany it is said to be an almost universalmaxim among the people that when you have had a tooth taken out you should insert it in amouse’s hole. To do so with a child’s milk-tooth which has fallen out will prevent the childfrom having toothache. Or you should go behind the stove and throw your toothbackwards over your head, saying “Mouse, give me your iron tooth; I will give you mybone tooth.” After that your other teeth will remain good. Far away from Europe, atRaratonga, in the Pacific, when a child’s tooth was extracted, the following prayer used tobe recited:“Big rat! Little rat!Here is my old tooth.Pray give me a new one.”"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Then the tooth was thrown on the thatch of the house, because rats make their nests in thedecayed thatch. The reason assigned for invoking the rats on these occasions was that rats’teeth were the strongest known to the natives.Other parts which are commonly believed to remain in a sympathetic union with the body,after the physical connexion has been severed, are the navel-string and the afterbirth,including the placenta. So intimate, indeed, is the union conceived to be, that the fortunesof the individual for good or evil throughout life are often supposed to be bound up withone or other of these portions of his person, so that if his navel-string or afterbirth ispreserved and properly treated, he will be prosperous; whereas if it be injured or lost, hewill suffer accordingly. Thus certain tribes of Western Australia believe that a man swimswell or ill, according as his mother at his birth threw the navel-string into water or not.Among the natives on the Pennefather River in Queensland it is believed that a part of thechild’s spirit (cho-i) stays in the afterbirth. Hence the grandmother takes the afterbirthaway and buries it in the sand. She marks the spot by a number of twigs which she sticks inthe ground in a circle, tying their tops together so that the structure resembles a cone.When Anjea, the being who causes conception in women by putting mud babies into theirwombs, comes along and sees the place, he takes out the spirit and carries it away to one ofhis haunts, such as a tree, a hole in a rock, or a lagoon where it may remain for years. Butsometime or other he will put the spirit again into a baby, and it will be born once moreinto the world. In Ponape, one of the Caroline Islands, the navel-string is placed in a shelland then disposed of in such a way as shall best adapt the child for the career which theparents have chosen for him; for example, if they wish to make him a good climber, theywill hang the navel-string on a tree. The Kei islanders regard the navel-string as thebrother or sister of the child, according to the sex of the infant. They put it in a pot withashes, and set it in the branches of a tree, that it may keep a watchful eye on the fortunes ofits comrade. Among the Bataks of Sumatra, as among many other peoples of the IndianArchipelago, the placenta passes for the child’s younger brother or sister, the sex beingdetermined by the sex of the child, and it is buried under the house. According to theBataks it is bound up with the child’s welfare, and seems, in fact, to be the seat of thetransferable soul, of which we shall hear something later on. The Karo Bataks even affirmthat of a man’s two souls it is the true soul that lives with the placenta under the house;that is the soul, they say, which begets children.The Baganda believe that every person is born with a double, and this double they identifywith the afterbirth, which they regard as a second child. The mother buries the afterbirthat the root of a plantain tree, which then becomes sacred until the fruit has ripened, when itis plucked to furnish a sacred feast for the family. Among the Cherokees the navel-string ofa girl is buried under a corn-mortar, in order that the girl may grow up to be a good baker;but the navel-string of a boy is hung up on a tree in the woods, in order that he may be ahunter. The Incas of Peru preserved the navel-string with the greatest care, and gave it tothe child to suck whenever it fell ill. In ancient Mexico they used to give a boy’s navel-stringto soldiers, to be buried by them on a field of battle, in order that the boy might thusacquire a passion for war. But the navel-string of a girl was buried beside the domestichearth, because this was believed to inspire her with a love of home and taste for cookingand baking."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Even in Europe many people still believe that a person’s destiny is more or less bound upwith that of his navel-string or afterbirth. Thus in Rhenish Bavaria the navel-string is keptfor a while wrapt up in a piece of old linen, and then cut or pricked to pieces according asthe child is a boy or a girl, in order that he or she may grow up to be a skilful workman ora good sempstress. In Berlin the midwife commonly delivers the dried navel-string to thefather with a strict injunction to preserve it carefully, for so long as it is kept the child willlive and thrive and be free from sickness. In Beauce and Perche the people are careful tothrow the navel-string neither into water nor into fire, believing that if that were done thechild would be drowned or burned.Thus in many parts of the world the navel-string, or more commonly the afterbirth, isregarded as a living being, the brother or sister of the infant, or as the material object inwhich the guardian spirit of the child or part of its soul resides. Further, the sympatheticconnexion supposed to exist between a person and his afterbirth or navel-string comes outvery clearly in the widespread custom of treating the afterbirth or navel-string in wayswhich are supposed to influence for life the character and career of the person, makinghim, if it is a man, a nimble climber, a strong swimmer, a skilful hunter, or a brave soldier,and making her, if it is a woman, a cunning sempstress, a good baker, and so forth. Thusthe beliefs and usages concerned with the afterbirth or placenta, and to a less extent withthe navel-string, present a remarkable parallel to the widespread doctrine of thetransferable or external soul and the customs founded on it. Hence it is hardly rash toconjecture that the resemblance is no mere chance coincidence, but that in the afterbirth orplacenta we have a physical basis (not necessarily the only one) for the theory and practiceof the external soul. The consideration of that subject is reserved for a later part of thiswork.A curious application of the doctrine of contagious magic is the relation commonly believedto exist between a wounded man and the agent of the wound, so that whatever issubsequently done by or to the agent must correspondingly affect the patient either forgood or evil. Thus Pliny tells us that if you have wounded a man and are sorry for it, youhave only to spit on the hand that gave the wound, and the pain of the sufferer will beinstantly alleviated. In Melanesia, if a man’s friends get possession of the arrow whichwounded him, they keep it in a damp place or in cool leaves, for then the inflammation willbe trifling and will soon subside. Meantime the enemy who shot the arrow is hard at workto aggravate the wound by all the means in his power. For this purpose he and his friendsdrink hot and burning juices and chew irritating leaves, for this will clearly inflame andirritate the wound. Further, they keep the bow near the fire to make the wound which ithas inflicted hot; and for the same reason they put the arrow-head, if it has been recovered,into the fire. Moreover, they are careful to keep the bow-string taut and to twang itoccasionally, for this will cause the wounded man to suffer from tension of the nerves andspasms of tetanus. “It is constantly received and avouched,” says Bacon, “that theanointing of the weapon that maketh the wound will heal the wound itself. In thisexperiment, upon the relation of men of credit (though myself, as yet, am not fully inclinedto believe it), you shall note the points following: first, the ointment wherewith this is doneis made of divers ingredients, whereof the strangest and hardest to come by are the mossupon the skull of a dead man unburied, and the fats of a boar and a bear killed in the act ofgeneration.” The precious ointment compounded out of these and other ingredients was"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"applied, as the philosopher explains, not to the wound but to the weapon, and that eventhough the injured man was at a great distance and knew nothing about it. Theexperiment, he tells us, had been tried of wiping the ointment off the weapon without theknowledge of the person hurt, with the result that he was presently in a great rage of painuntil the weapon was anointed again. Moreover, “it is affirmed that if you cannot get theweapon, yet if you put an instrument of iron or wood resembling the weapon into thewound, whereby it bleedeth, the anointing of that instrument will serve and work theeffect.” Remedies of the sort which Bacon deemed worthy of his attention are still in voguein the eastern counties of England. Thus in Suffolk if a man cuts himself with a bill-hook ora scythe he always takes care to keep the weapon bright, and oils it to prevent the woundfrom festering. If he runs a thorn or, as he calls it, a bush into his hand, he oils or greasesthe extracted thorn. A man came to a doctor with an inflamed hand, having run a thorninto it while he was hedging. On being told that the hand was festering, he remarked, “Thatdidn’t ought to, for I greased the bush well after I pulled it out.” If a horse wounds its footby treading on a nail, a Suffolk groom will invariably preserve the nail, clean it, and greaseit every day, to prevent the foot from festering. Similarly Cambridgeshire labourers thinkthat if a horse has run a nail into its foot, it is necessary to grease the nail with lard or oiland put it away in some safe place, or the horse will not recover. A few years ago aveterinary surgeon was sent for to attend a horse which had ripped its side open on thehinge of a farm gatepost. On arriving at the farm he found that nothing had been done forthe wounded horse, but that a man was busy trying to pry the hinge out of the gatepost inorder that it might be greased and put away, which, in the opinion of the Cambridgewiseacres, would conduce to the recovery of the animal. Similarly Essex rustics opine that,if a man has been stabbed with a knife, it is essential to his recovery that the knife shouldbe greased and laid across the bed on which the sufferer is lying. So in Bavaria you aredirected to anoint a linen rag with grease and tie it on the edge of the axe that cut you,taking care to keep the sharp edge upwards. As the grease on the axe dries, your woundheals. Similarly in the Harz Mountains they say that if you cut yourself, you ought to smearthe knife or the scissors with fat and put the instrument away in a dry place in the name ofthe Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. As the knife dries, the wound heals. Otherpeople, however, in Germany say that you should stick the knife in some damp place in theground, and that your hurt will heal as the knife rusts. Others again, in Bavaria,recommend you to smear the axe or whatever it is with blood and put it under the eaves.The train of reasoning which thus commends itself to English and German rustics, incommon with the savages of Melanesia and America, is carried a step further by theaborigines of Central Australia, who conceive that under certain circumstances the nearrelations of a wounded man must grease themselves, restrict their diet, and regulate theirbehaviour in other ways in order to ensure his recovery. Thus when a lad has beencircumcised and the wound is not yet healed, his mother may not eat opossum, or a certainkind of lizard, or carpet snake, or any kind of fat, for otherwise she would retard thehealing of the boy’s wound. Every day she greases her digging-sticks and never lets themout of her sight; at night she sleeps with them close to her head. No one is allowed to touchthem. Every day also she rubs her body all over with grease, as in some way this is believedto help her son’s recovery. Another refinement of the same principle is due to the ingenuityof the German peasant. It is said that when one of his pigs or sheep breaks its leg, a farmerof Rhenish Bavaria or Hesse will bind up the leg of a chair with bandages and splints in"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"due form. For some days thereafter no one may sit on that chair, move it, or knock upagainst it; for to do so would pain the injured pig or sheep and hinder the cure. In this lastcase it is clear that we have passed wholly out of the region of contagious magic and intothe region of homoeopathic or imitative magic; the chair-leg, which is treated instead of thebeast’s leg, in no sense belongs to the animal, and the application of bandages to it is a meresimulation of the treatment which a more rational surgery would bestow on the realpatient.The sympathetic connexion supposed to exist between a man and the weapon which haswounded him is probably founded on the notion that the blood on the weapon continues tofeel with the blood in his body. For a like reason the Papuans of Tumleo, an island off NewGuinea, are careful to throw into the sea the bloody bandages with which their woundshave been dressed, for they fear that if these rags fell into the hands of an enemy he mightinjure them magically thereby. Once when a man with a wound in his mouth, which bledconstantly, came to the missionaries to be treated, his faithful wife took great pains tocollect all the blood and cast it into the sea. Strained and unnatural as this idea may seemto us, it is perhaps less so than the belief that magic sympathy is maintained between aperson and his clothes, so that whatever is done to the clothes will be felt by the manhimself, even though he may be far away at the time. In the Wotjobaluk tribe of Victoria awizard would sometimes get hold of a man’s opossum rug and roast it slowly in the fire,and as he did so the owner of the rug would fall sick. If the wizard consented to undo thecharm, he would give the rug back to the sick man’s friends, bidding them put it in water,“so as to wash the fire out.” When that happened, the sufferer would feel a refreshingcoolness and probably recover. In Tanna, one of the New Hebrides, a man who had agrudge at another and desired his death would try to get possession of a cloth which hadtouched the sweat of his enemy’s body. If he succeeded, he rubbed the cloth carefully overwith the leaves and twigs of a certain tree, rolled and bound cloth, twigs, and leaves into along sausage-shaped bundle, and burned it slowly in the fire. As the bundle was consumed,the victim fell ill, and when it was reduced to ashes, he died. In this last form ofenchantment, however, the magical sympathy may be supposed to exist not so muchbetween the man and the cloth as between the man and the sweat which issued from hisbody. But in other cases of the same sort it seems that the garment by itself is enough togive the sorcerer a hold upon his victim. The witch in Theocritus, while she melted animage or lump of wax in order that her faithless lover might melt with love of her, did notforget to throw into the fire a shred of his cloak which he had dropped in her house. InPrussia they say that if you cannot catch a thief, the next best thing you can do is to gethold of a garment which he may have shed in his flight; for if you beat it soundly, the thiefwill fall sick. This belief is firmly rooted in the popular mind. Some eighty or ninety yearsago, in the neighbourhood of Berend, a man was detected trying to steal honey, and fled,leaving his coat behind him. When he heard that the enraged owner of the honey wasmauling his lost coat, he was so alarmed that he took to his bed and died.Again, magic may be wrought on a man sympathetically, not only through his clothes andsevered parts of himself, but also through the impressions left by his body in sand or earth.In particular, it is a world-wide superstition that by injuring footprints you injure the feetthat made them. Thus the natives of South-eastern Australia think that they can lame aman by placing sharp pieces of quartz, glass, bone, or charcoal in his footprints. Rheumatic"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"pains are often attributed by them to this cause. Seeing a Tatungolung man very lame, Mr.Howitt asked him what was the matter. He said, “some fellow has put bottle in my foot.” Hewas suffering from rheumatism, but believed that an enemy had found his foot-track andhad buried it in a piece of broken bottle, the magical influence of which had entered hisfoot.Similar practices prevail in various parts of Europe. Thus in Mecklenburg it is thoughtthat if you drive a nail into a man’s footprint he will fall lame; sometimes it is required thatthe nail should be taken from a coffin. A like mode of injuring an enemy is resorted to insome parts of France. It is said that there was an old woman who used to frequent Stow inSuffolk, and she was a witch. If, while she walked, any one went after her and stuck a nailor a knife into her footprint in the dust, the dame could not stir a step till it was withdrawn.Among the South Slavs a girl will dig up the earth from the footprints of the man she lovesand put it in a flower-pot. Then she plants in the pot a marigold, a flower that is thought tobe fadeless. And as its golden blossom grows and blooms and never fades, so shall hersweetheart’s love grow and bloom, and never, never fade. Thus the love-spell acts on theman through the earth he trod on. An old Danish mode of concluding a treaty was based onthe same idea of the sympathetic connexion between a man and his footprints: thecovenanting parties sprinkled each other’s footprints with their own blood, thus giving apledge of fidelity. In ancient Greece superstitions of the same sort seem to have beencurrent, for it was thought that if a horse stepped on the track of a wolf he was seized withnumbness; and a maxim ascribed to Pythagoras forbade people to pierce a man’sfootprints with a nail or a knife.The same superstition is turned to account by hunters in many parts of the world for thepurpose of running down the game. Thus a German huntsman will stick a nail taken froma coffin into the fresh spoor of the quarry, believing that this will hinder the animal fromescaping. The aborigines of Victoria put hot embers in the tracks of the animals they werepursuing. Hottentot hunters throw into the air a handful of sand taken from the footprintsof the game, believing that this will bring the animal down. Thompson Indians used to laycharms on the tracks of wounded deer; after that they deemed it superfluous to pursue theanimal any further that day, for being thus charmed it could not travel far and would soondie. Similarly, Ojebway Indians placed “medicine” on the track of the first deer or bearthey met with, supposing that this would soon bring the animal into sight, even if it weretwo or three days’ journey off; for this charm had power to compress a journey of severaldays into a few hours. Ewe hunters of West Africa stab the footprints of game with a sharp-pointed stick in order to maim the quarry and allow them to come up with it.But though the footprint is the most obvious it is not the only impression made by the bodythrough which magic may be wrought on a man. The aborigines of South-eastern Australiabelieve that a man may be injured by burying sharp fragments of quartz, glass, and soforth in the mark made by his reclining body; the magical virtue of these sharp thingsenters his body and causes those acute pains which the ignorant European puts down torheumatism. We can now understand why it was a maxim with the Pythagoreans that inrising from bed you should smooth away the impression left by your body on the bed-clothes. The rule was simply an old precaution against magic, forming part of a whole codeof superstitious maxims which antiquity fathered on Pythagoras, though doubtless they"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"were familiar to the barbarous forefathers of the Greeks long before the time of thatphilosopher.4. The Magician’s ProgressWE have now concluded our examination of the general principles of sympathetic magic.The examples by which I have illustrated them have been drawn for the most part fromwhat may be called private magic, that is from magical rites and incantations practised forthe benefit or the injury of individuals. But in savage society there is commonly to be foundin addition what we may call public magic, that is, sorcery practised for the benefit of thewhole community. Wherever ceremonies of this sort are observed for the common good, itis obvious that the magician ceases to be merely a private practitioner and becomes to someextent a public functionary. The development of such a class of functionaries is of greatimportance for the political as well as the religious evolution of society. For when thewelfare of the tribe is supposed to depend on the performance of these magical rites, themagician rises into a position of much influence and repute, and may readily acquire therank and authority of a chief or king. The profession accordingly draws into its ranks someof the ablest and most ambitious men of the tribe, because it holds out to them a prospect ofhonour, wealth, and power such as hardly any other career could offer. The acuter mindsperceive how easy it is to dupe their weaker brother and to play on his superstition fortheir own advantage. Not that the sorcerer is always a knave and impostor; he is oftensincerely convinced that he really possesses those wonderful powers which the credulity ofhis fellows ascribes to him. But the more sagacious he is, the more likely he is to seethrough the fallacies which impose on duller wits. Thus the ablest members of theprofession must tend to be more or less conscious deceivers; and it is just these men who invirtue of their superior ability will generally come to the top and win for themselvespositions of the highest dignity and the most commanding authority. The pitfalls whichbeset the path of the professional sorcerer are many, and as a rule only the man of coolesthead and sharpest wit will be able to steer his way through them safely. For it must alwaysbe remembered that every single profession and claim put forward by the magician as suchis false; not one of them can be maintained without deception, conscious or unconscious.Accordingly the sorcerer who sincerely believes in his own extravagant pretensions is in fargreater peril and is much more likely to be cut short in his career than the deliberateimpostor. The honest wizard always expects that his charms and incantations will producetheir supposed effect; and when they fail, not only really, as they always do, butconspicuously and disastrously, as they often do, he is taken aback: he is not, like hisknavish colleague, ready with a plausible excuse to account for the failure, and before hecan find one he may be knocked on the head by his disappointed and angry employers.The general result is that at this stage of social evolution the supreme power tends to fallinto the hands of men of the keenest intelligence and the most unscrupulous character. Ifwe could balance the harm they do by their knavery against the benefits they confer bytheir superior sagacity, it might well be found that the good greatly outweighed the evil.For more mischief has probably been wrought in the world by honest fools in high placesthan by intelligent rascals. Once your shrewd rogue has attained the height of his ambition,and has no longer any selfish end to further, he may, and often does, turn his talents, his"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"experience, his resources, to the service of the public. Many men who have been leastscrupulous in the acquisition of power have been most beneficent in the use of it, whetherthe power they aimed at and won was that of wealth, political authority, or what not. In thefield of politics the wily intriguer, the ruthless victor, may end by being a wise andmagnanimous ruler, blessed in his lifetime, lamented at his death, admired and applaudedby posterity. Such men, to take two of the most conspicuous instances, were Julius Caesarand Augustus. But once a fool always a fool, and the greater the power in his hands themore disastrous is likely to be the use he makes of it. The heaviest calamity in Englishhistory, the breach with America, might never have occurred if George the Third had notbeen an honest dullard.Thus, so far as the public profession of magic affected the constitution of savage society, ittended to place the control of affairs in the hands of the ablest man: it shifted the balance ofpower from the many to the one: it substituted a monarchy for a democracy, or rather foran oligarchy of old men; for in general the savage community is ruled, not by the wholebody of adult males, but by a council of elders. The change, by whatever causes produced,and whatever the character of the early rulers, was on the whole very beneficial. For therise of monarchy appears to be an essential condition of the emergence of mankind fromsavagery. No human being is so hide-bound by custom and tradition as your democraticsavage; in no state of society consequently is progress so slow and difficult. The old notionthat the savage is the freest of mankind is the reverse of the truth. He is a slave, not indeedto a visible master, but to the past, to the spirits of his dead forefathers, who haunt his stepsfrom birth to death, and rule him with a rod of iron. What they did is the pattern of right,the unwritten law to which he yields a blind unquestioning obedience. The least possiblescope is thus afforded to superior talent to change old customs for the better. The ablestman is dragged down by the weakest and dullest, who necessarily sets the standard, sincehe cannot rise, while the other can fall. The surface of such a society presents a uniformdead level, so far as it is humanly possible to reduce the natural inequalities, theimmeasurable real differences of inborn capacity and temper, to a false superficialappearance of equality. From this low and stagnant condition of affairs, which demagoguesand dreamers in later times have lauded as the ideal state, the Golden Age, of humanity,everything that helps to raise society by opening a career to talent and proportioning thedegrees of authority to men’s natural abilities, deserves to be welcomed by all who have thereal good of their fellows at heart. Once these elevating influences have begun to operate—and they cannot be for ever suppressed—the progress of civilisation becomescomparatively rapid. The rise of one man to supreme power enables him to carry throughchanges in a single lifetime which previously many generations might not have sufficed toeffect; and if, as will often happen, he is a man of intellect and energy above the common,he will readily avail himself of the opportunity. Even the whims and caprices of a tyrantmay be of service in breaking the chain of custom which lies so heavy on the savage. And assoon as the tribe ceases to be swayed by the timid and divided counsels of the elders, andyields to the direction of a single strong and resolute mind, it becomes formidable to itsneighbours and enters on a career of aggrandisement, which at an early stage of history isoften highly favourable to social, industrial, and intellectual progress. For extending itssway, partly by force of arms, partly by the voluntary submission of weaker tribes, thecommunity soon acquires wealth and slaves, both of which, by relieving some classes fromthe perpetual struggle for a bare subsistence, afford them an opportunity of devoting"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"themselves to that disinterested pursuit of knowledge which is the noblest and mostpowerful instrument to ameliorate the lot of man.Intellectual progress, which reveals itself in the growth of art and science and the spread ofmore liberal views, cannot be dissociated from industrial or economic progress, and that inits turn receives an immense impulse from conquest and empire. It is no mere accident thatthe most vehement outbursts of activity of the human mind have followed close on the heelsof victory, and that the great conquering races of the world have commonly done most toadvance and spread civilisation, thus healing in peace the wounds they inflicted in war. TheBabylonians, the Greeks, the Romans, the Arabs are our witnesses in the past: we may yetlive to see a similar outburst in Japan. Nor, to remount the stream of history to its sources,is it an accident that all the first great strides towards civilisation have been made underdespotic and theocratic governments, like those of Egypt, Babylon, and Peru, where thesupreme ruler claimed and received the servile allegiance of his subjects in the doublecharacter of a king and a god. It is hardly too much to say that at this early epochdespotism is the best friend of humanity and, paradoxical as it may sound, of liberty. Forafter all there is more liberty in the best sense—liberty to think our own thoughts and tofashion our own destinies—under the most absolute despotism, the most grinding tyranny,than under the apparent freedom of savage life, where the individual’s lot is cast from thecradle to the grave in the iron mould of hereditary custom.So far, therefore, as the public profession of magic has been one of the roads by which theablest men have passed to supreme power, it has contributed to emancipate mankind fromthe thraldom of tradition and to elevate them into a larger, freer life, with a broaderoutlook on the world. This is no small service rendered to humanity. And when weremember further that in another direction magic has paved the way for science, we areforced to admit that if the black art has done much evil, it has also been the source of muchgood; that if it is the child of error, it has yet been the mother of freedom and truth.IV. Magic and ReligionTHE examples collected in the last chapter may suffice to illustrate the general principlesof sympathetic magic in its two branches, to which we have given the names ofHomoeopathic and Contagious respectively. In some cases of magic which have comebefore us we have seen that the operation of spirits is assumed, and that an attempt is madeto win their favour by prayer and sacrifice. But these cases are on the whole exceptional;they exhibit magic tinged and alloyed with religion. Wherever sympathetic magic occurs inits pure unadulterated form, it assumes that in nature one event follows another necessarilyand invariably without the intervention of any spiritual or personal agency. Thus itsfundamental conception is identical with that of modern science; underlying the wholesystem is a faith, implicit but real and firm, in the order and uniformity of nature. Themagician does not doubt that the same causes will always produce the same effects, that theperformance of the proper ceremony, accompanied by the appropriate spell, will inevitablybe attended by the desired result, unless, indeed, his incantations should chance to bethwarted and foiled by the more potent charms of another sorcerer. He supplicates nohigher power: he sues the favour of no fickle and wayward being: he abases himself before"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"no awful deity. Yet his power, great as he believes it to be, is by no means arbitrary andunlimited. He can wield it only so long as he strictly conforms to the rules of his art, or towhat may be called the laws of nature as conceived by him. To neglect these rules, to breakthese laws in the smallest particular, is to incur failure, and may even expose the unskilfulpractitioner himself to the utmost peril. If he claims a sovereignty over nature, it is aconstitutional sovereignty rigorously limited in its scope and exercised in exact conformitywith ancient usage. Thus the analogy between the magical and the scientific conceptions ofthe world is close. In both of them the succession of events is assumed to be perfectlyregular and certain, being determined by immutable laws, the operation of which can beforeseen and calculated precisely; the elements of caprice, of chance, and of accident arebanished from the course of nature. Both of them open up a seemingly boundless vista ofpossibilities to him who knows the causes of things and can touch the secret springs that setin motion the vast and intricate mechanism of the world. Hence the strong attraction whichmagic and science alike have exercised on the human mind; hence the powerful stimulusthat both have given to the pursuit of knowledge. They lure the weary enquirer, thefootsore seeker, on through the wilderness of disappointment in the present by their endlesspromises of the future: they take him up to the top of an exceeding high mountain andshow him, beyond the dark clouds and rolling mists at his feet, a vision of the celestial city,far off, it may be, but radiant with unearthly splendour, bathed in the light of dreams.The fatal flaw of magic lies not in its general assumption of a sequence of eventsdetermined by law, but in its total misconception of the nature of the particular laws whichgovern that sequence. If we analyse the various cases of sympathetic magic which havebeen passed in review in the preceding pages, and which may be taken as fair samples ofthe bulk, we shall find, as I have already indicated, that they are all mistaken applicationsof one or other of two great fundamental laws of thought, namely, the association of ideasby similarity and the association of ideas by contiguity in space or time. A mistakenassociation of similar ideas produces homoeopathic or imitative magic: a mistakenassociation of contiguous ideas produces contagious magic. The principles of associationare excellent in themselves, and indeed absolutely essential to the working of the humanmind. Legitimately applied they yield science; illegitimately applied they yield magic, thebastard sister of science. It is therefore a truism, almost a tautology, to say that all magic isnecessarily false and barren; for were it ever to become true and fruitful, it would nolonger be magic but science. From the earliest times man has been engaged in a search forgeneral rules whereby to turn the order of natural phenomena to his own advantage, andin the long search he has scraped together a great hoard of such maxims, some of themgolden and some of them mere dross. The true or golden rules constitute the body ofapplied science which we call the arts; the false are magic.If magic is thus next of kin to science, we have still to enquire how it stands related toreligion. But the view we take of that relation will necessarily be coloured by the idea whichwe have formed of the nature of religion itself; hence a writer may reasonably be expectedto define his conception of religion before he proceeds to investigate its relation to magic.There is probably no subject in the world about which opinions differ so much as thenature of religion, and to frame a definition of it which would satisfy every one mustobviously be impossible. All that a writer can do is, first, to say clearly what he means byreligion, and afterwards to employ the word consistently in that sense throughout his work."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"By religion, then, I understand a propitiation or conciliation of powers superior to manwhich are believed to direct and control the course of nature and of human life. Thusdefined, religion consists of two elements, a theoretical and a practical, namely, a belief inpowers higher than man and an attempt to propitiate or please them. Of the two, beliefclearly comes first, since we must believe in the existence of a divine being before we canattempt to please him. But unless the belief leads to a corresponding practice, it is not areligion but merely a theology; in the language of St. James, “faith, if it hath not works, isdead, being alone.” In other words, no man is religious who does not govern his conduct insome measure by the fear or love of God. On the other hand, mere practice, divested of allreligious belief, is also not religion. Two men may behave in exactly the same way, and yetone of them may be religious and the other not. If the one acts from the love or fear of God,he is religious; if the other acts from the love or fear of man, he is moral or immoralaccording as his behaviour comports or conflicts with the general good. Hence belief andpractice or, in theological language, faith and works are equally essential to religion, whichcannot exist without both of them. But it is not necessary that religious practice shouldalways take the form of a ritual; that is, it need not consist in the offering of sacrifice, therecitation of prayers, and other outward ceremonies. Its aim is to please the deity, and ifthe deity is one who delights in charity and mercy and purity more than in oblations ofblood, the chanting of hymns, and the fumes of incense, his worshippers will best pleasehim, not by prostrating themselves before him, by intoning his praises, and by filling histemples with costly gifts, but by being pure and merciful and charitable towards men, forin so doing they will imitate, so far as human infirmity allows, the perfections of the divinenature. It was this ethical side of religion which the Hebrew prophets, inspired with a nobleideal of God’s goodness and holiness, were never weary of inculcating. Thus Micah says:“He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but todo justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?” And at a later time muchof the force by which Christianity conquered the world was drawn from the same highconception of God’s moral nature and the duty laid on men of conforming themselves to it.“Pure religion and undefiled,” says St. James, “before God and the Father is this, To visitthe fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from theworld.”But if religion involves, first, a belief in superhuman beings who rule the world, and,second, an attempt to win their favour, it clearly assumes that the course of nature is tosome extent elastic or variable, and that we can persuade or induce the mighty beings whocontrol it to deflect, for our benefit, the current of events from the channel in which theywould otherwise flow. Now this implied elasticity or variability of nature is directlyopposed to the principles of magic as well as of science, both of which assume that theprocesses of nature are rigid and invariable in their operation, and that they can as little beturned from their course by persuasion and entreaty as by threats and intimidation. Thedistinction between the two conflicting views of the universe turns on their answer to thecrucial question, Are the forces which govern the world conscious and personal, orunconscious and impersonal? Religion, as a conciliation of the superhuman powers,assumes the former member of the alternative. For all conciliation implies that the beingconciliated is a conscious or personal agent, that his conduct is in some measure uncertain,and that he can be prevailed upon to vary it in the desired direction by a judicious appealto his interests, his appetites, or his emotions. Conciliation is never employed towards"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"things which are regarded as inanimate, nor towards persons whose behaviour in theparticular circumstances is known to be determined with absolute certainty. Thus in so faras religion assumes the world to be directed by conscious agents who may be turned fromtheir purpose by persuasion, it stands in fundamental antagonism to magic as well as toscience, both of which take for granted that the course of nature is determined, not by thepassions or caprice of personal beings, but by the operation of immutable laws actingmechanically. In magic, indeed, the assumption is only implicit, but in science it is explicit.It is true that magic often deals with spirits, which are personal agents of the kind assumedby religion; but whenever it does so in its proper form, it treats them exactly in the samefashion as it treats inanimate agents, that is, it constrains or coerces instead of conciliatingor propitiating them as religion would do. Thus it assumes that all personal beings,whether human or divine, are in the last resort subject to those impersonal forces whichcontrol all things, but which nevertheless can be turned to account by any one who knowshow to manipulate them by the appropriate ceremonies and spells. In ancient Egypt, forexample, the magicians claimed the power of compelling even the highest gods to do theirbidding, and actually threatened them with destruction in case of disobedience. Sometimes,without going quite so far as that, the wizard declared that he would scatter the bones ofOsiris or reveal his sacred legend, if the god proved contumacious. Similarly in India at thepresent day the great Hindoo trinity itself of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva is subject to thesorcerers, who, by means of their spells, exercise such an ascendency over the mightiestdeities, that these are bound submissively to execute on earth below, or in heaven above,whatever commands their masters the magicians may please to issue. There is a sayingeverywhere current in India: “The whole universe is subject to the gods; the gods aresubject to the spells (mantras); the spells to the Brahmans; therefore the Brahmans are ourgods.”This radical conflict of principle between magic and religion sufficiently explains therelentless hostility with which in history the priest has often pursued the magician. Thehaughty self-sufficiency of the magician, his arrogant demeanour towards the higherpowers, and his unabashed claim to exercise a sway like theirs could not but revolt thepriest, to whom, with his awful sense of the divine majesty, and his humble prostration inpresence of it, such claims and such a demeanour must have appeared an impious andblasphemous usurpation of prerogatives that belong to God alone. And sometimes, we maysuspect, lower motives concurred to whet the edge of the priest’s hostility. He professed tobe the proper medium, the true intercessor between God and man, and no doubt hisinterests as well as his feelings were often injured by a rival practitioner, who preached asurer and smoother road to fortune than the rugged and slippery path of divine favour.Yet this antagonism, familiar as it is to us, seems to have made its appearancecomparatively late in the history of religion. At an earlier stage the functions of priest andsorcerer were often combined or, to speak perhaps more correctly, were not yetdifferentiated from each other. To serve his purpose man wooed the good-will of gods orspirits by prayer and sacrifice, while at the same time he had recourse to ceremonies andforms of words which he hoped would of themselves bring about the desired result withoutthe help of god or devil. In short, he performed religious and magical rites simultaneously;he uttered prayers and incantations almost in the same breath, knowing or recking little ofthe theoretical inconsistency of his behaviour, so long as by hook or crook he contrived to"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"get what he wanted. Instances of this fusion or confusion of magic with religion havealready met us in the practices of Melanesians and of other peoples.The same confusion of magic and religion has survived among peoples that have risen tohigher levels of culture. It was rife in ancient India and ancient Egypt; it is by no meansextinct among European peasantry at the present day. With regard to ancient India we aretold by an eminent Sanscrit scholar that “the sacrificial ritual at the earliest period ofwhich we have detailed information is pervaded with practices that breathe the spirit of themost primitive magic.” Speaking of the importance of magic in the East, and especially inEgypt, Professor Maspero remarks that “we ought not to attach to the word magic thedegrading idea which it almost inevitably calls up in the mind of a modern. Ancient magicwas the very foundation of religion. The faithful who desired to obtain some favour from agod had no chance of succeeding except by laying hands on the deity, and this arrest couldonly be effected by means of a certain number of rites, sacrifices, prayers, and chants,which the god himself had revealed, and which obliged him to do what was demanded ofhim.”Among the ignorant classes of modern Europe the same confusion of ideas, the samemixture of religion and magic, crops up in various forms. Thus we are told that in France“the majority of the peasants still believe that the priest possesses a secret and irresistiblepower over the elements. By reciting certain prayers which he alone knows and has theright to utter, yet for the utterance of which he must afterwards demand absolution, hecan, on an occasion of pressing danger, arrest or reverse for a moment the action of theeternal laws of the physical world. The winds, the storms, the hail, and the rain are at hiscommand and obey his will. The fire also is subject to him, and the flames of aconflagration are extinguished at his word.” For example, French peasants used to be,perhaps are still, persuaded that the priests could celebrate, with certain special rites, aMass of the Holy Spirit, of which the efficacy was so miraculous that it never met with anyopposition from the divine will; God was forced to grant whatever was asked of Him in thisform, however rash and importunate might be the petition. No idea of impiety orirreverence attached to the rite in the minds of those who, in some of the great extremitiesof life, sought by this singular means to take the kingdom of heaven by storm. The secularpriests generally refused to say the Mass of the Holy Spirit; but the monks, especially theCapuchin friars, had the reputation of yielding with less scruple to the entreaties of theanxious and distressed. In the constraint thus supposed by Catholic peasantry to be laid bythe priest upon the deity we seem to have an exact counterpart of the power which theancient Egyptians ascribed to their magicians. Again, to take another example, in manyvillages of Provence the priest is still reputed to possess the faculty of averting storms. It isnot every priest who enjoys this reputation; and in some villages, when a change of pastorstakes place, the parishioners are eager to learn whether the new incumbent has the power(pouder), as they call it. At the first sign of a heavy storm they put him to the proof byinviting him to exorcise the threatening clouds; and if the result answers to their hopes, thenew shepherd is assured of the sympathy and respect of his flock. In some parishes, wherethe reputation of the curate in this respect stood higher than that of his rector, the relationsbetween the two have been so strained in consequence that the bishop has had to translatethe rector to another benefice. Again, Gascon peasants believe that to revenge themselveson their enemies bad men will sometimes induce a priest to say a mass called the Mass of"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Saint Sécaire. Very few priests know this mass, and three-fourths of those who do know itwould not say it for love or money. None but wicked priests dare to perform the gruesomeceremony, and you may be quite sure that they will have a very heavy account to render forit at the last day. No curate or bishop, not even the archbishop of Auch, can pardon them;that right belongs to the pope of Rome alone. The Mass of Saint Sécaire may be said only ina ruined or deserted church, where owls mope and hoot, where bats flit in the gloaming,where gypsies lodge of nights, and where toads squat under the desecrated altar. Thitherthe bad priest comes by night with his light o’ love, and at the first stroke of eleven hebegins to mumble the mass backwards, and ends just as the clocks are knelling themidnight hour. His leman acts as clerk. The host he blesses is black and has three points;he consecrates no wine, but instead he drinks the water of a well into which the body of anunbaptized infant has been flung. He makes the sign of the cross, but it is on the groundand with his left foot. And many other things he does which no good Christian could lookupon without being struck blind and deaf and dumb for the rest of his life. But the man forwhom the mass is said withers away little by little, and nobody can say what is the matterwith him; even the doctors can make nothing of it. They do not know that he is slowlydying of the Mass of Saint Sécaire.Yet though magic is thus found to fuse and amalgamate with religion in many ages and inmany lands, there are some grounds for thinking that this fusion is not primitive, and thatthere was a time when man trusted to magic alone for the satisfaction of such wants astranscended his immediate animal cravings. In the first place a consideration of thefundamental notions of magic and religion may incline us to surmise that magic is olderthan religion in the history of humanity. We have seen that on the one hand magic isnothing but a mistaken application of the very simplest and most elementary processes ofthe mind, namely the association of ideas by virtue of resemblance or contiguity; and thaton the other hand religion assumes the operation of conscious or personal agents, superiorto man, behind the visible screen of nature. Obviously the conception of personal agents ismore complex than a simple recognition of the similarity or contiguity of ideas; and atheory which assumes that the course of nature is determined by conscious agents is moreabstruse and recondite, and requires for its apprehension a far higher degree of intelligenceand reflection, than the view that things succeed each other simply by reason of theircontiguity or resemblance. The very beasts associate the ideas of things that are like eachother or that have been found together in their experience; and they could hardly survivefor a day if they ceased to do so. But who attributes to the animals a belief that thephenomena of nature are worked by a multitude of invisible animals or by one enormousand prodigiously strong animal behind the scenes? It is probably no injustice to the brutesto assume that the honour of devising a theory of this latter sort must be reserved forhuman reason. Thus, if magic be deduced immediately from elementary processes ofreasoning, and be, in fact, an error into which the mind falls almost spontaneously, whilereligion rests on conceptions which the merely animal intelligence can hardly be supposedto have yet attained to, it becomes probable that magic arose before religion in theevolution of our race, and that man essayed to bend nature to his wishes by the sheer forceof spells and enchantments before he strove to coax and mollify a coy, capricious, orirascible deity by the soft insinuation of prayer and sacrifice.The conclusion which we have thus reached deductively from a consideration of the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"fundamental ideas of magic and religion is confirmed inductively by the observation thatamong the aborigines of Australia, the rudest savages as to whom we possess accurateinformation, magic is universally practised, whereas religion in the sense of a propitiationor conciliation of the higher powers seems to be nearly unknown. Roughly speaking, allmen in Australia are magicians, but not one is a priest; everybody fancies he can influencehis fellows or the course of nature by sympathetic magic, but nobody dreams ofpropitiating gods by prayer and sacrifice.But if in the most backward state of human society now known to us we find magic thusconspicuously present and religion conspicuously absent, may we not reasonablyconjecture that the civilised races of the world have also at some period of their historypassed through a similar intellectual phase, that they attempted to force the great powersof nature to do their pleasure before they thought of courting their favour by offerings andprayer—in short that, just as on the material side of human culture there has everywherebeen an Age of Stone, so on the intellectual side there has everywhere been an Age ofMagic? There are reasons for answering this question in the affirmative. When we surveythe existing races of mankind from Greenland to Tierra del Fuego, or from Scotland toSingapore, we observe that they are distinguished one from the other by a great variety ofreligions, and that these distinctions are not, so to speak, merely coterminous with thebroad distinctions of race, but descend into the minuter subdivisions of states andcommonwealths, nay, that they honeycomb the town, the village, and even the family, sothat the surface of society all over the world is cracked and seamed, sapped and mined withrents and fissures and yawning crevasses opened up by the disintegrating influence ofreligious dissension. Yet when we have penetrated through these differences, which affectmainly the intelligent and thoughtful part of the community, we shall find underlying themall a solid stratum of intellectual agreement among the dull, the weak, the ignorant, and thesuperstitious, who constitute, unfortunately, the vast majority of mankind. One of the greatachievements of the nineteenth century was to run shafts down into this low mentalstratum in many parts of the world, and thus to discover its substantial identityeverywhere. It is beneath our feet—and not very far beneath them—here in Europe at thepresent day, and it crops up on the surface in the heart of the Australian wilderness andwherever the advent of a higher civilisation has not crushed it under ground. Thisuniversal faith, this truly Catholic creed, is a belief in the efficacy of magic. While religioussystems differ not only in different countries, but in the same country in different ages, thesystem of sympathetic magic remains everywhere and at all times substantially alike in itsprinciples and practice. Among the ignorant and superstitious classes of modern Europe itis very much what it was thousands of years ago in Egypt and India, and what it now isamong the lowest savages surviving in the remotest corners of the world. If the test of truthlay in a show of hands or a counting of heads, the system of magic might appeal, with farmore reason than the Catholic Church, to the proud motto, “Quod semper, quod ubique,quod ab omnibus,” as the sure and certain credential of its own infallibility.It is not our business here to consider what bearing the permanent existence of such a solidlayer of savagery beneath the surface of society, and unaffected by the superficial changesof religion and culture, has upon the future of humanity. The dispassionate observer,whose studies have led him to plumb its depths, can hardly regard it otherwise than as astanding menace to civilisation. We seem to move on a thin crust which may at any moment"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"be rent by the subterranean forces slumbering below. From time to time a hollow murmurunderground or a sudden spirt of flame into the air tells of what is going on beneath ourfeet. Now and then the polite world is startled by a paragraph in a newspaper which tellshow in Scotland an image has been found stuck full of pins for the purpose of killing anobnoxious laird or minister, how a woman has been slowly roasted to death as a witch inIreland, or how a girl has been murdered and chopped up in Russia to make those candlesof human tallow by whose light thieves hope to pursue their midnight trade unseen. Butwhether the influences that make for further progress, or those that threaten to undo whathas already been accomplished, will ultimately prevail; whether the impulsive energy of theminority or the dead weight of the majority of mankind will prove the stronger force tocarry us up to higher heights or to sink us into lower depths, are questions rather for thesage, the moralist, and the statesman, whose eagle vision scans the future, than for thehumble student of the present and the past. Here we are only concerned to ask how far theuniformity, the universality, and the permanence of a belief in magic, compared with theendless variety and the shifting character of religious creeds, raises a presumption that theformer represents a ruder and earlier phase of the human mind, through which all theraces of mankind have passed or are passing on their way to religion and science.If an Age of Religion has thus everywhere, as I venture to surmise, been preceded by anAge of Magic, it is natural that we should enquire what causes have led mankind, or rathera portion of them, to abandon magic as a principle of faith and practice and to betakethemselves to religion instead. When we reflect upon the multitude, the variety, and thecomplexity of the facts to be explained, and the scantiness of our information regardingthem, we shall be ready to acknowledge that a full and satisfactory solution of so profounda problem is hardly to be hoped for, and that the most we can do in the present state of ourknowledge is to hazard a more or less plausible conjecture. With all due diffidence, then, Iwould suggest that a tardy recognition of the inherent falsehood and barrenness of magicset the more thoughtful part of mankind to cast about for a truer theory of nature and amore fruitful method of turning her resources to account. The shrewder intelligences mustin time have come to perceive that magical ceremonies and incantations did not reallyeffect the results which they were designed to produce, and which the majority of theirsimpler fellows still believed that they did actually produce. This great discovery of theinefficacy of magic must have wrought a radical though probably slow revolution in theminds of those who had the sagacity to make it. The discovery amounted to this, that menfor the first time recognised their inability to manipulate at pleasure certain natural forceswhich hitherto they had believed to be completely within their control. It was a confessionof human ignorance and weakness. Man saw that he had taken for causes what were nocauses, and that all his efforts to work by means of these imaginary causes had been vain.His painful toil had been wasted, his curious ingenuity had been squandered to no purpose.He had been pulling at strings to which nothing was attached; he had been marching, as hethought, straight to the goal, while in reality he had only been treading in a narrow circle.Not that the effects which he had striven so hard to produce did not continue to manifestthemselves. They were still produced, but not by him. The rain still fell on the thirstyground: the sun still pursued his daily, and the moon her nightly journey across the sky:the silent procession of the seasons still moved in light and shadow, in cloud and sunshineacross the earth: men were still born to labour and sorrow, and still, after a brief sojournhere, were gathered to their fathers in the long home hereafter. All things indeed went on"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"as before, yet all seemed different to him from whose eyes the old scales had fallen. For hecould no longer cherish the pleasing illusion that it was he who guided the earth and theheaven in their courses, and that they would cease to perform their great revolutions werehe to take his feeble hand from the wheel. In the death of his enemies and his friends he nolonger saw a proof of the resistless potency of his own or of hostile enchantments; he nowknew that friends and foes alike had succumbed to a force stronger than any that he couldwield, and in obedience to a destiny which he was powerless to control.Thus cut adrift from his ancient moorings and left to toss on a troubled sea of doubt anduncertainty, his old happy confidence in himself and his powers rudely shaken, ourprimitive philosopher must have been sadly perplexed and agitated till he came to rest, asin a quiet haven after a tempestuous voyage, in a new system of faith and practice, whichseemed to offer a solution of his harassing doubts and a substitute, however precarious, forthat sovereignty over nature which he had reluctantly abdicated. If the great world went onits way without the help of him or his fellows, it must surely be because there were otherbeings, like himself, but far stronger, who, unseen themselves, directed its course andbrought about all the varied series of events which he had hitherto believed to bedependent on his own magic. It was they, as he now believed, and not he himself, who madethe stormy wind to blow, the lightning to flash, and the thunder to roll; who had laid thefoundations of the solid earth and set bounds to the restless sea that it might not pass; whocaused all the glorious lights of heaven to shine; who gave the fowls of the air their meatand the wild beasts of the desert their prey; who bade the fruitful land to bring forth inabundance, the high hills to be clothed with forests, the bubbling springs to rise under therocks in the valleys, and green pastures to grow by still waters; who breathed into man’snostrils and made him live, or turned him to destruction by famine and pestilence and war.To these mighty beings, whose handiwork he traced in all the gorgeous and variedpageantry of nature, man now addressed himself, humbly confessing his dependence ontheir invisible power, and beseeching them of their mercy to furnish him with all goodthings, to defend him from the perils and dangers by which our mortal life is compassedabout on every hand, and finally to bring his immortal spirit, freed from the burden of thebody, to some happier world, beyond the reach of pain and sorrow, where he might restwith them and with the spirits of good men in joy and felicity for ever.In this, or some such way as this, the deeper minds may be conceived to have made thegreat transition from magic to religion. But even in them the change can hardly ever havebeen sudden; probably it proceeded very slowly, and required long ages for its more or lessperfect accomplishment. For the recognition of man’s powerlessness to influence the courseof nature on a grand scale must have been gradual; he cannot have been shorn of the wholeof his fancied dominion at a blow. Step by step he must have been driven back from hisproud position; foot by foot he must have yielded, with a sigh, the ground which he hadonce viewed as his own. Now it would be the wind, now the rain, now the sunshine, now thethunder, that he confessed himself unable to wield at will; and as province after province ofnature thus fell from his grasp, till what had once seemed a kingdom threatened to shrinkinto a prison, man must have been more and more profoundly impressed with a sense of hisown helplessness and the might of the invisible beings by whom he believed himself to besurrounded. Thus religion, beginning as a slight and partial acknowledgment of powerssuperior to man, tends with the growth of knowledge to deepen into a confession of man’s"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"entire and absolute dependence on the divine; his old free bearing is exchanged for anattitude of lowliest prostration before the mysterious powers of the unseen, and his highestvirtue is to submit his will to theirs: In la sua volontade è nostra pace. But this deepeningsense of religion, this more perfect submission to the divine will in all things, affects onlythose higher intelligences who have breadth of view enough to comprehend the vastness ofthe universe and the littleness of man. Small minds cannot grasp great ideas; to theirnarrow comprehension, their purblind vision, nothing seems really great and importantbut themselves. Such minds hardly rise into religion at all. They are, indeed, drilled bytheir betters into an outward conformity with its precepts and a verbal profession of itstenets; but at heart they cling to their old magical superstitions, which may bediscountenanced and forbidden, but cannot be eradicated by religion, so long as they havetheir roots deep down in the mental framework and constitution of the great majority ofmankind.The reader may well be tempted to ask, How was it that intelligent men did not soonerdetect the fallacy of magic? How could they continue to cherish expectations that wereinvariably doomed to disappointment? With what heart persist in playing venerable anticsthat led to nothing, and mumbling solemn balderdash that remained without effect? Whycling to beliefs which were so flatly contradicted by experience? How dare to repeatexperiments that had failed so often? The answer seems to be that the fallacy was far fromeasy to detect, the failure by no means obvious, since in many, perhaps in most cases, thedesired event did actually follow, at a longer or shorter interval, the performance of the ritewhich was designed to bring it about; and a mind of more than common acuteness wasneeded to perceive that, even in these cases, the rite was not necessarily the cause of theevent. A ceremony intended to make the wind blow or the rain fall, or to work the death ofan enemy, will always be followed, sooner or later, by the occurrence it is meant to bring topass; and primitive man may be excused for regarding the occurrence as a direct result ofthe ceremony, and the best possible proof of its efficacy. Similarly, rites observed in themorning to help the sun to rise, and in spring to wake the dreaming earth from her wintersleep, will invariably appear to be crowned with success, at least within the temperatezones; for in these regions the sun lights his golden lamp in the east every morning, andyear by year the vernal earth decks herself afresh with a rich mantle of green. Hence thepractical savage, with his conservative instincts, might well turn a deaf ear to the subtletiesof the theoretical doubter, the philosophic radical, who presumed to hint that sunrise andspring might not, after all, be direct consequences of the punctual performance of certaindaily or yearly ceremonies, and that the sun might perhaps continue to rise and trees toblossom though the ceremonies were occasionally intermitted, or even discontinuedaltogether. These sceptical doubts would naturally be repelled by the other with scorn andindignation as airy reveries subversive of the faith and manifestly contradicted byexperience. “Can anything be plainer,” he might say, “than that I light my twopennycandle on earth and that the sun then kindles his great fire in heaven? I should be glad toknow whether, when I have put on my green robe in spring, the trees do not afterwards dothe same? These are facts patent to everybody, and on them I take my stand. I am a plainpractical man, not one of your theorists and splitters of hairs and choppers of logic.Theories and speculation and all that may be very well in their way, and I have not theleast objection to your indulging in them, provided, of course, you do not put them inpractice. But give me leave to stick to facts; then I know where I am.” The fallacy of this"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"reasoning is obvious to us, because it happens to deal with facts about which we have longmade up our minds. But let an argument of precisely the same calibre be applied to matterswhich are still under debate, and it may be questioned whether a British audience wouldnot applaud it as sound, and esteem the speaker who used it a safe man—not brilliant orshowy, perhaps, but thoroughly sensible and hard-headed. If such reasonings could passmuster among ourselves, need we wonder that they long escaped detection by the savage?V. The Magical Control of the Weather1. The Public MagicianTHE READER may remember that we were led to plunge into the labyrinth of magic by aconsideration of two different types of man-god. This is the clue which has guided ourdevious steps through the maze, and brought us out at last on higher ground, whence,resting a little by the way, we can look back over the path we have already traversed andforward to the longer and steeper road we have still to climb.As a result of the foregoing discussion, the two types of human gods may conveniently bedistinguished as the religious and the magical man-god respectively. In the former, a beingof an order different from and superior to man is supposed to become incarnate, for alonger or a shorter time, in a human body, manifesting his super-human power andknowledge by miracles wrought and prophecies uttered through the medium of the fleshlytabernacle in which he has deigned to take up his abode. This may also appropriately becalled the inspired or incarnate type of man-god. In it the human body is merely a frailearthly vessel filled with a divine and immortal spirit. On the other hand, a man-god of themagical sort is nothing but a man who possesses in an unusually high degree powers whichmost of his fellows arrogate to themselves on a smaller scale; for in rude society there ishardly a person who does not dabble in magic. Thus, whereas a man-god of the former orinspired type derives his divinity from a deity who has stooped to hide his heavenlyradiance behind a dull mask of earthly mould, a man-god of the latter type draws hisextraordinary power from a certain physical sympathy with nature. He is not merely thereceptacle of a divine spirit. His whole being, body and soul, is so delicately attuned to theharmony of the world that a touch of his hand or a turn of his head may send a thrillvibrating through the universal framework of things; and conversely his divine organism isacutely sensitive to such slight changes of environment as would leave ordinary mortalswholly unaffected. But the line between these two types of man-god, however sharply wemay draw it in theory, is seldom to be traced with precision in practice, and in what followsI shall not insist on it.We have seen that in practice the magic art may be employed for the benefit either ofindividuals or of the whole community, and that according as it is directed to one or otherof these two objects it may be called private or public magic. Further, I pointed out that thepublic magician occupies a position of great influence, from which, if he is a prudent andable man, he may advance step by step to the rank of a chief or king. Thus an examination"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"of public magic conduces to an understanding of the early kingship, since in savage andbarbarous society many chiefs and kings appear to owe their authority in great measure totheir reputation as magicians.Among the objects of public utility which magic may be employed to secure, the mostessential is an adequate supply of food. The examples cited in preceding pages prove thatthe purveyors of food—the hunter, the fisher, the farmer—all resort to magical practices inthe pursuit of their various callings; but they do so as private individuals for the benefit ofthemselves and their families, rather than as public functionaries acting in the interest ofthe whole people. It is otherwise when the rites are performed, not by the hunters, thefishers, the farmers themselves, but by professional magicians on their behalf. In primitivesociety, where uniformity of occupation is the rule, and the distribution of the communityinto various classes of workers has hardly begun, every man is more or less his ownmagician; he practises charms and incantations for his own good and the injury of hisenemies. But a great step in advance has been taken when a special class of magicians hasbeen instituted; when, in other words, a number of men have been set apart for the expresspurpose of benefiting the whole community by their skill, whether that skill be directed tothe healing of diseases, the forecasting of the future, the regulation of the weather, or anyother object of general utility. The impotence of the means adopted by most of thesepractitioners to accomplish their ends ought not to blind us to the immense importance ofthe institution itself. Here is a body of men relieved, at least in the higher stages ofsavagery, from the need of earning their livelihood by hard manual toil, and allowed, nay,expected and encouraged, to prosecute researches into the secret ways of nature. It was atonce their duty and their interest to know more than their fellows, to acquaint themselveswith everything that could aid man in his arduous struggle with nature, everything thatcould mitigate his sufferings and prolong his life. The properties of drugs and minerals, thecauses of rain and drought, of thunder and lightning, the changes of the seasons, the phasesof the moon, the daily and yearly journeys of the sun, the motions of the stars, the mysteryof life, and the mystery of death, all these things must have excited the wonder of theseearly philosophers, and stimulated them to find solutions of problems that were doubtlessoften thrust on their attention in the most practical form by the importunate demands oftheir clients, who expected them not merely to understand but to regulate the greatprocesses of nature for the good of man. That their first shots fell very far wide of the markcould hardly be helped. The slow, the never-ending approach to truth consists inperpetually forming and testing hypotheses, accepting those which at the time seem to fitthe facts and rejecting the others. The views of natural causation embraced by the savagemagician no doubt appear to us manifestly false and absurd; yet in their day they werelegitimate hypotheses, though they have not stood the test of experience. Ridicule andblame are the just meed, not of those who devised these crude theories, but of those whoobstinately adhered to them after better had been propounded. Certainly no men ever hadstronger incentives in the pursuit of truth than these savage sorcerers. To maintain at leasta show of knowledge was absolutely necessary; a single mistake detected might cost themtheir life. This no doubt led them to practise imposture for the purpose of concealing theirignorance; but it also supplied them with the most powerful motive for substituting a realfor a sham knowledge, since, if you would appear to know anything, by far the best way isactually to know it. Thus, however justly we may reject the extravagant pretensions ofmagicians and condemn the deceptions which they have practised on mankind, the original"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"institution of this class of men has, take it all in all, been productive of incalculable good tohumanity. They were the direct predecessors, not merely of our physicians and surgeons,but of our investigators and discoverers in every branch of natural science. They began thework which has since been carried to such glorious and beneficent issues by theirsuccessors in after ages; and if the beginning was poor and feeble, this is to be imputed tothe inevitable difficulties which beset the path of knowledge rather than to the naturalincapacity or wilful fraud of the men themselves.2. The Magical Control of RainOF THE THINGS which the public magician sets himself to do for the good of the tribe,one of the chief is to control the weather and especially to ensure an adequate fall of rain.Water is an essential of life, and in most countries the supply of it depends upon showers.Without rain vegetation withers, animals and men languish and die. Hence in savagecommunities the rain-maker is a very important personage; and often a special class ofmagicians exists for the purpose of regulating the heavenly water-supply. The methods bywhich they attempt to discharge the duties of their office are commonly, though not always,based on the principle of homoeopathic or imitative magic. If they wish to make rain theysimulate it by sprinkling water or mimicking clouds: if their object is to stop rain and causedrought, they avoid water and resort to warmth and fire for the sake of drying up the tooabundant moisture. Such attempts are by no means confined, as the cultivated readermight imagine, to the naked inhabitants of those sultry lands like Central Australia andsome parts of Eastern and Southern Africa, where often for months together the pitilesssun beats down out of a blue and cloudless sky on the parched and gaping earth. They are,or used to be, common enough among outwardly civilised folk in the moister climate ofEurope. I will now illustrate them by instances drawn from the practice both of public andprivate magic.Thus, for example, in a village near Dorpat, in Russia, when rain was much wanted, threemen used to climb up the fir-trees of an old sacred grove. One of them drummed with ahammer on a kettle or small cask to imitate thunder; the second knocked two fire-brandstogether and made the sparks fly, to imitate lightning; and the third, who was called “therain-maker,” had a bunch of twigs with which he sprinkled water from a vessel on all sides.To put an end to drought and bring down rain, women and girls of the village of Ploska arewont to go naked by night to the boundaries of the village and there pour water on theground. In Halmahera, or Gilolo, a large island to the west of New Guinea, a wizard makesrain by dipping a branch of a particular kind of tree in water and then scattering themoisture from the dripping bough over the ground. In New Britain the rain-maker wrapssome leaves of a red and green striped creeper in a banana-leaf, moistens the bundle withwater, and buries it in the ground; then he imitates with his mouth the plashing of rain.Amongst the Omaha Indians of North America, when the corn is withering for want ofrain, the members of the sacred Buffalo Society fill a large vessel with water and dancefour times round it. One of them drinks some of the water and spirts it into the air, makinga fine spray in imitation of a mist or drizzling rain. Then he upsets the vessel, spilling thewater on the ground; whereupon the dancers fall down and drink up the water, gettingmud all over their faces. Lastly, they squirt the water into the air, making a fine mist. This"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"saves the corn. In spring-time the Natchez of North America used to club together topurchase favourable weather for their crops from the wizards. If rain was needed, thewizards fasted and danced with pipes full of water in their mouths. The pipes wereperforated like the nozzle of a watering-can, and through the holes the rain-maker blew thewater towards that part of the sky where the clouds hung heaviest. But if fine weather waswanted, he mounted the roof of his hut, and with extended arms, blowing with all hismight, he beckoned to the clouds to pass by. When the rains do not come in due season thepeople of Central Angoniland repair to what is called the rain-temple. Here they clearaway the grass, and the leader pours beer into a pot which is buried in the ground, while hesays, “Master Chauta, you have hardened your heart towards us, what would you have usdo? We must perish indeed. Give your children the rains, there is the beer we have givenyou.” Then they all partake of the beer that is left over, even the children being made to sipit. Next they take branches of trees and dance and sing for rain. When they return to thevillage they find a vessel of water set at the doorway by an old woman; so they dip theirbranches in it and wave them aloft, so as to scatter the drops. After that the rain is sure tocome driving up in heavy clouds. In these practices we see a combination of religion withmagic; for while the scattering of the water-drops by means of branches is a purely magicalceremony, the prayer for rain and the offering of beer are purely religious rites. In theMara tribe of Northern Australia the rain-maker goes to a pool and sings over it his magicsong. Then he takes some of the water in his hands, drinks it, and spits it out in variousdirections. After that he throws water all over himself, scatters it about, and returns quietlyto the camp. Rain is supposed to follow. The Arab historian Makrizi describes a method ofstopping rain which is said to have been resorted to by a tribe of nomads called Alqamar inHadramaut. They cut a branch from a certain tree in the desert, set it on fire, and thensprinkled the burning brand with water. After that the vehemence of the rain abated, justas the water vanished when it fell on the glowing brand. Some of the Eastern Angamis ofManipur are said to perform a some-what similar ceremony for the opposite purpose, inorder, namely, to produce rain. The head of the village puts a burning brand on the graveof a man who has died of burns, and quenches the brand with water, while he prays thatrain may fall. Here the putting out the fire with water, which is an imitation of rain, isreinforced by the influence of the dead man, who, having been burnt to death, willnaturally be anxious for the descent of rain to cool his scorched body and assuage hispangs.Other people besides the Arabs have used fire as a means of stopping rain. Thus the Sulkaof New Britain heat stones red hot in the fire and then put them out in the rain, or theythrow hot ashes in the air. They think that the rain will soon cease to fall, for it does notlike to be burned by the hot stones or ashes. The Telugus send a little girl out naked intothe rain with a burning piece of wood in her hand, which she has to show to the rain. Thatis supposed to stop the downpour. At Port Stevens in New South Wales the medicine-menused to drive away rain by throwing fire-sticks into the air, while at the same time theypuffed and shouted. Any man of the Anula tribe in Northern Australia can stop rain bysimply warming a green stick in the fire, and then striking it against the wind.In time of severe drought the Dieri of Central Australia, loudly lamenting the impoverishedstate of the country and their own half-starved condition, call upon the spirits of theirremote predecessors, whom they call Mura-muras, to grant them power to make a heavy"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"rain-fall. For they believe that the clouds are bodies in which rain is generated by their ownceremonies or those of neighbouring tribes, through the influence of the Mura-muras. Theway in which they set about drawing rain from the clouds is this. A hole is dug about twelvefeet long and eight or ten broad, and over this hole a conical hut of logs and branches ismade. Two wizards, supposed to have received a special inspiration from the Mura-muras,are bled by an old and influential man with a sharp flint; and the blood, drawn from theirarms below the elbow, is made to flow on the other men of the tribe, who sit huddledtogether in the hut. At the same time the two bleeding men throw handfuls of down about,some of which adheres to the blood-stained bodies of their comrades, while the rest floats inthe air. The blood is thought to represent the rain, and the down the clouds. During theceremony two large stones are placed in the middle of the hut; they stand for gatheringclouds and presage rain. Then the wizards who were bled carry away the two stones forabout ten or fifteen miles, and place them as high as they can in the tallest tree. Meanwhilethe other men gather gypsum, pound it fine, and throw it into a water-hole. This the Mura-muras see, and at once they cause clouds to appear in the sky. Lastly, the men, young andold, surround the hut, and, stooping down, butt at it with their heads, like so many rams.Thus they force their way through it and reappear on the other side, repeating the processtill the hut is wrecked. In doing this they are forbidden to use their hands or arms; butwhen the heavy logs alone remain, they are allowed to pull them out with their hands. “Thepiercing of the hut with their heads symbolises the piercing of the clouds; the fall of the hut,the fall of the rain.” Obviously, too, the act of placing high up in trees the two stones, whichstand for clouds, is a way of making the real clouds to mount up in the sky. The Dieri alsoimagine that the foreskins taken from lads at circumcision have a great power of producingrain. Hence the Great Council of the tribe always keeps a small stock of foreskins ready foruse. They are carefully concealed, being wrapt up in feathers with the fat of the wild dogand of the carpet snake. A woman may not see such a parcel opened on any account. Whenthe ceremony is over, the foreskin is buried, its virtue being exhausted. After the rains havefallen, some of the tribe always undergo a surgical operation, which consists in cutting theskin of their chest and arms with a sharp flint. The wound is then tapped with a flat stick toincrease the flow of blood, and red ochre is rubbed into it. Raised scars are thus produced.The reason alleged by the natives for this practice is that they are pleased with the rain,and that there is a connexion between the rain and the scars. Apparently the operation isnot very painful, for the patient laughs and jokes while it is going on. Indeed, little childrenhave been seen to crowd round the operator and patiently take their turn; then after beingoperated on, they ran away, expanding their little chests and singing for the rain to beatupon them. However, they were not so well pleased next day, when they felt their woundsstiff and sore. In Java, when rain is wanted, two men will sometimes thrash each other withsupple rods till the blood flows down their backs; the streaming blood represents the rain,and no doubt is supposed to make it fall on the ground. The people of Egghiou, a district ofAbyssinia, used to engage in sanguinary conflicts with each other, village against village,for a week together every January for the purpose of procuring rain. Some years ago theemperor Menelik forbade the custom. However, the following year the rain was deficient,and the popular outcry so great that the emperor yielded to it, and allowed the murderousfights to be resumed, but for two days a year only. The writer who mentions the customregards the blood shed on these occasions as a propitiatory sacrifice offered to spirits whocontrol the showers; but perhaps, as in the Australian and Javanese ceremonies, it is an"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"imitation of rain. The prophets of Baal, who sought to procure rain by cutting themselveswith knives till the blood gushed out, may have acted on the same principle.There is a widespread belief that twin children possess magical powers over nature,especially over rain and the weather. This curious superstition prevails among some of theIndian tribes of British Columbia, and has led them often to impose certain singularrestrictions or taboos on the parents of twins, though the exact meaning of theserestrictions is generally obscure. Thus the Tsimshian Indians of British Columbia believethat twins control the weather; therefore they pray to wind and rain, “Calm down, breathof the twins.” Further, they think that the wishes of twins are always fulfilled; hence twinsare feared, because they can harm the man they hate. They can also call the salmon and theolachen or candle-fish, and so they are known by a name which means “making plentiful.”In the opinion of the Kwakiutl Indians of British Columbia twins are transformed salmon;hence they may not go near water, lest they should be changed back again into the fish. Intheir childhood they can summon any wind by motions of their hands, and they can makefair or foul weather, and also cure diseases by swinging a large wooden rattle. The NootkaIndians of British Columbia also believe that twins are somehow related to salmon. Henceamong them twins may not catch salmon, and they may not eat or even handle the freshfish. They can make fair or foul weather, and can cause rain to fall by painting their facesblack and then washing them, which may represent the rain dripping from the darkclouds. The Shuswap Indians, like the Thompson Indians, associate twins with the grizzlybear, for they call them “young grizzly bears.” According to them, twins remainthroughout life endowed with supernatural powers. In particular they can make good orbad weather. They produce rain by spilling water from a basket in the air; they make fineweather by shaking a small flat piece of wood attached to a stick by a string; they raisestorms by strewing down on the ends of spruce branches.The same power of influencing the weather is attributed to twins by the Baronga, a tribe ofBantu negroes who, inhabit the shores of Delagoa Bay in South-eastern Africa. Theybestow the name of Tilo—that is, the sky—on a woman who has given birth to twins, andthe infants themselves are called the children of the sky. Now when the storms whichgenerally burst in the months of September and October have been looked for in vain,when a drought with its prospect of famine is threatening, and all nature, scorched andburnt up by a sun that has shone for six months from a cloudless sky, is panting for thebeneficent showers of the South African spring, the women perform ceremonies to bringdown the longed-for rain on the parched earth. Stripping themselves of all their garments,they assume in their stead girdles and head-dresses of grass, or short petticoats made of theleaves of a particular sort of creeper. Thus attired, uttering peculiar cries and singingribald songs, they go about from well to well, cleansing them of the mud and impuritieswhich have accumulated in them. The wells, it may be said, are merely holes in the sandwhere a little turbid unwholesome water stagnates. Further, the women must repair to thehouse of one of their gossips who has given birth to twins, and must drench her with water,which they carry in little pitchers. Having done so they go on their way, shrieking out theirloose songs and dancing immodest dances. No man may see these leaf-clad women goingtheir rounds. If they meet a man, they maul him and thrust him aside. When they havecleansed the wells, they must go and pour water on the graves of their ancestors in thesacred grove. It often happens, too, that at the bidding of the wizard they go and pour"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"water on the graves of twins. For they think that the grave of a twin ought always to bemoist, for which reason twins are regularly buried near a lake. If all their efforts to procurerain prove abortive, they will remember that such and such a twin was buried in a dryplace on the side of a hill. “No wonder,” says the wizard in such a case, “that the sky isfiery. Take up his body and dig him a grave on the shore of the lake.” His orders are atonce obeyed, for this is supposed to be the only means of bringing down the rain.Some of the foregoing facts strongly support an interpretation which Professor Oldenberghas given of the rules to be observed by a Brahman who would learn a particular hymn ofthe ancient Indian collection known as the Samaveda. The hymn, which bears the name ofthe Sakvari song, was believed to embody the might of Indra’s weapon, the thunderbolt;and hence, on account of the dreadful and dangerous potency with which it was thuscharged, the bold student who essayed to master it had to be isolated from his fellow-men,and to retire from the village into the forest. Here for a space of time, which might vary,according to different doctors of the law, from one to twelve years, he had to observecertain rules of life, among which were the following. Thrice a day he had to touch water;he must wear black garments and eat black food; when it rained, he might not seek theshelter of a roof, but had to sit in the rain and say, “Water is the Sakvari song”; when thelightning flashed, he said, “That is like the Sakvari song”; when the thunder pealed, hesaid, “The Great One is making a great noise.” He might never cross a running streamwithout touching water; he might never set foot on a ship unless his life were in danger,and even then he must be sure to touch water when he went on board; “for in water,” soran the saying, “lies the virtue of the Sakvari song.” When at last he was allowed to learnthe song itself, he had to dip his hands in a vessel of water in which plants of all sorts hadbeen placed. If a man walked in the way of all these precepts, the rain-god Parjanya, it wassaid, would send rain at the wish of that man. It is clear, as Professor Oldenberg well pointsout, that “all these rules are intended to bring the Brahman into union with water, to makehim, as it were, an ally of the water powers, and to guard him against their hostility. Theblack garments and the black food have the same significance; no one will doubt that theyrefer to the rain-clouds when he remembers that a black victim is sacrificed to procurerain; ‘it is black, for such is the nature of rain.’ In respect of another rain-charm it is saidplainly, ‘He puts on a black garment edged with black, for such is the nature of rain.’ Wemay therefore assume that here in the circle of ideas and ordinances of the Vedic schoolsthere have been preserved magical practices of the most remote antiquity, which wereintended to prepare the rain-maker for his office and dedicate him to it.”It is interesting to observe that where an opposite result is desired, primitive logic enjoinsthe weather-doctor to observe precisely opposite rules of conduct. In the tropical island ofJava, where the rich vegetation attests the abundance of the rainfall, ceremonies for themaking of rain are rare, but ceremonies for the prevention of it are not uncommon. Whena man is about to give a great feast in the rainy season and has invited many people, hegoes to a weather-doctor and asks him to “prop up the clouds that may be lowering.” If thedoctor consents to exert his professional powers, he begins to regulate his behaviour bycertain rules as soon as his customer has departed. He must observe a fast, and may neitherdrink nor bathe; what little he eats must be eaten dry, and in no case may he touch water.The host, on his side, and his servants, both male and female, must neither wash clothesnor bathe so long as the feast lasts, and they have all during its continuance to observe"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"strict chastity. The doctor seats himself on a new mat in his bedroom, and before a smalloil-lamp he murmurs, shortly before the feast takes place, the following prayer orincantation: “Grandfather and Grandmother Sroekoel” (the name seems to be taken atrandom; others are sometimes used), “return to your country. Akkemat is your country.Put down your water-cask, close it properly, that not a drop may fall out.” While he uttersthis prayer the sorcerer looks upwards, burning incense the while. So among the Toradjasthe rain-doctor, whose special business it is to drive away rain, takes care not to touchwater before, during, or after the discharge of his professional duties. He does not bathe, heeats with unwashed hands, he drinks nothing but palm wine, and if he has to cross a streamhe is careful not to step in the water. Having thus prepared himself for his task he has asmall hut built for himself outside of the village in a rice-field, and in this hut he keeps up alittle fire, which on no account may be suffered to go out. In the fire he burns various kindsof wood, which are supposed to possess the property of driving off rain; and he puffs in thedirection from which the rain threatens to come, holding in his hand a packet of leaves andbark which derive a similar cloud-compelling virtue, not from their chemical composition,but from their names, which happen to signify something dry or volatile. If clouds shouldappear in the sky while he is at work, he takes lime in the hollow of his hand and blows ittowards them. The lime, being so very dry, is obviously well adapted to disperse the dampclouds. Should rain afterwards be wanted, he has only to pour water on his fire, andimmediately the rain will descend in sheets.The reader will observe how exactly the Javanese and Toradja observances, which areintended to prevent rain, form the antithesis of the Indian observances, which aim atproducing it. The Indian sage is commanded to touch water thrice a day regularly as wellas on various special occasions; the Javanese and Toradja wizards may not touch it at all.The Indian lives out in the forest, and even when it rains he may not take shelter; theJavanese and the Toradja sit in a house or a hut. The one signifies his sympathy with waterby receiving the rain on his person and speaking of it respectfully; the others light a lampor a fire and do their best to drive the rain away. Yet the principle on which all three act isthe same; each of them, by a sort of childish make-believe, identifies himself with thephenomenon which he desires to produce. It is the old fallacy that the effect resembles itscause: if you would make wet weather, you must be wet; if you would make dry weather,you must be dry.In South-eastern Europe at the present day ceremonies are observed for the purpose ofmaking rain which not only rest on the same general train of thought as the preceding, buteven in their details resemble the ceremonies practised with the same intention by theBaronga of Delagoa Bay. Among the Greeks of Thessaly and Macedonia, when a droughthas lasted a long time, it is customary to send a procession of children round to all the wellsand springs of the neighbourhood. At the head of the procession walks a girl adorned withflowers, whom her companions drench with water at every halting-place, while they sing aninvocation, of which the following is part:“Perperia all fresh bedewed,Freshen all the neighbourhood;By the woods, on the highway,"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"As thou goest, to God now pray:O my God, upon the plain,Send thou us a still, small rain;That the fields may fruitful be,And vines in blossom we may see;That the grain be full and sound,And wealthy grow the folks around.”In time of drought the Serbians strip a girl to her skin and clothe her from head to foot ingrass, herbs, and flowers, even her face being hidden behind a veil of living green. Thusdisguised she is called the Dodola, and goes through the village with a troop of girls. Theystop before every house; the Dodola keeps turning herself round and dancing, while theother girls form a ring about her singing one of the Dodola songs, and the housewife poursa pail of water over her. One of the songs they sing runs thus:“We go through the village;The clouds go in the sky;We go faster,Faster go the clouds;They have overtaken us,And wetted the corn and the vine.”At Poona in India, when rain is needed, the boys dress up one of their number in nothingbut leaves and call him King of Rain. Then they go round to every house in the village,where the house-holder or his wife sprinkles the Rain King with water, and gives the partyfood of various kinds. When they have thus visited all the houses, they strip the Rain Kingof his leafy robes and feast upon what they have gathered.Bathing is practised as a rain-charm in some parts of Southern and Western Russia.Sometimes after service in church the priest in his robes has been thrown down on theground and drenched with water by his parishioners. Sometimes it is the women who,without stripping off their clothes, bathe in crowds on the day of St. John the Baptist, whilethey dip in the water a figure made of branches, grass, and herbs, which is supposed torepresent the saint. In Kursk, a province of Southern Russia, when rain is much wanted,the women seize a passing stranger and throw him into the river, or souse him from head tofoot. Later on we shall see that a passing stranger is often taken for a deity or thepersonification of some natural power. It is recorded in official documents that during adrought in 1790 the peasants of Scheroutz and Werboutz collected all the women andcompelled them to bathe, in order that rain might fall. An Armenian rain-charm is tothrow the wife of a priest into the water and drench her. The Arabs of North Africa fling aholy man, willy-nilly, into a spring as a remedy for drought. In Minahassa, a province of"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"North Celebes, the priest bathes as a rain-charm. In Central Celebes when there has beenno rain for a long time and the rice-stalks begin to shrivel up, many of the villagers,especially the young folk, go to a neighbouring brook and splash each other with water,shouting noisily, or squirt water on one another through bamboo tubes. Sometimes theyimitate the plump of rain by smacking the surface of the water with their hands, or byplacing an inverted gourd on it and drumming on the gourd with their fingers.Women are sometimes supposed to be able to make rain by ploughing, or pretending toplough. Thus the Pshaws and Chewsurs of the Caucasus have a ceremony called“ploughing the rain,” which they observe in time of drought. Girls yoke themselves to aplough and drag it into a river, wading in the water up to their girdles. In the samecircumstances Armenian girls and women do the same. The oldest woman, or the priest’swife, wears the priest’s dress, while the others, dressed as men, drag the plough throughthe water against the stream. In the Caucasian province of Georgia, when a drought haslasted long, marriageable girls are yoked in couples with an ox-yoke on their shoulders, apriest holds the reins, and thus harnessed they wade through rivers, puddles, and marshes,praying, screaming, weeping, and laughing. In a district of Transylvania when the groundis parched with drought, some girls strip themselves naked, and, led by an older woman,who is also naked, they steal a harrow and carry it across the fields to a brook, where theyset it afloat. Next they sit on the harrow and keep a tiny flame burning on each corner of itfor an hour. Then they leave the harrow in the water and go home. A similar rain-charm isresorted to in some parts of India; naked women drag a plough across a field by night,while the men keep carefully out of the way, for their presence would break the spell.Sometimes the rain-charm operates through the dead. Thus in New Caledonia the rain-makers blackened themselves all over, dug up a dead body, took the bones to a cave,jointed them, and hung the skeleton over some taro leaves. Water was poured over theskeleton to run down on the leaves. They believed that the soul of the deceased took up thewater, converted it into rain, and showered it down again. In Russia, if common reportmay be believed, it is not long since the peasants of any district that chanced to be afflictedwith drought used to dig up the corpse of some one who had drunk himself to death andsink it in the nearest swamp or lake, fully persuaded that this would ensure the fall of theneeded rain. In 1868 the prospect of a bad harvest, caused by a prolonged drought, inducedthe inhabitants of a village in the Tarashchansk district to dig up the body of a Raskolnik,or Dissenter, who had died in the preceding December. Some of the party beat the corpse,or what was left of it, about the head, exclaiming, “Give us rain!” while others pouredwater on it through a sieve. Here the pouring of water through a sieve seems plainly animitation of a shower, and reminds us of the manner in which Strepsiades in Aristophanesimagined that rain was made by Zeus. Sometimes, in order to procure rain, the Toradjasmake an appeal to the pity of the dead. Thus, in the village of Kalingooa, there is the graveof a famous chief, the grandfather of the present ruler. When the land suffers fromunseasonable drought, the people go to this grave, pour water on it, and say, “Ograndfather, have pity on us; if it is your will that this year we should eat, then give rain.”After that they hang a bamboo full of water over the grave; there is a small hole in thelower end of the bamboo, so that the water drips from it continually. The bamboo is alwaysrefilled with water until rain drenches the ground. Here, as in New Caledonia, we findreligion blent with magic, for the prayer to the dead chief, which is purely religious, is eked"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"out with a magical imitation of rain at his grave. We have seen that the Baronga of DelagoaBay drench the tombs of their ancestors, especially the tombs of twins, as a raincharm.Among some of the Indian tribes in the region of the Orinoco it was customary for therelations of a deceased person to disinter his bones a year after burial, burn them, andscatter the ashes to the winds, because they believed that the ashes were changed into rain,which the dead man sent in return for his obsequies. The Chinese are convinced that whenhuman bodies remain unburied, the souls of their late owners feel the discomfort of rain,just as living men would do if they were exposed without shelter to the inclemency of theweather. These wretched souls, therefore, do all in their power to prevent the rain fromfalling, and often their efforts are only too successful. Then drought ensues, the mostdreaded of all calamities in China, because bad harvests, dearth, and famine follow in itstrain. Hence it has been a common practice of the Chinese authorities in time of drought tointer the dry bones of the unburied dead for the purpose of putting an end to the scourgeand conjuring down the rain.Animals, again, often play an important part in these weather-charms. The Anula tribe ofNorthern Australia associate the dollar-bird with rain, and call it the rain-bird. A man whohas the bird for his totem can make rain at a certain pool. He catches a snake, puts it aliveinto the pool, and after holding it under water for a time takes it out, kills it, and lays itdown by the side of the creek. Then he makes an arched bundle of grass stalks in imitationof a rainbow, and sets it up over the snake. After that all he does is to sing over the snakeand the mimic rainbow; sooner or later the rain will fall. They explain this procedure bysaying that long ago the dollar-bird had as a mate at this spot a snake, who lived in the pooland used to make rain by spitting up into the sky till a rainbow and clouds appeared andrain fell. A common way of making rain in many parts of Java is to bathe a cat or two cats,a male and a female; sometimes the animals are carried in procession with music. Even inBatavia you may from time to time see children going about with a cat for this purpose;when they have ducked it in a pool, they let it go.Among the Wambugwe of East Africa, when the sorcerer desires to make rain, he takes ablack sheep and a black calf in bright sunshine, and has them placed on the roof of thecommon hut in which the people live together. Then he slits the stomachs of the animalsand scatters their contents in all directions. After that he pours water and medicine into avessel; if the charm has succeeded, the water boils up and rain follows. On the other hand,if the sorcerer wishes to prevent rain from falling, he withdraws into the interior of the hut,and there heats a rock-crystal in a calabash. In order to procure rain the Wagogo sacrificeblack fowls, black sheep, and black cattle at the graves of dead ancestors, and the rain-maker wears black clothes during the rainy season. Among the Matabele the rain-charmemployed by sorcerers was made from the blood and gall of a black ox. In a district ofSumatra, in order to procure rain, all the women of the village, scantily clad, go to theriver, wade into it, and splash each other with the water. A black cat is thrown into thestream and made to swim about for a while, then allowed to escape to the bank, pursued bythe splashing of the women. The Garos of Assam offer a black goat on the top of a veryhigh mountain in time of drought. In all these cases the colour of the animal is part of thecharm; being black, it will darken the sky with rain-clouds. So the Bechuanas burn thestomach of an ox at evening, because they say, “The black smoke will gather the clouds andcause the rain to come.” The Timorese sacrifice a black pig to the Earth-goddess for rain, a"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"white or red one to the Sun-god for sunshine. The Angoni sacrifice a black ox for rain anda white one for fine weather. Among the high mountains of Japan there is a district inwhich, if rain has not fallen for a long time, a party of villagers goes in procession to thebed of a mountain torrent, headed by a priest, who leads a black dog. At the chosen spotthey tether the beast to a stone, and make it a target for their bullets and arrows. When itslife-blood bespatters the rocks, the peasants throw down their weapons and lift up theirvoices in supplication to the dragon divinity of the stream, exhorting him to send downforthwith a shower to cleanse the spot from its defilement. Custom has prescribed that onthese occasions the colour of the victim shall be black, as an emblem of the wished-for rain-clouds. But if fine weather is wanted, the victim must be white, without a spot.The intimate association of frogs and toads with water has earned for these creatures awidespread reputation as custodians of rain; and hence they often play a part in charmsdesigned to draw needed showers from the sky. Some of the Indians of the Orinoco held thetoad to be the god or lord of the waters, and for that reason feared to kill the creature.They have been known to keep frogs under a pot and to beat them with rods when therewas a drought. It is said that the Aymara Indians often make little images of frogs andother aquatic animals and place them on the tops of the hills as a means of bringing downrain. The Thompson Indians of British Columbia and some people in Europe think that tokill a frog will cause rain to fall. In order to procure rain people of low caste in the CentralProvinces of India will tie a frog to a rod covered with green leaves and branches of the nîmtree (Azadirachta Indica) and carry it from door to door singing:“Send soon, O frog, the jewel of water!And ripen the wheat and millet in the field.”The Kapus or Reddis are a large caste of cultivators and landowners in the MadrasPresidency. When rain fails, women of the caste will catch a frog and tie it alive to a newwinnowing fan made of bamboo. On this fan they spread a few margosa leaves and go fromdoor to door singing, “Lady frog must have her bath. Oh! rain-god, give a little water forher at least.” While the Kapu women sing this song, the woman of the house pours waterover the frog and gives an alms, convinced that by so doing she will soon bring rain downin torrents.Sometimes, when a drought has lasted a long time, people drop the usual hocus-pocus ofimitative magic altogether, and being far too angry to waste their breath in prayer theyseek by threats and curses or even downright physical force to extort the waters of heavenfrom the supernatural being who has, so to say, cut them off at the main. In a Japanesevillage, when the guardian divinity had long been deaf to the peasants’ prayers for rain,they at last threw down his image and, with curses loud and long, hurled it head foremostinto a stinking rice-field. “There,” they said, “you may stay yourself for a while, to see howyou will feel after a few days’ scorching in this broiling sun that is burning the life from ourcracking fields.” In the like circumstances the Feloupes of Senegambia cast down theirfetishes and drag them about the fields, cursing them till rain falls."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Chinese are adepts in the art of taking the kingdom of heaven by storm. Thus, whenrain is wanted they make a huge dragon of paper or wood to represent the rain-god, andcarry it about in procession; but if no rain follows, the mock-dragon is execrated and tornto pieces. At other times they threaten and beat the god if he does not give rain; sometimesthey publicly depose him from the rank of deity. On the other hand, if the wished-for rainfalls, the god is promoted to a higher rank by an imperial decree. In April 1888 themandarins of Canton prayed to the god Lung-wong to stop the incessant downpour of rain;and when he turned a deaf ear to their petitions they put him in a lock-up for five days.This had a salutary effect. The rain ceased and the god was restored to liberty. Some yearsbefore, in time of drought, the same deity had been chained and exposed to the sun for daysin the courtyard of his temple in order that he might feel for himself the urgent need ofrain. So when the Siamese need rain, they set out their idols in the blazing sun; but if theywant dry weather, they unroof the temples and let the rain pour down on the idols. Theythink that the inconvenience to which the gods are thus subjected will induce them to grantthe wishes of their worshippers.The reader may smile at the meteorology of the Far East; but precisely similar modes ofprocuring rain have been resorted to in Christian Europe within our own lifetime. By theend of April 1893 there was great distress in Sicily for lack of water. The drought hadlasted six months. Every day the sun rose and set in a sky of cloudless blue. The gardens ofthe Conca d’Oro, which surround Palermo with a magnificent belt of verdure, werewithering. Food was becoming scarce. The people were in great alarm. All the mostapproved methods of procuring rain had been tried without effect. Processions hadtraversed the streets and the fields. Men, women, and children, telling their beads, had lainwhole nights before the holy images. Consecrated candles had burned day and night in thechurches. Palm branches, blessed on Palm Sunday, had been hung on the trees. AtSolaparuta, in accordance with a very old custom, the dust swept from the churches onPalm Sunday had been spread on the fields. In ordinary years these holy sweepingspreserve the crops; but that year, if you will believe me, they had no effect whatever. AtNicosia the inhabitants, bare-headed and bare-foot, carried the crucifixes through all thewards of the town and scourged each other with iron whips. It was all in vain. Even thegreat St. Francis of Paolo himself, who annually performs the miracle of rain and is carriedevery spring through the market-gardens, either could not or would not help. Masses,vespers, concerts, illuminations, fire-works—nothing could move him. At last the peasantsbegan to lose patience. Most of the saints were banished. At Palermo they dumped St.Joseph in a garden to see the state of things for himself, and they swore to leave him therein the sun till rain fell. Other saints were turned, like naughty children, with their faces tothe wall. Others again, stripped of their beautiful robes, were exiled far from theirparishes, threatened, grossly insulted, ducked in horse-ponds. At Caltanisetta the goldenwings of St. Michael the Archangel were torn from his shoulders and replaced with wingsof pasteboard; his purple mantle was taken away and a clout wrapt about him instead. AtLicata the patron saint, St. Angelo, fared even worse, for he was left without any garmentsat all; he was reviled, he was put in irons, he was threatened with drowning or hanging.“Rain or the rope!” roared the angry people at him, as they shook their fists in his face.Sometimes an appeal is made to the pity of the gods. When their corn is being burnt up bythe sun, the Zulus look out for a “heaven bird,” kill it, and throw it into a pool. Then the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"heaven melts with tenderness for the death of the bird; “it wails for it by raining, wailing afuneral wail.” In Zululand women sometimes bury their children up to the neck in theground, and then retiring to a distance keep up a dismal howl for a long time. The sky issupposed to melt with pity at the sight. Then the women dig the children out and feel surethat rain will soon follow. They say that they call to “the lord above” and ask him to sendrain. If it comes they declare that “Usondo rains.” In times of drought the Guanches ofTeneriffe led their sheep to sacred ground, and there they separated the lambs from theirdams, that their plaintive bleating might touch the heart of the god. In Kumaon a way ofstopping rain is to pour hot oil in the left ear of a dog. The animal howls with pain, hishowls are heard by Indra, and out of pity for the beast’s sufferings the god stops the rain.Sometimes the Toradjas attempt to procure rain as follows. They place the stalks of certainplants in water, saying, “Go and ask for rain, and so long as no rain falls I will not plantyou again, but there shall you die.” Also they string some fresh-water snails on a cord, andhang the cord on a tree, and say to the snails, “Go and ask for rain, and so long as no raincomes, I will not take you back to the water.” Then the snails go and weep, and the godstake pity and send rain. However, the foregoing ceremonies are religious rather thanmagical, since they involve an appeal to the compassion of higher powers.Stones are often supposed to possess the property of bringing on rain, provided they bedipped in water or sprinkled with it, or treated in some other appropriate manner. In aSamoan village a certain stone was carefully housed as the representative of the rain-making god, and in time of drought his priests carried the stone in procession and dipped itin a stream. Among the Ta-ta-thi tribe of New South Wales, the rain-maker breaks off apiece of quartz-crystal and spits it towards the sky; the rest of the crystal he wraps in emufeathers, soaks both crystal and feathers in water, and carefully hides them. In theKeramin tribe of New South Wales the wizard retires to the bed of a creek, drops water ona round flat stone, then covers up and conceals it. Among some tribes of North-westernAustralia the rain-maker repairs to a piece of ground which is set apart for the purpose ofrain-making. There he builds a heap of stones or sand, places on the top of it his magicstone, and walks or dances round the pile chanting his incantations for hours, till sheerexhaustion obliges him to desist, when his place is taken by his assistant. Water is sprinkledon the stone and huge fires are kindled. No layman may approach the sacred spot while themystic ceremony is being performed. When the Sulka of New Britain wish to procure rainthey blacken stones with the ashes of certain fruits and set them out, along with certainother plants and buds, in the sun. Then a handful of twigs is dipped in water and weightedwith stones, while a spell is chanted. After that rain should follow. In Manipur, on a loftyhill to the east of the capital, there is a stone which the popular imagination likens to anumbrella. When rain is wanted, the rajah fetches water from a spring below and sprinklesit on the stone. At Sagami in Japan there is a stone which draws down rain whenever wateris poured on it. When the Wakondyo, a tribe of Central Africa, desire rain, they send to theWawamba, who dwell at the foot of snowy mountains, and are the happy possessors of a“rain-stone.” In consideration of a proper payment, the Wawamba wash the preciousstone, anoint it with oil, and put it in a pot full of water. After that the rain cannot fail tocome. In the arid wastes of Arizona and New Mexico the Apaches sought to make rain bycarrying water from a certain spring and throwing it on a particular point high up on arock; after that they imagined that the clouds would soon gather, and that rain wouldbegin to fall."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"But customs of this sort are not confined to the wilds of Africa and Asia or the torriddeserts of Australia and the New World. They have been practised in the cool air andunder the grey skies of Europe. There is a fountain called Barenton, of romantic fame, inthose “wild woods of Broceliande,” where, if legend be true, the wizard Merlin still sleepshis magic slumber in the hawthorn shade. Thither the Breton peasants used to resort whenthey needed rain. They caught some of the water in a tankard and threw it on a slab nearthe spring. On Snowdon there is a lonely tarn called Dulyn, or the Black Lake, lying “in adismal dingle surrounded by high and dangerous rocks.” A row of stepping-stones runs outinto the lake, and if any one steps on the stones and throws water so as to wet the fartheststone, which is called the Red Altar, “it is but a chance that you do not get rain beforenight, even when it is hot weather.” In these cases it appears probable that, as in Samoa,the stone is regarded as more or less divine. This appears from the custom sometimesobserved of dipping a cross in the Fountain of Barenton to procure rain, for this is plainly aChristian substitute for the old pagan way of throwing water on the stone. At variousplaces in France it is, or used till lately to be, the practice to dip the image of a saint inwater as a means of procuring rain. Thus, beside the old priory of Commagny, there is aspring of St. Gervais, whither the inhabitants go in procession to obtain rain or fineweather according to the needs of the crops. In times of great drought they throw into thebasin of the fountain an ancient stone image of the saint that stands in a sort of niche fromwhich the fountain flows. At Collobrières and Carpentras a similar practice was observedwith the images of St. Pons and St. Gens respectively. In several villages of Navarre prayersfor rain used to be offered to St. Peter, and by way of enforcing them the villagers carriedthe image of the saint in procession to the river, where they thrice invited him to reconsiderhis resolution and to grant their prayers; then, if he was still obstinate, they plunged him inthe water, despite the remonstrances of the clergy, who pleaded with as much truth as pietythat a simple caution or admonition administered to the image would produce an equallygood effect. After this the rain was sure to fall within twenty-four hours. Catholic countriesdo not enjoy a monopoly of making rain by ducking holy images in water. In Mingrelia,when the crops are suffering from want of rain, they take a particularly holy image and dipit in water every day till a shower falls; and in the Far East the Shans drench the images ofBuddha with water when the rice is perishing of drought. In all such cases the practice isprobably at bottom a sympathetic charm, however it may be disguised under theappearance of a punishment or a threat.Like other peoples, the Greeks and Romans sought to obtain rain by magic, when prayersand processions had proved ineffectual. For example, in Arcadia, when the corn and treeswere parched with drought, the priest of Zeus dipped an oak branch into a certain springon Mount Lycaeus. Thus troubled, the water sent up a misty cloud, from which rain soonfell upon the land. A similar mode of making rain is still practised, as we have seen, inHalmahera near New Guinea. The people of Crannon in Thessaly had a bronze chariotwhich they kept in a temple. When they desired a shower they shook the chariot and theshower fell. Probably the rattling of the chariot was meant to imitate thunder; we havealready seen that mock thunder and lightning form part of a rain-charm in Russia andJapan. The legendary Salmoneus, King of Elis, made mock thunder by dragging bronzekettles behind his chariot, or by driving over a bronze bridge, while he hurled blazingtorches in imitation of lightning. It was his impious wish to mimic the thundering car ofZeus as it rolled across the vault of heaven. Indeed he declared that he was actually Zeus,"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"and caused sacrifices to be offered to himself as such. Near a temple of Mars, outside thewalls of Rome, there was kept a certain stone known as the lapis manalis. In time ofdrought the stone was dragged into Rome, and this was supposed to bring down rainimmediately.3. The Magical Control of the SunAS THE MAGICIAN thinks he can make rain, so he fancies he can cause the sun to shine,and can hasten or stay its going down. At an eclipse the Ojebways used to imagine that thesun was being extinguished. So they shot fire-tipped arrows in the air, hoping thus torekindle his expiring light. The Sencis of Peru also shot burning arrows at the sun duringan eclipse, but apparently they did this not so much to relight his lamp as to drive away asavage beast with which they supposed him to be struggling. Conversely during an eclipseof the moon some tribes of the Orinoco used to bury lighted brands in the ground; because,said they, if the moon were to be extinguished, all fire on earth would be extinguished withher, except such as was hidden from her sight. During an eclipse of the sun theKamtchatkans were wont to bring out fire from their huts and pray the great luminary toshine as before. But the prayer addressed to the sun shows that this ceremony was religiousrather than magical. Purely magical, on the other hand, was the ceremony observed onsimilar occasions by the Chilcotin Indians. Men and women tucked up their robes, as theydo in travelling, and then leaning on staves, as if they were heavy laden, they continued towalk in a circle till the eclipse was over. Apparently they thought thus to support the failingsteps of the sun as he trod his weary round in the sky. Similarly in ancient Egypt the king,as the representative of the sun, walked solemnly round the walls of a temple in order toensure that the sun should perform his daily journey round the sky without theinterruption of an eclipse or other mishap. And after the autumnal equinox the ancientEgyptians held a festival called “the nativity of the sun’s walking-stick,” because, as theluminary declined daily in the sky, and his light and heat diminished, he was supposed toneed a staff on which to lean. In New Caledonia when a wizard desires to make sunshine,he takes some plants and corals to the burial-ground, and fashions them into a bundle,adding two locks of hair cut from a living child of his family, also two teeth or an entirejawbone from the skeleton of an ancestor. He then climbs a mountain whose top catches thefirst rays of the morning sun. Here he deposits three sorts of plants on a flat stone, places abranch of dry coral beside them, and hangs the bundle of charms over the stone. Nextmorning he returns to the spot and sets fire to the bundle at the moment when the sun risesfrom the sea. As the smoke curls up, he rubs the stone with the dry coral, invokes hisancestors and says: “Sun! I do this that you may be burning hot, and eat up all the cloudsin the sky.” The same ceremony is repeated at sunset. The New Caledonians also make adrought by means of a disc-shaped stone with a hole in it. At the moment when the sunrises, the wizard holds the stone in his hand and passes a burning brand repeatedly into thehole, while he says: “I kindle the sun, in order that he may eat up the clouds and dry upour land, so that it may produce nothing.” The Banks Islanders make sunshine by means ofa mock sun. They take a very round stone, called a vat loa or sunstone, wind red braidabout it, and stick it with owls’ feathers to represent rays, singing the proper spell in a lowvoice. Then they hang it on some high tree, such as a banyan or a casuarina, in a sacred"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"place.The offering made by the Brahman in the morning is supposed to produce the sun, and weare told that “assuredly it would not rise, were he not to make that offering.” The ancientMexicans conceived the sun as the source of all vital force; hence they named himIpalnemohuani, “He by whom men live.” But if he bestowed life on the world, he neededalso to receive life from it. And as the heart is the seat and symbol of life, bleeding hearts ofmen and animals were presented to the sun to maintain him in vigour and enable him torun his course across the sky. Thus the Mexican sacrifices to the sun were magical ratherthan religious, being designed, not so much to please and propitiate him, as physically torenew his energies of heat, light, and motion. The constant demand for human victims tofeed the solar fire was met by waging war every year on the neighbouring tribes andbringing back troops of captives to be sacrificed on the altar. Thus the ceaseless wars of theMexicans and their cruel system of human sacrifices, the most monstrous on record,sprang in great measure from a mistaken theory of the solar system. No more strikingillustration could be given of the disastrous consequences that may flow in practice from apurely speculative error. The ancient Greeks believed that the sun drove in a chariot acrossthe sky; hence the Rhodians, who worshipped the sun as their chief deity, annuallydedicated a chariot and four horses to him, and flung them into the sea for his use.Doubtless they thought that after a year’s work his old horses and chariot would be wornout. From a like motive, probably, the idolatrous kings of Judah dedicated chariots andhorses to the sun, and the Spartans, Persians, and Massagetae sacrificed horses to him. TheSpartans performed the sacrifice on the top of Mount Taygetus, the beautiful range behindwhich they saw the great luminary set every night. It was as natural for the inhabitants ofthe valley of Sparta to do this as it was for the islanders of Rhodes to throw the chariot andhorses into the sea, into which the sun seemed to them to sink at evening. For thus, whetheron the mountain or in the sea, the fresh horses stood ready for the weary god where theywould be most welcome, at the end of his day’s journey.As some people think they can light up the sun or speed him on his way, so others fancythey can retard or stop him. In a pass of the Peruvian Andes stand two ruined towers onopposite hills. Iron hooks are clamped into their walls for the purpose of stretching a netfrom one tower to the other. The net is intended to catch the sun. Stories of men who havecaught the sun in a noose are widely spread. When the sun is going southward in theautumn, and sinking lower and lower in the Arctic sky, the Esquimaux of Iglulik play thegame of cat’s cradle in order to catch him in the meshes of the string and so prevent hisdisappearance. On the contrary, when the sun is moving northward in the spring, they playthe game of cup-and-ball to hasten his return. When an Australian blackfellow wishes tostay the sun from going down till he gets home, he puts a sod in the fork of a tree, exactlyfacing the setting sun. On the other hand, to make it go down faster, the Australians throwsand into the air and blow with their mouths towards the sun, perhaps to waft the lingeringorb westward and bury it under the sands into which it appears to sink at night.As some people imagine they can hasten the sun, so others fancy they can jog the tardymoon. The natives of New Guinea reckon months by the moon, and some of them havebeen known to throw stones and spears at the moon, in order to accelerate its progress andso to hasten the return of their friends, who were away from home for twelve months"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"working on a tobacco plantation. The Malays think that a bright glow at sunset may throwa weak person into a fever. Hence they attempt to extinguish the glow by spitting out waterand throwing ashes at it. The Shuswap Indians believe that they can bring on cold weatherby burning the wood of a tree that has been struck by lightning. The belief may be based onthe observation that in their country cold follows a thunder-storm. Hence in spring, whenthese Indians are travelling over the snow on high ground, they burn splinters of suchwood in the fire in order that the crust of the snow may not melt.4. The Magical Control of the WindONCE more, the savage thinks he can make the wind to blow or to be still. When the day ishot and a Yakut has a long way to go, he takes a stone which he has chanced to find in ananimal or fish, winds a horse-hair several times round it, and ties it to a stick. He thenwaves the stick about, uttering a spell. Soon a cool breeze begins to blow. In order toprocure a cool wind for nine days the stone should first be dipped in the blood of a bird orbeast and then presented to the sun, while the sorcerer makes three turns contrary to thecourse of the luminary. If a Hottentot desires the wind to drop, he takes one of his fattestskins and hangs it on the end of a pole, in the belief that by blowing the skin down the windwill lose all its force and must itself fall. Fuegian wizards throw shells against the wind tomake it drop. The natives of the island of Bibili, off New Guinea, are reputed to make windby blowing with their mouths. In stormy weather the Bogadjim people say, “The Bibili folkare at it again, blowing away.” Another way of making wind which is practised in NewGuinea is to strike a “wind-stone” lightly with a stick; to strike it hard would bring on ahurricane. So in Scotland witches used to raise the wind by dipping a rag in water andbeating it thrice on a stone, saying:“I knok this rag upone this staneTo raise the wind in the divellis name,It sall not lye till I please againe.”In Greenland a woman in child-bed and for some time after delivery is supposed to possessthe power of laying a storm. She has only to go out of doors, fill her mouth with air, andcoming back into the house blow it out again. In antiquity there was a family at Corinthwhich enjoyed the reputation of being able to still the raging wind; but we do not know inwhat manner its members exercised a useful function, which probably earned for them amore solid recompense than mere repute among the seafaring population of the isthmus.Even in Christian times, under the reign of Constantine, a certain Sopater suffered death atConstantinople on a charge of binding the winds by magic, because it happened that thecorn-ships of Egypt and Syria were detained afar off by calms or head-winds, to the rageand disappointment of the hungry Byzantine rabble. Finnish wizards used to sell wind tostorm-stayed mariners. The wind was enclosed in three knots; if they undid the first knot, amoderate wind sprang up; if the second, it blew half a gale; if the third, a hurricane. Indeed"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"the Esthonians, whose country is divided from Finland only by an arm of the sea, stillbelieve in the magical powers of their northern neighbours. The bitter winds that blow inspring from the north and north-east, bringing ague and rheumatic inflammations in theirtrain, are set down by the simple Esthonian peasantry to the machinations of the Finnishwizards and witches. In particular they regard with special dread three days in spring towhich they give the name of Days of the Cross; one of them falls on the Eve of AscensionDay. The people in the neighbourhood of Fellin fear to go out on these days lest the cruelwinds from Lappland should smite them dead. A popular Esthonian song runs:Wind of the Cross! rushing and mighty!Heavy the blow of thy wings sweeping past!Wild wailing wind of misfortune and sorrow,Wizards of Finland ride by on the blast.It is said, too, that sailors, beating up against the wind in the Gulf of Finland, sometimes seea strange sail heave in sight astern and overhaul them hand over hand. On she comes witha cloud of canvas—all her studding-sails out—right in the teeth of the wind, forging herway through the foaming billows, dashing back the spray in sheets from her cutwater,every sail swollen to bursting, every rope strained to cracking. Then the sailors know thatshe hails from Finland.The art of tying up the wind in three knots, so that the more knots are loosed the strongerwill blow the wind, has been attributed to wizards in Lappland and to witches in Shetland,Lewis, and the Isle of Man. Shetland seamen still buy winds in the shape of knottedhandkerchiefs or threads from old women who claim to rule the storms. There are said tobe ancient crones in Lerwick now who live by selling wind. Ulysses received the winds in aleathern bag from Aeolus, King of the Winds. The Motumotu in New Guinea think thatstorms are sent by an Oiabu sorcerer; for each wind he has a bamboo which he opens atpleasure. On the top of Mount Agu in Togo, a district of West Africa, resides a fetish calledBagba, who is supposed to control the wind and the rain. His priest is said to keep thewinds shut up in great pots.Often the stormy wind is regarded as an evil being who may be intimidated, driven away,or killed. When storms and bad weather have lasted long and food is scarce with theCentral Esquimaux, they endeavour to conjure the tempest by making a long whip ofseaweed, armed with which they go down to the beach and strike out in the direction of thewind, crying “Taba (it is enough)!” Once when north-westerly winds had kept the ice longon the coast and food was becoming scarce, the Esquimaux performed a ceremony to makea calm. A fire was kindled on the shore, and the men gathered round it and chanted. An oldman then stepped up to the fire and in a coaxing voice invited the demon of the wind tocome under the fire and warm himself. When he was supposed to have arrived, a vessel ofwater, to which each man present had contributed, was thrown on the flames by an oldman, and immediately a flight of arrows sped towards the spot where the fire had been.They thought that the demon would not stay where he had been so badly treated. To"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"complete the effect, guns were discharged in various directions, and the captain of aEuropean vessel was invited to fire on the wind with cannon. On the twenty-first ofFebruary 1883 a similar ceremony was performed by the Esquimaux of Point Barrow,Alaska, with the intention of killing the spirit of the wind. Women drove the demon fromtheir houses with clubs and knives, with which they made passes in the air; and the men,gathering round a fire, shot him with their rifles and crushed him under a heavy stone themoment that steam rose in a cloud from the smouldering embers, on which a tub of waterhad just been thrown.The Lengua Indians of the Gran Chaco ascribe the rush of a whirl-wind to the passage of aspirit and they fling sticks at it to frighten it away. When the wind blows down their huts,the Payaguas of South America snatch up firebrands and run against the wind, menacing itwith the blazing brands, while others beat the air with their fists to frighten the storm.When the Guaycurus are threatened by a severe storm, the men go out armed, and thewomen and children scream their loudest to intimidate the demon. During a tempest theinhabitants of a Batak village in Sumatra have been seen to rush from their houses armedwith sword and lance. The rajah placed himself at their head, and with shouts and yellsthey hewed and hacked at the invisible foe. An old woman was observed to be speciallyactive in the defence of her house, slashing the air right and left with a long sabre. In aviolent thunderstorm, the peals sounding very near, the Kayans of Borneo have been seento draw their swords threateningly half out of their scabbards, as if to frighten away thedemons of the storm. In Australia the huge columns of red sand that move rapidly across adesert tract are thought by the natives to be spirits passing along. Once an athletic youngblack ran after one of these moving columns to kill it with boomerangs. He was away twoor three hours, and came back very weary, saying he had killed Koochee (the demon), butthat Koochee had growled at him and he must die. Of the Bedouins of Eastern Africa it issaid that “no whirl-wind ever sweeps across the path without being pursued by a dozensavages with drawn creeses, who stab into the centre of the dusty column in order to driveaway the evil spirit that is believed to be riding on the blast.”In the light of these examples a story told by Herodotus, which his modern critics havetreated as a fable, is perfectly credible. He says, without however vouching for the truth ofthe tale, that once in the land of the Psylli, the modern Tripoli, the wind blowing from theSahara had dried up all the water-tanks. So the people took counsel and marched in a bodyto make war on the south wind. But when they entered the desert the simoon swept downon them and buried them to a man. The story may well have been told by one who watchedthem disappearing, in battle array, with drums and cymbals beating, into the red cloud ofwhirling sand.VI. Magicians as KingsTHE FOREGOING evidence may satisfy us that in many lands and many races magic hasclaimed to control the great forces of nature for the good of man. If that has been so, thepractitioners of the art must necessarily be personages of importance and influence in anysociety which puts faith in their extravagant pretensions, and it would be no matter forsurprise if, by virtue of the reputation which they enjoy and of the awe which they inspire,"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"some of them should attain to the highest position of authority over their credulous fellows.In point of fact magicians appear to have often developed into chiefs and kings.Let us begin by looking at the lowest race of men as to whom we possess comparatively fulland accurate information, the aborigines of Australia. These savages are ruled neither bychiefs nor kings. So far as their tribes can be said to have a political constitution, it is ademocracy or rather an oligarchy of old and influential men, who meet in council anddecide on all measures of importance to the practical exclusion of the younger men. Theirdeliberative assembly answers to the senate of later times: if we had to coin a word for sucha government of elders we might call it a gerontocracy. The elders who in aboriginalAustralia thus meet and direct the affairs of their tribe appear to be for the most part theheadmen of their respective totem clans. Now in Central Australia, where the desert natureof the country and the almost complete isolation from foreign influences have retardedprogress and preserved the natives on the whole in their most primitive state, the headmenof the various totem clans are charged with the important task of performing magicalceremonies for the multiplication of the totems, and as the great majority of the totems areedible animals or plants, it follows that these men are commonly expected to provide thepeople with food by means of magic. Others have to make the rain to fall or to render otherservices to the community. In short, among the tribes of Central Australia the headmen arepublic magicians. Further, their most important function is to take charge of the sacredstorehouse, usually a cleft in the rocks or a hole in the ground, where are kept the holystones and sticks (churinga) with which the souls of all the people, both living and dead, areapparently supposed to be in a manner bound up. Thus while the headmen have certainlyto perform what we should call civil duties, such as to inflict punishment for breaches oftribal custom, their principal functions are sacred or magical.When we pass from Australia to New Guinea we find that, though the natives stand at a farhigher level of culture than the Australian aborigines, the constitution of society amongthem is still essentially democratic or oligarchic, and chieftainship exists only in embryo.Thus Sir William MacGregor tells us that in British New Guinea no one has ever arisenwise enough, bold enough, and strong enough to become the despot even of a single district.“The nearest approach to this has been the very distant one of some person becoming arenowned wizard; but that has only resulted in levying a certain amount of blackmail.”According to a native account, the origin of the power of Melanesian chiefs lies entirely inthe belief that they have communication with mighty ghosts, and wield that supernaturalpower whereby they can bring the influence of the ghosts to bear. If a chief imposed a fine,it was paid because the people universally dreaded his ghostly power, and firmly believedthat he could inflict calamity and sickness upon such as resisted him. As soon as anyconsiderable number of his people began to disbelieve in his influence with the ghosts, hispower to levy fines was shaken. Again, Dr. George Brown tells us that in New Britain “aruling chief was always supposed to exercise priestly functions, that is, he professed to be inconstant communication with the tebarans (spirits), and through their influence he wasenabled to bring rain or sunshine, fair winds or foul ones, sickness or health, success ordisaster in war, and generally to procure any blessing or curse for which the applicant waswilling to pay a sufficient price.”Still rising in the scale of culture we come to Africa, where both the chieftainship and the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"kingship are fully developed; and here the evidence for the evolution of the chief out of themagician, and especially out of the rain-maker, is comparatively plentiful. Thus among theWambugwe, a Bantu people of East Africa, the original form of government was a familyrepublic, but the enormous power of the sorcerers, transmitted by inheritance, soon raisedthem to the rank of petty lords or chiefs. Of the three chiefs living in the country in 1894two were much dreaded as magicians, and the wealth of cattle they possessed came to themalmost wholly in the shape of presents bestowed for their services in that capacity. Theirprincipal art was that of rain-making. The chiefs of the Wataturu, another people of EastAfrica, are said to be nothing but sorcerers destitute of any direct political influence.Again, among the Wagogo of East Africa the main power of the chiefs, we are told, isderived from their art of rain-making. If a chief cannot make rain himself, he must procureit from some one who can.Again, among the tribes of the Upper Nile the medicine-men are generally the chiefs. Theirauthority rests above all upon their supposed power of making rain, for “rain is the onething which matters to the people in those districts, as if it does not come down at the righttime it means untold hardships for the community. It is therefore small wonder that menmore cunning than their fellows should arrogate to themselves the power of producing it,or that having gained such a reputation, they should trade on the credulity of their simplerneighbours.” Hence “most of the chiefs of these tribes are rain-makers, and enjoy apopularity in proportion to their powers to give rain to their people at the proper season...Rain-making chiefs always build their villages on the slopes of a fairly high hill, as they nodoubt know that the hills attract the clouds, and that they are, therefore, fairly safe in theirweather forecasts.” Each of these rain-makers has a number of rain-stones, such as rock-crystal, aventurine, and amethyst, which he keeps in a pot. When he wishes to produce rainhe plunges the stones in water, and taking in his hand a peeled cane, which is split at thetop, he beckons with it to the clouds to come or waves them away in the way they should go,muttering an incantation the while. Or he pours water and the entrails of a sheep or goatinto a hollow in a stone and then sprinkles the water towards the sky. Though the chiefacquires wealth by the exercise of his supposed magical powers, he often, perhapsgenerally, comes to a violent end; for in time of drought the angry people assemble and killhim, believing that it is he who prevents the rain from falling. Yet the office is usuallyhereditary and passes from father to son. Among the tribes which cherish these beliefs andobserve these customs are the Latuka, Bari, Laluba, and Lokoiya.In Central Africa, again, the Lendu tribe, to the west of Lake Albert, firmly believe thatcertain people possess the power of making rain. Among them the rain-maker either is achief or almost invariably becomes one. The Banyoro also have a great respect for thedispensers of rain, whom they load with a profusion of gifts. The great dispenser, he whohas absolute and uncontrollable power over the rain, is the king; but he can depute hispower to other persons, so that the benefit may be distributed and the heavenly water laidon over the various parts of the kingdom.In Western as well as in Eastern and Central Africa we meet with the same union of chieflywith magical functions. Thus in the Fan tribe the strict distinction between chief andmedicine-man does not exist. The chief is also a medicine-man and a smith to boot; for theFans esteem the smith’s craft sacred, and none but chiefs may meddle with it."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"As to the relation between the offices of chief and rain-maker in South Africa a well-informed writer observes: “In very old days the chief was the great Rain-maker of thetribe. Some chiefs allowed no one else to compete with them, lest a successful Rain-makershould be chosen as chief. There was also another reason: the Rain-maker was sure tobecome a rich man if he gained a great reputation, and it would manifestly never do for thechief to allow any one to be too rich. The Rain-maker exerts tremendous control over thepeople, and so it would be most important to keep this function connected with royalty.Tradition always places the power of making rain as the fundamental glory of ancientchiefs and heroes, and it seems probable that it may have been the origin of chieftainship.The man who made the rain would naturally become the chief. In the same way Chaka [thefamous Zulu despot] used to declare that he was the only diviner in the country, for if heallowed rivals his life would be insecure.” Similarly speaking of the South African tribes ingeneral, Dr. Moffat says that “the rain-maker is in the estimation of the people no meanpersonage, possessing an influence over the minds of the people superior even to that of theking, who is likewise compelled to yield to the dictates of this arch-official.”The foregoing evidence renders it probable that in Africa the king has often been developedout of the public magician, and especially out of the rain-maker. The unbounded fearwhich the magician inspires and the wealth which he amasses in the exercise of hisprofession may both be supposed to have contributed to his promotion. But if the career ofa magician and especially of a rain-maker offers great rewards to the successfulpractitioner of the art, it is beset with many pitfalls into which the unskilful or unluckyartist may fall. The position of the public sorcerer is indeed a very precarious one; forwhere the people firmly believe that he has it in his power to make the rain to fall, the sunto shine, and the fruits of the earth to grow, they naturally impute drought and dearth tohis culpable negligence or wilful obstinacy, and they punish him accordingly. Hence inAfrica the chief who fails to procure rain is often exiled or killed. Thus, in some parts ofWest Africa, when prayers and offerings presented to the king have failed to procure rain,his subjects bind him with ropes and take him by force to the grave of his forefathers thathe may obtain from them the needed rain. The Banjars in West Africa ascribe to their kingthe power of causing rain or fine weather. So long as the weather is fine they load him withpresents of grain and cattle. But if long drought or rain threatens to spoil the crops, theyinsult and beat him till the weather changes. When the harvest fails or the surf on the coastis too heavy to allow of fishing, the people of Loango accuse their king of a “bad heart” anddepose him. On the Grain Coast the high priest or fetish king, who bears the title of Bodio,is responsible for the health of the community, the fertility of the earth, and the abundanceof fish in the sea and rivers; and if the country suffers in any of these respects the Bodio isdeposed from his office. In Ussukuma, a great district on the southern bank of the VictoriaNyanza, “the rain and locust question is part and parcel of the Sultan’s government. He,too, must know how to make rain and drive away the locusts. If he and his medicine-menare unable to accomplish this, his whole existence is at stake in times of distress. On acertain occasion, when the rain so greatly desired by the people did not come, the Sultanwas simply driven out (in Ututwa, near Nassa). The people, in fact, hold that rulers musthave power over Nature and her phenomena.” Again, we are told of the natives of theNyanaza region generally that “they are persuaded that rain only falls as a result of magic,and the important duty of causing it to descend devolves on the chief of the tribe. If raindoes not come at the proper time, everybody complains. More than one petty king has been"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"banished his country because of drought.” Among the Latuka of the Upper Nile, when thecrops are withering, and all the efforts of the chief to draw down rain have proved fruitless,the people commonly attack him by night, rob him of all he possesses, and drive him away.But often they kill him.In many other parts of the world kings have been expected to regulate the course of naturefor the good of their people and have been punished if they failed to do so. It appears thatthe Scythians, when food was scarce, used to put their king in bonds. In ancient Egypt thesacred kings were blamed for the failure of the crops, but the sacred beasts were also heldresponsible for the course of nature. When pestilence and other calamities had fallen on theland, in consequence of a long and severe drought, the priests took the animals by nightand threatened them, but if the evil did not abate they slew the beasts. On the coral islandof Niue ̄ or Savage Island, in the South Pacific, there formerly reigned a line of kings. Butas the kings were also high priests, and were supposed to make the food grow, the peoplebecame angry with them in times of scarcity and killed them; till at last, as one afteranother was killed, no one would be king, and the monarchy came to an end. AncientChinese writers inform us that in Corea the blame was laid on the king whenever too muchor too little rain fell and the crops did not ripen. Some said that he must be deposed, othersthat he must be slain.Among the American Indians the furthest advance towards civilisation was made under themonarchical and theocratic governments of Mexico and Peru; but we know too little of theearly history of these countries to say whether the predecessors of their deified kings weremedicine-men or not. Perhaps a trace of such a succession may be detected in the oathwhich the Mexican kings, when they mounted the throne, swore that they would make thesun to shine, the clouds to give rain, the rivers to flow, and the earth to bring forth fruits inabundance. Certainly, in aboriginal America the sorcerer or medicine-man, surrounded bya halo of mystery and an atmosphere of awe, was a personage of great influence andimportance, and he may well have developed into a chief or king in many tribes, thoughpositive evidence of such a development appears to be lacking. Thus Catlin tells us that inNorth America the medicine-men “are valued as dignitaries in the tribe, and the greatestrespect is paid to them by the whole community; not only for their skill in their materiamedica, but more especially for their tact in magic and mysteries, in which they all deal to avery great extent... . In all tribes their doctors are conjurers—are magicians—are sooth-sayers, and I had like to have said high-priests, inasmuch as they superintend and conductall their religious ceremonies; they are looked upon by all as oracles of the nation. In allcouncils of war and peace, they have a seat with the chiefs, are regularly consulted beforeany public step is taken, and the greatest deference and respect is paid to their opinions.”Similarly in California “the shaman was, and still is, perhaps the most importantindividual among the Maidu. In the absence of any definite system of government, theword of a shaman has great weight: as a class they are regarded with much awe, and as arule are obeyed much more than the chief.”In South America also the magicians or medicine-men seem to have been on the highroadto chieftainship or kingship. One of the earliest settlers on the coast of Brazil, theFrenchman Thevet, reports that the Indians “hold these pages (or medicine-men) in suchhonour and reverence that they adore, or rather idolise them. You may see the common"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"folk go to meet them, prostrate themselves, and pray to them, saying, ‘Grant that I be notill, that I do not die, neither I nor my children,’ or some such request. And he answers,‘You shall not die, you shall not be ill,’ and such like replies. But sometimes if it happensthat these pages do not tell the truth, and things turn out otherwise than they predicted, thepeople make no scruple of killing them as unworthy of the title and dignity of pages.”Among the Lengua Indians of the Gran Chaco every clan has its cazique or chief, but hepossesses little authority. In virtue of his office he has to make many presents, so he seldomgrows rich and is generally more shabbily clad than any of his subjects. “As a matter offact the magician is the man who has most power in his hands, and he is accustomed toreceive presents instead of to give them.” It is the magician’s duty to bring downmisfortune and plagues on the enemies of his tribe, and to guard his own people againsthostile magic. For these services he is well paid, and by them he acquires a position of greatinfluence and authority.Throughout the Malay region the rajah or king is commonly regarded with superstitiousveneration as the possessor of supernatural powers, and there are grounds for thinkingthat he too, like apparently so many African chiefs, has been developed out of a simplemagician. At the present day the Malays firmly believe that the king possesses a personalinfluence over the works of nature, such as the growth of the crops and the bearing of fruit-trees. The same prolific virtue is supposed to reside, though in a lesser degree, in hisdelegates, and even in the persons of Europeans who chance to have charge of districts.Thus in Selangor, one of the native states of the Malay Peninsula, the success or failure ofthe rice-crops is often attributed to a change of district officers. The Toorateyas ofSouthern Celebes hold that the prosperity of the rice depends on the behaviour of theirprinces, and that bad government, by which they mean a government which does notconform to ancient custom, will result in a failure of the crops.The Dyaks of Sarawak believed that their famous English ruler, Rajah Brooke, wasendowed with a certain magical virtue which, if properly applied, could render the rice-crops abundant. Hence when he visited a tribe, they used to bring him the seed which theyintended to sow next year, and he fertilised it by shaking over it the women’s necklaces,which had been previously dipped in a special mixture. And when he entered a village, thewomen would wash and bathe his feet, first with water, and then with the milk of a youngcoco-nut, and lastly with water again, and all this water which had touched his person theypreserved for the purpose of distributing it on their farms, believing that it ensured anabundant harvest. Tribes which were too far off for him to visit used to send him a smallpiece of white cloth and a little gold or silver, and when these things had been impregnatedby his generative virtue they buried them in their fields, and confidently expected a heavycrop. Once when a European remarked that the rice-crops of the Samban tribe were thin,the chief immediately replied that they could not be otherwise, since Rajah Brooke hadnever visited them, and he begged that Mr. Brooke might be induced to visit his tribe andremove the sterility of their land.The belief that kings possess magical or supernatural powers by virtue of which they canfertilise the earth and confer other benefits on their subjects would seem to have beenshared by the ancestors of all the Aryan races from India to Ireland, and it has left cleartraces of itself in our own country down to modern times. Thus the ancient Hindoo law-"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"book called The Laws of Manu describes as follows the effects of a good king’s reign: “Inthat country where the king avoids taking the property of mortal sinners, men are born indue time and are long-lived. And the crops of the husbandmen spring up, each as it wassown, and the children die not, and no misshaped offspring is born.” In Homeric Greecekings and chiefs were spoken of as sacred or divine; their houses, too, were divine and theirchariots sacred; and it was thought that the reign of a good king caused the black earth tobring forth wheat and barley, the trees to be loaded with fruit, the flocks to multiply, andthe sea to yield fish. In the Middle Ages, when Waldemar I., King of Denmark, travelled inGermany, mothers brought their infants and husbandmen their seed for him to lay hishands on, thinking that children would both thrive the better for the royal touch, and for alike reason farmers asked him to throw the seed for them. It was the belief of the ancientIrish that when their kings observed the customs of their ancestors, the seasons were mild,the crops plentiful, the cattle fruitful, the waters abounded with fish, and the fruit trees hadto be propped up on account of the weight of their produce. A canon attributed to St.Patrick enumerates among the blessings that attend the reign of a just king “fine weather,calm seas, crops abundant, and trees laden with fruit.” On the other hand, dearth, drynessof cows, blight of fruit, and scarcity of corn were regarded as infallible proofs that thereigning king was bad.Perhaps the last relic of such superstitions which lingered about our English kings was thenotion that they could heal scrofula by their touch. The disease was accordingly known asthe King’s Evil. Queen Elizabeth often exercised this miraculous gift of healing. OnMidsummer Day 1633, Charles the First cured a hundred patients at one swoop in thechapel royal at Holyrood. But it was under his son Charles the Second that the practiceseems to have attained its highest vogue. It is said that in the course of his reign Charles theSecond touched near a hundred thousand persons for scrofula. The press to get near himwas sometimes terrific. On one occasion six or seven of those who came to be healed weretrampled to death. The cool-headed William the Third contemptuously refused to lendhimself to the hocuspocus; and when his palace was besieged by the usual unsavourycrowd, he ordered them to be turned away with a dole. On the only occasion when he wasimportuned into laying his hand on a patient, he said to him, “God give you better healthand more sense.” However, the practice was continued, as might have been expected, by thedull bigot James the Second and his dull daughter Queen Anne.The kings of France also claimed to possess the same gift of healing by touch, which theyare said to have derived from Clovis or from St. Louis, while our English kings inherited itfrom Edward the Confessor. Similarly the savage chiefs of Tonga were believed to healscrofula and cases of indurated liver by the touch of their feet; and the cure was strictlyhomoeopathic, for the disease as well as the cure was thought to be caused by contact withthe royal person or with anything that belonged to it.On the whole, then, we seem to be justified in inferring that in many parts of the world theking is the lineal successor of the old magician or medicine-man. When once a special classof sorcerers has been segregated from the community and entrusted by it with thedischarge of duties on which the public safety and welfare are believed to depend, thesemen gradually rise to wealth and power, till their leaders blossom out into sacred kings.But the great social revolution which thus begins with democracy and ends in despotism is"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"attended by an intellectual revolution which affects both the conception and the functionsof royalty. For as time goes on, the fallacy of magic becomes more and more apparent tothe acuter minds and is slowly displaced by religion; in other words, the magician givesway to the priest, who, renouncing the attempt to control directly the processes of naturefor the good of man, seeks to attain the same end indirectly by appealing to the gods to dofor him what he no longer fancies he can do for himself. Hence the king, starting as amagician, tends gradually to exchange the practice of magic for the priestly functions ofprayer and sacrifice. And while the distinction between the human and the divine is stillimperfectly drawn, it is often imagined that men may themselves attain to godhead, notmerely after their death, but in their lifetime, through the temporary or permanentpossession of their whole nature by a great and powerful spirit. No class of the communityhas benefited so much as kings by this belief in the possible incarnation of a god in humanform. The doctrine of that incarnation, and with it the theory of the divinity of kings in thestrict sense of the word, will form the subject of the following chapter.VII. Incarnate Human GodsTHE INSTANCES which in the preceding chapters I have drawn from the beliefs andpractices of rude peoples all over the world, may suffice to prove that the savage fails torecognise those limitations to his power over nature which seem so obvious to us. In asociety where every man is supposed to be endowed more or less with powers which weshould call supernatural, it is plain that the distinction between gods and men is somewhatblurred, or rather has scarcely emerged. The conception of gods as superhuman beingsendowed with powers to which man possesses nothing comparable in degree and hardlyeven in kind, has been slowly evolved in the course of history. By primitive peoples thesupernatural agents are not regarded as greatly, if at all, superior to man; for they may befrightened and coerced by him into doing his will. At this stage of thought the world isviewed as a great democracy; all beings in it, whether natural or supernatural, aresupposed to stand on a footing of tolerable equality. But with the growth of his knowledgeman learns to realise more clearly the vastness of nature and his own littleness andfeebleness in presence of it. The recognition of his helplessness does not, however, carrywith it a corresponding belief in the impotence of those supernatural beings with which hisimagination peoples the universe. On the contrary, it enhances his conception of theirpower. For the idea of the world as a system of impersonal forces acting in accordance withfixed and invariable laws has not yet fully dawned or darkened upon him. The germ of theidea he certainly has, and he acts upon it, not only in magic art, but in much of the businessof daily life. But the idea remains undeveloped, and so far as he attempts to explain theworld he lives in, he pictures it as the manifestation of conscious will and personal agency.If then he feels himself to be so frail and slight, how vast and powerful must he deem thebeings who control the gigantic machinery of nature! Thus as his old sense of equality withthe gods slowly vanishes, he resigns at the same time the hope of directing the course ofnature by his own unaided resources, that is, by magic, and looks more and more to thegods as the sole repositories of those supernatural powers which he once claimed to sharewith them. With the advance of knowledge, therefore, prayer and sacrifice assume theleading place in religious ritual; and magic, which once ranked with them as a legitimate"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"equal, is gradually relegated to the background and sinks to the level of a black art. It isnot regarded as an encroachment, at once vain and impious, on the domain of the gods, andas such encounters the steady opposition of the priests, whose reputation and influence riseor fall with those of their gods. Hence, when at a late period the distinction between religionand superstition has emerged, we find that sacrifice and prayer are the resource of thepious and enlightened portion of the community, while magic is the refuge of thesuperstitious and ignorant. But when, still later, the conception of the elemental forces aspersonal agents is giving way to the recognition of natural law; then magic, based as itimplicitly is on the idea of a necessary and invariable sequence of cause and effect,independent of personal will, reappears from the obscurity and discredit into which it hadfallen, and by investigating the causal sequences in nature, directly prepares the way forscience. Alchemy leads up to chemistry.The notion of a man-god, or of a human being endowed with divine or supernaturalpowers, belongs essentially to that earlier period of religious history in which gods and menare still viewed as beings of much the same order, and before they are divided by theimpassable gulf which, to later thought, opens out between them. Strange, therefore, asmay seem to us the idea of a god incarnate in human form, it has nothing very startling forearly man, who sees in a man-god or a god-man only a higher degree of the samesupernatural powers which he arrogates in perfect good faith to himself. Nor does he drawany very sharp distinction between a god and a powerful sorcerer. His gods are oftenmerely invisible magicians who behind the veil of nature work the same sort of charms andincantations which the human magician works in a visible and bodily form among hisfellows. And as the gods are commonly believed to exhibit themselves in the likeness of mento their worshippers, it is easy for the magician, with his supposed miraculous powers, toacquire the reputation of being an incarnate deity. Thus beginning as little more than asimple conjurer, the medicine-man or magician tends to blossom out into a full-blown godand king in one. Only in speaking of him as a god we must beware of importing into thesavage conception of deity those very abstract and complex ideas which we attach to theterm. Our ideas on this profound subject are the fruit of a long intellectual and moralevolution, and they are so far from being shared by the savage that he cannot evenunderstand them when they are explained to him. Much of the controversy which hasraged as to the religion of the lower races has sprung merely from a mutualmisunderstanding. The savage does not understand the thoughts of the civilised man, andfew civilised men understand the thoughts of the savage. When the savage uses his word forgod, he has in his mind a being of a certain sort: when the civilised man uses his word forgod, he has in his mind a being of a very different sort; and if, as commonly happens, thetwo men are equally unable to place themselves at the other’s point of view, nothing butconfusion and mistakes can result from their discussions. If we civilised men insist onlimiting the name of God to that particular conception of the divine nature which weourselves have formed, then we must confess that the savage has no god at all. But we shalladhere more closely to the facts of history if we allow most of the higher savages at least topossess a rudimentary notion of certain supernatural beings who may fittingly be calledgods, though not in the full sense in which we use the word. That rudimentary notionrepresents in all probability the germ out of which the civilised peoples have graduallyevolved their own high conceptions of deity; and if we could trace the whole course ofreligious development, we might find that the chain which links our idea of the Godhead"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"with that of the savage is one and unbroken.With these explanations and cautions I will now adduce some examples of gods who havebeen believed by their worshippers to be incarnate in living human beings, whether men orwomen. The persons in whom a deity is thought to reveal himself are by no means alwayskings or descendants of kings; the supposed incarnation may take place even in men of thehumblest rank. In India, for example, one human god started in life as a cotton-bleacherand another as the son of a carpenter. I shall therefore not draw my examples exclusivelyfrom royal personages, as I wish to illustrate the general principle of the deification ofliving men, in other words, the incarnation of a deity in human form. Such incarnate godsare common in rude society. The incarnation may be temporary or permanent. In theformer case, the incarnation—commonly known as inspiration or possession—reveals itselfin supernatural knowledge rather than in supernatural power. In other words, its usualmanifestations are divination and prophecy rather than miracles. On the other hand, whenthe incarnation is not merely temporary, when the divine spirit has permanently taken upits abode in a human body, the god-man is usually expected to vindicate his character byworking miracles. Only we have to remember that by men at this stage of thought miraclesare not considered as breaches of natural law. Not conceiving the existence of natural law,primitive man cannot conceive a breach of it. A miracle is to him merely an unusuallystriking manifestation of a common power.The belief in temporary incarnation or inspiration is world-wide. Certain persons aresupposed to be possessed from time to time by a spirit or deity; while the possession lasts,their own personality lies in abeyance, the presence of the spirit is revealed by convulsiveshiverings and shakings of the man’s whole body, by wild gestures and excited looks, all ofwhich are referred, not to the man himself, but to the spirit which has entered into him;and in this abnormal state all his utterances are accepted as the voice of the god or spiritdwelling in him and speaking through him. Thus, for example, in the Sandwich Islands, theking, personating the god, uttered the responses of the oracle from his concealment in aframe of wicker-work. But in the southern islands of the Pacific the god “frequentlyentered the priest, who, inflated as it were with the divinity, ceased to act or speak as avoluntary agent, but moved and spoke as entirely under supernatural influence. In thisrespect there was a striking resemblance between the rude oracles of the Polynesians, andthose of the celebrated nations of ancient Greece. As soon as the god was supposed to haveentered the priest, the latter became violently agitated, and worked himself up to thehighest pitch of apparent frenzy, the muscles of the limbs seemed convulsed, the bodyswelled, the countenance became terrific, the features distorted, and the eyes wild andstrained. In this state he often rolled on the earth, foaming at the mouth, as if labouringunder the influence of the divinity by whom he was possessed, and, in shrill cries, andviolent and often indistinct sounds, revealed the will of the god. The priests, who wereattending, and versed in the mysteries, received, and reported to the people, thedeclarations which had been thus received. When the priest had uttered the response of theoracle, the violent paroxysm gradually subsided, and comparative composure ensued. Thegod did not, however, always leave him as soon as the communication had been made.Sometimes the same taura, or priest, continued for two or three days possessed by the spiritor deity; a piece of a native cloth, of a peculiar kind, worn round one arm, was anindication of inspiration, or of the indwelling of the god with the individual who wore it."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The acts of the man during this period were considered as those of the god, and hence thegreatest attention was paid to his expressions, and the whole of his deportment... Whenuruhia (under the inspiration of the spirit), the priest was always considered as sacred asthe god, and was called, during this period, atua, god, though at other times onlydenominated taura or priest.”But examples of such temporary inspiration are so common in every part of the world andare now so familiar through books on ethnology that it is needless to multiply illustrationsof the general principle. It may be well, however, to refer to two particular modes ofproducing temporary inspiration, because they are perhaps less known than some others,and because we shall have occasion to refer to them later on. One of these modes ofproducing inspiration is by sucking the fresh blood of a sacrificed victim. In the temple ofApollo Diradiotes at Argos, a lamb was sacrificed by night once a month; a woman, whohad to observe a rule of chastity, tasted the blood of the lamb, and thus being inspired bythe god she prophesied or divined. At Aegira in Achaia the priestess of Earth drank thefresh blood of a bull before she descended into the cave to prophesy. Similarly among theKuruvikkarans, a class of bird-catchers and beggars in Southern India, the goddess Kali isbelieved to descend upon the priest, and he gives oracular replies after sucking the bloodwhich streams from the cut throat of a goat. At a festival of the Alfoors of Minahassa, inNorthern Celebes, after a pig has been killed, the priest rushes furiously at it, thrusts hishead into the carcase, and drinks of the blood. Then he is dragged away from it by forceand set on a chair, whereupon he begins to prophesy how the rice-crop will turn out thatyear. A second time he runs at the carcase and drinks of the blood; a second time he isforced into the chair and continues his predictions. It is thought that there is a spirit in himwhich possesses the power of prophecy.The other mode of producing temporary inspiration, to which I shall here refer, consists inthe use of a sacred tree or plant. Thus in the Hindoo Koosh a fire is kindled with twigs ofthe sacred cedar; and the Dainyal or sibyl, with a cloth over her head, inhales the thickpungent smoke till she is seized with convulsions and falls senseless to the ground. Soon sherises and raises a shrill chant, which is caught up and loudly repeated by her audience. SoApollo’s prophetess ate the sacred laurel and was fumigated with it before she prophesied.The Bacchanals ate ivy, and their inspired fury was by some believed to be due to theexciting and intoxicating properties of the plant. In Uganda the priest, in order to beinspired by his god, smokes a pipe of tobacco fiercely till he works himself into a frenzy; theloud excited tones in which he then talks are recognised as the voice of the god speakingthrough him. In Madura, an island off the north coast of Java, each spirit has its regularmedium, who is oftener a woman than a man. To prepare herself for the reception of thespirit she inhales the fumes of incense, sitting with her head over a smoking censer.Gradually she falls into a sort of trance accompanied by shrieks, grimaces, and violentspasms. The spirit is now supposed to have entered into her, and when she grows calmerher words are regarded as oracular, being the utterances of the indwelling spirit, while herown soul is temporarily absent.The person temporarily inspired is believed to acquire, not merely divine knowledge, butalso, at least occasionally, divine power. In Cambodia, when an epidemic breaks out, theinhabitants of several villages unite and go with a band of music at their head to look for"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"the man whom the local god is supposed to have chosen for his temporary incarnation.When found, the man is conducted to the altar of the god, where the mystery of incarnationtakes place. Then the man becomes an object of veneration to his fellows, who implore himto protect the village against the plague. A certain image of Apollo, which stood in a sacredcave at Hylae near Magnesia, was thought to impart superhuman strength. Sacred men,inspired by it, leaped down precipices, tore up huge trees by the roots, and carried them ontheir backs along the narrowest defiles. The feats performed by inspired dervishes belongto the same class.Thus far we have seen that the savage, failing to discern the limits of his ability to controlnature, ascribes to himself and to all men certain powers which we should now callsupernatural. Further, we have seen that, over and above this general supernaturalism,some persons are supposed to be inspired for short periods by a divine spirit, and thustemporarily to enjoy the knowledge and power of the indwelling deity. From beliefs likethese it is an easy step to the conviction that certain men are permanently possessed by adeity, or in some other undefined way are endued with so high a degree of supernaturalpower as to be ranked as gods and to receive the homage of prayer and sacrifice.Sometimes these human gods are restricted to purely supernatural or spiritual functions.Sometimes they exercise supreme political power in addition. In the latter case they arekings as well as gods, and the government is a theocracy. Thus in the Marquesas orWashington Islands there was a class of men who were deified in their lifetime. They weresupposed to wield a supernatural power over the elements: they could give abundantharvests or smite the ground with barrenness; and they could inflict disease or death.Human sacrifices were offered to them to avert their wrath. There were not many of them,at the most one or two in each island. They lived in mystic seclusion. Their powers weresometimes, but not always, hereditary. A missionary has described one of these humangods from personal observation. The god was a very old man who lived in a large housewithin an enclosure. In the house was a kind of altar, and on the beams of the house and onthe trees round it were hung human skeletons, head down. No one entered the enclosureexcept the persons dedicated to the service of the god; only on days when human victimswere sacrificed might ordinary people penetrate into the precinct. This human godreceived more sacrifices than all the other gods; often he would sit on a sort of scaffold infront of his house and call for two or three human victims at a time. They were alwaysbrought, for the terror he inspired was extreme. He was invoked all over the island, andofferings were sent to him from every side. Again, of the South Sea Islands in general weare told that each island had a man who represented or personified the divinity. Such menwere called gods, and their substance was confounded with that of the deity. The man-godwas sometimes the king himself; oftener he was a priest or subordinate chief.The ancient Egyptians, far from restricting their adoration to cats and dogs and such smalldeer, very liberally extended it to men. One of these human deities resided at the village ofAnabis, and burnt sacrifices were offered to him on the altars; after which, says Porphyry,he would eat his dinner just as if he were an ordinary mortal. In classical antiquity theSicilian philosopher Empedocles gave himself out to be not merely a wizard but a god.Addressing his fellow-citizens in verse he said:"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"“O friends, in this great city that climbs the yellow slopeOf Agrigentum’s citadel, who make good works your scope,Who offer to the stranger a haven quiet and fair,All hail! Among you honoured I walk with lofty air.With garlands, blooming garlands you crown my noble brow,A mortal man no longer, a deathless godhead now.Where e’er I go, the people crowd round and worship pay,And thousands follow seeking to learn the better way.Some crave prophetic visions, some smit with anguish soreWould fain hear words of comfort and suffer pain no more.”He asserted that he could teach his disciples how to make the wind to blow or be still, therain to fall and the sun to shine, how to banish sickness and old age and to raise the dead.When Demetrius Poliorcetes restored the Athenian democracy in 307 B.C., the Atheniansdecreed divine honours to him and his father Antigonus, both of them being then alive,under the title of the Saviour Gods. Altars were set up to the Saviours, and a priestappointed to attend to their worship. The people went forth to meet their deliverer withhymns and dances, with garlands and incense and libations; they lined the streets and sangthat he was the only true god, for the other gods slept, or dwelt far away, or were not. Inthe words of a contemporary poet, which were chanted in public and sung in private:“Of all the gods the greatest and the dearestTo the city are come.For Demeter and DemetriusTogether time has brought.She comes to hold the Maiden’s awful rites,And he joyous and fair and laughing,As befits a god.A glorious sight, with all his friends about him,He in their midst,They like to stars, and he the sun.Son of Poseidon the mighty, Aphrodite’s son,All hail!The other gods dwell far away,Or have no ears,Or are not, or pay us no heed.But thee we present see,No god of wood or stone, but godhead true.Therefore to thee we pray.”The ancient Germans believed that there was something holy in women, and accordingly"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"consulted them as oracles. Their sacred women, we are told, looked on the eddying riversand listened to the murmur or the roar of the water, and from the sight and sound foretoldwhat would come to pass. But often the veneration of the men went further, and theyworshipped women as true and living goddesses. For example, in the reign of Vespasian acertain Veleda, of the tribe of the Bructeri, was commonly held to be a deity, and in thatcharacter reigned over her people, her sway being acknowledged far and wide. She lived ina tower on the river Lippe, a tributary of the Rhine. When the people of Cologne sent tomake a treaty with her, the ambassadors were not admitted to her presence; thenegotiations were conducted through a minister, who acted as the mouthpiece of herdivinity and reported her oracular utterances. The example shows how easily among ourrude forefathers the ideas of divinity and royalty coalesced. It is said that among the Getaedown to the beginning of our era there was always a man who personified a god and wascalled God by the people. He dwelt on a sacred mountain and acted as adviser to the king.According to the early Portuguese historian, Dos Santos, the Zimbas, or Muzimbas, apeople of South-eastern Africa, “do not adore idols or recognize any god, but instead theyvenerate and honour their king, whom they regard as a divinity, and they say he is thegreatest and best in the world. And the said king says of himself that he alone is god of theearth, for which reason if it rains when he does not wish it to do so, or is too hot, he shootsarrows at the sky for not obeying him.” The Mashona of Southern Africa informed theirbishop that they had once had a god, but that the Matabeles had driven him away. “Thislast was in reference to a curious custom in some villages of keeping a man they called theirgod. He seemed to be consulted by the people and had presents given to him. There was oneat a village belonging to a chief Magondi, in the old days. We were asked not to fire off anyguns near the village, or we should frighten him away.” This Mashona god was formerlybound to render an annual tribute to the king of the Matabele in the shape of four blackoxen and one dance. A missionary has seen and described the deity discharging the latterpart of his duty in front of the royal hut. For three mortal hours, without a break, to thebanging of a tambourine, the click of castanettes, and the drone of a monotonous song, theswarthy god engaged in a frenzied dance, crouching on his hams like a tailor, sweating likea pig, and bounding about with an agility which testified to the strength and elasticity of hisdivine legs.The Baganda of Central Africa believed in a god of Lake Nyanza, who sometimes took uphis abode in a man or woman. The incarnate god was much feared by all the people,including the king and the chiefs. When the mystery of incarnation had taken place, theman, or rather the god, removed about a mile and a half from the margin of the lake, andthere awaited the appearance of the new moon before he engaged in his sacred duties.From the moment that the crescent moon appeared faintly in the sky, the king and all hissubjects were at the command of the divine man, or Lubare (god), as he was called, whoreigned supreme not only in matters of faith and ritual, but also in questions of war andstate policy. He was consulted as an oracle; by his word he could inflict or heal sickness,withhold rain, and cause famine. Large presents were made him when his advice wassought. The chief of Urua, a large region to the west of Lake Tanganyika, “arrogates tohimself divine honours and power and pretends to abstain from food for days withoutfeeling its necessity; and, indeed, declares that as a god he is altogether above requiringfood and only eats, drinks, and smokes for the pleasure it affords him.” Among the Gallas,"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"when a woman grows tired of the cares of housekeeping, she begins to talk incoherentlyand to demean herself extravagantly. This is a sign of the descent of the holy spirit Calloupon her. Immediately her husband prostrates himself and adores her; she ceases to bearthe humble title of wife and is called “Lord”; domestic duties have no further claim on her,and her will is a divine law.The king of Loango is honoured by his people “as though he were a god; and he is calledSambee and Pango, which mean god. They believe that he can let them have rain when helikes; and once a year, in December, which is the time they want rain, the people come tobeg of him to grant it to them.” On this occasion the king, standing on his throne, shoots anarrow into the air, which is supposed to bring on rain. Much the same is said of the king ofMombasa. Down to a few years ago, when his spiritual reign on earth was brought to anabrupt end by the carnal weapons of English marines and bluejackets, the king of Beninwas the chief object of worship in his dominions. “He occupies a higher post here than thePope does in Catholic Europe; for he is not only God’s vicegerent upon earth, but a godhimself, whose subjects both obey and adore him as such, although I believe theiradoration to arise rather from fear than love.” The king of Iddah told the English officersof the Niger Expedition, “God made me after his own image; I am all the same as God; andhe appointed me a king.”A peculiarly bloodthirsty monarch of Burma, by name Badonsachen, whose verycountenance reflected the inbred ferocity of his nature, and under whose reign morevictims perished by the executioner than by the common enemy, conceived the notion thathe was something more than mortal, and that this high distinction had been granted him asa reward for his numerous good works. Accordingly he laid aside the title of king andaimed at making himself a god. With this view, and in imitation of Buddha, who, beforebeing advanced to the rank of a divinity, had quitted his royal palace and seraglio andretired from the world, Badonsachen withdrew from his palace to an immense pagoda, thelargest in the empire, which he had been engaged in constructing for many years. Here heheld conferences with the most learned monks, in which he sought to persuade them thatthe five thousand years assigned for the observance of the law of Buddha were now elapsed,and that he himself was the god who was destined to appear after that period, and toabolish the old law by substituting his own. But to his great mortification many of themonks undertook to demonstrate the contrary; and this disappointment, combined with hislove of power and his impatience under the restraints of an ascetic life, quickly disabusedhim of his imaginary godhead, and drove him back to his palace and his harem. The kingof Siam “is venerated equally with a divinity. His subjects ought not to look him in the face;they prostrate themselves before him when he passes, and appear before him on theirknees, their elbows resting on the ground.” There is a special language devoted to hissacred person and attributes, and it must be used by all who speak to or of him. Even thenatives have difficulty in mastering this peculiar vocabulary. The hairs of the monarch’shead, the soles of his feet, the breath of his body, indeed every single detail of his person,both outward and inward, have particular names. When he eats or drinks, sleeps or walks,a special word indicates that these acts are being performed by the sovereign, and suchwords cannot possibly be applied to the acts of any other person whatever. There is noword in the Siamese language by which any creature of higher rank or greater dignity thana monarch can be described; and the missionaries, when they speak of God, are forced to"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"use the native word for king.But perhaps no country in the world has been so prolific of human gods as India; nowherehas the divine grace been poured out in a more liberal measure on all classes of societyfrom kings down to milkmen. Thus amongst the Todas, a pastoral people of the NeilgherryHills of Southern India, the dairy is a sanctuary, and the milkman who attends to it hasbeen described as a god. On being asked whether the Todas salute the sun, one of thesedivine milkmen replied, “Those poor fellows do so, but I,” tapping his chest, “I, a god! whyshould I salute the sun?” Every one, even his own father, prostrates himself before themilkman, and no one would dare to refuse him anything. No human being, except anothermilkman, may touch him; and he gives oracles to all who consult him, speaking with thevoice of a god.Further, in India “every king is regarded as little short of a present god.” The Hindoo law-book of Manu goes farther and says that “even an infant king must not be despised from anidea that he is a mere mortal; for he is a great deity in human form.” There is said to havebeen a sect in Orissa some years ago who worshipped the late Queen Victoria in herlifetime as their chief divinity. And to this day in India all living persons remarkable forgreat strength or valour or for supposed miraculous powers run the risk of beingworshipped as gods. Thus, a sect in the Punjaub worshipped a deity whom they calledNikkal Sen. This Nikkal Sen was no other than the redoubted General Nicholson, andnothing that the general could do or say damped the ardour of his adorers. The more hepunished them, the greater grew the religious awe with which they worshipped him. AtBenares not many years ago a celebrated deity was incarnate in the person of a Hindoogentleman who rejoiced in the euphonious name of Swami Bhaskaranandaji Saraswati,and looked uncommonly like the late Cardinal Manning, only more ingenuous. His eyesbeamed with kindly human interest, and he took what is described as an innocent pleasurein the divine honours paid him by his confiding worshippers.At Chinchvad, a small town about ten miles from Poona in Western India, there lives afamily of whom one in each generation is believed by a large proportion of the Mahrattasto be an incarnation of the elephant-headed god Gunputty. That celebrated deity was firstmade flesh about the year 1640 in the person of a Brahman of Poona, by name MoorabaGosseyn, who sought to work out his salvation by abstinence, mortification, and prayer.His piety had its reward. The god himself appeared to him in a vision of the night andpromised that a portion of his, that is, of Gunputty’s holy spirit should abide with him andwith his seed after him even to the seventh generation. The divine promise was fulfilled.Seven successive incarnations, transmitted from father to son, manifested the light ofGunputty to a dark world. The last of the direct line, a heavy-looking god with very weakeyes, died in the year 1810. But the cause of truth was too sacred, and the value of thechurch property too considerable, to allow the Brahmans to contemplate with equanimitythe unspeakable loss that would be sustained by a world which knew not Gunputty.Accordingly they sought and found a holy vessel in whom the divine spirit of the masterhad revealed itself anew, and the revelation has been happily continued in an unbrokensuccession of vessels from that time to this. But a mysterious law of spiritual economy,whose operation in the history of religion we may deplore though we cannot alter, hasdecreed that the miracles wrought by the god-man in these degenerate days cannot"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"compare with those which were wrought by his predecessors in days gone by; and it is evenreported that the only sign vouchsafed by him to the present generation of vipers is themiracle of feeding the multitude whom he annually entertains to dinner at Chinchvad.A Hindoo sect, which has many representatives in Bombay and Central India, holds that itsspiritual chiefs or Maharajas, as they are called, are representatives or even actualincarnations on earth of the god Krishna. And as Krishna looks down from heaven withmost favour on such as minister to the wants of his successors and vicars on earth, apeculiar rite called Self-devotion has been instituted, whereby his faithful worshippersmake over their bodies, their souls, and, what is perhaps still more important, their worldlysubstance to his adorable incarnations; and women are taught to believe that the highestbliss for themselves and their families is to be attained by yielding themselves to theembraces of those beings in whom the divine nature mysteriously coexists with the formand even the appetites of true humanity.Christianity itself has not uniformly escaped the taint of these unhappy delusions; indeed ithas often been sullied by the extravagances of vain pretenders to a divinity equal to or evensurpassing that of its great Founder. In the second century Montanus the Phrygian claimedto be the incarnate Trinity, uniting in his single person God the Father, God the Son, andGod the Holy Ghost. Nor is this an isolated case, the exorbitant pretension of a single ill-balanced mind. From the earliest times down to the present day many sects have believedthat Christ, nay God himself, is incarnate in every fully initiated Christian, and they havecarried this belief to its logical conclusion by adoring each other. Tertullian records thatthis was done by his fellow-Christians at Carthage in the second century; the disciples ofSt. Columba worshipped him as an embodiment of Christ; and in the eighth centuryElipandus of Toledo spoke of Christ as “a god among gods,” meaning that all believerswere gods just as truly as Jesus himself. The adoration of each other was customary amongthe Albigenses, and is noticed hundreds of times in the records of the Inquisition atToulouse in the early part of the fourteenth century.In the thirteenth century there arose a sect called the Brethren and Sisters of the FreeSpirit, who held that by long and assiduous contemplation any man might be united to thedeity in an ineffable manner and become one with the source and parent of all things, andthat he who had thus ascended to God and been absorbed in his beatific essence, actuallyformed part of the Godhead, was the Son of God in the same sense and manner with Christhimself, and enjoyed thereby a glorious immunity from the trammels of all laws humanand divine. Inwardly transported by this blissful persuasion, though outwardly presentingin their aspect and manners a shocking air of lunacy and distraction, the sectaries roamedfrom place to place, attired in the most fantastic apparel and begging their bread with wildshouts and clamour, spurning indignantly every kind of honest labour and industry as anobstacle to divine contemplation and to the ascent of the soul towards the Father of spirits.In all their excursions they were followed by women with whom they lived on terms of theclosest familiarity. Those of them who conceived they had made the greatest proficiency inthe higher spiritual life dispensed with the use of clothes altogether in their assemblies,looking upon decency and modesty as marks of inward corruption, characteristics of a soulthat still grovelled under the dominion of the flesh and had not yet been elevated intocommunion with the divine spirit, its centre and source. Sometimes their progress towards"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"this mystic communion was accelerated by the Inquisition, and they expired in the flames,not merely with unclouded serenity, but with the most triumphant feelings of cheerfulnessand joy.About the year 1830 there appeared, in one of the States of the American Union borderingon Kentucky, an impostor who declared that he was the Son of God, the Saviour ofmankind, and that he had reappeared on earth to recall the impious, the unbelieving, andsinners to their duty. He protested that if they did not mend their ways within a certaintime, he would give the signal, and in a moment the world would crumble to ruins. Theseextravagant pretensions were received with favour even by persons of wealth and positionin society. At last a German humbly besought the new Messiah to announce the dreadfulcatastrophe to his fellow-countrymen in the German language, as they did not understandEnglish, and it seemed a pity that they should be damned merely on that account. Thewould-be Saviour in reply confessed with great candour that he did not know German.“What!” retorted the German, “you the Son of God, and don’t speak all languages, anddon’t even know German? Come, come, you are a knave, a hypocrite, and a madman.Bedlam is the place for you.” The spectators laughed, and went away ashamed of theircredulity.Sometimes, at the death of the human incarnation, the divine spirit transmigrates intoanother man. The Buddhist Tartars believe in a great number of living Buddhas, whoofficiate as Grand Lamas at the head of the most important monasteries. When one of theseGrand Lamas dies his disciples do not sorrow, for they know that he will soon reappear,being born in the form of an infant. Their only anxiety is to discover the place of his birth.If at this time they see a rainbow they take it as a sign sent them by the departed Lama toguide them to his cradle. Sometimes the divine infant himself reveals his identity. “I am theGrand Lama,” he says, “the living Buddha of such and such a temple. Take me to my oldmonastery. I am its immortal head.” In whatever way the birthplace of the Buddha isrevealed, whether by the Buddha’s own avowal or by the sign in the sky, tents are struck,and the joyful pilgrims, often headed by the king or one of the most illustrious of the royalfamily, set forth to find and bring home the infant god. Generally he is born in Tibet, theholy land, and to reach him the caravan has often to traverse the most frightful deserts.When at last they find the child they fall down and worship him. Before, however, he isacknowledged as the Grand Lama whom they seek he must satisfy them of his identity. Heis asked the name of the monastery of which he claims to be the head, how far off it is, andhow many monks live in it; he must also describe the habits of the deceased Grand Lamaand the manner of his death. Then various articles, as prayer-books, tea-pots, and cups, areplaced before him, and he has to point out those used by himself in his previous life. If hedoes so without a mistake his claims are admitted, and he is conducted in triumph to themonastery. At the head of all the Lamas is the Dalai Lama of Lhasa, the Rome of Tibet. Heis regarded as a living god, and at death his divine and immortal spirit is born again in achild. According to some accounts the mode of discovering the Dalai Lama is similar to themethod, already described, of discovering an ordinary Grand Lama. Other accounts speakof an election by drawing lots from a golden jar. Wherever he is born, the trees and plantsput forth green leaves; at his bidding flowers bloom and springs of water rise; and hispresence diffuses heavenly blessings."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"But he is by no means the only man who poses as a god in these regions. A register of all theincarnate gods in the Chinese empire is kept in the Li fan yiian or Colonial Office atPeking. The number of gods who have thus taken out a license is one hundred and sixty.Tibet is blessed with thirty of them, Northern Mongolia rejoices in nineteen, and SouthernMongolia basks in the sunshine of no less than fifty-seven. The Chinese government, with apaternal solicitude for the welfare of its subjects, forbids the gods on the register to bereborn anywhere but in Tibet. They fear lest the birth of a god in Mongolia should haveserious political consequences by stirring the dormant patriotism and warlike spirit of theMongols, who might rally round an ambitious native deity of royal lineage and seek to winfor him, at the point of the sword, a temporal as well as a spiritual kingdom. But besidesthese public or licensed gods there are a great many little private gods, or unlicensedpractitioners of divinity, who work miracles and bless their people in holes and corners;and of late years the Chinese government has winked at the rebirth of these pettifoggingdeities outside of Tibet. However, once they are born, the government keeps its eye on themas well as on the regular practitioners, and if any of them misbehaves he is promptlydegraded, banished to a distant monastery, and strictly forbidden ever to be born again inthe flesh.From our survey of the religious position occupied by the king in rude societies we mayinfer that the claim to divine and supernatural powers put forward by the monarchs ofgreat historical empires like those of Egypt, Mexico, and Peru, was not the simple outcomeof inflated vanity or the empty expression of a grovelling adulation; it was merely asurvival and extension of the old savage apotheosis of living kings. Thus, for example, aschildren of the Sun the Incas of Peru were revered like gods; they could do no wrong, andno one dreamed of offending against the person, honour, or property of the monarch or ofany of the royal race. Hence, too, the Incas did not, like most people, look on sickness as anevil. They considered it a messenger sent from their father the Sun to call them to come andrest with him in heaven. Therefore the usual words in which an Inca announced hisapproaching end were these: “My father calls me to come and rest with him.” They wouldnot oppose their father’s will by offering sacrifice for recovery, but openly declared that hehad called them to his rest. Issuing from the sultry valleys upon the lofty tableland of theColombian Andes, the Spanish conquerors were astonished to find, in contrast to thesavage hordes they had left in the sweltering jungles below, a people enjoying a fair degreeof civilisation, practising agriculture, and living under a government which Humboldt hascompared to the theocracies of Tibet and Japan. These were the Chibchas, Muyscas, orMozcas, divided into two kingdoms, with capitals at Bogota and Tunja, but unitedapparently in spiritual allegiance to the high pontiff of Sogamozo or Iraca. By a long andascetic novitiate, this ghostly ruler was reputed to have acquired such sanctity that thewaters and the rain obeyed him, and the weather depended on his will. The Mexican kingsat their accession, as we have seen, took an oath that they would make the sun to shine, theclouds to give rain, the rivers to flow, and the earth to bring forth fruits in abundance. Weare told that Montezuma, the last king of Mexico, was worshipped by his people as a god.The early Babylonian kings, from the time of Sargon I. till the fourth dynasty of Ur orlater, claimed to be gods in their lifetime. The monarchs of the fourth dynasty of Ur inparticular had temples built in their honour; they set up their statues in varioussanctuaries and commanded the people to sacrifice to them; the eighth month was"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"especially dedicated to the kings, and sacrifices were offered to them at the new moon andon the fifteenth of each month. Again, the Parthian monarchs of the Arsacid house styledthemselves brothers of the sun and moon and were worshipped as deities. It was esteemedsacrilege to strike even a private member of the Arsacid family in a brawl.The kings of Egypt were deified in their lifetime, sacrifices were offered to them, and theirworship was celebrated in special temples and by special priests. Indeed the worship of thekings sometimes cast that of the gods into the shade. Thus in the reign of Merenra a highofficial declared that he had built many holy places in order that the spirits of the king, theever-living Merenra, might be invoked “more than all the gods.” “It has never beendoubted that the king claimed actual divinity; he was the ‘great god,’ the‘golden Horus,’and son of Ra. He claimed authority not only over Egypt, but over‘all lands andnations,’‘the whole world in its length and its breadth, the east and the west,’‘the entirecompass of the great circuit of the sun,’‘the sky and what is in it, the earth and all that isupon it,’‘every creature that walks upon two or upon four legs, all that fly or flutter, thewhole world offers her productions to him.’ Whatever in fact might be asserted of the Sun-god, was dogmatically predicable of the king of Egypt. His titles were directly derived fromthose of the Sun-god.” “In the course of his existence,” we are told, “the king of Egyptexhausted all the possible conceptions of divinity which the Egyptians had framed forthemselves. A superhuman god by his birth and by his royal office, he became the deifiedman after his death. Thus all that was known of the divine was summed up in him.”We have now completed our sketch, for it is no more than a sketch, of the evolution of thatsacred kingship which attained its highest form, its most absolute expression, in themonarchies of Peru and Egypt. Historically, the institution appears to have originated inthe order of public magicians or medicine-men; logically it rests on a mistaken deductionfrom the association of ideas. Men mistook the order of their ideas for the order of nature,and hence imagined that the control which they have, or seem to have, over their thoughts,permitted them to exercise a corresponding control over things. The men who for onereason or another, because of the strength or the weakness of their natural parts, weresupposed to possess these magical powers in the highest degree, were gradually marked offfrom their fellows and became a separate class, who were destined to exercise a most far-reaching influence on the political, religious, and intellectual evolution of mankind. Socialprogress, as we know, consists mainly in a successive differentiation of functions, or, insimpler language, a division of labour. The work which in primitive society is done by allalike and by all equally ill, or nearly so, is gradually distributed among different classes ofworkers and executed more and more perfectly; and so far as the products, material orimmaterial, of this specialised labour are shared by all, the whole community benefits bythe increasing specialisation. Now magicians or medicine-men appear to constitute theoldest artificial or professional class in the evolution of society. For sorcerers are found inevery savage tribe known to us; and among the lowest savages, such as the Australianaborigines, they are the only professional class that exists. As time goes on, and the processof differentiation continues, the order of medicine-men is itself subdivided into such classesas the healers of disease, the makers of rain, and so forth; while the most powerful memberof the order wins for himself a position as chief and gradually develops into a sacred king,his old magical functions falling more and more into the background and being exchangedfor priestly or even divine duties, in proportion as magic is slowly ousted by religion. Still"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"later, a partition is effected between the civil and the religious aspect of the kingship, thetemporal power being committed to one man and the spiritual to another. Meanwhile themagicians, who may be repressed but cannot be extirpated by the predominance ofreligion, still addict themselves to their old occult arts in preference to the newer ritual ofsacrifice and prayer; and in time the more sagacious of their number perceive the fallacy ofmagic and hit upon a more effectual mode of manipulating the forces of nature for the goodof man; in short, they abandon sorcery for science. I am far from affirming that the courseof development has everywhere rigidly followed these lines: it has doubtless varied greatlyin different societies. I merely mean to indicate in the broadest outline what I conceive tohave been its general trend. Regarded from the industrial point of view the evolution hasbeen from uniformity to diversity of function: regarded from the political point of view, ithas been from democracy to despotism. With the later history of monarchy, especially withthe decay of despotism and its displacement by forms of government better adapted to thehigher needs of humanity, we are not concerned in this enquiry: our theme is the growth,not the decay, of a great and, in its time, beneficent institution.VIII. Departmental Kings of NatureTHE PRECEDING investigation has proved that the same union of sacred functions with aroyal title which meets us in the King of the Wood at Nemi, the Sacrificial King at Rome,and the magistrate called the King at Athens, occurs frequently outside the limits ofclassical antiquity and is a common feature of societies at all stages from barbarism tocivilisation. Further, it appears that the royal priest is often a king, not only in name but infact, swaying the sceptre as well as the crosier. All this confirms the traditional view of theorigin of the titular and priestly kings in the republics of ancient Greece and Italy. At leastby showing that the combination of spiritual and temporal power, of which Graeco-Italiantradition preserved the memory, has actually existed in many places, we have obviated anysuspicion of improbability that might have attached to the tradition. Therefore we maynow fairly ask, May not the King of the Wood have had an origin like that which aprobable tradition assigns to the Sacrificial King of Rome and the titular King of Athens?In other words, may not his predecessors in office have been a line of kings whom arepublican revolution stripped of their political power, leaving them only their religiousfunctions and the shadow of a crown? There are at least two reasons for answering thisquestion in the negative. One reason is drawn from the abode of the priest of Nemi; theother from his title, the King of the Wood. If his predecessors had been kings in theordinary sense, he would surely have been found residing, like the fallen kings of Rome andAthens, in the city of which the sceptre had passed from him. This city must have beenAricia, for there was none nearer. But Aricia was three miles off from his forest sanctuaryby the lake shore. If he reigned, it was not in the city, but in the greenwood. Again his title,King of the Wood, hardly allows us to suppose that he had ever been a king in the commonsense of the word. More likely he was a king of nature, and of a special side of nature,namely, the woods from which he took his title. If we could find instances of what we maycall departmental kings of nature, that is of persons supposed to rule over particularelements or aspects of nature, they would probably present a closer analogy to the King ofthe Wood than the divine kings we have been hitherto considering, whose control of nature"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"is general rather than special. Instances of such departmental kings are not wanting.On a hill at Bomma near the mouth of the Congo dwells Namvulu Vumu, King of the Rainand Storm. Of some of the tribes on the Upper Nile we are told that they have no kings inthe common sense; the only persons whom they acknowledge as such are the Kings of theRain, Mata Kodou, who are credited with the power of giving rain at the proper time, thatis, the rainy season. Before the rains begin to fall at the end of March the country is aparched and arid desert; and the cattle, which form the people’s chief wealth, perish forlack of grass. So, when the end of March draws on, each householder betakes himself to theKing of the Rain and offers him a cow that he may make the blessed waters of heaven todrip on the brown and withered pastures. If no shower falls, the people assemble anddemand that the king shall give them rain; and if the sky still continues cloudless, they ripup his belly, in which he is believed to keep the storms. Amongst the Bari tribe one of theseRain Kings made rain by sprinkling water on the ground out of a handbell.Among tribes on the outskirts of Abyssinia a similar office exists and has been thusdescribed by an observer: “The priesthood of the Alfai, as he is called by the Barea andKunama, is a remarkable one; he is believed to be able to make rain. This office formerlyexisted among the Algeds and appears to be still common to the Nuba negroes. The Alfai ofthe Barea, who is also consulted by the northern Kunama, lives near Tembadere on amountain alone with his family. The people bring him tribute in the form of clothes andfruits, and cultivate for him a large field of his own. He is a kind of king, and his officepasses by inheritance to his brother or sister’s son. He is supposed to conjure down rainand to drive away the locusts. But if he disappoints the people’s expectation and a greatdrought arises in the land, the Alfai is stoned to death, and his nearest relations are obligedto cast the first stone at him. When we passed through the country, the office of Alfai wasstill held by an old man; but I heard that rain-making had proved too dangerous for himand that he had renounced his office.”In the backwoods of Cambodia live two mysterious sovereigns known as the King of theFire and the King of the Water. Their fame is spread all over the south of the great Indo-Chinese peninsula; but only a faint echo of it has reached the West. Down to a few yearsago no European, so far as is known, had ever seen either of them; and their very existencemight have passed for a fable, were it not that till lately communications were regularlymaintained between them and the King of Cambodia, who year by year exchanged presentswith them. Their royal functions are of a purely mystic or spiritual order; they have nopolitical authority; they are simple peasants, living by the sweat of their brow and theofferings of the faithful. According to one account they live in absolute solitude, nevermeeting each other and never seeing a human face. They inhabit successively seven towersperched upon seven mountains, and every year they pass from one tower to another. Peoplecome furtively and cast within their reach what is needful for their subsistence. Thekingship lasts seven years, the time necessary to inhabit all the towers successively; butmany die before their time is out. The offices are hereditary in one or (according to others)two royal families, who enjoy high consideration, have revenues assigned to them, and areexempt from the necessity of tilling the ground. But naturally the dignity is not coveted,and when a vacancy occurs, all eligible men (they must be strong and have children) fleeand hide themselves. Another account, admitting the reluctance of the hereditary"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"candidates to accept the crown, does not countenance the report of their hermit-likeseclusion in the seven towers. For it represents the people as prostrating themselves beforethe mystic kings whenever they appear in public, it being thought that a terrible hurricanewould burst over the country if this mark of homage were omitted. Like many other sacredkings, of whom we shall read in the sequel, the Kings of Fire and Water are not allowed todie a natural death, for that would lower their reputation. Accordingly when one of them isseriously ill, the elders hold a consultation and if they think he cannot recover they stabhim to death. His body is burned and the ashes are piously collected and publicly honouredfor five years. Part of them is given to the widow, and she keeps them in an urn, which shemust carry on her back when she goes to weep on her husband’s grave.We are told that the Fire King, the more important of the two, whose supernatural powershave never been questioned, officiates at marriages, festivals, and sacrifices in honour ofthe Yan or spirit. On these occasions a special place is set apart for him; and the path bywhich he approaches is spread with white cotton cloths. A reason for confining the royaldignity to the same family is that this family is in possession of certain famous talismanswhich would lose their virtue or disappear if they passed out of the family. These talismansare three: the fruit of a creeper called Cui, gathered ages ago at the time of the last deluge,but still fresh and green; a rattan, also very old but bearing flowers that never fade; andlastly, a sword containing a Yan or spirit, who guards it constantly and works miracles withit. The spirit is said to be that of a slave, whose blood chanced to fall upon the blade while itwas being forged, and who died a voluntary death to expiate his involuntary offence. Bymeans of the two former talismans the Water King can raise a flood that would drown thewhole earth. If the Fire King draws the magic sword a few inches from its sheath, the sun ishidden and men and beasts fall into a profound sleep; were he to draw it quite out of thescabbard, the world would come to an end. To this wondrous brand sacrifices of buffaloes,pigs, fowls, and ducks are offered for rain. It is kept swathed in cotton and silk; andamongst the annual presents sent by the King of Cambodia were rich stuffs to wrap thesacred sword.Contrary to the common usage of the country, which is to bury the dead, the bodies of boththese mystic monarchs are burnt, but their nails and some of their teeth and bones arereligiously preserved as amulets. It is while the corpse is being consumed on the pyre thatthe kinsmen of the deceased magician flee to the forest and hide themselves, for fear ofbeing elevated to the invidious dignity which he has just vacated. The people go and searchfor them, and the first whose lurking place they discover is made King of Fire or Water.These, then, are examples of what I have called departmental kings of nature. But it is a farcry to Italy from the forests of Cambodia and the sources of the Nile. And though Kings ofRain, Water, and Fire have been found, we have still to discover a King of the Wood tomatch the Arician priest who bore that title. Perhaps we shall find him nearer home.IX. The Worship of Trees"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"1. Tree-spiritsIN THE RELIGIOUS history of the Aryan race in Europe the worship of trees has playedan important part. Nothing could be more natural. For at the dawn of history Europe wascovered with immense primaeval forests, in which the scattered clearings must haveappeared like islets in an ocean of green. Down to the first century before our era theHercynian forest stretched eastward from the Rhine for a distance at once vast andunknown; Germans whom Caesar questioned had travelled for two months through itwithout reaching the end. Four centuries later it was visited by the Emperor Julian, andthe solitude, the gloom, the silence of the forest appear to have made a deep impression onhis sensitive nature. He declared that he knew nothing like it in the Roman empire. In ourown country the wealds of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex are remnants of the great forest ofAnderida, which once clothed the whole of the south-eastern portion of the island.Westward it seems to have stretched till it joined another forest that extended fromHampshire to Devon. In the reign of Henry II. the citizens of London still hunted the wildbull and the boar in the woods of Hampstead. Even under the later Plantagenets the royalforests were sixty-eight in number. In the forest of Arden it was said that down to moderntimes a squirrel might leap from tree to tree for nearly the whole length of Warwickshire.The excavation of ancient pile-villages in the valley of the Po has shown that long before therise and probably the foundation of Rome the north of Italy was covered with dense woodsof elms, chestnuts, and especially of oaks. Archaeology is here confirmed by history; forclassical writers contain many references to Italian forests which have now disappeared. Aslate as the fourth century before our era Rome was divided from central Etruria by thedreaded Ciminian forest, which Livy compares to the woods of Germany. No merchant, ifwe may trust the Roman historian, had ever penetrated its pathless solitudes; and it wasdeemed a most daring feat when a Roman general, after sending two scouts to explore itsintricacies, led his army into the forest and, making his way to a ridge of the woodedmountains, looked down on the rich Etrurian fields spread out below. In Greece beautifulwoods of pine, oak, and other trees still linger on the slopes of the high Arcadianmountains, still adorn with their verdure the deep gorge through which the Ladon hurriesto join the sacred Alpheus, and were still, down to a few years ago, mirrored in the darkblue waters of the lonely lake of Pheneus; but they are mere fragments of the forests whichclothed great tracts in antiquity, and which at a more remote epoch may have spanned theGreek peninsula from sea to sea.From an examination of the Teutonic words for “temple” Grimm has made it probablethat amongst the Germans the oldest sanctuaries were natural woods. However that maybe, tree-worship is well attested for all the great European families of the Aryan stock.Amongst the Celts the oak-worship of the Druids is familiar to every one, and their oldword for sanctuary seems to be identical in origin and meaning with the Latin nemus, agrove or woodland glade, which still survives in the name of Nemi. Sacred groves werecommon among the ancient Germans, and tree-worship is hardly extinct amongst theirdescendants at the present day. How serious that worship was in former times may begathered from the ferocious penalty appointed by the old German laws for such as dared topeel the bark of a standing tree. The culprit’s navel was to be cut out and nailed to the partof the tree which he had peeled, and he was to be driven round and round the tree till allhis guts were wound about its trunk. The intention of the punishment clearly was to"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"replace the dead bark by a living substitute taken from the culprit; it was a life for a life,the life of a man for the life of a tree. At Upsala, the old religious capital of Sweden, therewas a sacred grove in which every tree was regarded as divine. The heathen Slavsworshipped trees and groves. The Lithuanians were not converted to Christianity tilltowards the close of the fourteenth century, and amongst them at the date of theirconversion the worship of trees was prominent. Some of them revered remarkable oaksand other great shady trees, from which they received oracular responses. Somemaintained holy groves about their villages or houses, where even to break a twig wouldhave been a sin. They thought that he who cut a bough in such a grove either died suddenlyor was crippled in one of his limbs. Proofs of the prevalence of tree-worship in ancientGreece and Italy are abundant. In the sanctuary of Aesculapius at Cos, for example, it wasforbidden to cut down the cypress-trees under a penalty of a thousand drachms. Butnowhere, perhaps, in the ancient world was this antique form of religion better preservedthan in the heart of the great metropolis itself. In the Forum, the busy centre of Roman life,the sacred fig-tree of Romulus was worshipped down to the days of the empire, and thewithering of its trunk was enough to spread consternation through the city. Again, on theslope of the Palatine Hill grew a cornel-tree which was esteemed one of the most sacredobjects in Rome. Whenever the tree appeared to a passer-by to be drooping, he set up a hueand cry which was echoed by the people in the street, and soon a crowd might be seenrunning helter-skelter from all sides with buckets of water, as if (says Plutarch) they werehastening to put out a fire.Among the tribes of the Finnish-Ugrian stock in Europe the heathen worship wasperformed for the most part in sacred groves, which were always enclosed with a fence.Such a grove often consisted merely of a glade or clearing with a few trees dotted about,upon which in former times the skins of the sacrificial victims were hung. The central pointof the grove, at least among the tribes of the Volga, was the sacred tree, beside whicheverything else sank into insignificance. Before it the worshippers assembled and the priestoffered his prayers, at its roots the victim was sacrificed, and its boughs sometimes servedas a pulpit. No wood might be hewn and no branch broken in the grove, and women weregenerally forbidden to enter it.But it is necessary to examine in some detail the notions on which the worship of trees andplants is based. To the savage the world in general is animate, and trees and plants are noexception to the rule. He thinks that they have souls like his own, and he treats themaccordingly. “They say,” writes the ancient vegetarian Porphyry, “that primitive men ledan unhappy life, for their superstition did not stop at animals but extended even to plants.For why should the slaughter of an ox or a sheep be a greater wrong than the felling of a firor an oak, seeing that a soul is implanted in these trees also?” Similarly, the HidatsaIndians of North America believe that every natural object has its spirit, or to speak moreproperly, its shade. To these shades some consideration or respect is due, but not equally toall. For example, the shade of the cottonwood, the greatest tree in the valley of the UpperMissouri, is supposed to possess an intelligence which, if properly approached, may helpthe Indians in certain undertakings; but the shades of shrubs and grasses are of littleaccount. When the Missouri, swollen by a freshet in spring, carries away part of its banksand sweeps some tall tree into its current, it is said that the spirit of the tree cries, while theroots still cling to the land and until the trunk falls with a splash into the stream. Formerly"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"the Indians considered it wrong to fell one of these giants, and when large logs were neededthey made use only of trees which had fallen of themselves. Till lately some of the morecredulous old men declared that many of the misfortunes of their people were caused bythis modern disregard for the rights of the living cottonwood. The Iroquois believed thateach species of tree, shrub, plant, and herb had its own spirit, and to these spirits it wastheir custom to return thanks. The Wanika of Eastern Africa fancy that every tree, andespecially every coco-nut tree, has its spirit; “the destruction of a cocoa-nut tree is regardedas equivalent to matricide, because that tree gives them life and nourishment, as a motherdoes her child.” Siamese monks, believing that there are souls everywhere, and that todestroy anything whatever is forcibly to dispossess a soul, will not break a branch of a tree,“as they will not break the arm of an innocent person.” These monks, of course, areBuddhists. But Buddhist animism is not a philosophical theory. It is simply a commonsavage dogma incorporated in the system of an historical religion. To suppose, with Benfeyand others, that the theories of animism and transmigration current among rude peoples ofAsia are derived from Buddhism, is to reverse the facts.Sometimes it is only particular sorts of trees that are supposed to be tenanted by spirits. AtGrbalj in Dalmatia it is said that among great beeches, oaks, and other trees there are somethat are endowed with shades or souls, and whoever fells one of them must die on the spot,or at least live an invalid for the rest of his days. If a woodman fears that a tree which hehas felled is one of this sort, he must cut off the head of a live hen on the stump of the treewith the very same axe with which he cut down the tree. This will protect him from allharm, even if the tree be one of the animated kind. The silk-cotton trees, which rear theirenormous trunks to a stupendous height, far out-topping all the other trees of the forest,are regarded with reverence throughout West Africa, from the Senegal to the Niger, andare believed to be the abode of a god or spirit. Among the Ewespeaking peoples of the SlaveCoast the indwelling god of this giant of the forest goes by the name of Huntin. Trees inwhich he specially dwells—for it is not every silk-cotton tree that he thus honours—aresurrounded by a girdle of palm-leaves; and sacrifices of fowls, and occasionally of humanbeings, are fastened to the trunk or laid against the foot of the tree. A tree distinguished bya girdle of palm-leaves may not be cut down or injured in any way; and even silk-cottontrees which are not supposed to be animated by Huntin may not be felled unless thewoodman first offers a sacrifice of fowls and palm-oil to purge himself of the proposedsacrilege. To omit the sacrifice is an offence which may be punished with death. Among theKangra mountains of the Punjaub a girl used to be annually sacrificed to an old cedar-tree,the families of the village taking it in turn to supply the victim. The tree was cut down notvery many years ago.If trees are animate, they are necessarily sensitive and the cutting of them down becomes adelicate surgical operation, which must be performed with as tender a regard as possiblefor the feelings of the sufferers, who otherwise may turn and rend the careless or bunglingoperator. When an oak is being felled “it gives a kind of shriekes or groanes, that may beheard a mile off, as if it were the genius of the oake lamenting. E. Wyld, Esq., hath heard itseverall times.” The Ojebways “very seldom cut down green or living trees, from the ideathat it puts them to pain, and some of their medicine-men profess to have heard the wailingof the trees under the axe.” Trees that bleed and utter cries of pain or indignation whenthey are hacked or burned occur very often in Chinese books, even in Standard Histories."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Old peasants in some parts of Austria still believe that forest-trees are animate, and will notallow an incision to be made in the bark without special cause; they have heard from theirfathers that the tree feels the cut not less than a wounded man his hurt. In felling a treethey beg its pardon. It is said that in the Upper Palatinate also old woodmen still secretlyask a fine, sound tree to forgive them before they cut it down. So in Jarkino the woodmancraves pardon of the tree he fells. Before the Ilocanes of Luzon cut down trees in the virginforest or on the mountains, they recite some verses to the following effect: “Be not uneasy,my friend, though we fell what we have been ordered to fell.” This they do in order not todraw down on themselves the hatred of the spirits who live in the trees, and who are apt toavenge themselves by visiting with grievous sickness such as injure them wantonly. TheBasoga of Central Africa think that, when a tree is cut down, the angry spirit whichinhabits it may cause the death of the chief and his family. To prevent this disaster theyconsult a medicine-man before they fell a tree. If the man of skill gives leave to proceed, thewoodman first offers a fowl and a goat to the tree; then as soon as he has given the firstblow with the axe, he applies his mouth to the cut and sucks some of the sap. In this way heforms a brotherhood with the tree, just as two men become blood-brothers by sucking eachother’s blood. After that he can cut down his tree-brother with impunity.But the spirits of vegetation are not always treated with deference and respect. If fairwords and kind treatment do not move them, stronger measures are sometimes resorted to.The durian-tree of the East Indies, whose smooth stem often shoots up to a height of eightyor ninety feet without sending out a branch, bears a fruit of the most delicious flavour andthe most disgusting stench. The Malays cultivate the tree for the sake of its fruit, and havebeen known to resort to a peculiar ceremony for the purpose of stimulating its fertility.Near Jugra in Selangor there is a small grove of durian-trees, and on a specially chosen daythe villagers used to assemble in it. Thereupon one of the local sorcerers would take ahatchet and deliver several shrewd blows on the trunk of the most barren of the trees,saying, “Will you now bear fruit or not? If you do not, I shall fell you.” To this the treereplied through the mouth of another man who had climbed a mangostin-tree hard by (thedurian-tree being unclimbable), “Yes, I will now bear fruit; I beg of you not to fell me.” Soin Japan to make trees bear fruit two men go into an orchard. One of them climbs up a treeand the other stands at the foot with an axe. The man with the axe asks the tree whether itwill yield a good crop next year and threatens to cut it down if it does not. To this the manamong the branches replies on behalf of the tree that it will bear abundantly. Odd as thismode of horticulture may seem to us, it has its exact parallels in Europe. On Christmas Evemany a South Slavonian and Bulgarian peasant swings an axe threateningly against abarren fruit-tree, while another man standing by intercedes for the menaced tree, saying,“Do not cut it down; it will soon bear fruit.” Thrice the axe is swung, and thrice theimpending blow is arrested at the entreaty of the intercessor. After that the frightened treewill certainly bear fruit next year.The conception of trees and plants as animated beings naturally results in treating them asmale and female, who can be married to each other in a real, and not merely a figurative orpoetical, sense of the word. The notion is not purely fanciful, for plants like animals havetheir sexes and reproduce their kind by the union of the male and female elements. Butwhereas in all the higher animals the organs of the two sexes are regularly separatedbetween different individuals, in most plants they exist together in every individual of the"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"species. This rule, however, is by no means universal, and in many species the male plant isdistinct from the female. The distinction appears to have been observed by some savages,for we are told that the Maoris “are acquainted with the sex of trees, etc., and have distinctnames for the male and female of some trees.” The ancients knew the difference betweenthe male and the female date-palm, and fertilised them artificially by shaking the pollen ofthe male tree over the flowers of the female. The fertilisation took place in spring. Amongthe heathen of Harran the month during which the palms were fertilised bore the name ofthe Date Month, and at this time they celebrated the marriage festival of all the gods andgoddesses. Different from this true and fruitful marriage of the palm are the false andbarren marriages of plants which play a part in Hindoo superstition. For example, if aHindoo has planted a grove of mangos, neither he nor his wife may taste of the fruit untilhe has formally married one of the trees, as a bridegroom, to a tree of a different sort,commonly a tamarind-tree, which grows near it in the grove. If there is no tamarind to actas bride, a jasmine will serve the turn. The expenses of such a marriage are oftenconsiderable, for the more Brahmans are feasted at it, the greater the glory of the owner ofthe grove. A family has been known to sell its golden and silver trinkets, and to borrow allthe money they could in order to marry a mango-tree to a jasmine with due pomp andceremony. On Christmas Eve German peasants used to tie fruit-trees together with strawropes to make them bear fruit, saying that the trees were thus married.In the Moluccas, when the clove-trees are in blossom, they are treated like pregnantwomen. No noise may be made near them; no light or fire may be carried past them atnight; no one may approach them with his hat on, all must uncover in their presence. Theseprecautions are observed lest the tree should be alarmed and bear no fruit, or should dropits fruit too soon, like the untimely delivery of a woman who has been frightened in herpregnancy. So in the East the growing rice-crop is often treated with the same considerateregard as a breeding woman. Thus in Amboyna, when the rice is in bloom, the people saythat it is pregnant and fire no guns and make no other noises near the field, for fear lest, ifthe rice were thus disturbed, it would miscarry, and the crop would be all straw and nograin.Sometimes it is the souls of the dead which are believed to animate trees. The Dieri tribe ofCentral Australia regard as very sacred certain trees which are supposed to be theirfathers transformed; hence they speak with reverence of these trees, and are careful thatthey shall not be cut down or burned. If the settlers require them to hew down the trees,they earnestly protest against it, asserting that were they to do so they would have no luck,and might be punished for not protecting their ancestors. Some of the Philippine Islandersbelieve that the souls of their ancestors are in certain trees, which they therefore spare. Ifthey are obliged to fell one of these trees, they excuse themselves to it by saying that it wasthe priest who made them do it. The spirits take up their abode, by preference, in tall andstately trees with great spreading branches. When the wind rustles the leaves, the nativesfancy it is the voice of the spirit; and they never pass near one of these trees without bowingrespectfully, and asking pardon of the spirit for disturbing his repose. Among theIgnorrotes, every village has its sacred tree, in which the souls of the dead forefathers of thehamlet reside. Offerings are made to the tree, and any injury done to it is believed to entailsome misfortune on the village. Were the tree cut down, the village and all its inhabitantswould inevitably perish."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"In Corea the souls of people who die of the plague or by the roadside, and of women whoexpire in childbirth, invariably take up their abode in trees. To such spirits offerings ofcake, wine, and pork are made on heaps of stones piled under the trees. In China it hasbeen customary from time immemorial to plant trees on graves in order thereby tostrengthen the soul of the deceased and thus to save his body from corruption; and as theevergreen cypress and pine are deemed to be fuller of vitality than other trees, they havebeen chosen by preference for this purpose. Hence the trees that grow on graves aresometimes identified with the souls of the departed. Among the Miao-Kia, an aboriginalrace of Southern and Western China, a sacred tree stands at the entrance of every village,and the inhabitants believe that it is tenanted by the soul of their first ancestor and that itrules their destiny. Sometimes there is a sacred grove near a village, where the trees aresuffered to rot and die on the spot. Their fallen branches cumber the ground, and no onemay remove them unless he has first asked leave of the spirit of the tree and offered him asacrifice. Among the Maraves of Southern Africa the burial-ground is always regarded as aholy place where neither a tree may be felled nor a beast killed, because everything there issupposed to be tenanted by the souls of the dead.In most, if not all, of these cases the spirit is viewed as incorporate in the tree; it animatesthe tree and must suffer and die with it. But, according to another and probably lateropinion, the tree is not the body, but merely the abode of the tree-spirit, which can quit itand return to it at pleasure. The inhabitants of Siaoo, an East Indian island, believe incertain sylvan spirits who dwell in forests or in great solitary trees. At full moon the spiritcomes forth from his lurking-place and roams about. He has a big head, very long armsand legs, and a ponderous body. In order to propitiate the wood-spirits people bringofferings of food, fowls, goats, and so forth to the places which they are supposed to haunt.The people of Nias think that, when a tree dies, its liberated spirit becomes a demon, whichcan kill a coco-nut palm by merely lighting on its branches, and can cause the death of allthe children in a house by perching on one of the posts that support it. Further, they are ofopinion that certain trees are at all times inhabited by roving demons who, if the trees weredamaged, would be set free to go about on errands of mischief. Hence the people respectthese trees, and are careful not to cut them down.Not a few ceremonies observed at cutting down haunted trees are based on the belief thatthe spirits have it in their power to quit the trees at pleasure or in case of need. Thus whenthe Pelew Islanders are felling a tree, they conjure the spirit of the tree to leave it and settleon another. The wily negro of the Slave Coast, who wishes to fell an ashorin tree, but knowsthat he cannot do it so long as the spirit remains in the tree, places a little palm-oil on theground as a bait, and then, when the unsuspecting spirit has quitted the tree to partake ofthis dainty, hastens to cut down its late abode. When the Toboongkoos of Celebes are aboutto clear a piece of forest in order to plant rice, they build a tiny house and furnish it withtiny clothes and some food and gold. Then they call together all the spirits of the wood,offer them the little house with its contents, and beseech them to quit the spot. After thatthey may safely cut down the wood without fearing to wound themselves in so doing. Beforethe Tomori, another tribe of Celebes, fell a tall tree they lay a quid of betel at its foot, andinvite the spirit who dwells in the tree to change his lodging; moreover, they set a littleladder against the trunk to enable him to descend with safety and comfort. The Mandelingsof Sumatra endeavour to lay the blame of all such misdeeds at the door of the Dutch"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"authorities. Thus when a man is cutting a road through a forest and has to fell a tall treewhich blocks the way, he will not begin to ply his axe until he has said: “Spirit who lodgestin this tree, take it not ill that I cut down thy dwelling, for it is done at no wish of mine butby order of the Controller.” And when he wishes to clear a piece of forest-land forcultivation, it is necessary that he should come to a satisfactory understanding with thewoodland spirits who live there before he lays low their leafy dwellings. For this purpose hegoes to the middle of the plot of ground, stoops down, and pretends to pick up a letter.Then unfolding a bit of paper he reads aloud an imaginary letter from the DutchGovernment, in which he is strictly enjoined to set about clearing the land without delay.Having done so, he says: “You hear that, spirits. I must begin clearing at once, or I shall behanged.”Even when a tree has been felled, sawn into planks, and used to build a house, it is possiblethat the woodland spirit may still be lurking in the timber, and accordingly some peopleseek to propitiate him before or after they occupy the new house. Hence, when a newdwelling is ready the Toradjas of Celebes kill a goat, a pig, or a buffalo, and smear all thewoodwork with its blood. If the building is a lobo or spirit-house, a fowl or a dog is killedon the ridge of the roof, and its blood allowed to flow down on both sides. The ruderTonapoo in such a case sacrifice a human being on the roof. This sacrifice on the roof of alobo or temple serves the same purpose as the smearing of blood on the woodwork of anordinary house. The intention is to propitiate the forest-spirits who may still be in thetimber; they are thus put in good humour and will do the inmates of the house no harm.For a like reason people in Celebes and the Moluccas are much afraid of planting a postupside down at the building of a house; for the forest-spirit, who might still be in thetimber, would very naturally resent the indignity and visit the inmates with sickness. TheKayans of Borneo are of opinion that tree-spirits stand very stiffly on the point of honourand visit men with their displeasure for any injury done to them. Hence after building ahouse, whereby they have been forced to ill-treat many trees, these people observe a periodof penance for a year during which they must abstain from many things, such as the killingof bears, tiger-cats, and serpents.2. Beneficent Powers of Tree-SpiritsWHEN a tree comes to be viewed, no longer as the body of the tree-spirit, but simply as itsabode which it can quit at pleasure, an important advance has been made in religiousthought. Animism is passing into polytheism. In other words, instead of regarding each treeas a living and conscious being, man now sees in it merely a lifeless, inert mass, tenanted fora longer or shorter time by a supernatural being who, as he can pass freely from tree totree, thereby enjoys a certain right of possession or lordship over the trees, and, ceasing tobe a tree-soul, becomes a forest god. As soon as the tree-spirit is thus in a measuredisengaged from each particular tree, he begins to change his shape and assume the bodyof a man, in virtue of a general tendency of early thought to clothe all abstract spiritualbeings in concrete human form. Hence in classical art the sylvan deities are depicted inhuman shape, their woodland character being denoted by a branch or some equallyobvious symbol. But this change of shape does not affect the essential character of the tree-spirit. The powers which he exercised as a tree-soul incorporate in a tree, he still continues"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"to wield as a god of trees. This I shall now attempt to prove in detail. I shall show, first, thattrees considered as animate beings are credited with the power of making the rain to fall,the sun to shine, flocks and herds to multiply, and women to bring forth easily; and,second, that the very same powers are attributed to tree-gods conceived asanthropomorphic beings or as actually incarnate in living men.First, then, trees or tree-spirits are believed to give rain and sunshine. When the missionaryJerome of Prague was persuading the heathen Lithuanians to fell their sacred groves, amultitude of women besought the Prince of Lithuania to stop him, saying that with thewoods he was destroying the house of god from which they had been wont to get rain andsunshine. The Mundaris in Assam think that if a tree in the sacred grove is felled the sylvangods evince their displeasure by withholding rain. In order to procure rain the inhabitantsof Monyo, a village in the Sagaing district of Upper Burma, chose the largest tamarind-treenear the village and named it the haunt of the spirit (nat) who controls the rain. Then theyoffered bread, coco-nuts, plantains, and fowls to the guardian spirit of the village and to thespirit who gives rain, and they prayed, “O Lord nat have pity on us poor mortals, and staynot the rain. Inasmuch as our offering is given ungrudgingly, let the rain fall day andnight.” Afterwards libations were made in honour of the spirit of the tamarind-tree; andstill later three elderly women, dressed in fine clothes and wearing necklaces and earrings,sang the Rain Song.Again, tree-spirits make the crops to grow. Amongst the Mundaris every village has itssacred grove, and “the grove deities are held responsible for the crops, and are especiallyhonoured at all the great agricultural festivals.” The negroes of the Gold Coast are in thehabit of sacrificing at the foot of certain tall trees, and they think that if one of these werefelled all the fruits of the earth would perish. The Gallas dance in couples round sacredtrees, praying for a good harvest. Every couple consists of a man and woman, who arelinked together by a stick, of which each holds one end. Under their arms they carry greencorn or grass. Swedish peasants stick a leafy branch in each furrow of their corn-fields,believing that this will ensure an abundant crop. The same idea comes out in the Germanand French custom of the Harvest-May. This is a large branch or a whole tree, which isdecked with ears of corn, brought home on the last waggon from the harvest-field, andfastened on the roof of the farmhouse or of the barn, where it remains for a year.Mannhardt has proved that this branch or tree embodies the tree-spirit conceived as thespirit of vegetation in general, whose vivifying and fructifying influence is thus brought tobear upon the corn in particular. Hence in Swabia the Harvest-May is fastened amongstthe last stalks of corn left standing on the field; in other places it is planted on the corn-fieldand the last sheaf cut is attached to its trunk.Again, the tree-spirit makes the herds to multiply and blesses women with offspring. InNorthern India the Emblica officinalis is a sacred tree. On the eleventh of the monthPhalgun (February) libations are poured at the foot of the tree, a red or yellow string isbound about the trunk, and prayers are offered to it for the fruitfulness of women, animals,and crops. Again, in Northern India the coco-nut is esteemed one of the most sacred fruits,and is called Sriphala, or the fruit of Sri, the goddess of prosperity. It is the symbol offertility, and all through Upper India is kept in shrines and presented by the priests towomen who desire to become mothers. In the town of Qua, near Old Calabar, there used to"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"grow a palm-tree which ensured conception to any barren woman who ate a nut from itsbranches. In Europe the May-tree or May-pole is apparently supposed to possess similarpowers over both women and cattle. Thus in some parts of Germany on the first of May thepeasants set up May-trees or May-bushes at the doors of stables and byres, one for eachhorse and cow; this is thought to make the cows yield much milk. Of the Irish we are toldthat “they fancy a green bough of a tree, fastened on May-day against the house, willproduce plenty of milk that summer.”On the second of July some of the Wends used to set up an oak-tree in the middle of thevillage with an iron cock fastened to its top; then they danced round it, and drove the cattleround it to make them thrive. The Circassians regard the pear-tree as the protector ofcattle. So they cut down a young pear-tree in the forest, branch it, and carry it home, whereit is adored as a divinity. Almost every house has one such pear-tree. In autumn, on the dayof the festival, the tree is carried into the house with great ceremony to the sound of musicand amid the joyous cries of all the inmates, who compliment it on its fortunate arrival. Itis covered with candles, and a cheese is fastened to its top. Round about it they eat, drink,and sing. Then they bid the tree good-bye and take it back to the courtyard, where itremains for the rest of the year, set up against the wall, without receiving any mark ofrespect.In the Tuhoe tribe of Maoris “the power of making women fruitful is ascribed to trees.These trees are associated with the navel-strings of definite mythical ancestors, as indeedthe navel-strings of all children used to be hung upon them down to quite recent times. Abarren woman had to embrace such a tree with her arms, and she received a male or afemale child according as she embraced the east or the west side.” The common Europeancustom of placing a green bush on May Day before or on the house of a beloved maidenprobably originated in the belief of the fertilising power of the tree-spirit. In some parts ofBavaria such bushes are set up also at the houses of newly-married pairs, and the practiceis only omitted if the wife is near her confinement; for in that case they say that thehusband has “set up a May-bush for himself.” Among the South Slavonians a barrenwoman, who desires to have a child, places a new chemise upon a fruitful tree on the eve ofSt. George’s Day. Next morning before sunrise she examines the garment, and if she findsthat some living creature has crept on it, she hopes that her wish will be fulfilled within theyear. Then she puts on the chemise, confident that she will be as fruitful as the tree onwhich the garment has passed the night. Among the Kara-Kirghiz barren women rollthemselves on the ground under a solitary apple-tree, in order to obtain offspring. Lastly,the power of granting to women an easy delivery at child-birth is ascribed to trees both inSweden and Africa. In some districts of Sweden there was formerly a bardträd or guardian-tree (lime, ash, or elm) in the neighbourhood of every farm. No one would pluck a singleleaf of the sacred tree, any injury to which was punished by ill-luck or sickness. Pregnantwomen used to clasp the tree in their arms in order to ensure an easy delivery. In somenegro tribes of the Congo region pregnant women make themselves garments out of thebark of a certain sacred tree, because they believe that this tree delivers them from thedangers that attend child-bearing. The story that Leto clasped a palm-tree and an olive-tree or two laurel-trees, when she was about to give birth to the divine twins Apollo andArtemis, perhaps points to a similar Greek belief in the efficacy of certain trees to facilitatedelivery."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"X. Relics of Tree Worship in Modern EuropeFROM THE FOREGOING review of the beneficent qualities commonly ascribed to tree-spirits, it is easy to understand why customs like the May-tree or May-pole have prevailedso widely and figured so prominently in the popular festivals of European peasants. Inspring or early summer or even on Midsummer Day, it was and still is in many parts ofEurope the custom to go out to the woods, cut down a tree and bring it into the village,where it is set up amid general rejoicings; or the people cut branches in the woods, andfasten them on every house. The intention of these customs is to bring home to the village,and to each house, the blessings which the tree-spirit has in its power to bestow. Hence thecustom in some places of planting a May-tree before every house, or of carrying the villageMay-tree from door to door, that every household may receive its share of the blessing. Outof the mass of evidence on this subject a few examples may be selected.Sir Henry Piers, in his Description of Westmeath, writing in 1682 says: “On May-eve, everyfamily sets up before their door a green bush, strewed over with yellow flowers, which themeadows yield plentifully. In countries where timber is plentiful, they erect tall slendertrees, which stand high, and they continue almost the whole year; so as a stranger would gonigh to imagine that they were all signs of ale-sellers, and that all houses were ale-houses.”In Northamptonshire a young tree ten or twelve feet high used to be planted before eachhouse on May Day so as to appear growing; flowers were thrown over it and strewn aboutthe door. “Among ancient customs still retained by the Cornish, may be reckoned that ofdecking their doors and porches on the first of May with green boughs of sycamore andhawthorn, and of planting trees, or rather stumps of trees, before their houses.” In thenorth of England it was formerly the custom for young people to rise a little after midnighton the morning of the first of May, and go out with music and the blowing of horns into thewoods, where they broke branches and adorned them with nosegays and crowns of flowers.This done, they returned about sunrise and fastened the flower-decked branches over thedoors and windows of their houses. At Abingdon in Berkshire young people formerly wentabout in groups on May morning, singing a carol of which the following are two of theverses:“We’ve been rambling all the night,And sometime of this day;And now returning back again,We bring a garland gay.A garland gay we bring you here;And at your door we stand;It is a sprout well budded out,The work of our Lord’s hand.”At the towns of Saffron Walden and Debden in Essex on the first of May little girls go"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"about in parties from door to door singing a song almost identical with the above andcarrying garlands; a doll dressed in white is usually placed in the middle of each garland.Similar customs have been and indeed are still observed in various parts of England. Thegarlands are generally in the form of hoops intersecting each other at right angles. Itappears that a hoop wreathed with rowan and marsh marigold, and bearing suspendedwithin it two balls, is still carried on May Day by villagers in some parts of Ireland. Theballs, which are sometimes covered with gold and silver paper, are said to have originallyrepresented the sun and moon.In some villages of the Vosges Mountains on the first Sunday of May young girls go inbands from house to house, singing a song in praise of May, in which mention is made ofthe “bread and meal that come in May.” If money is given them, they fasten a green boughto the door; if it is refused, they wish the family many children and no bread to feed them.In the French department of Mayenne, boys who bore the name of Maillotins used to goabout from farm to farm on the first of May singing carols, for which they received moneyor a drink; they planted a small tree or a branch of a tree. Near Saverne in Alsace bands ofpeople go about carrying May-trees. Amongst them is a man dressed in a white shirt withhis face blackened; in front of him is carried a large May-tree, but each member of theband also carries a smaller one. One of the company bears a huge basket, in which hecollects eggs, bacon, and so forth.On the Thursday before Whitsunday the Russian villagers “go out into the woods, singsongs, weave garlands, and cut down a young birch-tree, which they dress up in woman’sclothes, or adorn with many-coloured shreds and ribbons. After that comes a feast, at theend of which they take the dressed-up birch-tree, carry it home to their village with joyfuldance and song, and set it up in one of the houses, where it remains as an honoured guesttill Whitsunday. On the two intervening days they pay visits to the house where their‘guest’ is; but on the third day, Whitsunday, they take her to a stream and fling her into itswaters,” throwing their garlands after her. In this Russian custom the dressing of the birchin woman’s clothes shows how clearly the tree is personified; and the throwing it into astream is most probably a raincharm.In some parts of Sweden on the eve of May Day lads go about carrying each a bunch offresh birch twigs wholly or partly in leaf. With the village fiddler at their head, they makethe round of the houses singing May songs; the burden of their songs is a prayer for fineweather, a plentiful harvest, and worldly and spiritual blessings. One of them carries abasket in which he collects gifts of eggs and the like. If they are well received, they stick aleafy twig in the roof over the cottage door. But in Sweden midsummer is the season whenthese ceremonies are chiefly observed. On the Eve of St. John (the twenty-third of June) thehouses are thoroughly cleansed and garnished with green boughs and flowers. Young fir-trees are raised at the doorway and elsewhere about the homestead; and very often smallumbrageous arbours are constructed in the garden. In Stockholm on this day a leaf-marketis held at which thousands of May-poles (Maj Stǎnger), from six inches to twelve feet high,decorated with leaves, flowers, slips of coloured paper, gilt egg-shells strung on reeds, andso on, are exposed for sale. Bonfires are lit on the hills, and the people dance round themand jump over them. But the chief event of the day is setting up the May-pole. This consistsof a straight and tall sprucepine tree, stripped of its branches. “At times hoops and at"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"others pieces of wood, placed crosswise, are attached to it at intervals; whilst at others it isprovided with bows, representing, so to say, a man with his arms akimbo. From top tobottom not only the ‘Maj Stăng’ (May-pole) itself, but the hoops, bows, etc., areornamented with leaves, flowers, slips of various cloth, gilt egg-shells, etc.; and on the top ofit is a large vane, or it may be a flag.” The raising of the May-pole, the decoration of whichis done by the village maidens, is an affair of much ceremony; the people flock to it from allquarters, and dance round it in a great ring. Midsummer customs of the same sort used tobe observed in some parts of Germany. Thus in the towns of the Upper Harz Mountainstall fir-trees, with the bark peeled off their lower trunks, were set up in open places anddecked with flowers and eggs, which were painted yellow and red. Round these trees theyoung folk danced by day and the old folk in the evening. In some parts of Bohemia also aMay-pole or midsummer-tree is erected on St. John’s Eve. The lads fetch a tall fir or pinefrom the wood and set it up on a height, where the girls deck it with nosegays, garlands,and red ribbons. It is afterwards burned.It would be needless to illustrate at length the custom, which has prevailed in various partsof Europe, such as England, France, and Germany, of setting up a village May-tree orMay-pole on May Day. A few examples will suffice. The puritanical writer Phillip Stubbesin his Anatomie of Abuses, first published at London in 1583, has described with manifestdisgust how they used to bring in the May-pole in the days of good Queen Bess. Hisdescription affords us a vivid glimpse of merry England in the olden time. “Against May,Whitsonday, or other time, all the yung men and maides, olde men and wives, run gaddingover night to the woods, groves, hils, and mountains, where they spend all the night inplesant pastimes; and in the morning they return, bringing with them birch and branchesof trees, to deck their assemblies withall. And no mervaile, for there is a great Lord presentamongst them, as superintendent and Lord over their pastimes and sportes, namely,Sathan, prince of hel. But the chiefest jewel they bring from thence is their May-pole,which they bring home with great veneration, as thus. They have twentie or fortie yoke ofoxen, every oxe having a sweet nose-gay of flouers placed on the tip of his hornes, and theseoxen drawe home this May-pole (this stinkyng ydol, rather), which is covered all over withfloures and hearbs, bound round about with strings, from the top to the bottome, andsometime painted with variable colours, with two or three hundred men, women andchildren following it with great devotion. And thus beeing reared up, with handkercheefsand flags hovering on the top, they straw the ground rounde about, binde green boughesabout it, set up sommer haules, bowers, and arbors hard by it. And then fall they to daunceabout it, like as the heathen people did at the dedication of the Idols, whereof this is aperfect pattern, or rather the thing itself. I have heard it credibly reported (and that vivavoce) by men of great gravitie and reputation, that of fortie, threescore, or a hundredmaides going to the wood over night, there have scaresly the third part of them returnedhome againe undefiled.”In Swabia on the first of May a tall fir-tree used to be fetched into the village, where it wasdecked with ribbons and set up; then the people danced round it merrily to music. The treestood on the village green the whole year through, until a fresh tree was brought in nextMay Day. In Saxony “people were not content with bringing the summer symbolically (asking or queen) into the village; they brought the fresh green itself from the woods even intothe houses: that is the May or Whitsuntide trees, which are mentioned in documents from"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"the thirteenth century onwards. The fetching in of the May-tree was also a festival. Thepeople went out into the woods to seek the May (majum quaerere), brought young trees,especially firs and birches, to the village and set them up before the doors of the houses orof the cattle-stalls or in the rooms. Young fellows erected such May-trees, as we havealready said, before the chambers of their sweethearts. Besides these household Mays, agreat May-tree or May-pole, which had also been brought in solemn procession to thevillage, was set up in the middle of the village or in the market-place of the town. It hadbeen chosen by the whole community, who watched over it most carefully. Generally thetree was stripped of its branches and leaves, nothing but the crown being left, on whichwere displayed, in addition to many-coloured ribbons and cloths, a variety of victuals suchas sausages, cakes, and eggs. The young folk exerted themselves to obtain these prizes. Inthe greasy poles which are still to be seen at our fairs we have a relic of these old May-poles. Not uncommonly there was a race on foot or on horseback to the May-tree—aWhitsunday pastime which in course of time has been divested of its goal and survives as apopular custom to this day in many parts of Germany.” At Bordeaux on the first of Maythe boys of each street used to erect in it a May-pole, which they adorned with garlands anda great crown; and every evening during the whole of the month the young people of bothsexes danced singing about the pole. Down to the present day May-trees decked withflowers and ribbons are set up on May Day in every village and hamlet of gay Provence.Under them the young folk make merry and the old folk rest.In all these cases, apparently, the custom is or was to bring in a new May-tree each year.However, in England the village May-pole seems as a rule, at least in later times, to havebeen permanent, not renewed annually. Villages of Upper Bavaria renew their May-poleonce every three, four, or five years. It is a fir-tree fetched from the forest, and amid all thewreaths, flags, and inscriptions with which it is bedecked, an essential part is the bunch ofdark green foliage left at the top “as a memento that in it we have to do, not with a deadpole, but with a living tree from the greenwood.” We can hardly doubt that originally thepractice everywhere was to set up a new May-tree every year. As the object of the customwas to bring in the fructifying spirit of vegetation, newly awakened in spring, the endwould have been defeated if, instead of a living tree, green and sappy, an old withered onehad been erected year after year or allowed to stand permanently. When, however, themeaning of the custom had been forgotten, and the May-tree was regarded simply as acentre for holiday merry-making, people saw no reason for felling a fresh tree every year,and preferred to let the same tree stand permanently, only decking it with fresh flowers onMay Day. But even when the May-pole had thus become a fixture, the need of giving it theappearance of being a green tree, not a dead pole, was sometimes felt. Thus at Weverhamin Cheshire “are two May-poles, which are decorated on this day (May Day) with all dueattention to the ancient solemnity; the sides are hung with garlands, and the top terminatedby a birch or other tall slender tree with its leaves on; the bark being peeled, and the stemspliced to the pole, so as to give the appearance of one tree from the summit.” Thus therenewal of the May-tree is like the renewal of the Harvest-May; each is intended to secure afresh portion of the fertilising spirit of vegetation, and to preserve it throughout the year.But whereas the efficacy of the Harvest-May is restricted to promoting the growth of thecrops, that of the May-tree or May-branch extends also, as we have seen, to women andcattle. Lastly, it is worth noting that the old May-tree is sometimes burned at the end of theyear. Thus in the district of Prague young people break pieces of the public May-tree and"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"place them behind the holy pictures in their rooms, where they remain till next May Day,and are then burned on the hearth. In Würtemberg the bushes which are set up on thehouses on Palm Sunday are sometimes left there for a year and then burnt.So much for the tree-spirit conceived as incorporate or immanent in the tree. We have nowto show that the tree-spirit is often conceived and represented as detached from the treeand clothed in human form, and even as embodied in living men or women. The evidencefor this anthropomorphic representation of the tree-spirit is largely to be found in thepopular customs of European peasantry.There is an instructive class of cases in which the tree-spirit is represented simultaneouslyin vegetable form and in human form, which are set side by side as if for the expresspurpose of explaining each other. In these cases the human representative of the tree-spiritis sometimes a doll or puppet, sometimes a living person, but whether a puppet or a person,it is placed beside a tree or bough; so that together the person or puppet, and the tree orbough, form a sort of bilingual inscription, the one being, so to speak, a translation of theother. Here, therefore, there is no room left for doubt that the spirit of the tree is actuallyrepresented in human form. Thus in Bohemia, on the fourth Sunday in Lent, young peoplethrow a puppet called Death into the water; then the girls go into the wood, cut down ayoung tree, and fasten to it a puppet dressed in white clothes to look like a woman; withthis tree and puppet they go from house to house collecting gratuities and singing songswith the refrain:“We carry Death out of the village,We bring Summer into the village.”Here, as we shall see later on, the “Summer” is the spirit of vegetation returning orreviving in spring. In some parts of our own country children go about asking for pencewith some small imitations of May-poles, and with a finely-dressed doll which they call theLady of the May. In these cases the tree and the puppet are obviously regarded asequivalent.At Thann, in Alsace, a girl called the Little May Rose, dressed in white, carries a smallMay-tree, which is gay with garlands and ribbons. Her companions collect gifts from doorto door, singing a song:“Little May Rose turn round three times,Let us look at you round and round!Rose of the May, come to the greenwood away,We will be merry all.So we go from the May to the roses.”"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"In the course of the song a wish is expressed that those who give nothing may lose theirfowls by the marten, that their vine may bear no clusters, their tree no nuts, their field nocorn; the produce of the year is supposed to depend on the gifts offered to these Maysingers. Here and in the cases mentioned above, where children go about with green boughsor garlands on May Day singing and collecting money, the meaning is that with the spirit ofvegetation they bring plenty and good luck to the house, and they expect to be paid for theservice. In Russian Lithuania, on the first of May, they used to set up a green tree beforethe village. Then the rustic swains chose the prettiest girl, crowned her, swathed her inbirch branches and set her beside the May-tree, where they danced, sang, and shouted “OMay! O May!” In Brie (Isle de France) a May-tree is erected in the midst of the village; itstop is crowned with flowers; lower down it is twined with leaves and twigs, still lower withhuge green branches. The girls dance round it, and at the same time a lad wrapt in leavesand called Father May is led about. In the small towns of the Franken Wald mountains inNorthern Bavaria, on the second of May, a Walber tree is erected before a tavern, and aman dances round it, enveloped in straw from head to foot in such a way that the ears ofcorn unite above his head to form a crown. He is called the Walber, and used to be led inprocession through the streets, which were adorned with sprigs of birch.Amongst the Slavs of Carinthia, on St. George’s Day (the twentythird of April), the youngpeople deck with flowers and garlands a tree which has been felled on the eve of thefestival. The tree is then carried in procession, accompanied with music and joyfulacclamations, the chief figure in the procession being the Green George, a young fellowclad from head to foot in green birch branches. At the close of the ceremonies the GreenGeorge, that is an effigy of him, is thrown into the water. It is the aim of the lad who actsGreen George to step out of his leafy envelope and substitute the effigy so adroitly that noone shall perceive the change. In many places, however, the lad himself who plays the partof Green George is ducked in a river or pond, with the express intention of thus ensuringrain to make the fields and meadows green in summer. In some places the cattle arecrowned and driven from their stalls to the accompaniment of a song:“Green George we bring,Green George we accompany,May he feed our herds well.If not, to the water with him.”Here we see that the same powers of making rain and fostering the cattle, which areascribed to the tree-spirit regarded as incorporate in the tree, are also attributed to thetree-spirit represented by a living man.Among the gypsies of Transylvania and Roumania the festival of Green George is the chiefcelebration of spring. Some of them keep it on Easter Monday, others on St. George’s Day(the twentythird of April). On the eve of the festival a young willow tree is cut down,adorned with garlands and leaves, and set up in the ground. Women with child place one oftheir garments under the tree, and leave it there over night; if next morning they find a leaf"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"of the tree lying on the garment, they know that their delivery will be easy. Sick and oldpeople go to the tree in the evening, spit on it thrice, and say, “You will soon die, but let uslive.” Next morning the gypsies gather about the willow. The chief figure of the festival isGreen George, a lad who is concealed from top to toe in green leaves and blossoms. Hethrows a few handfuls of grass to the beasts of the tribe, in order that they may have nolack of fodder throughout the year. Then he takes three iron nails, which have lain forthree days and nights in water, and knocks them into the willow; after which he pulls themout and flings them into a running stream to propitiate the water-spirits. Finally, apretence is made of throwing Green George into the water, but in fact it is only a puppetmade of branches and leaves which is ducked in the stream. In this version of the customthe powers of granting an easy delivery to women and of communicating vital energy to thesick and old are clearly ascribed to the willow; while Green George, the human double ofthe tree, bestows food on the cattle, and further ensures the favour of the water-spirits byputting them in indirect communication with the tree.Without citing more examples to the same effect, we may sum up the results of thepreceding pages in the words of Mannhardt: “The customs quoted suffice to establish withcertainty the conclusion that in these spring processions the spirit of vegetation is oftenrepresented both by the May-tree and in addition by a man dressed in green leaves orflowers or by a girl similarly adorned. It is the same spirit which animates the tree and isactive in the inferior plants and which we have recognised in the May-tree and the Harvest-May. Quite consistently the spirit is also supposed to manifest his presence in the firstflower of spring and reveals himself both in a girl representing a May-rose, and also, asgiver of harvest, in the person of the Walber. The procession with this representative of thedivinity was supposed to produce the same beneficial effects on the fowls, the fruit-trees,and the crops as the presence of the deity himself. In other words the mummer wasregarded not as an image but as an actual representative of the spirit of vegetation; hencethe wish expressed by the attendants on the May-rose and the May-tree that those whorefuse them gifts of eggs, bacon, and so forth, may have no share in the blessings which it isin the power of the itinerant spirit to bestow. We may conclude that these beggingprocessions with May-trees or May-boughs from door to door (‘bringing the May or thesummer’) had everywhere originally a serious and, so to speak, sacramental significance;people really believed that the god of growth was present unseen in the bough; by theprocession he was brought to each house to bestow his blessing. The names May, FatherMay, May Lady, Queen of the May, by which the anthropomorphic spirit of vegetation isoften denoted, show that the idea of the spirit of vegetation is blent with a personification ofthe season at which his powers are most strikingly manifested.”So far we have seen that the tree-spirit or the spirit of vegetation in general is representedeither in vegetable form alone, as by a tree, bough, or flower; or in vegetable and humanform simultaneously, as by a tree, bough, or flower in combination with a puppet or aliving person. It remains to show that the representation of him by a tree, bough, or floweris sometimes entirely dropped, while the representation of him by a living person remains.In this case the representative character of the person is generally marked by dressing himor her in leaves or flowers; sometimes, too, it is indicated by the name he or she bears.Thus in some parts of Russia on St. George’s Day (the twenty-third of April) a youth is"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"dressed out, like our Jack-in-the-Green, with leaves and flowers. The Slovenes call him theGreen George. Holding a lighted torch in one hand and a pie in the other, he goes out to thecorn-fields, followed by girls singing appropriate songs. A circle of brushwood is nextlighted, in the middle of which is set the pie. All who take part in the ceremony then sitdown around the fire and divide the pie among them. In this custom the Green Georgedressed in leaves and flowers is plainly identical with the similarly disguised Green Georgewho is associated with a tree in the Carinthian, Transylvanian, and Roumanian customsobserved on the same day. Again, we saw that in Russia at Whitsuntide a birch-tree isdressed in woman’s clothes and set up in the house. Clearly equivalent to this is the customobserved on Whit-Monday by Russian girls in the district of Pinsk. They choose theprettiest of their number, envelop her in a mass of foliage taken from the birch-trees andmaples, and carry her about through the village.In Ruhla as soon as the trees begin to grow green in spring, the children assemble on aSunday and go out into the woods, where they choose one of their playmates to be the LittleLeaf Man. They break branches from the trees and twine them about the child till only hisshoes peep out from the leafy mantle. Holes are made in it for him to see through, and twoof the children lead the Little Leaf Man that he may not stumble or fall. Singing anddancing they take him from house to house, asking for gifts of food such as eggs, cream,sausages, and cakes. Lastly, they sprinkle the Leaf Man with water and feast on the foodthey have collected. In the Fricktal, Switzerland, at Whitsuntide boys go out into a woodand swathe one of their number in leafy boughs. He is called the Whitsuntide-lout, andbeing mounted on horseback with a green branch in his hand he is led back into the village.At the village-well a halt is called and the leaf-clad lout is dismounted and ducked in thetrough. Thereby he acquires the right of sprinkling water on everybody, and he exercisesthe right specially on girls and street urchins. The urchins march before him in bandsbegging him to give them a Whitsuntide wetting.In England the best-known example of these leaf-clad mummers is the Jack-in-the-Green, achimney-sweeper who walks encased in a pyramidal framework of wickerwork, which iscovered with holly and ivy, and surmounted by a crown of flowers and ribbons. Thusarrayed he dances on May Day at the head of a troop of chimney-sweeps, who collectpence. In Fricktal a similar frame of basketwork is called the Whitsuntide Basket. As soonas the trees begin to bud, a spot is chosen in the wood, and here the village lads make theframe with all secrecy, lest others should forestall them. Leafy branches are twined roundtwo hoops, one of which rests on the shoulders of the wearer, the other encircles his claves;holes are made for his eyes and mouth; and a large nosegay crowns the whole. In this guisehe appears suddenly in the village at the hour of vespers, preceded by three boys blowingon horns made of willow bark. The great object of his supporters is to set up theWhitsuntide Basket on the village well, and to keep it and him there, despite the efforts ofthe lads from neighbouring villages, who seek to carry off the Whitsuntide Basket and set itup on their own well.In the class of cases of which the foregoing are specimens it is obvious that the leaf-cladperson who is led about is equivalent to the May-tree, May-bough, or May-doll, which iscarried from house to house by children begging. Both are representatives of the beneficentspirit of vegetation, whose visit to the house is recompensed by a present of money or food."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Often the leaf-clad person who represents the spirit of vegetation is known as the king orthe queen; thus, for example, he or she is called the May King, Whitsuntide King, Queen ofMay, and so on. These titles, as Mannhardt observes, imply that the spirit incorporate invegetation is a ruler, whose creative power extends far and wide.In a village near Salzwedel a May-tree is set up at Whitsuntide and the boys race to it; hewho reaches it first is king; a garland of flowers is put round his neck and in his hand hecarries a May-bush, with which, as the procession moves along, he sweeps away the dew. Ateach house they sing a song, wishing the inmates good luck, referring to the “black cow inthe stall milking white milk, black hen on the nest laying white eggs,” and begging a gift ofeggs, bacon, and so on. At the village of Ellgoth in Silesia a ceremony called the King’sRace is observed at Whitsuntide. A pole with a cloth tied to it is set up in a meadow, andthe young men ride past it on horseback, each trying to snatch away the cloth as he gallopsby. The one who succeeds in carrying it off and dipping it in the neighbouring Oder isproclaimed King. Here the pole is clearly a substitute for a May-tree. In some villages ofBrunswick at Whitsuntide a May King is completely enveloped in a May-bush. In someparts of Thüringen also they have a May King at Whitsuntide, but he is dressed up ratherdifferently. A frame of wood is made in which a man can stand; it is completely coveredwith birch boughs and is surmounted by a crown of birch and flowers, in which a bell isfastened. This frame is placed in the wood and the May King gets into it. The rest go outand look for him, and when they have found him they lead him back into the village to themagistrate, the clergyman, and others, who have to guess who is in the verdurous frame. Ifthey guess wrong, the May King rings his bell by shaking his head, and a forfeit of beer orthe like must be paid by the unsuccessful guesser. At Wahrstedt the boys at Whitsuntidechoose by lot a king and a high-steward. The latter is completely concealed in a May-bush,wears a wooden crown wreathen with flowers, and carries a wooden sword. The king, onthe other hand, is only distinguished by a nosegay in his cap, and a reed, with a red ribbontied to it, in his hand. They beg for eggs from house to house, threatening that, where noneare given, none will be laid by the hens throughout the year. In this custom the high-steward appears, for some reason, to have usurped the insignia of the king. At Hildesheimfive or six young fellows go about on the afternoon of Whit-Monday cracking long whips inmeasured time and collecting eggs from the houses. The chief person of the band is the LeafKing, a lad swathed so completely in birchen twigs that nothing of him can be seen but hisfeet. A huge head-dress of birchen twigs adds to his apparent stature. In his hand hecarries a long crook, with which he tries to catch stray dogs and children. In some parts ofBohemia on Whit-Monday the young fellows disguise themselves in tall caps of birch barkadorned with flowers. One of them is dressed as a king and dragged on a sledge to thevillage green, and if on the way they pass a pool the sledge is always overturned into it.Arrived at the green they gather round the king; the crier jumps on a stone or climbs up atree and recites lampoons about each house and its inmates. Afterwards the disguises ofbark are stripped off and they go about the village in holiday attire, carrying a May-treeand begging. Cakes, eggs, and corn are sometimes given them. At Grossvargula, nearLangensalza, in the eighteenth century a Grass King used to be led about in procession atWhitsuntide. He was encased in a pyramid of poplar branches, the top of which wasadorned with a royal crown of branches and flowers. He rode on horseback with the leafypyramid over him, so that its lower end touched the ground, and an opening was left in itonly for his face. Surrounded by a cavalcade of young fellows, he rode in procession to the"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"town hall, the parsonage, and so on, where they all got a drink of beer. Then under theseven lindens of the neighbouring Sommerberg, the Grass King was stripped of his greencasing; the crown was handed to the Mayor, and the branches were stuck in the flax fieldsin order to make the flax grow tall. In this last trait the fertilising influence ascribed to therepresentative of the tree-spirit comes out clearly. In the neighbourhood of Pilsen(Bohemia) a conical hut of green branches, without any door, is erected at Whitsuntide inthe midst of the village. To this hut rides a troop of village lads with a king at their head.He wears a sword at his side and a sugar-loaf hat of rushes on his head. In his train are ajudge, a crier, and a personage called the Frog-flayer or Hangman. This last is a sort ofragged merryandrew, wearing a rusty old sword and bestriding a sorry hack. On reachingthe hut the crier dismounts and goes round it looking for a door. Finding none, he says,“Ah, this is perhaps an enchanted castle; the witches creep through the leaves and need nodoor.” At last he draws his sword and hews his way into the hut, where there is a chair, onwhich he seats himself and proceeds to criticise in rhyme the girls, farmers, and farm-servants of the neighbourhood. When this is over, the Frog-flayer steps forward and, afterexhibiting a cage with frogs in it, sets up a gallows on which he hangs the frogs in a row. Inthe neighbourhood of Plas the ceremony differs in some points. The king and his soldiersare completely clad in bark, adorned with flowers and ribbons; they all carry swords andride horses, which are gay with green branches and flowers. While the village dames andgirls are being criticised at the arbour, a frog is secretly pinched and poked by the crier tillit quacks. Sentence of death is passed on the frog by the king; the hangman beheads it andflings the bleeding body among the spectators. Lastly, the king is driven from the hut andpursued by the soldiers. The pinching and beheading of the frog are doubtless, asMannhardt observes, a rain-charm. We have seen that some Indians of the Orinoco beatfrogs for the express purpose of producing rain, and that killing a frog is a European rain-charm.Often the spirit of vegetation in spring is represented by a queen instead of a king. In theneighbourhood of Libchowic (Bohemia), on the fourth Sunday in Lent, girls dressed inwhite and wearing the first spring flowers, as violets and daisies, in their hair, lead aboutthe village a girl who is called the Queen and is crowned with flowers. During theprocession, which is conducted with great solemnity, none of the girls may stand still, butmust keep whirling round continually and singing. In every house the Queen announces thearrival of spring and wishes the inmates good luck and blessings, for which she receivespresents. In German Hungary the girls choose the prettiest girl to be their WhitsuntideQueen, fasten a towering wreath on her brow, and carry her singing through the streets. Atevery house they stop, sing old ballads, and receive presents. In the south-east of Ireland onMay Day the prettiest girl used to be chosen Queen of the district for twelve months. Shewas crowned with wild flowers; feasting, dancing, and rustic sports followed, and wereclosed by a grand procession in the evening. During her year of office she presided overrural gatherings of young people at dances and merry-makings. If she married before nextMay Day, her authority was at an end, but her successor was not elected till that day cameround. The May Queen is common In France and familiar in England.Again the spirit of vegetation is sometimes represented by a king and queen, a lord andlady, or a bridegroom and bride. Here again the parallelism holds between theanthropomorphic and the vegetable representation of the tree-spirit, for we have seen"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"above that trees are sometimes married to each other. At Halford in South Warwickshirethe children go from house to house on May Day, walking two and two in procession andheaded by a King and Queen. Two boys carry a May-pole some six or seven feet high,which is covered with flowers and greenery. Fastened to it near the top are two cross-barsat right angles to each other. These are also decked with flowers, and from the ends of thebars hang hoops similarly adorned. At the houses the children sing May songs and receivemoney, which is used to provide tea for them at the schoolhouse in the afternoon. In aBohemian village near Königgrätz on Whit-Monday the children play the king’s game, atwhich a king and queen march about under a canopy, the queen wearing a garland, andthe youngest girl carrying two wreaths on a plate behind them. They are attended by boysand girls called groomsmen and bridesmaids, and they go from house to house collectinggifts. A regular feature in the popular celebration of Whitsuntide in Silesia used to be, andto some extent still is, the contest for the kingship. This contest took various forms, but themark or goal was generally the May-tree or May-pole. Sometimes the youth who succeededin climbing the smooth pole and bringing down the prize was proclaimed the WhitsuntideKing and his sweetheart the Whitsuntide Bride. Afterwards the king, carrying the May-bush, repaired with the rest of the company to the alehouse, where a dance and a feastended the merry-making. Often the young farmers and labourers raced on horseback tothe May-pole, which was adorned with flowers, ribbons, and a crown. He who first reachedthe pole was the Whitsuntide King, and the rest had to obey his orders for that day. Theworst rider became the clown. At the May-tree all dismounted and hoisted the king on theirshoulders. He nimbly swarmed up the pole and brought down the May-bush and thecrown, which had been fastened to the top. Meanwhile the clown hurried to the alehouseand proceeded to bolt thirty rolls of bread and to swig four quart bottles of brandy with theutmost possible despatch. He was followed by the king, who bore the May-bush and crownat the head of the company. If on their arrival the clown had already disposed of the rollsand the brandy, and greeted the king with a speech and a glass of beer, his score was paidby the king; otherwise he had to settle it himself. After church time the stately processionwound through the village. At the head of it rode the king, decked with flowers andcarrying the May-bush. Next came the clown with his clothes turned inside out, a greatflaxen beard on his chain, and the Whitsuntide crown on his head. Two riders disguised asguards followed. The procession drew up before every farmyard; the two guardsdismounted, shut the clown into the house, and claimed a contribution from the housewifeto buy soap with which to wash the clown’s beard. Custom allowed them to carry off anyvictuals which were not under lock and key. Last of all they came to the house in which theking’s sweetheart lived. She was greeted as Whitsuntide Queen and received suitablepresents—to wit, a many-coloured sash, a cloth, and an apron. The king got as a prize, avest, a neck-cloth, and so forth, and had the right of setting up the May-bush orWhitsuntide-tree before his master’s yard, where it remained as an honourable token tillthe same day next year. Finally the procession took its way to the tavern, where the kingand queen opened the dance. Sometimes the Whitsuntide King and Queen succeeded tooffice in a different way. A man of straw, as large as life and crowned with a red cap, wasconveyed in a cart, between two men armed and disguised as guards, to a place where amock court was waiting to try him. A great crowd followed the cart. After a formal trialthe straw man was condemned to death and fastened to a stake on the execution ground.The young men with bandaged eyes tried to stab him with a spear. He who succeeded"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"became king and his sweetheart queen. The straw man was known as the Goliath.In a parish of Denmark it used to be the custom at Whitsuntide to dress up a little girl asthe Whitsun-bride and a little boy as her groom. She was decked in all the finery of agrown-up bride, and wore a crown of the freshest flowers of spring on her head. Her groomwas as gay as flowers, ribbons, and knots could make him. The other children adornedthemselves as best they could with the yellow flowers of the trollius and caltha. Then theywent in great state from farmhouse to farmhouse, two little girls walking at the head of theprocession as bridesmaids, and six or eight outriders galloping ahead on hobby-horses toannounce their coming. Contributions of eggs, butter, loaves, cream, coffee, sugar, andtallow-candles were received and conveyed away in baskets. When they had made theround of the farms, some of the farmers’ wives helped to arrange the wedding feast, andthe children danced merrily in clogs on the stamped clay floor till the sun rose and thebirds began to sing. All this is now a thing of the past. Only the old folks still remember thelittle Whitsun-bride and her mimic pomp.We have seen that in Sweden the ceremonies associated elsewhere with May Day orWhitsuntide commonly take place at Midsummer. Accordingly we find that in some partsof the Swedish province of Blekinge they still choose a Midsummer’s Bride, to whom the“church coronet” is occasionally lent. The girl selects for herself a Bridegroom, and acollection is made for the pair, who for the time being are looked on as man and wife. Theother youths also choose each his bride. A similar ceremony seems to be still kept up inNorway.In the neighbourhood of Briançon (Dauphiné) on May Day the lads wrap up in greenleaves a young fellow whose sweetheart has deserted him or married another. He lies downon the ground and feigns to be asleep. Then a girl who likes him, and would marry him,comes and wakes him, and raising him up offers him her arm and a flag. So they go to thealehouse, where the pair lead off the dancing. But they must marry within the year, or theyare treated as old bachelor and old maid, and are debarred the company of the young folks.The lad is called the Bridegroom of the month of May. In the alehouse he puts off hisgarment of leaves, out of which, mixed with flowers, his partner in the dance makes anosegay, and wears it at her breast next day, when he leads her again to the alehouse. Likethis is a Russian custom observed in the district of Nerechta on the Thursday beforeWhitsunday. The girls go out into a birch-wood, wind a girdle or band round a statelybirch, twist its lower branches into a wreath, and kiss each other in pairs through thewreath. The girls who kiss through the wreath call each other gossips. Then one of the girlssteps forward, and mimicking a drunken man, flings herself on the ground, rolls on thegrass, and feigns to fall fast asleep. Another girl wakens the pretended sleeper and kisseshim; then the whole bevy trips singing through the wood to twine garlands, which theythrow into the water. In the fate of the garlands floating on the stream they read their own.Here the part of the sleeper was probably at one time played by a lad. In these French andRussian customs we have a forsaken bridegroom, in the following a forsaken bride. OnShrove Tuesday the Slovenes of Oberkrain drag a straw puppet with joyous cries up anddown the village; then they throw it into the water or burn it, and from the height of theflames they judge of the abundance of the next harvest. The noisy crew is followed by afemale masker, who drags a great board by a string and gives out that she is a forsaken"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"bride.Viewed in the light of what has gone before, the awakening of the forsaken sleeper in theseceremonies probably represents the revival of vegetation in spring. But it is not easy toassign their respective parts to the forsaken bridegroom and to the girl who wakes himfrom his slumber. Is the sleeper the leafless forest or the bare earth of winter? Is the girlwho awakens him the fresh verdure or the genial sunshine of spring? It is hardly possible,on the evidence before us, to answer these questions.In the Highlands of Scotland the revival of vegetation in spring used to be graphicallyrepresented on St. Bride’s Day, the first of February. Thus in the Hebrides “the mistressand servants of each family take a sheaf of oats, and dress it up in women’s apparel, put itin a large basket and lay a wooden club by it, and this they call Briid’s bed; and then themistress and servants cry three times, ‘Briid is come, Briid is welcome.’ This they do justbefore going to bed, and when they rise in the morning they look among the ashes,expecting to see the impression of Briid’s club there; which if they do, they reckon it a truepresage of a good crop and prosperous year, and the contrary they take as an ill omen.”The same custom is described by another witness thus: “Upon the night before Candlemasit is usual to make a bed with corn and hay, over which some blankets are laid, in a part ofthe house, near the door. When it is ready, a person goes out and repeats three times, ...‘Bridget, Bridget, come in; thy bed is ready.’ One or more candles are left burning near itall night.” Similarly in the Isle of Man “on the eve of the first of February, a festival wasformerly kept, called, in the Manks language, Laa’l Breeshey, in honour of the Irish ladywho went over to the Isle of Man to receive the veil from St. Maughold. The custom was togather a bundle of green rushes, and standing with them in the hand on the threshold ofthe door, to invite the holy Saint Bridget to come and lodge with them that night. In theManks language, the invitation ran thus: ‘Brede, Brede, tar gys my thie tar dyn thie aymsnoght Foshil jee yn dorrys da Brede, as lhig da Brede e heet staigh.’ In English: ‘Bridget,Bridget, come to my house, come to my house to-night. Open the door for Bridget, and letBridget come in.’ After these words were repeated, the rushes were strewn on the floor byway of a carpet or bed for St. Bridget. A custom very similar to this was also observed insome of the Out-Isles of the ancient Kingdom of Man.” In these Manx and Highlandceremonies it is obvious that St. Bride, or St. Bridget, is an old heathen goddess of fertility,disguised in a threadbare Christian cloak. Probably she is no other than Brigit, the Celticgoddess of fire and apparently of the crops.Often the marriage of the spirit of vegetation in spring, though not directly represented, isimplied by naming the human representative of the spirit, “the Bride,” and dressing her inwedding attire. Thus in some villages of Altmark at Whitsuntide, while the boys go aboutcarrying a May-tree or leading a boy enveloped in leaves and flowers, the girls lead aboutthe May Bride, a girl dressed as a bride with a great nosegay in her hair. They go fromhouse to house, the May Bride singing a song in which she asks for a present and tells theinmates of each house that if they give her something they will themselves have somethingthe whole year through; but if they give her nothing they will themselves have nothing. Insome parts of Westphalia two girls lead a flower-crowned girl called the Whitsuntide Bridefrom door to door, singing a song in which they ask for eggs."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"XI. The Influence of the Sexes on VegetationFROM THE PRECEDING examination of the spring and summer festivals of Europe wemay infer that our rude forefathers personified the powers of vegetation as male andfemale, and attempted, on the principle of homoeopathic or imitative magic, to quicken thegrowth of trees and plants by representing the marriage of the sylvan deities in the personsof a King and Queen of May, a Whitsun Bridegroom and Bride, and so forth. Suchrepresentations were accordingly no mere symbolic or allegorical dramas, pastoral playsdesigned to amuse or instruct a rustic audience. They were charms intended to make thewoods to grow green, the fresh grass to sprout, the corn to shoot, and the flowers to blow.And it was natural to suppose that the more closely the mock marriage of the leaf-clad orflower-decked mummers aped the real marriage of the woodland sprites, the more effectivewould be the charm. Accordingly we may assume with a high degree of probability that theprofligacy which notoriously attended these ceremonies was at one time not an accidentalexcess but an essential part of the rites, and that in the opinion of those who performedthem the marriage of trees and plants could not be fertile without the real union of thehuman sexes. At the present day it might perhaps be vain to look in civilised Europe forcustoms of this sort observed for the explicit purpose of promoting the growth ofvegetation. But ruder races in other parts of the world have consciously employed theintercourse of the sexes as a means to ensure the fruitfulness of the earth; and some riteswhich are still, or were till lately, kept up in Europe can be reasonably explained only asstunted relics of a similar practice. The following facts will make this plain.For four days before they committed the seed to the earth the Pipiles of Central Americakept apart from their wives “in order that on the night before planting they might indulgetheir passions to the fullest extent; certain persons are even said to have been appointed toperform the sexual act at the very moment when the first seeds were deposited in theground.” The use of their wives at that time was indeed enjoined upon the people by thepriests as a religious duty, in default of which it was not lawful to sow the seed. The onlypossible explanation of this custom seems to be that the Indians confused the process bywhich human beings reproduce their kind with the process by which plants discharge thesame function, and fancied that by resorting to the former they were simultaneouslyforwarding the latter. In some parts of Java, at the season when the bloom will soon be onthe rice, the husbandman and his wife visit their fields by night and there engage in sexualintercourse for the purpose of promoting the growth of the crop. In the Leti, Sarmata, andsome other groups of islands which lie between the western end of New Guinea and thenorthern part of Australia, the heathen population regard the sun as the male principle bywhom the earth or female prínciple is fertilised. They call him Upu-lera or Mr. Sun, andrepresent him under the form of a lamp made of coco-nut leaves, which may be seenhanging everywhere in their houses and in the sacred fig-tree. Under the tree lies a largeflat stone, which serves as a sacrificial table. On it the heads of slain foes were and are stillplaced in some of the islands. Once a year, at the beginning of the rainy season, Mr. Suncomes down into the holy fig-tree to fertilise the earth, and to facilitate his descent a ladderwith seven rungs is considerately placed at his disposal. It is set up under the tree and isadorned with carved figures of the birds whose shrill clarion heralds the approach of thesun in the east. On this occasion pigs and dogs are sacrificed in profusion; men and womenalike indulge in a saturnalia; and the mystic union of the sun and the earth is dramatically"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"represented in public, amid song and dance, by the real union of the sexes under the tree.The object of the festival, we are told, is to procure rain, plenty of food and drink,abundance of cattle and children and riches from Grandfather Sun. They pray that he maymake every she-goat to cast two or three young, the people to multiply, the dead pigs to bereplaced by living pigs, the empty rice-baskets to be filled, and so on. And to induce him togrant their requests they offer him pork and rice and liquor, and invite him to fall to. In theBabar Islands a special flag is hoisted at this festival as a symbol of the creative energy ofthe sun; it is of white cotton, about nine feet high, and consists of the figure of a man in anappropriate attitude. It would be unjust to treat these orgies as a mere outburst ofunbridled passion; no doubt they are deliberately and solemnly organised as essential tothe fertility of the earth and the welfare of man.The same means which are thus adopted to stimulate the growth of the crops are naturallyemployed to ensure the fruitfulness of trees. In some parts of Amboyna, when the state ofthe clove plantation indicates that the crop is likely to be scanty, the men go naked to theplantations by night, and there seek to fertilise the trees precisely as they would impregnatewomen, while at the same time they call out for “More cloves!” This is supposed to makethe trees bear fruit more abundantly.The Baganda of Central Africa believe so strongly in the intimate relation between theintercourse of the sexes and the fertility of the ground that among them a barren wife isgenerally sent away, because she is supposed to prevent her husband’s garden frombearing fruit. On the contrary, a couple who have given proof of extraordinary fertility bybecoming the parents of twins are believed by the Baganda to be endowed with acorresponding power of increasing the fruitfulness of the plantain-trees, which furnishthem with their staple food. Some little time after the birth of the twins a ceremony isperformed, the object of which clearly is to transmit the reproductive virtue of the parentsto the plantains. The mother lies down on her back in the thick grass near the house andplaces a flower of the plantain between her legs; then her husband comes and knocks theflower away with his genital member. Further, the parents go through the countryperforming dances in the gardens of favoured friends, apparently for the purpose ofcausing the plantain-trees to bear fruit more abundantly.In various parts of Europe customs have prevailed both at spring and harvest which areclearly based on the same crude notion that the relation of the human sexes to each othercan be so used as to quicken the growth of plants. For example, in the Ukraine on St.George’s Day (the twenty-third of April) the priest in his robes, attended by his acolytes,goes out to the fields of the village, where the crops are beginning to show green above theground, and blesses them. After that the young married people lie down in couples on thesown fields and roll several times over on them, in the belief that this will promote thegrowth of the crops. In some parts of Russia the priest himself is rolled by women over thesprouting crop, and that without regard to the mud and holes which he may encounter inhis beneficent progress. If the shepherd resists or remonstrates, his flock murmurs, “LittleFather, you do not really wish us well, you do not wish us to have corn, although you dowish to live on our corn.” In some parts of Germany at harvest the men and women, whohave reaped the corn, roll together on the field. This again is probably a mitigation of anolder and ruder custom designed to impart fertility to the fields by methods like those"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"resorted to by the Pipiles of Central America long ago and by the cultivators of rice in Javaat the present time.To the student who cares to track the devious course of the human mind in its gropingsafter truth, it is of some interest to observe that the same theoretical belief in thesympathetic influence of the sexes on vegetation, which has led some peoples to indulgetheir passions as a means of fertilising the earth, has led others to seek the same end bydirectly opposite means. From the moment that they sowed the maize till the time that theyreaped it, the Indians of Nicaragua lived chastely, keeping apart from their wives andsleeping in a separate place. They ate no salt, and drank neither cocoa nor chicha, thefermented liquor made from maize; in short the season was for them, as the Spanishhistorian observes, a time of abstinence. To this day some of the Indian tribes of CentralAmerica practise continence for the purpose of thereby promoting the growth of the crops.Thus we are told that before sowing the maize the Kekchi Indians sleep apart from theirwives, and eat no flesh for five days, while among the Lanquineros and Cajaboneros theperiod of abstinence from these carnal pleasures extends to thirteen days. So amongst someof the Germans of Transylvania it is a rule that no man may sleep with his wife during thewhole of the time that he is engaged in sowing his fields. The same rule is observed atKalotaszeg in Hungary; the people think that if the custom were not observed the cornwould be mildewed. Similarly a Central Australian headman of the Kaitish tribe strictlyabstains from marital relations with his wife all the time that he is performing magicalceremonies to make the grass grow; for he believes that a breach of this rule would preventthe grass seed from sprouting properly. In some of the Melanesian islands, when the yamvines are being trained, the men sleep near the gardens and never approach their wives;should they enter the garden after breaking this rule of continence the fruits of the gardenwould be spoilt.If we ask why it is that similar beliefs should logically lead, among different peoples, tosuch opposite modes of conduct as strict chastity and more or less open debauchery, thereason, as it presents itself to the primitive mind, is perhaps not very far to seek. If rudeman identifies himself, in a manner, with nature; if he fails to distinguish the impulses andprocesses in himself from the methods which nature adopts to ensure the reproduction ofplants and animals, he may leap to one of two conclusions. Either he may infer that byyielding to his appetites he will thereby assist in the multiplication of plants and animals; orhe may imagine that the vigour which he refuses to expend in reproducing his own kind,will form as it were a store of energy whereby other creatures, whether vegetable oranimal, will somehow benefit in propagating their species. Thus from the same crudephilosophy, the same primitive notions of nature and life, the savage may derive bydifferent channels a rule either of profligacy or of asceticism.To readers bred in religion which is saturated with the ascetic idealism of the East, theexplanation which I have given of the rule of continence observed under certaincircumstances by rude or savage peoples may seem far-fetched and improbable. They maythink that moral purity, which is so intimately associated in their minds with theobservance of such a rule, furnishes a sufficient explanation of it; they may hold withMilton that chastity in itself is a noble virtue, and that the restraint which it imposes on oneof the strongest impulses of our animal nature marks out those who can submit to it as men"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"raised above the common herd, and therefore worthy to receive the seal of the divineapprobation. However natural this mode of thought may seem to us, it is utterly foreignand indeed incomprehensible to the savage. If he resists on occasion the sexual instinct, it isfrom no high idealism, no ethereal aspiration after moral purity, but for the sake of someulterior yet perfectly definite and concrete object, to gain which he is prepared to sacrificethe immediate gratification of his senses. That this is or may be so, the examples I havecited are amply sufficient to prove. They show that where the instinct of self-preservation,which manifests itself chiefly in the search for food, conflicts or appears to conflict with theinstinct which conduces to the propagation of the species, the former instinct, as theprimary and more fundamental, is capable of overmastering the latter. In short, the savageis willing to restrain his sexual propensity for the sake of food. Another object for the sakeof which he consents to exercise the same self-restraint is victory in war. Not only thewarrior in the field but his friends at home will often bridle their sensual appetites from abelief that by so doing they will the more easily overcome their enemies. The fallacy of sucha belief, like the belief that the chastity of the sower conduces to the growth of the seed, isplain enough to us; yet perhaps the self-restraint which these and the like beliefs, vain andfalse as they are, have imposed on mankind, has not been without its utility in bracing andstrengthening the breed. For strength of character in the race as in the individual consistsmainly in the power of sacrificing the present to the future, of disregarding the immediatetemptations of ephemeral pleasure for more distant and lasting sources of satisfaction. Themore the power is exercised the higher and stronger becomes the character; till the heightof heroism is reached in men who renounce the pleasures of life and even life itself for thesake of keeping or winning for others, perhaps in distant ages, the blessings of freedom andtruth.XII. The Sacred Marriage1. Diana as a Goddess of FertilityWE have seen that according to a widespread belief, which is not without a foundation infact, plants reproduce their kinds through the sexual union of male and female elements,and that on the principle of homoeopathic or imitative magic this reproduction is supposedto be stimulated by the real or mock marriage of men and women, who masquerade for thetime being as spirits of vegetation. Such magical dramas have played a great part in thepopular festivals of Europe, and based as they are on a very crude conception of naturallaw, it is clear that they must have been handed down from a remote antiquity. We shallhardly, therefore, err in assuming that they date from a time when the forefathers of thecivilised nations of Europe were still barbarians, herding their cattle and cultivatingpatches of corn in the clearings of the vast forests, which then covered the greater part ofthe continent, from the Mediterranean to the Arctic Ocean. But if these old spells andenchantments for the growth of leaves and blossoms, of grass and flowers and fruit, havelingered down to our own time in the shape of pastoral plays and popular merry-makings,is it not reasonable to suppose that they survived in less attenuated forms some twothousand years ago among the civilised peoples of antiquity? Or, to put it otherwise, is it"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"not likely that in certain festivals of the ancients we may be able to detect the equivalents ofour May Day, Whitsuntide, and Midsummer celebrations, with this difference, that in thosedays the ceremonies had not yet dwindled into mere shows and pageants, but were stillreligious or magical rites, in which the actors consciously supported the high parts of godsand goddesses? Now in the first chapter of this book we found reason to believe that thepriest who bore the title of King of the Wood at Nemi had for his mate the goddess of thegrove, Diana herself. May not he and she, as King and Queen of the Wood, have beenserious counterparts of the merry mummers who play the King and Queen of May, theWhitsuntide Bridegroom and Bride in modern Europe? and may not their union have beenyearly celebrated in a theogamy or divine marriage? Such dramatic weddings of gods andgoddesses, as we shall see presently, were carried out as solemn religious rites in manyparts of the ancient world; hence there is no intrinsic improbability in the supposition thatthe sacred grove at Nemi may have been the scene of an annual ceremony of this sort.Direct evidence that it was so there is none, but analogy pleads in favour of the view, as Ishall now endeavour to show.Diana was essentially a goddess of the woodlands, as Ceres was a goddess of the corn andBacchus a god of the vine. Her sanctuaries were commonly in groves, indeed every grovewas sacred to her, and she is often associated with the forest god Silvanus in dedications.But whatever her origin may have been, Diana was not always a mere goddess of trees.Like her Greek sister Artemis, she appears to have developed into a personification of theteeming life of nature, both animal and vegetable. As mistress of the greenwood she wouldnaturally be thought to own the beasts, whether wild or tame, that ranged through it,lurking for their prey in its gloomy depths, munching the fresh leaves and shoots amongthe boughs, or cropping the herbage in the open glades and dells. Thus she might come tobe the patron goddess both of hunters and herdsmen, just as Silvanus was the god not onlyof woods, but of cattle. Similarly in Finland the wild beasts of the forest were regarded asthe herds of the woodland god Tapio and of his stately and beautiful wife. No man mightslay one of these animals without the gracious permission of their divine owners. Hence thehunter prayed to the sylvan deities, and vowed rich offerings to them if they would drivethe game across his path. And cattle also seem to have enjoyed the protection of thosespirits of the woods, both when they were in their stalls and while they strayed in the forest.Before the Gayos of Sumatra hunt deer, wild goats, or wild pigs with hounds in the woods,they deem it necessary to obtain the leave of the unseen Lord of the forest. This is doneaccording to a prescribed form by a man who has special skill in woodcraft. He lays down aquid of betel before a stake which is cut in a particular way to represent the Lord of theWood, and having done so he prays to the spirit to signify his consent or refusal. In histreatise on hunting, Arrian tells us that the Celts used to offer an annual sacrifice toArtemis on her birthday, purchasing the sacrificial victim with the fines which they hadpaid into her treasury for every fox, hare, and roe that they had killed in the course of theyear. The custom clearly implied that the wild beasts belonged to the goddess, and that shemust be compensated for their slaughter.But Diana was not merely a patroness of wild beasts, a mistress of woods and hills, of lonelyglades and sounding rivers; conceived as the moon, and especially, it would seem, as theyellow harvest moon, she filled the farmer’s grange with goodly fruits, and heard theprayers of women in travail. In her sacred grove at Nemi, as we have seen, she was"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"especially worshipped as a goddess of childbirth, who bestowed offspring on men andwomen. Thus Diana, like the Greek Artemis, with whom she was constantly identified, maybe described as a goddess of nature in general and of fertility in particular. We need notwonder, therefore, that in her sanctuary on the Aventine she was represented by an imagecopied from the many-breasted idol of the Ephesian Artemis, with all its crowded emblemsof exuberant fecundity. Hence too we can understand why an ancient Roman law,attributed to King Tullus Hostilius, prescribed that, when incest had been committed, anexpiatory sacrifice should be offered by the pontiffs in the grove of Diana. For we knowthat the crime of incest is commonly supposed to cause a dearth; hence it would be meetthat atonement for the offence should be made to the goddess of fertility.Now on the principle that the goddess of fertility must herself be fertile, it behoved Diana tohave a male partner. Her mate, if the testimony of Servius may be trusted, was that Virbiuswho had his representative, or perhaps rather his embodiment, in the King of the Wood atNemi. The aim of their union would be to promote the fruitfulness of the earth, of animals,and of mankind; and it might naturally be thought that this object would be more surelyattained if the sacred nuptials were celebrated every year, the parts of the divine bride andbridegroom being played either by their images or by living persons. No ancient writermentions that this was done in the grove at Nemi; but our knowledge of the Arician ritualis so scanty that the want of information on this head can hardly count as a fatal objectionto the theory. That theory, in the absence of direct evidence, must necessarily be based onthe analogy of similar customs practised elsewhere. Some modern examples of suchcustoms, more or less degenerate, were described in the last chapter. Here we shallconsider their ancient counterparts.2. The Marriage of the GodsAT BABYLON the imposing sanctuary of Bel rose like a pyramid above the city in a seriesof eight towers or stories, planted one on the top of the other. On the highest tower, reachedby an ascent which wound about all the rest, there stood a spacious temple, and in thetemple a great bed, magnificently draped and cushioned, with a golden table beside it. Inthe temple no image was to be seen, and no human being passed the night there, save asingle woman, whom, according to the Chaldean priests, the god chose from among all thewomen of Babylon. They said that the deity himself came into the temple at night and sleptin the great bed; and the woman, as a consort of the god, might have no intercourse withmortal man.At Thebes in Egypt a woman slept in the temple of Ammon as the consort of the god, and,like the human wife of Bel at Babylon, she was said to have no commerce with a man. InEgyptian texts she is often mentioned as “the divine consort,” and usually she was no less apersonage than the Queen of Egypt herself. For, according to the Egyptians, theirmonarchs were actually begotten by the god Ammon, who assumed for the time being theform of the reigning king, and in that disguise had intercourse with the queen. The divineprocreation is carved and painted in great detail on the walls of two of the oldest temples inEgypt, those of Deir el Bahari and Luxor; and the inscriptions attached to the paintingsleave no doubt as to the meaning of the scenes."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"At Athens the god of the vine, Dionysus, was annually married to the Queen, and it appearsthat the consummation of the divine union, as well as the espousals, was enacted at theceremony; but whether the part of the god was played by a man or an image we do notknow. We learn from Aristotle that the ceremony took place in the old official residence ofthe King, known as the Cattle-stall, which stood near the Prytaneum or Town-hall on thenorth-eastern slope of the Acropolis. The object of the marriage can hardly have been anyother than that of ensuring the fertility of the vines and other fruit-trees of which Dionysuswas the god. Thus both in form and in meaning the ceremony would answer to the nuptialsof the King and Queen of May.In the great mysteries solemnised at Eleusis in the month of September the union of thesky-god Zeus with the corn-goddess Demeter appears to have been represented by theunion of the hierophant with the priestess of Demeter, who acted the parts of god andgoddess. But their intercourse was only dramatic or symbolical, for the hierophant hadtemporarily deprived himself of his virility by an application of hemlock. The torcheshaving been extinguished, the pair descended into a murky place, while the throng ofworshippers awaited in anxious suspense the result of the mystic congress, on which theybelieved their own salvation to depend. After a time the hierophant reappeared, and in ablaze of light silently exhibited to the assembly a reaped ear of corn, the fruit of the divinemarriage. Then in a loud voice he proclaimed, “Queen Brimo has brought forth a sacredboy Brimos,” by which he meant, “The Mighty One has brought forth the Mighty.” Thecorn-mother in fact had given birth to her child, the corn, and her travail-pangs wereenacted in the sacred drama. This revelation of the reaped corn appears to have been thecrowning act of the mysteries. Thus through the glamour shed round these rites by thepoetry and philosophy of later ages there still looms, like a distant landscape through asunlit haze, a simple rustic festival designed to cover the wide Eleusinian plain with aplenteous harvest by wedding the goddess of the corn to the sky-god, who fertilised the bareearth with genial showers. Every few years the people of Plataea, in Boeotia, held a festivalcalled the Little Daedala, at which they felled an oak-tree in an ancient oak forest. Out ofthe tree they carved an image, and having dressed it as a bride, they set it on a bullock-cartwith a bridesmaid beside it. The image seems then to have been drawn to the bank of theriver Asopus and back to the town, attended by a piping and dancing crowd. Every sixtyyears the festival of the Great Daedala was celebrated by all the people of Boeotia; and at itall the images, fourteen in number, which had accumulated at the lesser festivals, weredragged on wains in procession to the river Asopus and then to the top of MountCithaeron, where they were burnt on a great pyre. The story told to explain the festivalssuggests that they celebrated the marriage of Zeus to Hera, represented by the oaken imagein bridal array. In Sweden every year a life-size image of Frey, the god of fertility, bothanimal and vegetable, was drawn about the country in a waggon attended by a beautifulgirl who was called the god’s wife. She acted also as his priestess in his great temple atUpsala. Wherever the waggon came with the image of the god and his blooming youngbride, the people crowded to meet them and offered sacrifices for a fruitful year.Thus the custom of marrying gods either to images or to human beings was widespreadamong the nations of antiquity. The ideas on which such a custom is based are too crude toallow us to doubt that the civilised Babylonians, Egyptians, and Greeks inherited it fromtheir barbarous or savage forefathers. This presumption is strengthened when we find rites"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"of a similar kind in vogue among the lower races. Thus, for example, we are told that onceupon a time the Wotyaks of the Malmyz district in Russia were distressed by a series of badharvests. They did not know what to do, but at last concluded that their powerful butmischievious god Keremet must be angry at being unmarried. So a deputation of eldersvisited the Wotyaks of Cura and came to an understanding with them on the subject. Thenthey returned home, laid in a large stock of brandy, and having made ready a gaily deckedwaggon and horses, they drove in procession with bells ringing, as they do when they arefetching home a bride, to the sacred grove at Cura. There they ate and drank merrily allnight, and next morning they cut a square piece of turf in the grove and took it home withthem. After that, though it fared well with the people of Malmyz, it fared ill with the peopleof Cura; for in Malmyz the bread was good, but in Cura it was bad. Hence the men of Curawho had consented to the marriage were blamed and roughly handled by their indignantfellow-villagers. “What they meant by this marriage ceremony,” says the writer whoreports it, “it is not easy to imagine. Perhaps, as Bechterew thinks, they meant to marryKeremet to the kindly and fruitful Mukylcin, the Earth-wife, in order that she mightinfluence him for good.” When wells are dug in Bengal, a wooden image of a god is madeand married to the goddess of water.Often the bride destined for the god is not a log or a cloud, but a living woman of flesh andblood. The Indians of a village in Peru have been known to marry a beautiful girl, aboutfourteen years of age, to a stone shaped like a human being, which they regarded as a god(huaca). All the villagers took part in the marriage ceremony, which lasted three days, andwas attended with much revelry. The girl thereafter remained a virgin and sacrificed to theidol for the people. They showed her the utmost reverence and deemed her divine. Everyyear about the middle of March, when the season for fishing with the dragnet began, theAlgonquins and Hurons married their nets to two young girls, aged six or seven. At thewedding feast the net was placed between the two maidens, and was exhorted to takecourage and catch many fish. The reason for choosing the brides so young was to makesure that they were virgins. The origin of the custom is said to have been this. One year,when the fishing season came round, the Algonquins cast their nets as usual, but tooknothing. Surprised at their want of success, they did not know what to make of it, till thesoul or genius (oki) of the net appeared to them in the likeness of a tall well-built man, whosaid to them in a great passion, “I have lost my wife and I cannot find one who has knownno other man but me; that is why you do not succeed, and why you never will succeed tillyou give me satisfaction on this head.” So the Algonquins held a council and resolved toappease the spirit of the net by marrying him to two such very young girls that he couldhave no ground of complaint on that score for the future. They did so, and the fishingturned out all that could be wished. The thing got wind among their neighbours theHurons, and they adopted the custom. A share of the catch was always given to the familiesof the two girls who acted as brides of the net for the year.The Oraons of Bengal worship the Earth as a goddess, and annually celebrate her marriagewith the Sun-god Dharme ̄ at the time when the sa ̄l tree is in blossom. The ceremony is asfollows. All bathe, then the men repair to the sacred grove (sarna), while the womenassemble at the house of the village priest. After sacrificing some fowls to the Sun-god andthe demon of the grove, the men eat and drink. “The priest is then carried back to thevillage on the shoulders of a strong man. Near the village the women meet the men and"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"wash their feet. With beating of drums and singing, dancing, and jumping, all proceed tothe priest’s house, which has been decorated with leaves and flowers. Then the usual formof marriage is performed between the priest and his wife, symbolising the supposed unionbetween Sun and Earth. After the ceremony all eat and drink and make merry; they danceand sing obscene songs, and finally indulge in the vilest orgies. The object is to move themother earth to become fruitful.” Thus the Sacred Marriage of the Sun and Earth,personated by the priest and his wife, is celebrated as a charm to ensure the fertility of theground; and for the same purpose, on the principle of homoeopathic magic, the peopleindulge in licentious orgy.It deserves to be remarked that the supernatural being to whom women are married isoften a god or spirit of water. Thus Mukasa, the god of the Victoria Nyanza lake, who waspropitiated by the Baganda every time they undertook a long voyage, had virgins providedfor him to serve as his wives. Like the Vestals they were bound to chastity, but unlike theVestals they seem to have been often unfaithful. The custom lasted until Mwanga wasconverted to Christianity. The Akikuyu of British East Africa worship the snake of acertain river, and at intervals of several years they marry the snake-god to women, butespecially to young girls. For this purpose huts are built by order of the medicine-men, whothere consummate the sacred marriage with the credulous female devotees. If the girls donot repair to the huts of their own accord in sufficient numbers, they are seized anddragged thither to the embraces of the deity. The offspring of these mystic unions appearsto be fathered on God (ngai); certainly there are children among the Akikuyu who pass forchildren of God. It is said that once, when the inhabitants of Cayeli in Buru—an EastIndian island—were threatened with destruction by a swarm of crocodiles, they ascribedthe misfortune to a passion which the prince of the crocodiles had conceived for a certaingirl. Accordingly, they compelled the damsel’s father to dress her in bridal array anddeliver her over to the clutches of her crocodile lover.A usage of the same sort is reported to have prevailed in the Maldive Islands before theconversion of the inhabitants to Islam. The famous Arab traveller Ibn Batutah hasdescribed the custom and the manner in which it came to an end. He was assured byseveral trustworthy natives, whose names he gives, that when the people of the islands wereidolaters there appeared to them every month an evil spirit among the jinn, who came fromacross the sea in the likeness of a ship full of burning lamps. The wont of the inhabitants, assoon as they perceived him, was to take a young virgin, and, having adorned her, to leadher to a heathen temple that stood on the shore, with a window looking out to sea. Therethey left the damsel for the night, and when they came back in the morning they found hera maid no more, and dead. Every month they drew lots, and he upon whom the lot fell gaveup his daughter to the jinnee of the sea. The last of the maidens thus offered to the demonwas rescued by a pious Berber, who by reciting the Koran succeeded in driving the jinneeback into the sea.Ibn Batutah’s narrative of the demon lover and his mortal brides closely resembles a well-known type of folk-tale, of which versions have been found from Japan and Annam in theEast to Senegambia, Scandinavia, and Scotland in the West. The story varies in detailsfrom people to people, but as commonly told it runs thus. A certain country is infested by amany-headed serpent, dragon, or other monster, which would destroy the whole people if a"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"human victim, generally a virgin, were not delivered up to him periodically. Many victimshave perished, and at last it has fallen to the lot of the king’s own daughter to be sacrificed.She is exposed to the monster, but the hero of the tale, generally a young man of humblebirth, interposes in her behalf, slays the monster, and receives the hand of the princess ashis reward. In many of the tales the monster, who is sometimes described as a serpent,inhabits the water of a sea, a lake, or a fountain. In other versions he is a serpent or dragonwho takes possession of the springs of water, and only allows the water to flow or thepeople to make use of it on condition of receiving a human victim.It would probably be a mistake to dismiss all these tales as pure inventions of the story-teller. Rather we may suppose that they reflect a real custom of sacrificing girls or womento be the wives of waterspirits, who are very often conceived as great serpents or dragons.XIII. The Kings of Rome and Alba1. Numa and EgeriaFROM THE FOREGOING survey of custom and legend we may infer that the sacredmarriage of the powers both of vegetation and of water has been celebrated by manypeoples for the sake of promoting the fertility of the earth, on which the life of animals andmen ultimately depends, and that in such rites the part of the divine bridegroom or bride isoften sustained by a man or woman. The evidence may, therefore, lend some countenanceto the conjecture that in the sacred grove at Nemi, where the powers of vegetation and ofwater manifested themselves in the fair forms of shady woods, tumbling cascades, andglassy lake, a marriage like that of our King and Queen of May was annually celebratedbetween the mortal King of the Wood and the immortal Queen of the Wood, Diana. In thisconnexion an important figure in the grove was the water-nymph Egeria, who wasworshipped by pregnant women because she, like Diana, could grant them an easydelivery. From this it seems fairly safe to conclude that, like many other springs, the waterof Egeria was credited with a power of facilitating conception as well as delivery. Thevotive offerings found on the spot, which clearly refer to the begetting of children, maypossibly have been dedicated to Egeria rather than to Diana, or perhaps we should rathersay that the water-nymph Egeria is only another form of the great nature-goddess Dianaherself, the mistress of sounding rivers as well as of umbrageous woods, who had her homeby the lake and her mirror in its calm waters, and whose Greek counterpart Artemis lovedto haunt meres and springs. The identification of Egeria with Diana is confirmed by astatement of Plutarch that Egeria was one of the oak-nymphs whom the Romans believedto preside over every green oak-grove; for, while Diana was a goddess of the woodlands ingeneral, she appears to have been intimately associated with oaks in particular, especiallyat her sacred grove of Nemi. Perhaps, then, Egeria was the fairy of a spring that flowedfrom the roots of a sacred oak. Such a spring is said to have gushed from the foot of thegreat oak at Dodona, and from its murmurous flow the priestess drew oracles. Among theGreeks a draught of water from certain sacred springs or wells was supposed to conferprophetic powers. This would explain the more than mortal wisdom with which, according"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"to tradition, Egeria inspired her royal husband or lover Numa. When we remember howvery often in early society the king is held responsible for the fall of rain and thefruitfulness of the earth, it seems hardly rash to conjecture that in the legend of thenuptials of Numa and Egeria we have a reminiscence of a sacred marriage which the oldRoman kings regularly contracted with a goddess of vegetation and water for the purposeof enabling him to discharge his divine or magical functions. In such a rite the part of thegoddess might be played either by an image or a woman, and if by a woman, probably bythe Queen. If there is any truth in this conjecture, we may suppose that the King andQueen of Rome masqueraded as god and goddess at their marriage, exactly as the Kingand Queen of Egypt appear to have done. The legend of Numa and Egeria points to asacred grove rather than to a house as the scene of the nuptial union, which, like themarriage of the King and Queen of May, or of the vine-god and the Queen of Athens, mayhave been annually celebrated as a charm to ensure the fertility not only of the earth but ofman and beast. Now, according to some accounts, the scene of the marriage was no otherthan the sacred grove of Nemi, and on quite independent grounds we have been led tosuppose that in that same grove the King of the Wood was wedded to Diana. Theconvergence of the two distinct lines of enquiry suggests that the legendary union of theRoman king with Egeria may have been a reflection or duplicate of the union of the King ofthe Wood with Egeria or her double Diana. This does not imply that the Roman kings everserved as Kings of the Wood in the Arician grove, but only that they may originally havebeen invested with a sacred character of the same general kind, and may have held officeon similar terms. To be more explicit, it is possible that they reigned, not by right of birth,but in virtue of their supposed divinity as representatives or embodiments of a god, andthat as such they mated with a goddess, and had to prove their fitness from time to time todischarge their divine functions by engaging in a severe bodily struggle, which may oftenhave proved fatal to them, leaving the crown to their victorious adversary. Our knowledgeof the Roman kingship is far too scanty to allow us to affirm any one of these propositionswith confidence; but at least there are some scattered hints or indications of a similarity inall these respects between the priests of Nemi and the kings of Rome, or perhaps ratherbetween their remote predecessors in the dark ages which preceded the dawn of legend.2. The King as JupiterIN THE FIRST place, then, it would seem that the Roman king personated no less a deitythan Jupiter himself. For down to imperial times victorious generals celebrating a triumph,and magistrates presiding at the games in the Circus, wore the costume of Jupiter, whichwas borrowed for the occasion from his great temple on the Capitol; and it has been heldwith a high degree of probability both by ancients and moderns that in so doing theycopied the traditionary attire and insignia of the Roman kings. They rode a chariot drawnby four laurel-crowned horses through the city, where every one else went on foot: theywore purple robes embroidered or spangled with gold: in the right hand they bore abranch of laurel, and in the left hand an ivory sceptre topped with an eagle: a wreath oflaurel crowned their brows: their face was reddened with vermilion; and over their head aslave held a heavy crown of massy gold fashioned in the likeness of oak leaves. In this attirethe assimilation of the man to the god comes out above all in the eagle-topped sceptre, the"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"oaken crown, and the reddened face. For the eagle was the bird of Jove, the oak was hissacred tree, and the face of his image standing in his four-horse chariot on the Capitol wasin like manner regularly dyed red on festivals; indeed, so important was it deemed to keepthe divine features properly rouged that one of the first duties of the censors was tocontract for having this done. As the triumphal procession always ended in the temple ofJupiter on the Capitol, it was peculiarly appropriate that the head of the victor should begraced by a crown of oak leaves, for not only was every oak consecrated to Jupiter, but theCapitoline temple of the god was said to have been built by Romulus beside a sacred oak,venerated by shepherds, to which the king attached the spoils won by him from theenemy’s general in battle. We are expressly told that the oak crown was sacred toCapitoline Jupiter; a passage of Ovid proves that it was regarded as the god’s specialemblem.According to a tradition which we have no reason to reject, Rome was founded by settlersfrom Alba Longa, a city situated on the slope of the Alban hills, overlooking the lake andthe Campagna. Hence if the Roman kings claimed to be representatives or embodiments ofJupiter, the god of the sky, of the thunder, and of the oak, it is natural to suppose that thekings of Alba, from whom the founder of Rome traced his descent, may have set up thesame claim before them. Now the Alban dynasty bore the name of Silvii or Wood, and itcan hardly be without significance that in the vision of the historic glories of Rome revealedto Aeneas in the underworld, Virgil, an antiquary as well as a poet, should represent all theline of Silvii as crowned with oak. A chaplet of oak leaves would thus seem to have beenpart of the insignia of the old kings of Alba Longa as of their successors the kings of Rome;in both cases it marked the monarch as the human representative of the oak-god. TheRoman annals record that one of the kings of Alba, Romulus, Remulus, or Amulius Silviusby name, set up for being a god in his own person, the equal or superior of Jupiter. Tosupport his pretensions and overawe his subjects, he constructed machines whereby hemimicked the clap of thunder and the flash of lightning. Diodorus relates that in the seasonof fruitage, when thunder is loud and frequent, the king commanded his soldiers to drownthe roar of heaven’s artillery by clashing their swords against their shields. But he paid thepenalty of his impiety, for he perished, he and his house, struck by a thunderbolt in themidst of a dreadful storm. Swollen by the rain, the Alban lake rose in flood and drownedhis palace. But still, says an ancient historian, when the water is low and the surfaceunruffled by a breeze, you may see the ruins of the palace at the bottom of the clear lake.Taken along with the similar story of Salmoneus, king of Elis, this legend points to a realcustom observed by the early kings of Greece and Italy, who, like their fellows in Africadown to modern times, may have been expected to produce rain and thunder for the goodof the crops. The priestly king Numa passed for an adept in the art of drawing downlightning from the sky. Mock thunder, we know, has been made by various peoples as arain-charm in modern times; why should it not have been made by kings in antiquity?Thus, if the kings of Alba and Rome imitated Jupiter as god of the oak by wearing a crownof oak leaves, they seem also to have copied him in his character of a weather-god bypretending to make thunder and lightning. And if they did so, it is probable that, likeJupiter in heaven and many kings on earth, they also acted as public rain-makers,wringing showers from the dark sky by their enchantments whenever the parched earthcried out for the refreshing moisture. At Rome the sluices of heaven were opened by means"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"of a sacred stone, and the ceremony appears to have formed part of the ritual of JupiterElicius, the god who elicits from the clouds the flashing lightning and the dripping rain.And who so well fitted to perform the ceremony as the king, the living representative of thesky-god?If the kings of Rome aped Capitoline Jove, their predecessors the kings of Alba probablylaid themselves out to mimic the great Latian Jupiter, who had his seat above the city onthe summit of the Alban Mountain. Latinus, the legendary ancestor of the dynasty, wassaid to have been changed into Latian Jupiter after vanishing from the world in themysterious fashion characteristic of the old Latin kings. The sanctuary of the god on thetop of the mountain was the religious centre of the Latin League, as Alba was its politicalcapital till Rome wrested the supremacy from its ancient rival. Apparently no temple, inour sense of the word, was ever erected to Jupiter on this his holy mountain; as god of thesky and thunder he appropriately received the homage of his worshippers in the open air.The massive wall, of which some remains still enclose the old garden of the Passionistmonastery, seems to have been part of the sacred precinct which Tarquin the Proud, thelast king of Rome, marked out for the solemn annual assembly of the Latin League. Thegod’s oldest sanctuary on this airy mountain-top was a grove; and bearing in mind notmerely the special consecration of the oak to Jupiter, but also the traditional oak crown ofthe Alban kings and the analogy of the Capitoline Jupiter at Rome, we may suppose thatthe trees in the grove were oaks. We know that in antiquity Mount Algidus, an outlyinggroup of the Alban hills, was covered with dark forests of oak; and among the tribes whobelonged to the Latin League in the earliest days, and were entitled to share the flesh of thewhite bull sacrificed on the Alban Mount, there was one whose members styled themselvesthe Men of the Oak, doubtless on account of the woods among which they dwelt.But we should err if we pictured to ourselves the country as covered in historical times withan unbroken forest of oaks. Theophrastus has left us a description of the woods of Latiumas they were in the fourth century before Christ. He says: “The land of the Latins is allmoist. The plains produce laurels, myrtles, and wonderful beeches; for they fell trees ofsuch a size that a single stem suffices for the keel of a Tyrrhenian ship. Pines and firs growin the mountains. What they call the land of Circe is a lofty headland thickly wooded withoak, myrtle, and luxuriant laurels. The natives say that Circe dwelt there, and they showthe grave of Elpenor, from which grow myrtles such as wreaths are made of, whereas theother myrtle-trees are tall.” Thus the prospect from the top of the Alban Mount in theearly days of Rome must have been very different in some respects from what it is to-day.The purple Apennines, indeed, in their eternal calm on the one hand, and the shiningMediterranean in its eternal unrest on the other, no doubt looked then much as they looknow, whether bathed in sunshine, or chequered by the fleeting shadows of clouds; butinstead of the desolate brown expanse of the fever-stricken Campagna, spanned by its longlines of ruined aqueducts, like the broken arches of the bridge in the vision of Mirza, theeye must have ranged over woodlands that stretched away, mile after mile, on all sides, tilltheir varied hues of green or autumnal scarlet and gold melted insensibly into the blue ofthe distant mountains and sea.But Jupiter did not reign alone on the top of his holy mountain. He had his consort withhim, the goddess Juno, who was worshipped here under the same title, Moneta, as on the"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Capitol at Rome. As the oak crown was sacred to Jupiter and Juno on the Capitol, so wemay suppose it was on the Alban Mount, from which the Capitoline worship was derived.Thus the oak-god would have his oak-goddess in the sacred oak grove. So at Dodona theoak-god Zeus was coupled with Dione, whose very name is only a dialectically differentform of Juno; and so on the top of Mount Cithaeron, as we have seen, he appears to havebeen periodically wedded to an oaken image of Hera. It is probable, though it cannot bepositively proved, that the sacred marriage of Jupiter and Juno was annually celebrated byall the peoples of the Latin stock in the month which they named after the goddess, themidsummer month of June.If at any time of the year the Romans celebrated the sacred marriage of Jupiter and Juno,as the Greeks commonly celebrated the corresponding marriage of Zeus and Hera, we maysuppose that under the Republic the ceremony was either performed over images of thedivine pair or acted by the Flamen Dialis and his wife the Flaminica. For the Flamen Dialiswas the priest of Jove; indeed, ancient and modern writers have regarded him, with muchprobability, as a living image of Jupiter, a human embodiment of the sky-god. In earliertimes the Roman king, as representative of Jupiter, would naturally play the part of theheavenly bridegroom at the sacred marriage, while his queen would figure as the heavenlybride, just as in Egypt the king and queen masqueraded in the character of deities, and asat Athens the queen annually wedded the vine-god Dionysus. That the Roman king andqueen should act the parts of Jupiter and Juno would seem all the more natural becausethese deities themselves bore the title of King and Queen.Whether that was so or not, the legend of Numa and Egeria appears to embody areminiscence of a time when the priestly king himself played the part of the divinebridegroom; and as we have seen reason to suppose that the Roman kings personated theoak-god, while Egeria is expressly said to have been an oak-nymph, the story of their unionin the sacred grove raises a presumption that at Rome in the regal period a ceremony wasperiodically performed exactly analogous to that which was annually celebrated at Athensdown to the time of Aristotle. The marriage of the King of Rome to the oak-goddess, likethe wedding of the vine-god to the Queen of Athens, must have been intended to quickenthe growth of vegetation by homoeopathic magic. Of the two forms of the rite we canhardly doubt that the Roman was the older, and that long before the northern invaders metwith the vine on the shores of the Mediterranean their forefathers had married the tree-godto the tree-goddess in the vast oak forests of Central and Northern Europe. In the Englandof our day the forests have mostly disappeared, yet still on many a village green and inmany a country lane a faded image of the sacred marriage lingers in the rustic pageantry ofMay Day.XIV. The Succession to the Kingdom in Ancient LatiumIN REGARD to the Roman king, whose priestly functions were inherited by his successorthe king of the Sacred Rites, the foregoing discussion has led us to the followingconclusions. He represented and indeed personated Jupiter, the great god of the sky, thethunder, and the oak, and in that character made rain, thunder, and lightning for the goodof his subjects, like many more kings of the weather in other parts of the world. Further, he"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"not only mimicked the oak-god by wearing an oak wreath and other insignia of divinity,but he was married to an oak-nymph Egeria, who appears to have been merely a local formof Diana in her character of a goddess of woods, of waters, and of child-birth. All theseconclusions, which we have reached mainly by a consideration of the Roman evidence, maywith great probability be applied to the other Latin communities. They too probably had ofold their divine or priestly kings, who transmitted their religious functions, without theircivil powers, to their successors the Kings of the Sacred Rites.But we have still to ask, What was the rule of succession to the kingdom among the oldLatin tribes? According to tradition, there were in all eight kings of Rome, and with regardto the five last of them, at all events, we can hardly doubt that they actually sat on thethrone, and that the traditional history of their reigns is, in its main outlines, correct. Nowit is very remarkable that though the first king of Rome, Romulus, is said to have beendescended from the royal house of Alba, in which the kingship is represented as hereditaryin the male line, not one of the Roman kings was immediately succeeded by his son on thethrone. Yet several left sons or grandsons behind them. On the other hand, one of them wasdescended from a former king through his mother, not through his father, and three of thekings, namely Tatius, the elder Tarquin, and Servius Tullius, were succeeded by their sons-in-law, who were all either foreigners or of foreign descent. This suggests that the right tothe kingship was transmitted in the female line, and was actually exercised by foreignerswho married the royal princesses. To put it in technical language, the succession to thekingship at Rome and probably in Latium generally would seem to have been determinedby certain rules which have moulded early society in many parts of the world, namelyexogamy, beena marriage, and female kinship or mother-kin. Exogamy is the rule whichobliges a man to marry a woman of a different clan from his own: beena marriage is therule that he must leave the home of his birth and live with his wife’s people; and femalekinship or mother-kin is the system of tracing relationship and transmitting the familyname through women instead of through men. If these principles regulated descent of thekingship among the ancient Latins, the state of things in this respect would be somewhat asfollows. The political and religious centre of each community would be the perpetual fireon the king’s hearth tended by Vestal Virgins of the royal clan. The king would be a man ofanother clan, perhaps of another town or even of another race, who had married adaughter of his predecessor and received the kingdom with her. The children whom he hadby her would inherit their mother’s name, not his; the daughters would remain at home;the sons, when they grew up, would go away into the world, marry, and settle in theirwives’ country, whether as kings or commoners. Of the daughters who stayed at home,some or all would be dedicated as Vestal Virgins for a longer or shorter time to the serviceof the fire on the hearth, and one of them would in time become the consort of her father’ssuccessor.This hypothesis has the advantage of explaining in a simple and natural way some obscurefeatures in the traditional history of the Latin kingship. Thus the legends which tell howLatin kings were born of virgin mothers and divine fathers become at least moreintelligible. For, stripped of their fabulous element, tales of this sort mean no more thanthat a woman has been gotten with child by a man unknown; and this uncertainty as tofatherhood is more easily compatible with a system of kinship which ignores paternity thanwith one which makes it all-important. If at the birth of the Latin kings their fathers were"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"really unknown, the fact points either to a general looseness of life in the royal family or toa special relaxation of moral rules on certain occasions, when men and women reverted fora season to the licence of an earlier age. Such Saturnalias are not uncommon at some stagesof social evolution. In our own country traces of them long survived in the practices of MayDay and Whitsuntide, if not of Christmas. Children born of more or less promiscuousintercourse which characterises festivals of this kind would naturally be fathered on thegod to whom the particular festival was dedicated.In this connexion it may be significant that a festival of jollity and drunkenness wascelebrated by the plebeians and slaves at Rome on Midsummer Day, and that the festivalwas specially associated with the fireborn King Servius Tullius, being held in honour ofFortuna, the goddess who loved Servius as Egeria loved Numa. The popular merrymakingsat this season included foot-races and boat-races; the Tiber was gay with flower-wreathedboats, in which young folk sat quaffing wine. The festival appears to have been a sort ofMidsummer Saturnalia answering to the real Saturnalia which fell at Midwinter. Inmodern Europe, as we shall learn later on, the great Midsummer festival has been above alla festival of lovers and of fire; one of its principal features is the pairing of sweethearts,who leap over the bonfires hand in hand or throw flowers across the flames to each other.And many omens of love and marriage are drawn from the flowers which bloom at thismystic season. It is the time of the roses and of love. Yet the innocence and beauty of suchfestivals in modern times ought not to blind us to the likelihood that in earlier days theywere marked by coarser features, which were probably of the essence of the rites. Indeed,among the rude Esthonian peasantry these features seem to have lingered down to our owngeneration, if not to the present day. One other feature in the Roman celebration ofMidsummer deserves to be specially noticed. The custom of rowing in flower-decked boatson the river on this day proves that it was to some extent a water festival; and water hasalways, down to modern times, played a conspicuous part in the rites of Midsummer Day,which explains why the Church, in throwing its cloak over the old heathen festival, chose todedicate it to St. John the Baptist.The hypothesis that the Latin kings may have been begotten at an annual festival of love isnecessarily a mere conjecture, though the traditional birth of Numa at the festival of theParilia, when shepherds leaped across the spring bonfires, as lovers leap across theMidsummer fires, may perhaps be thought to lend it a faint colour of probability. But it isquite possible that the uncertainty as to their fathers may not have arisen till long after thedeath of the kings, when their figures began to melt away into the cloudland of fable,assuming fantastic shapes and gorgeous colouring as they passed from earth to heaven. Ifthey were alien immigrants, strangers and pilgrims in the land they ruled over, it would benatural enough that the people should forget their lineage, and forgetting it should providethem with another, which made up in lustre what it lacked in truth. The final apotheosis,which represented the kings not merely as sprung from gods but as themselves deitiesincarnate, would be much facilitated if in their lifetime, as we have seen reason to think,they had actually laid claim to divinity.If among the Latins the women of royal blood always stayed at home and received as theirconsorts men of another stock, and often of another country, who reigned as kings in virtueof their marriage with a native princess, we can understand not only why foreigners wore"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"the crown at Rome, but also why foreign names occur in the list of the Alban kings. In astate of society where nobility is reckoned only through women—in other words, wheredescent through the mother is everything, and descent through the father is nothing—noobjection will be felt to uniting girls of the highest rank to men of humble birth, even toaliens or slaves, provided that in themselves the men appear to be suitable mates. Whatreally matters is that the royal stock, on which the prosperity and even the existence of thepeople is supposed to depend, should be perpetuated in a vigorous and efficient form, andfor this purpose it is necessary that the women of the royal family should bear children tomen who are physically and mentally fit, according to the standard of early society, todischarge the important duty of procreation. Thus the personal qualities of the kings at thisstage of social evolution are deemed of vital importance. If they, like their consorts, are ofroyal and divine descent, so much the better; but it is not essential that they should be so.At Athens, as at Rome, we find traces of succession to the throne by marriage with a royalprincess; for two of the most ancient kings of Athens, namely Cecrops and Amphictyon, aresaid to have married the daughters of their predecessors. This tradition is to a certainextent confirmed by evidence, pointing to the conclusion that at Athens male kinship waspreceded by female kinship.Further, if I am right in supposing that in ancient Latium the royal families kept theirdaughters at home and sent forth their sons to marry princesses and reign among theirwives’ people, it will follow that the male descendants would reign in successive generationsover different kingdoms. Now this seems to have happened both in ancient Greece and inancient Sweden; from which we may legitimately infer that it was a custom practised bymore than one branch of the Aryan stock in Europe. Many Greek traditions relate how aprince left his native land, and going to a far country married the king’s daughter andsucceeded to the kingdom. Various reasons are assigned by ancient Greek writers for thesemigrations of the princes. A common one is that the king’s son had been banished formurder. This would explain very well why he fled his own land, but it is no reason at allwhy he should become king of another. We may suspect that such reasons areafterthoughts devised by writers, who, accustomed to the rule that a son should succeed tohis father’s property and kingdom, were hard put to it to account for so many traditions ofkings’ sons who quitted the land of their birth to reign over a foreign kingdom. InScandinavian tradition we meet with traces of similar customs. For we read of daughters’husbands who received a share of the kingdoms of their royal fathers-in-law, even whenthese fathers-in-law had sons of their own; in particular, during the five generations whichpreceded Harold the Fair-haired, male members of the Ynglingar family, which is said tohave come from Sweden, are reported in the Heimskringla or Sagas of the Norwegian Kingsto have obtained at least six provinces in Norway by marriage with the daughters of thelocal kings.Thus it would seem that among some Aryan peoples, at a certain stage of their socialevolution, it has been customary to regard women and not men as the channels in whichroyal blood flows, and to bestow the kingdom in each successive generation on a man ofanother family, and often of another country, who marries one of the princesses and reignsover his wife’s people. A common type of popular tale, which relates how an adventurer,coming to a strange land, wins the hand of the king’s daughter and with her the half or the"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"whole of the kingdom, may well be a reminiscence of a real custom.Where usages and ideas of this sort prevail, it is obvious that the kingship is merely anappanage of marriage with a woman of the blood royal. The old Danish historian SaxoGrammaticus puts this view of the kingship very clearly in the mouth of Hermutrude, alegendary queen of Scotland. “Indeed she was a queen,” says Hermutrude, “and but thather sex gainsaid it, might be deemed a king; nay (and this is yet truer), whomsoever shethought worthy of her bed was at once a king, and she yielded her kingdom with herself.Thus her sceptre and her hand went together.” The statement is all the more significantbecause it appears to reflect the actual practice of the Pictish kings. We know from thetestimony of Bede that, whenever a doubt arose as to the succession, the Picts chose theirkings from the female rather than the male line.The personal qualities which recommended a man for a royal alliance and succession to thethrone would naturally vary according to the popular ideas of the time and the character ofthe king or his substitute, but it is reasonable to suppose that among them in early societyphysical strength and beauty would hold a prominent place.Sometimes apparently the right to the hand of the princess and to the throne has beendetermined by a race. The Alitemnian Libyans awarded the kingdom to the fleetest runner.Amongst the old Prussians, candidates for nobility raced on horseback to the king, and theone who reached him first was ennobled. According to tradition the earliest games atOlympia were held by Endymion, who set his sons to run a race for the kingdom. His tombwas said to be at the point of the racecourse from which the runners started. The famousstory of Pelops and Hippodamia is perhaps only another version of the legend that the firstraces at Olympia were run for no less a prize than a kingdom.These traditions may very well reflect a real custom of racing for a bride, for such a customappears to have prevailed among various peoples, though in practice it has degeneratedinto a mere form or pretence. Thus “there is one race, called the ‘Love Chase,’ which maybe considered a part of the form of marriage among the Kirghiz. In this the bride, armedwith a formidable whip, mounts a fleet horse, and is pursued by all the young men whomake any pretensions to her hand. She will be given as a prize to the one who catches her,but she has the right, besides urging on her horse to the utmost, to use her whip, often withno mean force, to keep off those lovers who are unwelcome to her, and she will probablyfavour the one whom she has already chosen in her heart.” The race for the bride is foundalso among the Koryaks of North-eastern Asia. It takes place in a large tent, round whichmany separate compartments called pologs are arranged in a continuous circle. The girlgets a start and is clear of the marriage if she can run through all the compartmentswithout being caught by the bridegroom. The women of the encampment place everyobstacle in the man’s way, tripping him up, belabouring him with switches, and so forth, sothat he has little chance of succeeding unless the girl wishes it and waits for him. Similarcustoms appear to have been practised by all the Teutonic peoples; for the German, Anglo-Saxon, and Norse languages possess in common a word for marriage which means simplybride-race. Moreover, traces of the custom survived into modern times.Thus it appears that the right to marry a girl, and especially a princess, has often beenconferred as a prize in an athletic contest. There would be no reason, therefore, for"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"surprise if the Roman kings, before bestowing their daughters in marriage, should haveresorted to this ancient mode of testing the personal qualities of their future sons-in-lawand successors. If my theory is correct, the Roman king and queen personated Jupiter andhis divine consort, and in the character of these divinities went through the annualceremony of a sacred marriage for the purpose of causing the crops to grow and men andcattle to be fruitful and multiply. Thus they did what in more northern lands we maysuppose the King and Queen of May were believed to do in days of old. Now we have seenthat the right to play the part of the King of May and to wed the Queen of May hassometimes been determined by an athletic contest, particularly by a race. This may havebeen a relic of an old marriage custom of the sort we have examined, a custom designed totest the fitness of a candidate for matrimony. Such a test might reasonably be applied withpeculiar rigour to the king in order to ensure that no personal defect should incapacitatehim for the performance of those sacred rites and ceremonies on which, even more than onthe despatch of his civil and military duties, the safety and prosperity of the communitywere believed to depend. And it would be natural to require of him that from time to timehe should submit himself afresh to the same ordeal for the sake of publicly demonstratingthat he was still equal to the discharge of his high calling. A relic of that test perhapssurvived in the ceremony known as the Flight of the King (regifugium), which continued tobe annually observed at Rome down to imperial times. On the twenty-fourth day ofFebruary a sacrifice used to be offered in the Comitium, and when it was over the King ofthe Sacred Rites fled from the Forum. We may conjecture that the Flight of the King wasoriginally a race for an annual kingship, which may have been awarded as a prize to thefleetest runner. At the end of the year the king might run again for a second term of office;and so on, until he was defeated and deposed or perhaps slain. In this way what had oncebeen a race would tend to assume the character of a flight and a pursuit. The king would begiven a start; he ran and his competitors ran after him, and if he were overtaken he had toyield the crown and perhaps his life to the lightest of foot among them. In time a man ofmasterful character might succeed in seating himself permanently on the throne andreducing the annual race or flight to the empty form which it seems always to have beenwithin historical times. The rite was sometimes interpreted as a commemoration of theexpulsion of the kings from Rome; but this appears to have been a mere afterthoughtdevised to explain a ceremony of which the old meaning was forgotten. It is far more likelythat in acting thus the King of the Sacred Rites was merely keeping up an ancient customwhich in the regal period had been annually observed by his predecessors the kings. Whatthe original intention of the rite may have been must probably always remain more or lessa matter of conjecture. The present explanation is suggested with a full sense of thedifficulty and obscurity in which the subject is involved.Thus if my theory is correct, the yearly flight of the Roman king was a relic of a time whenthe kingship was an annual office awarded, along with the hand of a princess, to thevictorious athlete or gladiator, who thereafter figured along with his bride as a god andgoddess at a sacred marriage designed to ensure the fertility of the earth by homoeopathicmagic. If I am right in supposing that in very early times the old Latin kings personated agod and were regularly put to death in that character, we can better understand themysterious or violent ends to which so many of them are said to have come. We have seenthat, according to tradition, one of the kings of Alba was killed by a thunderbolt forimpiously mimicking the thunder of Jupiter. Romulus is said to have vanished mysteriously"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"like Aeneas, or to have been cut to pieces by the patricians whom he had offended, and theseventh of July, the day on which he perished, was a festival which bore some resemblanceto the Saturnalia. For on that day the female slaves were allowed to take certainremarkable liberties. They dressed up as free women in the attire of matrons and maids,and in this guise they went forth from the city, scoffed and jeered at all whom they met,and engaged among themselves in a fight, striking and throwing stones at each other.Another Roman king who perished by violence was Tatius, the Sabine colleague ofRomulus. It is said that he was at Lavinium offering a public sacrifice to the ancestral gods,when some men, to whom he had given umbrage, despatched him with the sacrificialknives and spits which they had snatched from the altar. The occasion and the manner ofhis death suggest that the slaughter may have been a sacrifice rather than an assassination.Again, Tullus Hostilius, the successor of Numa, was commonly said to have been killed bylightning, but many held that he was murdered at the instigation of Ancus Marcius, whoreigned after him. Speaking of the more or less mythical Numa, the type of the priestlyking, Plutarch observes that “his fame was enhanced by the fortunes of the later kings. Forof the five who reigned after him the last was deposed and ended his life in exile, and of theremaining four not one died a natural death; for three of them were assassinated andTullus Hostilius was consumed by thunderbolts.”These legends of the violent ends of the Roman kings suggest that the contest by which theygained the throne may sometimes have been a mortal combat rather than a race. If thatwere so, the analogy which we have traced between Rome and Nemi would be still closer.At both places the sacred kings, the living representatives of the godhead, would thus beliable to suffer deposition and death at the hand of any resolute man who could prove hisdivine right to the holy office by the strong arm and the sharp sword. It would not besurprising if among the early Latins the claim to the kingdom should often have beensettled by single combat; for down to historical times the Umbrians regularly submittedtheir private disputes to the ordeal of battle, and he who cut his adversary’s throat wasthought thereby to have proved the justice of his cause beyond the reach of cavil.XV. The Worship of the OakTHE WORSHIP of the oak tree or of the oak god appears to have been shared by all thebranches of the Aryan stock in Europe. Both Greeks and Italians associated the tree withtheir highest god, Zeus or Jupiter, the divinity of the sky, the rain, and the thunder.Perhaps the oldest and certainly one of the most famous sanctuaries in Greece was that ofDodona, where Zeus was revered in the oracular oak. The thunder-storms which are saidto rage at Dodona more frequently than anywhere else in Europe, would render the spot afitting home for the god whose voice was heard alike in the rustling of the oak leaves and inthe crash of thunder. Perhaps the bronze gongs which kept up a humming in the windround the sanctuary were meant to mimick the thunder that might so often be heardrolling and rumbling in the coombs of the stern and barren mountains which shut in thegloomy valley. In Boeotia, as we have seen, the sacred marriage of Zeus and Hera, the oakgod and the oak goddess, appears to have been celebrated with much pomp by a religiousfederation of states. And on Mount Lycaeus in Arcadia the character of Zeus as god both of"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"the oak and of the rain comes out clearly in the rain charm practised by the priest of Zeus,who dipped an oak branch in a sacred spring. In his latter capacity Zeus was the god towhom the Greeks regularly prayed for rain. Nothing could be more natural; for often,though not always, he had his seat on the mountains where the clouds gather and the oaksgrow. On the Acropolis at Athens there was an image of Earth praying to Zeus for rain.And in time of drought the Athenians themselves prayed, “Rain, rain, O dear Zeus, on thecornland of the Athenians and on the plains.”Again, Zeus wielded the thunder and lightning as well as the rain. At Olympia andelsewhere he was worshipped under the surname of Thunderbolt; and at Athens there wasa sacrificial hearth of Lightning Zeus on the city wall, where some priestly officials watchedfor lightning over Mount Parnes at certain seasons of the year. Further, spots which hadbeen struck by lightning were regularly fenced in by the Greeks and consecrated to Zeusthe Descender, that is, to the god who came down in the flash from heaven. Altars were setup within these enclosures and sacrifices offered on them. Several such places are knownfrom inscriptions to have existed in Athens.Thus when ancient Greek kings claimed to be descended from Zeus, and even to bear hisname, we may reasonably suppose that they also attempted to exercise his divine functionsby making thunder and rain for the good of their people or the terror and confusion oftheir foes. In this respect the legend of Salmoneus probably reflects the pretensions of awhole class of petty sovereigns who reigned of old, each over his little canton, in the oak-clad highlands of Greece. Like their kinsmen the Irish kings, they were expected to be asource of fertility to the land and of fecundity to the cattle; and how could they fulfil theseexpectations better than by acting the part of their kinsman Zeus, the great god of the oak,the thunder, and the rain? They personified him, apparently, just as the Italian kingspersonified Jupiter.In ancient Italy every oak was sacred to Jupiter, the Italian counterpart of Zeus; and onthe Capitol at Rome the god was worshipped as the deity not merely of the oak, but of therain and the thunder. Contrasting the piety of the good old times with the scepticism of anage when nobody thought that heaven was heaven, or cared a fig for Jupiter, a Romanwriter tells us that in former days noble matrons used to go with bare feet, streaming hair,and pure minds, up the long Capitoline slope, praying to Jupiter for rain. And straightway,he goes on, it rained bucketsful, then or never, and everybody returned dripping likedrowned rats. “But nowadays,” says he, “we are no longer religious, so the fields liebaking.”When we pass from Southern to Central Europe we still meet with the great god of the oakand the thunder among the barbarous Aryans who dwelt in the vast primaeval forests.Thus among the Celts of Gaul the Druids esteemed nothing more sacred than the mistletoeand the oak on which it grew; they chose groves of oaks for the scene of their solemnservice, and they performed none of their rites without oak leaves. “The Celts,” says aGreek writer, “worship Zeus, and the Celtic image of Zeus is a tall oak.” The Celticconquerors, who settled in Asia in the third century before our era, appear to have carriedthe worship of the oak with them to their new home; for in the heart of Asia Minor theGalatian senate met in a place which bore the pure Celtic name of Drynemetum, “thesacred oak grove” or “the temple of the oak.” Indeed the very name of Druids is believed"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"by good authorities to mean no more than “oak men.”In the religion of the ancient Germans the veneration for sacred groves seems to have heldthe foremost place, and according to Grimm the chief of their holy trees was the oak. Itappears to have been especially dedicated to the god of thunder, Donar or Thunar, theequivalent of the Norse Thor; for a sacred oak near Geismar, in Hesse, which Boniface cutdown in the eighth century, went among the heathen by the name of Jupiter’s oak (roburJovis), which in old German would be Donares eih, “the oak of Donar.” That the Teutonicthunder god Donar, Thunar, Thor was identified with the Italian thunder god Jupiterappears from our word Thursday, Thunar’s day, which is merely a rendering of the Latindies Jovis. Thus among the ancient Teutons, as among the Greeks and Italians, the god ofthe oak was also the god of the thunder. Moreover, he was regarded as the great fertilisingpower, who sent rain and caused the earth to bear fruit; for Adam of Bremen tells us that“Thor presides in the air; he it is who rules thunder and lightning, wind and rains, fineweather and crops.” In these respects, therefore, the Teutonic thunder god again resembledhis southern counterparts Zeus and Jupiter.Amongst the Slavs also the oak appears to have been the sacred tree of the thunder godPerun, the counterpart of Zeus and Jupiter. It is said that at Novgorod there used to standan image of Perun in the likeness of a man with a thunder-stone in his hand. A fire of oakwood burned day and night in his honour; and if ever it went out the attendants paid fortheir negligence with their lives. Perun seems, like Zeus and Jupiter, to have been the chiefgod of his people; for Procopius tells us that the Slavs “believe that one god, the maker oflightning, is alone lord of all things, and they sacrifice to him oxen and every victim.”The chief deity of the Lithuanians was Perkunas or Perkuns, the god of thunder andlightning, whose resemblance to Zeus and Jupiter has often been pointed out. Oaks weresacred to him, and when they were cut down by the Christian missionaries, the peopleloudly complained that their sylvan deities were destroyed. Perpetual fires, kindled withthe wood of certain oak-trees, were kept up in honour of Perkunas; if such a fire went out,it was lighted again by friction of the sacred wood. Men sacrificed to oak-trees for goodcrops, while women did the same to lime-trees; from which we may infer that theyregarded oaks as male and lime-trees as female. And in time of drought, when they wantedrain, they used to sacrifice a black heifer, a black he-goat, and a black cock to the thundergod in the depths of the woods. On such occasions the people assembled in great numbersfrom the country round about, ate and drank, and called upon Perkunas. They carried abowl of beer thrice round the fire, then poured the liquor on the flames, while they prayedto the god to send showers. Thus the chief Lithuanian deity presents a close resemblance toZeus and Jupiter, since he was the god of the oak, the thunder, and the rain.From the foregoing survey it appears that a god of the oak, the thunder, and the rain wasworshipped of old by all the main branches of the Aryan stock in Europe, and was indeedthe chief deity of their pantheon."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"XVI. Dianus and DianaIN THIS CHAPTER I propose to recapitulate the conclusions to which the enquiry hasthus far led us, and drawing together the scattered rays of light, to turn them on the darkfigure of the priest of Nemi.We have found that at an early stage of society men, ignorant of the secret processes ofnature and of the narrow limits within which it is in our power to control and direct them,have commonly arrogated to themselves functions which in the present state of knowledgewe should deem superhuman or divine. The illusion has been fostered and maintained bythe same causes which begot it, namely, the marvellous order and uniformity with whichnature conducts her operations, the wheels of her great machine revolving with asmoothness and precision which enable the patient observer to anticipate in general theseason, if not the very hour, when they will bring round the fulfilment of his hopes or theaccomplishment of his fears. The regularly recurring events of this great cycle, or ratherseries of cycles, soon stamp themselves even on the dull mind of the savage. He foreseesthem, and foreseeing them mistakes the desired recurrence for an effect of his own will,and the dreaded recurrence for an effect of the will of his enemies. Thus the springs whichset the vast machine in motion, though they lie far beyond our ken, shrouded in a mysterywhich we can never hope to penetrate, appear to ignorant man to lie within his reach: hefancies he can touch them and so work by magic art all manner of good to himself and evilto his foes. In time the fallacy of this belief becomes apparent to him: he discovers thatthere are things he cannot do, pleasures which he is unable of himself to procure, painswhich even the most potent magician is powerless to avoid. The unattainable good, theinevitable ill, are now ascribed by him to the action of invisible powers, whose favour is joyand life, whose anger is misery and death. Thus magic tends to be displaced by religion,and the sorcerer by the priest. At this stage of thought the ultimate causes of things areconceived to be personal beings, many in number and often discordant in character, whopartake of the nature and even of the frailty of man, though their might is greater than his,and their life far exceeds the span of his ephemeral existence. Their sharply-markedindividualities, their clear-cut outlines have not yet begun, under the powerful solvent ofphilosophy, to melt and coalesce into that single unknown substratum of phenomenawhich, according to the qualities with which our imagination invests it, goes by one or otherof the high-sounding names which the wit of man has devised to hide his ignorance.Accordingly, so long as men look on their gods as beings akin to themselves and not raisedto an unapproachable height above them, they believe it to be possible for those of theirown number who surpass their fellows to attain to the divine rank after death or even inlife. Incarnate human deities of this latter sort may be said to halt midway between the ageof magic and the age of religion. If they bear the names and display the pomp of deities, thepowers which they are supposed to wield are commonly those of their predecessor themagician. Like him, they are expected to guard their people against hostile enchantments,to heal them in sickness, to bless them with offspring, and to provide them with anabundant supply of food by regulating the weather and performing the other ceremonieswhich are deemed necessary to ensure the fertility of the earth and the multiplication ofanimals. Men who are credited with powers so lofty and far-reaching naturally hold thehighest place in the land, and while the rift between the spiritual and the temporal sphereshas not yet widened too far, they are supreme in civil as well as religious matters: in a"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"word, they are kings as well as gods. Thus the divinity which hedges a king has its rootsdeep down in human history, and long ages pass before these are sapped by a profounderview of nature and man.In the classical period of Greek and Latin antiquity the reign of kings was for the most parta thing of the past; yet the stories of their lineage, titles, and pretensions suffice to provethat they too claimed to rule by divine right and to exercise superhuman powers. Hence wemay without undue temerity assume that the King of the Wood at Nemi, though shorn inlater times of his glory and fallen on evil days, represented a long line of sacred kings whohad once received not only the homage but the adoration of their subjects in return for themanifold blessings which they were supposed to dispense. What little we know of thefunctions of Diana in the Arician grove seems to prove that she was here conceived as agoddess of fertility, and particularly as a divinity of childbirth. It is reasonable, therefore,to suppose that in the discharge of these important duties she was assisted by her priest, thetwo figuring as King and Queen of the Wood in a solemn marriage, which was intended tomake the earth gay with the blossoms of spring and the fruits of autumn, and to gladdenthe hearts of men and women with healthful offspring.If the priest of Nemi posed not merely as a king, but as a god of the grove, we have still toask, What deity in particular did he personate? The answer of antiquity is that herepresented Virbius, the consort or lover of Diana. But this does not help us much, for ofVirbius we know little more than the name. A clue to the mystery is perhaps supplied bythe Vestal fire which burned in the grove. For the perpetual holy fires of the Aryans inEurope appear to have been commonly kindled and fed with oak-wood, and in Rome itself,not many miles from Nemi, the fuel of the Vestal fire consisted of oaken sticks or logs, ashas been proved by a microscopic analysis of the charred embers of the Vestal fire, whichwere discovered by Commendatore G. Boni in the course of the memorable excavationswhich he conducted in the Roman forum at the end of the nineteenth century. But theritual of the various Latin towns seems to have been marked by great uniformity; hence itis reasonable to conclude that wherever in Latium a Vestal fire was maintained, it was fed,as at Rome, with wood of the sacred oak. If this was so at Nemi, it becomes probable thatthe hallowed grove there consisted of a natural oak-wood, and that therefore the tree whichthe King of the Wood had to guard at the peril of his life was itself an oak; indeed, it wasfrom an evergreen oak, according to Virgil, that Aeneas plucked the Golden Bough. Nowthe oak was the sacred tree of Jupiter, the supreme god of the Latins. Hence it follows thatthe King of the Wood, whose life was bound up in a fashion with an oak, personated no lessa deity than Jupiter himself. At least the evidence, slight as it is, seems to point to thisconclusion. The old Alban dynasty of the Silvii or Woods, with their crown of oak leaves,apparently aped the style and emulated the powers of Latian Jupiter, who dwelt on the topof the Alban Mount. It is not impossible that the King of the Wood, who guarded thesacred oak a little lower down the mountain, was the lawful successor and representative ofthis ancient line of the Silvii or Woods. At all events, if I am right in supposing that hepassed for a human Jupiter, it would appear that Virbius, with whom legend identifiedhim, was nothing but a local form of Jupiter, considered perhaps in his original aspect as agod of the greenwood.The hypothesis that in later times at all events the King of the Wood played the part of the"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"oak god Jupiter, is confirmed by an examination of his divine partner Diana. For twodistinct lines of argument converge to show that if Diana was a queen of the woods ingeneral, she was at Nemi a goddess of the oak in particular. In the first place, she bore thetitle of Vesta, and as such presided over a perpetual fire, which we have seen reason tobelieve was fed with oak wood. But a goddess of fire is not far removed from a goddess ofthe fuel which burns in the fire; primitive thought perhaps drew no sharp line ofdistinction between the blaze and the wood that blazes. In the second place, the nymphEgeria at Nemi appears to have been merely a form of Diana, and Egeria is definitely saidto have been a Dryad, a nymph of the oak. Elsewhere in Italy the goddess had her home onoak-clad mountains. Thus Mount Algidus, a spur of the Alban hills, was covered inantiquity with dark forests of oak, both of the evergreen and the deciduous sort. In winterthe snow lay long on these cold hills, and their gloomy oak-woods were believed to be afavourite haunt of Diana, as they have been of brigands in modern times. Again, MountTifata, the long abrupt ridge of the Apennines which looks down on the Campanian plainbehind Capua, was wooded of old with evergreen oaks, among which Diana had a temple.Here Sulla thanked the goddess for his victory over the Marians in the plain below,attesting his gratitude by inscriptions which were long afterwards to be seen in the temple.On the whole, then, we conclude that at Nemi the King of the Wood personated the oak-godJupiter and mated with the oak-goddess Diana in the sacred grove. An echo of their mysticunion has come down to us in the legend of the loves of Numa and Egeria, who according tosome had their trysting-place in these holy woods.To this theory it may naturally be objected that the divine consort of Jupiter was not Dianabut Juno, and that if Diana had a mate at all he might be expected to bear the name not ofJupiter, but of Dianus or Janus, the latter of these forms being merely a corruption of theformer. All this is true, but the objection may be parried by observing that the two pairs ofdeities, Jupiter and Juno on the one side, and Dianus and Diana, or Janus and Jana, on theother side, are merely duplicates of each other, their names and their functions being insubstance and origin identical. With regard to their names, all four of them come from thesame Aryan root DI, meaning “bright,” which occurs in the names of the correspondingGreek deities, Zeus and his old female consort Dione. In regard to their functions, Junoand Diana were both goddesses of fecundity and childbirth, and both were sooner or lateridentified with the moon. As to the true nature and functions of Janus the ancientsthemselves were puzzled; and where they hesitated, it is not for us confidently to decide.But the view mentioned by Varro that Janus was the god of the sky is supported not onlyby the etymological identity of his name with that of the sky-god Jupiter, but also by therelation in which he appears to have stood to Jupiter’s two mates, Juno and Juturna. Forthe epithet Junonian bestowed on Janus points to a marriage union between the twodeities; and according to one account Janus was the husband of the water-nymph Juturna,who according to others was beloved by Jupiter. Moreover, Janus, like Jove, was regularlyinvoked, and commonly spoken of under the title of Father. Indeed, he was identified withJupiter not merely by the logic of the learned St. Augustine, but by the piety of a paganworshipper who dedicated an offering to Jupiter Dianus. A trace of his relation to the oakmay be found in the oakwoods of the Janiculum, the hill on the right bank of the Tiber,where Janus is said to have reigned as a king in the remotest ages of Italian history.Thus, if I am right, the same ancient pair of deities was variously known among the Greek"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"and Italian peoples as Zeus and Dione, Jupiter and Juno, or Dianus (Janus) and Diana(Jana), the names of the divinities being identical in substance, though varying in form withthe dialect of the particular tribe which worshipped them. At first, when the peoples dweltnear each other, the difference between the deities would be hardly more than one of name;in other words, it would be almost purely dialectical. But the gradual dispersion of thetribes, and their consequent isolation from each other, would favour the growth ofdivergent modes of conceiving and worshipping the gods whom they had carried with themfrom their old home, so that in time discrepancies of myth and ritual would tend to springup and thereby to convert a nominal into a real distinction between the divinities.Accordingly when, with the slow progress of culture, the long period of barbarism andseparation was passing away, and the rising political power of a single strong communityhad begun to draw or hammer its weaker neighbours into a nation, the confluent peopleswould throw their gods, like their dialects, into a common stock; and thus it might comeabout that the same ancient deities, which their forefathers had worshipped together beforethe dispersion, would now be so disguised by the accumulated effect of dialectical andreligious divergencies that their original identity might fail to be recognised, and theywould take their places side by side as independent divinities in the national pantheon.This duplication of deities, the result of the final fusion of kindred tribes who had long livedapart, would account for the appearance of Janus beside Jupiter, and of Diana or Janabeside Juno in the Roman religion. At least this appears to be a more probable theory thanthe opinion, which has found favour with some modern scholars, that Janus was originallynothing but the god of doors. That a deity of his dignity and importance, whom theRomans revered as a god of gods and the father of his people, should have started in life asa humble, though doubtless respectable, doorkeeper appears very unlikely. So lofty an endhardly consorts with so lowly a beginning. It is more probable that the door (janua) got itsname from Janus than that he got his name from it. This view is strengthened by aconsideration of the word janua itself. The regular word for door is the same in all thelanguages of the Aryan family from India to Ireland. It is dur in Sanscrit, thura in Greek,tür in German, door in English, dorus in old Irish, and foris in Latin. Yet besides thisordinary name for door, which the Latins shared with all their Aryan brethren, they hadalso the name janua, to which there is no corresponding term in any Indo-Europeanspeech. The word has the appearance of being an adjectival form derived from the nounJanus. I conjecture that it may have been customary to set up an image or symbol of Janusat the principal door of the house in order to place the entrance under the protection of thegreat god. A door thus guarded might be known as a janua foris, that is, a Januan door,and the phrase might in time be abridged into janua, the noun foris being understood butnot expressed. From this to the use of janua to designate a door in general, whetherguarded by an image of Janus or not, would be an easy and natural transition.If there is any truth in this conjecture, it may explain very simply the origin of the doublehead of Janus, which has so long exercised the ingenuity of mythologists. When it hadbecome customary to guard the entrance of houses and towns by an image of Janus, itmight well be deemed necessary to make the sentinel god look both ways, before andbehind, at the same time, in order that nothing should escape his vigilant eye. For if thedivine watchman always faced in one direction, it is easy to imagine what mischief mighthave been wrought with impunity behind his back. This explanation of the double-headed"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Janus at Rome is confirmed by the double-headed idol which the Bush negroes in theinterior of Surinam regularly set up as a guardian at the entrance of a village. The idolconsists of a block of wood with a human face rudely carved on each side; it stands under agateway composed of two uprights and a cross-bar. Beside the idol generally lies a whiterag intended to keep off the devil; and sometimes there is also a stick which seems torepresent a bludgeon or weapon of some sort. Further, from the cross-bar hangs a smalllog which serves the useful purpose of knocking on the head any evil spirit who mightattempt to pass through the gateway. Clearly this double-headed fetish at the gateway ofthe negro villages in Surinam bears a close resemblance to the double-headed images ofJanus which, grasping a stick in one hand and a key in the other, stood sentinel at Romangates and doorways; and we can hardly doubt that in both cases the heads facing two waysare to be similarly explained as expressive of the vigilance of the guardian god, who kepthis eye on spiritual foes behind and before, and stood ready to bludgeon them on the spot.We may, therefore, dispense with the tedious and unsatisfactory explanations which, if wemay trust Ovid, the wily Janus himself fobbed off an anxious Roman enquirer.To apply these conclusions to the priest of Nemi, we may suppose that as the mate of Dianahe represented originally Dianus or Janus rather than Jupiter, but that the differencebetween these deities was of old merely superficial, going little deeper than the names, andleaving practically unaffected the essential functions of the god as a power of the sky, thethunder, and the oak. It was fitting, therefore, that his human representative at Nemishould dwell, as we have seen reason to believe he did, in an oak grove. His title of King ofthe Wood clearly indicates the sylvan character of the deity whom he served; and since hecould only be assailed by him who had plucked the bough of a certain tree in the grove, hisown life might be said to be bound up with that of the sacred tree. Thus he not only servedbut embodied the great Aryan god of the oak; and as an oak-god he would mate with theoak-goddess, whether she went by the name of Egeria or Diana. Their union, howeverconsummated, would be deemed essential to the fertility of the earth and the fecundity ofman and beast. Further, as the oak-god was also a god of the sky, the thunder, and the rain,so his human representative would be required, like many other divine kings, to cause theclouds to gather, the thunder to peal, and the rain to descend in due season, that the fieldsand orchards might bear fruit and the pastures be covered with luxuriant herbage. Thereputed possessor of powers so exalted must have been a very important personage; andthe remains of buildings and of votive offerings which have been found on the site of thesanctuary combine with the testimony of classical writers to prove that in later times it wasone of the greatest and most popular shrines in Italy. Even in the old days, when thechampaign country around was still parcelled out among the petty tribes who composedthe Latin League, the sacred grove is known to have been an object of their commonreverence and care. And just as the kings of Cambodia used to send offerings to the mystickings of Fire and Water far in the dim depths of the tropical forest, so, we may well believe,from all sides of the broad Latian plain the eyes and footsteps of Italian pilgrims turned tothe quarter where, standing sharply out against the faint blue line of the Apennines or thedeeper blue of the distant sea, the Alban Mountain rose before them, the home of themysterious priest of Nemi, the King of the Wood. There, among the green woods and besidethe still waters of the lonely hills, the ancient Aryan worship of the god of the oak, thethunder, and the dripping sky lingered in its early, almost Druidical form, long after agreat political and intellectual revolution had shifted the capital of Latin religion from the"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"forest to the city, from Nemi to Rome.XVII. The Burden of Royalty1. Royal and Priestly TaboosAT A CERTAIN stage of early society the king or priest is often thought to be endowedwith supernatural powers or to be an incarnation of a deity, and consistently with thisbelief the course of nature is supposed to be more or less under his control, and he is heldresponsible for bad weather, failure of the crops, and similar calamities. To some extent itappears to be assumed that the king’s power over nature, like that over his subjects andslaves, is exerted through definite acts of will; and therefore if drought, famine, pestilence,or storms arise, the people attribute the misfortune to the negligence or guilt of their king,and punish him accordingly with stripes and bonds, or, if he remains obdurate, withdeposition and death. Sometimes, however, the course of nature, while regarded asdependent on the king, is supposed to be partly independent of his will. His person isconsidered, if we may express it so, as the dynamical centre of the universe, from whichlines of force radiate to all quarters of the heaven; so that any motion of his—the turning ofhis head, the lifting of his hand—instantaneously affects and may seriously disturb somepart of nature. He is the point of support on which hangs the balance of the world, and theslightest irregularity on his part may overthrow the delicate equipoise. The greatest caremust, therefore, be taken both by and of him; and his whole life, down to its minutestdetails, must be so regulated that no act of his, voluntary or involuntary, may disarrange orupset the established order of nature. Of this class of monarchs the Mikado or Dairi, thespiritual emperor of Japan, is or rather used to be a typical example. He is an incarnationof the sun goddess, the deity who rules the universe, gods and men included; once a year allthe gods wait upon him and spend a month at his court. During that month, the name ofwhich means “without gods,” no one frequents the temples, for they are believed to bedeserted. The Mikado receives from his people and assumes in his official proclamationsand decrees the title of “manifest or incarnate deity,” and he claims a general authorityover the gods of Japan. For example, in an official decree of the year 646 the emperor isdescribed as “the incarnate god who governs the universe.”The following description of the Mikado’s mode of life was written about two hundredyears ago:“Even to this day the princes descended of this family, more particularly those who sit onthe throne, are looked upon as persons most holy in themselves, and as Popes by birth.And, in order to preserve these advantageous notions in the minds of their subjects, theyare obliged to take an uncommon care of their sacred persons, and to do such things,which, examined according to the customs of other nations, would be thought ridiculousand impertinent. It will not be improper to give a few instances of it. He thinks that itwould be very prejudicial to his dignity and holiness to touch the ground with his feet; forthis reason, when he intends to go anywhere, he must be carried thither on men’s"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"shoulders. Much less will they suffer that he should expose his sacred person to the openair, and the sun is not thought worthy to shine on his head. There is such a holinessascribed to all the parts of his body that he dares to cut off neither his hair, nor his beard,nor his nails. However, lest he should grow too dirty, they may clean him in the night whenhe is asleep; because, they say, that which is taken from his body at that time, hath beenstolen from him, and that such a theft doth not prejudice his holiness or dignity. In ancienttimes, he was obliged to sit on the throne for some hours every morning, with the imperialcrown on his head, but to sit altogether like a statue, without stirring either hands or feet,head or eyes, nor indeed any part of his body, because, by this means, it was thought thathe could preserve peace and tranquillity in his empire; for if, unfortunately, he turnedhimself on one side or the other, or if he looked a good while towards any part of hisdominions, it was apprehended that war, famine, fire, or some other great misfortune wasnear at hand to desolate the country. But it having been afterwards discovered, that theimperial crown was the palladium, which by its immobility could preserve peace in theempire, it was thought expedient to deliver his imperial person, consecrated only to idlenessand pleasures, from this burthensome duty, and therefore the crown is at present placed onthe throne for some hours every morning. His victuals must be dressed every time in newpots, and served at table in new dishes: both are very clean and neat, but made only ofcommon clay; that without any considerable expense they may be laid aside, or broke, afterthey have served once. They are generally broke, for fear they should come into the handsof laymen, for they believe religiously, that if any layman should presume to eat his foodout of these sacred dishes, it would swell and inflame his mouth and throat. The like illeffect is dreaded from the Dairi’s sacred habits; for they believe that if a layman shouldwear them, without the Emperor’s express leave or command, they would occasionswellings and pains in all parts of his body.” To the same effect an earlier account of theMikado says: “It was considered as a shameful degradation for him even to touch theground with his foot. The sun and moon were not even permitted to shine upon his head.None of the superfluities of the body were ever taken from him, neither his hair, his beard,nor his nails were cut. Whatever he eat was dressed in new vessels.”Similar priestly or rather divine kings are found, at a lower level of barbarism, on the westcoast of Africa. At Shark Point near Cape Padron, in Lower Guinea, lives the priestly kingKukulu, alone in a wood. He may not touch a woman nor leave his house; indeed he maynot even quit his chair, in which he is obliged to sleep sitting, for if he lay down no windwould arise and navigation would be stopped. He regulates storms, and in generalmaintains a wholesome and equable state of the atmosphere. On Mount Agu in Togo therelives a fetish or spirit called Bagba, who is of great importance for the whole of thesurrounding country. The power of giving or withholding rain is ascribed to him, and he islord of the winds, including the Harmattan, the dry, hot wind which blows from theinterior. His priest dwells in a house on the highest peak of the mountain, where he keepsthe winds bottled up in huge jars. Applications for rain, too, are made to him, and he doesa good business in amulets, which consist of the teeth and claws of leopards. Yet though hispower is great and he is indeed the real chief of the land, the rule of the fetish forbids himever to leave the mountain, and he must spend the whole of his life on its summit. Onlyonce a year may he come down to make purchases in the market; but even then he may notset foot in the hut of any mortal man, and must return to his place of exile the same day.The business of government in the villages is conducted by subordinate chiefs, who are"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"appointed by him. In the West African kingdom of Congo there was a supreme pontiffcalled Chitomé or Chitombé, whom the negroes regarded as a god on earth and all-powerful in heaven. Hence before they would taste the new crops they offered him the first-fruits, fearing that manifold misfortunes would befall them if they broke this rule. When heleft his residence to visit other places within his jurisdiction, all married people had toobserve strict continence the whole time he was out; for it was supposed that any act ofincontinence would prove fatal to him. And if he were to die a natural death, they thoughtthat the world would perish, and the earth, which he alone sustained by his power andmerit, would immediately be annihilated. Amongst the semi-barbarous nations of the NewWorld, at the date of the Spanish conquest, there were found hierarchies or theocracies likethose of Japan; in particular, the high pontiff of the Zapotecs appears to have presented aclose parallel to the Mikado. A powerful rival to the king himself, this spiritual lordgoverned Yopaa, one of the chief cities of the kingdom, with absolute dominion. It isimpossible, we are told, to overrate the reverence in which he was held. He was looked onas a god whom the earth was not worthy to hold nor the sun to shine upon. He profaned hissanctity if he even touched the ground with his foot. The officers who bore his palanquin ontheir shoulders were members of the highest families: he hardly deigned to look onanything around him; and all who met him fell with their faces to the earth, fearing thatdeath would overtake them if they saw even his shadow. A rule of continence was regularlyimposed on the Zapotec priests, especially upon the high pontiff; but “on certain days ineach year, which were generally celebrated with feasts and dances, it was customary for thehigh priest to become drunk. While in this state, seeming to belong neither to heaven nor toearth, one of the most beautiful of the virgins consecrated to the service of the gods wasbrought to him.” If the child she bore him was a son, he was brought up as a prince of theblood, and the eldest son succeeded his father on the pontifical throne. The supernaturalpowers attributed to this pontiff are not specified, but probably they resembled those of theMikado and Chitomé.Wherever, as in Japan and West Africa, it is supposed that the order of nature, and eventhe existence of the world, is bound up with the life of the king or priest, it is clear that hemust be regarded by his subjects as a source both of infinite blessing and of infinite danger.On the one hand, the people have to thank him for the rain and sunshine which foster thefruits of the earth, for the wind which brings ships to their coasts, and even for the solidground beneath their feet. But what he gives he can refuse; and so close is the dependenceof nature on his person, so delicate the balance of the system of forces whereof he is thecentre, that the least irregularity on his part may set up a tremor which shall shake theearth to its foundations. And if nature may be disturbed by the slightest involuntary act ofthe king, it is easy to conceive the convulsion which his death might provoke. The naturaldeath of the Chitomé, as we have seen, was thought to entail the destruction of all things.Clearly, therefore, out of a regard for their own safety, which might be imperilled by anyrash act of the king, and still more by his death, the people will exact of their king or priesta strict conformity to those rules, the observance of which is deemed necessary for his ownpreservation, and consequently for the preservation of his people and the world. The ideathat early kingdoms are despotisms in which the people exist only for the sovereign, iswholly inapplicable to the monarchies we are considering. On the contrary, the sovereignin them exists only for his subjects; his life is only valuable so long as he discharges theduties of his position by ordering the course of nature for his people’s benefit. So soon as he"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"fails to do so, the care, the devotion, the religious homage which they had hitherto lavishedon him cease and are changed into hatred and contempt; he is dismissed ignominiously,and may be thankful if he escapes with his life. Worshipped as a god one day, he is killed asa criminal the next. But in this changed behaviour of the people there is nothing capriciousor inconsistent. On the contrary, their conduct is entirely of a piece. If their king is theirgod, he is or should be also their preserver; and if he will not preserve them, he must makeroom for another who will. So long, however, as he answers their expectations, there is nolimit to the care which they take of him, and which they compel him to take of himself. Aking of this sort lives hedged in by a ceremonious etiquette, a network of prohibitions andobservances, of which the intention is not to contribute to his dignity, much less to hiscomfort, but to restrain him from conduct which, by disturbing the harmony of nature,might involve himself, his people, and the universe in one common catastrophe. Far fromadding to his comfort, these observances, by trammelling his every act, annihilate hisfreedom and often render the very life, which it is their object to preserve, a burden andsorrow to him.Of the supernaturally endowed kings of Loango it is said that the more powerful a king is,the more taboos is he bound to observe; they regulate all his actions, his walking and hisstanding, his eating and drinking, his sleeping and waking. To these restraints the heir tothe throne is subject from infancy; but as he advances in life the number of abstinences andceremonies which he must observe increases, “until at the moment that he ascends thethrone he is lost in the ocean of rites and taboos.” In the crater of an extinct volcano,enclosed on all sides by grassy slopes, lie the scattered huts and yam-fields of Riabba, thecapital of the native king of Fernando Po. This mysterious being lives in the lowest depthsof the crater, surrounded by a harem of forty women, and covered, it is said, with old silvercoins. Naked savage as he is, he yet exercises far more influence in the island than theSpanish governor at Santa Isabel. In him the conservative spirit of the Boobies oraboriginal inhabitants of the island is, as it were, incorporate. He has never seen a whiteman and, according to the firm conviction of all the Boobies, the sight of a pale face wouldcause his instant death. He cannot bear to look upon the sea; indeed it is said that he maynever see it even in the distance, and that therefore he wears away his life with shackles onhis legs in the dim twilight of his hut. Certain it is that he has never set foot on the beach.With the exception of his musket and knife, he uses nothing that comes from the whites;European cloth never touches his person, and he scorns tobacco, rum, and even salt.Among the Ewe-speaking peoples of the Slave Coast “the king is at the same time highpriest. In this quality he was, particularly in former times, unapproachable by his subjects.Only by night was he allowed to quit his dwelling in order to bathe and so forth. None buthis representative, the so-called ‘visible king,’ with three chosen elders might converse withhim, and even they had to sit on an ox-hide with their backs turned to him. He might notsee any European nor any horse, nor might he look upon the sea, for which reason he wasnot allowed to quit his capital even for a few moments. These rules have been disregardedin recent times.” The king of Dahomey himself is subject to the prohibition of beholding thesea, and so are the kings of Loango and Great Ardra in Guinea. The sea is the fetish of theEyeos, to the north-west of Dahomey, and they and their king are threatened with death bytheir priests if ever they dare to look on it. It is believed that the king of Cayor in Senegalwould infallibly die within the year if he were to cross a river or an arm of the sea. In"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Mashonaland down to recent times the chiefs would not cross certain rivers, particularlythe Rurikwi and the Nyadiri; and the custom was still strictly observed by at least one chiefwithin recent years. “On no account will the chief cross the river. If it is absolutelynecessary for him to do so, he is blindfolded and carried across with shouting and singing.Should he walk across, he will go blind or die and certainly lose the chieftainship.” Soamong the Mahafalys and Sakalavas in the south of Madagascar some kings are forbiddento sail on the sea or to cross certain rivers. Among the Sakalavas the chief is regarded as asacred being, but “he is held in leash by a crowd of restrictions, which regulate hisbehaviour like that of the emperor of China. He can undertake nothing whatever unless thesorcerers have declared the omens favourable; he may not eat warm food: on certain dayshe may not quit his hut; and so on.” Among some of the hill tribes of Assam both theheadman and his wife have to observe many taboos in respect of food; thus they may noteat buffalo, pork, dog, fowl, or tomatoes. The headman must be chaste, the husband of onewife, and he must separate himself from her on the eve of a general or public observance oftaboo. In one group of tribes the headman is forbidden to eat in a strange village, andunder no provocation whatever may he utter a word of abuse. Apparently the peopleimagine that the violation of any of these taboos by a headman would bring downmisfortune on the whole village.The ancient kings of Ireland, as well as the kings of the four provinces of Leinster,Munster, Connaught, and Ulster, were subject to certain quaint prohibitions or taboos, onthe due observance of which the prosperity of the people of the country, as well as theirown, was supposed to depend. Thus, for example, the sun might not rise on the king ofIreland in his bed at Tara, the old capital of Erin; he was forbidden to alight onWednesday at Magh Breagh, to traverse Magh Cuillinn after sunset, to incite his horse atFan-Chomair, to go in a ship upon the water the Monday after Bealltaine (May day), andto leave the track of his army upon Ath Maighne the Tuesday after All-Hallows. The kingof Leinster might not go round Tuath Laighean left-hand-wise on Wednesday, nor sleepbetween the Dothair (Dodder) and the Duibhlinn with his head inclining to one side, norencamp for nine days on the plains of Cualann, nor travel the road of Duibhlinn onMonday, nor ride a dirty black-heeled horse across Magh Maistean. The king of Munsterwas prohibited from enjoying the feast of Loch Lein from one Monday to another; frombanqueting by night in the beginning of harvest before Geim at Leitreacha; fromencamping for nine days upon the Siuir; and from holding a border meeting at Gabhran.The king of Connaught might not conclude a treaty respecting his ancient palace ofCruachan after making peace on All-Hallows Day, nor go in a speckled garment on a greyspeckled steed to the heath of Dal Chais, nor repair to an assembly of women at Seaghais,nor sit in autumn on the sepulchral mounds of the wife of Maine, nor contend in runningwith the rider of a grey one-eyed horse at Ath Gallta between two posts. The king of Ulsterwas forbidden to attend the horse fair at Rath Line among the youths of Dal Araidhe, tolisten to the fluttering of the flocks of birds of Linn Saileach after sunset, to celebrate thefeast of the bull of Daire-mic-Daire, to go into Magh Cobha in the month of March, and todrink of the water of Bo Neimhidh between two darknesses. If the kings of Ireland strictlyobserved these and many other customs, which were enjoined by immemorial usage, it wasbelieved that they would never meet with mischance or misfortune, and would live forninety years without experiencing the decay of old age; that no epidemic or mortalitywould occur during their reigns; and that the seasons would be favourable and the earth"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"yield its fruit in abundance; whereas, if they set the ancient usages at naught, the countrywould be visited with plague, famine, and bad weather.The kings of Egypt were worshipped as gods, and the routine of their daily life wasregulated in every detail by precise and unvarying rules. “The life of the kings of Egypt,”says Diodorus, “was not like that of other monarchs who are irresponsible and may do justwhat they choose; on the contrary, everything was fixed for them by law, not only theirofficial duties, but even the details of their daily life... The hours both of day and nightwere arranged at which the king had to do, not what he pleased, but what was prescribedfor him... For not only were the times appointed at which he should transact publicbusiness or sit in judgment; but the very hours for his walking and bathing and sleepingwith his wife, and, in short, performing every act of life were all settled. Custom enjoined asimple diet; the only flesh he might eat was veal and goose, and he might only drink aprescribed quantity of wine.” However, there is reason to think that these rules wereobserved, not by the ancient Pharaohs, but by the priestly kings who reigned at Thebes andEthiopia at the close of the twentieth dynasty.Of the taboos imposed on priests we may see a striking example in the rules of lifeprescribed for the Flamen Dialis at Rome, who has been interpreted as a living image ofJupiter, or a human embodiment of the sky-spirit. They were such as the following: TheFlamen Dialis might not ride or even touch a horse, nor see an army under arms, nor weara ring which was not broken, nor have a knot on any part of his garments; no fire except asacred fire might be taken out of his house; he might not touch wheaten flour or leavenedbread; he might not touch or even name a goat, a dog, raw meat, beans, and ivy; he mightnot walk under a vine; the feet of his bed had to be daubed with mud; his hair could be cutonly by a free man and with a bronze knife and his hair and nails when cut had to beburied under a lucky tree; he might not touch a dead body nor enter a place where one wasburned; he might not see work being done on holy days; he might not be uncovered in theopen air; if a man in bonds were taken into his house, the captive had to be unbound andthe cords had to be drawn up through a hole in the roof and so let down into the street. Hiswife, the Flaminica, had to observe nearly the same rules, and others of her own besides.She might not ascend more than three steps of the kind of staircase called Greek; at acertain festival she might not comb her hair; the leather of her shoes might not be madefrom a beast that had died a natural death, but only from one that had been slain orsacrificed; if she heard thunder she was tabooed till she had offered an expiatory sacrifice.Among the Grebo people of Sierra Leone there is a pontiff who bears the title of Bodia andhas been compared, on somewhat slender grounds, to the high priest of the Jews. He isappointed in accordance with the behest of an oracle. At an elaborate ceremony ofinstallation he is anointed, a ring is put on his ankle as a badge of office, and the door-postsof his house are sprinkled with the blood of a sacrificed goat. He has charge of the publictalismans and idols, which he feeds with rice and oil every new moon; and he sacrifices onbehalf of the town to the dead and to demons. Nominally his power is very great, but inpractice it is very limited; for he dare not defy public opinion, and he is held responsible,even with his life, for any adversity that befalls the country. It is expected of him that heshould cause the earth to bring forth abundantly, the people to be healthy, war to be drivenfar away, and witchcraft to be kept in abeyance. His life is trammelled by the observance of"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"certain restrictions or taboos. Thus he may not sleep in any house but his own officialresidence, which is called the “anointed house” with reference to the ceremony of anointinghim at inauguration. He may not drink water on the highway. He may not eat while acorpse is in the town, and he may not mourn for the dead. If he dies while in office, he mustbe buried at dead of night; few may hear of his burial, and none may mourn for him whenhis death is made public. Should he have fallen a victim to the poison ordeal by drinking adecoction of sassywood, as it is called, he must be buried under a running stream of water.Among the Todas of Southern India the holy milkman, who acts as priest of the sacreddairy, is subject to a variety of irksome and burdensome restrictions during the whole timeof his incumbency, which may last many years. Thus he must live at the sacred dairy andmay never visit his home or any ordinary village. He must be celibate; if he is married hemust leave his wife. On no account may any ordinary person touch the holy milkman or theholy dairy; such a touch would so defile his holiness that he would forfeit his office. It isonly on two days a week, namely Mondays and Thursdays, that a mere layman may evenapproach the milkman; on other days if he has any business with him, he must stand at adistance (some say a quarter of a mile) and shout his message across the intervening space.Further, the holy milkman never cuts his hair or pares his nails so long as he holds office;he never crosses a river by a bridge, but wades through a ford and only certain fords; if adeath occurs in his clan, he may not attend any of the funeral ceremonies, unless he firstresigns his office and descends from the exalted rank of milkman to that of a mere commonmortal. Indeed it appears that in old days he had to resign the seals, or rather the pails, ofoffice whenever any member of his clan departed this life. However, these heavy restraintsare laid in their entirety only on milkmen of the very highest class.2. Divorce of the Spiritual from the Temporal PowerTHE BURDENSOME observances attached to the royal or priestly office produced theirnatural effect. Either men refused to accept the office, which hence tended to fall intoabeyance; or accepting it, they sank under its weight into spiritless creatures, cloisteredrecluses, from whose nerveless fingers the reins of government slipped into the firmergrasp of men who were often content to wield the reality of sovereignty without its name. Insome countries this rift in the supreme power deepened into a total and permanentseparation of the spiritual and temporal powers, the old royal house retaining their purelyreligious functions, while the civil government passed into the hands of a younger and morevigorous race.To take examples. In a previous part of this work we saw that in Cambodia it is oftennecessary to force the kingships of Fire and Water upon the reluctant successors, and thatin Savage Island the monarchy actually came to an end because at last no one could beinduced to accept the dangerous distinction. In some parts of West Africa, when the kingdies, a family council is secretly held to determine his successor. He on whom the choicefalls is suddenly seized, bound, and thrown into the fetish-house, where he is kept indurance till he consents to accept the crown. Sometimes the heir finds means of evading thehonour which it is sought to thrust upon him; a ferocious chief has been known to go aboutconstantly armed, resolute to resist by force any attempt to set him on the throne. The"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"savage Timmes of Sierra Leone, who elect their king, reserve to themselves the right ofbeating him on the eve of his coronation; and they avail themselves of this constitutionalprivilege with such hearty goodwill that sometimes the unhappy monarch does not longsurvive his elevation to the throne. Hence when the leading chiefs have a spite at a man andwish to rid themselves of him, they elect him king. Formerly, before a man was proclaimedking of Sierra Leone, it used to be the custom to load him with chains and thrash him.Then the fetters were knocked off, the kingly robe was placed on him, and he received inhis hands the symbol of royal dignity, which was nothing but the axe of the executioner. Itis not therefore surprising to read that in Sierra Leone, where such customs have prevailed,“except among the Mandingoes and Suzees, few kings are natives of the countries theygovern. So different are their ideas from ours, that very few are solicitous of the honour,and competition is very seldom heard of.”The Mikados of Japan seem early to have resorted to the expedient of transferring thehonours and burdens of supreme power to their infant children; and the rise of theTycoons, long the temporal sovereigns of the country, is traced to the abdication of acertain Mikado in favour of his three-year-old son. The sovereignty having been wrested bya usurper from the infant prince, the cause of the Mikado was championed by Yoritomo, aman of spirit and conduct, who overthrew the usurper and restored to the Mikado theshadow, while he retained for himself the substance, of power. He bequeathed to hisdescendants the dignity he had won, and thus became the founder of the line of Tycoons.Down to the latter half of the sixteenth century the Tycoons were active and efficientrulers; but the same fate overtook them which had befallen the Mikados. Immeshed in thesame inextricable web of custom and law, they degenerated into mere puppets, hardlystirring from their palaces and occupied in a perpetual round of empty ceremonies, whilethe real business of government was managed by the council of state. In Tonquin themonarchy ran a similar course. Living like his predecessors in effeminacy and sloth, theking was driven from the throne by an ambitious adventurer named Mack, who from afisherman had risen to be Grand Mandarin. But the king’s brother Tring put down theusurper and restored the king, retaining, however, for himself and his descendants thedignity of general of all the forces. Thenceforward the kings, though invested with the titleand pomp of sovereignty, ceased to govern. While they lived secluded in their palaces, allreal political power was wielded by the hereditary generals.In Mangaia, a Polynesian island, religious and civil authority were lodged in separatehands, spiritual functions being discharged by a line of hereditary kings, while thetemporal government was entrusted from time to time to a victorious war-chief, whoseinvestiture, however, had to be completed by the king. Similarly in Tonga, besides the civilking whose right to the throne was partly hereditary and partly derived from his warlikereputation and the number of his fighting men, there was a great divine chief who rankedabove the king and the other chiefs in virtue of his supposed descent from one of the chiefgods. Once a year the first-fruits of the ground were offered to him at a solemn ceremony,and it was believed that if these offerings were not made the vengeance of the gods wouldfall in a signal manner on the people. Peculiar forms of speech, such as were applied to noone else, were used in speaking of him, and everything that he chanced to touch becamesacred or tabooed. When he and the king met, the monarch had to sit down on the groundin token of respect until his holiness had passed by. Yet though he enjoyed the highest"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"veneration by reason of his divine origin, this sacred personage possessed no politicalauthority, and if he ventured to meddle with affairs of state it was at the risk of receiving arebuff from the king, to whom the real power belonged, and who finally succeeded inridding himself of his spiritual rival.In some parts of Western Africa two kings reign side by side, a fetish or religious king anda civil king, but the fetish king is really supreme. He controls the weather and so forth, andcan put a stop to everything. When he lays his red staff on the ground, no one may passthat way. This division of power between a sacred and a secular ruler is to be met withwherever the true negro culture has been left unmolested, but where the negro form ofsociety has been disturbed, as in Dahomey and Ashantee, there is a tendency to consolidatethe two powers in a single king.In some parts of the East Indian island of Timor we meet with a partition of power like thatwhich is represented by the civil king and the fetish king of Western Africa. Some of theTimorese tribes recognise two rajahs, the ordinary or civil rajah, who governs the people,and the fetish or taboo rajah, who is charged with the control of everything that concernsthe earth and its products. This latter ruler has the right of declaring anything taboo; hispermission must be obtained before new land may be brought under cultivation, and hemust perform certain necessary ceremonies when the work is being carried out. If droughtor blight threatens the crops, his help is invoked to save them. Though he ranks below thecivil rajah, he exercises a momentous influence on the course of events, for his secularcolleague is bound to consult him in all important matters. In some of the neighbouringislands, such as Rotti and eastern Flores, a spiritual ruler of the same sort is recognisedunder various native names, which all mean “lord of the ground.” Similarly in the Mekeodistrict of British New Guinea there is a double chieftainship. The people are divided intotwo groups according to families, and each of the groups has its chief. One of the two is thewar chief, the other is the taboo chief. The office of the latter is hereditary; his duty is toimpose a taboo on any of the crops, such as the coco-nuts and areca nuts, whenever hethinks it desirable to prohibit their use. In his office we may perhaps detect the beginningof a priestly dynasty, but as yet his functions appear to be more magical than religious,being concerned with the control of the harvests rather than with the propitiation of higherpowers.XVIII. The Perils of the Soul1. The Soul as a MannikinTHE FOREGOING examples have taught us that the office of a sacred king or priest isoften hedged in by a series of burdensome restrictions or taboos, of which a principalpurpose appears to be to preserve the life of the divine man for the good of his people. Butif the object of the taboos is to save his life, the question arises, How is their observancesupposed to effect this end? To understand this we must know the nature of the dangerwhich threatens the king’s life, and which it is the intention of these curious restrictions to"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"guard against. We must, therefore, ask: What does early man understand by death? Towhat causes does he attribute it? And how does he think it may be guarded against?As the savage commonly explains the processes of inanimate nature by supposing that theyare produced by living beings working in or behind the phenomena, so he explains thephenomena of life itself. If an animal lives and moves, it can only be, he thinks, becausethere is a little animal inside which moves it: if a man lives and moves, it can only bebecause he has a little man or animal inside who moves him. The animal inside the animal,the man inside the man, is the soul. And as the activity of an animal or man is explained bythe presence of the soul, so the repose of sleep or death is explained by its absence; sleep ortrance being the temporary, death being the permanent absence of the soul. Hence if deathbe the permanent absence of the soul, the way to guard against it is either to prevent thesoul from leaving the body, or, if it does depart, to ensure that it shall return. Theprecautions adopted by savages to secure one or other of these ends take the form ofcertain prohibitions or taboos, which are nothing but rules intended to ensure either thecontinued presence or the return of the soul. In short, they are life-preservers or life-guards. These general statements will now be illustrated by examples.Addressing some Australian blacks, a European missionary said, “I am not one, as youthink, but two.” Upon this they laughed. “You may laugh as much as you like,” continuedthe missionary, “I tell you that I am two in one; this great body that you see is one; withinthat there is another little one which is not visible. The great body dies, and is buried, butthe little body flies away when the great one dies.” To this some of the blacks replied, “Yes,yes. We also are two, we also have a little body within the breast.” On being asked wherethe little body went after death, some said it went behind the bush, others said it went intothe sea, and some said they did not know. The Hurons thought that the soul had a head andbody, arms and legs; in short, that it was a complete little model of the man himself. TheEsquimaux believe that “the soul exhibits the same shape as the body it belongs to, but is ofa more subtle and ethereal nature.” According to the Nootkas the soul has the shape of atiny man; its seat is the crown of the head. So long as it stands erect, its owner is hale andhearty; but when from any cause it loses its upright position, he loses his senses. Among theIndian tribes of the Lower Fraser River, man is held to have four souls, of which theprincipal one has the form of a mannikin, while the other three are shadows of it. TheMalays conceive the human soul as a little man, mostly invisible and of the bigness of athumb, who corresponds exactly in shape, proportion, and even in complexion to the manin whose body he resides. This mannikin is of a thin, unsubstantial nature, though not soimpalpable but that it may cause displacement on entering a physical object, and it can flitquickly from place to place; it is temporarily absent from the body in sleep, trance, anddisease, and permanently absent after death.So exact is the resemblance of the mannikin to the man, in other words, of the soul to thebody, that, as there are fat bodies and thin bodies, so there are fat souls and thin souls; asthere are heavy bodies and light bodies, long bodies and short bodies, so there are heavysouls and light souls, long souls and short souls. The people of Nias think that every man,before he is born, is asked how long or how heavy a soul he would like, and a soul of thedesired weight or length is measured out to him. The heaviest soul ever given out weighsabout ten grammes. The length of a man’s life is proportioned to the length of his soul;"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"children who die young had short souls. The Fijian conception of the soul as a tiny humanbeing comes clearly out in the customs observed at the death of a chief among the Nakelotribe. When a chief dies, certain men, who are the hereditary undertakers, call him, as helies, oiled and ornamented, on fine mats, saying, “Rise, sir, the chief, and let us be going.The day has come over the land.” Then they conduct him to the river side, where theghostly ferryman comes to ferry Nakelo ghosts across the stream. As they thus attend thechief on his last journey, they hold their great fans close to the ground to shelter him,because, as one of them explained to a missionary, “His soul is only a little child.” People inthe Punjaub who tattoo themselves believe that at death the soul, “the little entire man orwoman” inside the mortal frame, will go to heaven blazoned with the same tattoo patternswhich adorned the body in life. Sometimes, however, as we shall see, the human soul isconceived not in human but in animal form.2. Absence and Recall of the SoulTHE SOUL is commonly supposed to escape by the natural openings of the body, especiallythe mouth and nostrils. Hence in Celebes they sometimes fasten fish-hooks to a sick man’snose, navel, and feet, so that if his soul should try to escape it may be hooked and held fast.A Turik on the Baram River, in Borneo, refused to part with some hook-like stones,because they, as it were, hooked his soul to his body, and so prevented the spiritual portionof him from becoming detached from the material. When a Sea Dyak sorcerer or medicine-man is initiated, his fingers are supposed to be furnished with fish-hooks, with which hewill thereafter clutch the human soul in the act of flying away, and restore it to the body ofthe sufferer. But hooks, it is plain, may be used to catch the souls of enemies as well as offriends. Acting on this principle head-hunters in Borneo hang wooden hooks beside theskulls of their slain enemies in the belief that this helps them on their forays to hook infresh heads. One of the implements of a Haida medicine-man is a hollow bone, in which hebottles up departing souls, and so restores them to their owners. When any one yawns intheir presence the Hindoos always snap their thumbs, believing that this will hinder thesoul from issuing through the open mouth. The Marquesans used to hold the mouth andnose of a dying man, in order to keep him in life by preventing his soul from escaping; thesame custom is reported of the New Caledonians; and with the like intention the Bagobosof the Philippine Islands put rings of brass wire on the wrists or ankles of their sick. On theother hand, the Itonamas of South America seal up the eyes, nose, and mouth of a dyingperson, in case his ghost should get out and carry off others; and for a similar reason thepeople of Nias, who fear the spirits of the recently deceased and identify them with thebreath, seek to confine the vagrant soul in its earthly tabernacle by bunging up the nose ortying up the jaws of the corpse. Before leaving a corpse the Wakelbura of Australia used toplace hot coals in its ears in order to keep the ghost in the body, until they had got such agood start that he could not overtake them. In Southern Celebes, to hinder the escape of awoman’s soul in childbed, the nurse ties a band as tightly as possible round the body of theexpectant mother. The Minangkabauers of Sumatra observe a similar custom; a skein ofthread or a string is sometimes fastened round the wrist or loins of a woman in childbed, sothat when her soul seeks to depart in her hour of travail it may find the egress barred. Andlest the soul of a babe should escape and be lost as soon as it is born, the Alfoors of Celebes,"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"when a birth is about to take place, are careful to close every opening in the house, even thekeyhole; and they stop up every chink and cranny in the walls. Also they tie up the mouthsof all animals inside and outside the house, for fear one of them might swallow the child’ssoul. For a similar reason all persons present in the house, even the mother herself, areobliged to keep their mouths shut the whole time the birth is taking place. When thequestion was put, Why they did not hold their noses also, lest the child’s soul should getinto one of them? the answer was that breath being exhaled as well as inhaled through thenostrils, the soul would be expelled before it could have time to settle down. Popularexpressions in the language of civilised peoples, such as to have one’s heart in one’s mouth,or the soul on the lips or in the nose, show how natural is the idea that the life or soul mayescape by the mouth or nostrils.Often the soul is conceived as a bird ready to take flight. This conception has probably lefttraces in most languages, and it lingers as a metaphor in poetry. The Malays carry out theconception of the bird-soul in a number of odd ways. If the soul is a bird on the wing, itmay be attracted by rice, and so either prevented from flying away or lured back againfrom its perilous flight. Thus in Java when a child is placed on the ground for the first time(a moment which uncultured people seem to regard as especially dangerous), it is put in ahen-coop and the mother makes a clucking sound, as if she were calling hens. And inSintang, a district of Borneo, when a person, whether man, woman, or child, has fallen outof a house or off a tree, and has been brought home, his wife or other kinswoman goes asspeedily as possible to the spot where the accident happened, and there strews rice, whichhas been coloured yellow, while she utters the words, “Cluck! cluck! soul! So-and-so is inhis house again. Cluck! cluck! soul!” Then she gathers up the rice in a basket, carries it tothe sufferer, and drops the grains from her hand on his head, saying again, “Cluck! cluck!soul!” Here the intention clearly is to decoy back the loitering bird-soul and replace it inthe head of its owner.The soul of a sleeper is supposed to wander away from his body and actually to visit theplaces, to see the persons, and to perform the acts of which he dreams. For example, whenan Indian of Brazil or Guiana wakes up from a sound sleep, he is firmly convinced that hissoul has really been away hunting, fishing, felling trees, or whatever else he has dreamed ofdoing, while all the time his body has been lying motionless in his hammock. A wholeBororo village has been thrown into a panic and nearly deserted because somebody haddreamed that he saw enemies stealthily approaching it. A Macusi Indian in weak health,who dreamed that his employer had made him haul the canoe up a series of difficultcataracts, bitterly reproached his master next morning for his want of consideration in thusmaking a poor invalid go out and toil during the night. The Indians of the Gran Chaco areoften heard to relate the most incredible stories as things which they have themselves seenand heard; hence strangers who do not know them intimately say in their haste that theseIndians are liars. In point of fact the Indians are firmly convinced of the truth of what theyrelate; for these wonderful adventures are simply their dreams, which they do notdistinguish from waking realities.Now the absence of the soul in sleep has its dangers, for if from any cause the soul shouldbe permanently detained away from the body, the person thus deprived of the vitalprinciple must die. There is a German belief that the soul escapes from a sleeper’s mouth in"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"the form of a white mouse or a little bird, and that to prevent the return of the bird oranimal would be fatal to the sleeper. Hence in Transylvania they say that you should not leta child sleep with its mouth open, or its soul will slip out in the shape of a mouse, and thechild will never wake. Many causes may detain the sleeper’s soul. Thus, his soul may meetthe soul of another sleeper and the two souls may fight; if a Guinea negro wakens with sorebones in the morning, he thinks that his soul has been thrashed by another soul in sleep. Orit may meet the soul of a person just deceased and be carried off by it; hence in the AruIslands the inmates of a house will not sleep the night after a death has taken place in it,because the soul of the deceased is supposed to be still in the house and they fear to meet itin a dream. Again, the soul of the sleeper may be prevented by an accident or by physicalforce from returning to his body. When a Dyak dreams of falling into the water, hesupposes that this accident has really befallen his spirit, and he sends for a wizard, whofishes for the spirit with a hand-net in a basin of water till he catches it and restores it to itsowner. The Santals tell how a man fell asleep, and growing very thirsty, his soul, in theform of a lizard, left his body and entered a pitcher of water to drink. Just then the ownerof the pitcher happened to cover it; so the soul could not return to the body and the mandied. While his friends were preparing to burn the body some one uncovered the pitcher toget water. The lizard thus escaped and returned to the body, which immediately revived; sothe man rose up and asked his friends why they were weeping. They told him they thoughthe was dead and were about to burn his body. He said he had been down a well to getwater, but had found it hard to get out and had just returned. So they saw it all.It is a common rule with primitive people not to waken a sleeper, because his soul is awayand might not have time to get back; so if the man wakened without his soul, he would fallsick. If it is absolutely necessary to rouse a sleeper, it must be done very gradually, to allowthe soul time to return. A Fijian in Matuku, suddenly wakened from a nap by somebodytreading on his foot, has been heard bawling after his soul and imploring it to return. Hehad just been dreaming that he was far away in Tonga, and great was his alarm onsuddenly wakening to find his body in Matuku. Death stared him in the face unless his soulcould be induced to speed at once across the sea and reanimate its deserted tenement. Theman would probably have died of fright if a missionary had not been at hand to allay histerror.Still more dangerous is it in the opinion of primitive man to move a sleeper or alter hisappearance, for if this were done the soul on its return might not be able to find orrecognise its body, and so the person would die. The Minangkabauers deem it highlyimproper to blacken or dirty the face of a sleeper, lest the absent soul should shrink fromre-entering a body thus disfigured. Patani Malays fancy that if a person’s face be paintedwhile he sleeps, the soul which has gone out of him will not recognise him, and he will sleepon till his face is washed. In Bombay it is thought equivalent to murder to change theaspect of a sleeper, as by painting his face in fantastic colours or giving moustaches to asleeping woman. For when the soul returns it will not know its own body, and the personwill die.But in order that a man’s soul should quit his body, it is not necessary that he should beasleep. It may quit him in his waking hours, and then sickness, insanity, or death will be theresult. Thus a man of the Wurunjeri tribe in Australia lay at his last gasp because his spirit"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"had departed from him. A medicine-man went in pursuit and caught the spirit by themiddle just as it was about to plunge into the sunset glow, which is the light cast by thesouls of the dead as they pass in and out of the under-world, where the sun goes to rest.Having captured the vagrant spirit, the doctor brought it back under his opossum rug, laidhimself down on the dying man, and put the soul back into him, so that after a time herevived. The Karens of Burma are perpetually anxious about their souls, lest these shouldgo roving from their bodies, leaving the owners to die. When a man has reason to fear thathis soul is about to take this fatal step, a ceremony is performed to retain or recall it, inwhich the whole family must take part. A meal is prepared consisting of a cock and hen, aspecial kind of rice, and a bunch of bananas. Then the head of the family takes the bowlwhich is used to skim rice, and knocking with it thrice on the top of the houseladder says:“Prrrroo! Come back, soul, do not tarry outside! If it rains, you will be wet. If the sunshines, you will be hot. The gnats will sting you, the leeches will bite you, the tigers willdevour you, the thunder will crush you. Prrrroo! Come back, soul! Here it will be well withyou. You shall want for nothing. Come and eat under shelter from the wind and thestorm.” After that the family partakes of the meal, and the ceremony ends with everybodytying their right wrist with a string which has been charmed by a sorcerer. Similarly theLolos of South-western China believe that the soul leaves the body in chronic illness. Inthat case they read a sort of elaborate litany, calling on the soul by name and beseeching itto return from the hills, the vales, the rivers, the forests, the fields, or from wherever it maybe straying. At the same time cups of water, wine, and rice are set at the door for therefreshment of the weary wandering spirit. When the ceremony is over, they tie a red cordround the arm of the sick man to tether the soul, and this cord is worn by him until itdecays and drops off.Some of the Congo tribes believe that when a man is ill, his soul has left his body and iswandering at large. The aid of the sorcerer is then called in to capture the vagrant spiritand restore it to the invalid. Generally the physician declares that he has successfullychased the soul into the branch of a tree. The whole town thereupon turns out andaccompanies the doctor to the tree, where the strongest men are deputed to break off thebranch in which the soul of the sick man is supposed to be lodged. This they do and carrythe branch back to the town, insinuating by their gestures that the burden is heavy andhard to bear. When the branch has been brought to the sick man’s hut, he is placed in anupright position by its side, and the sorcerer performs the enchantments by which the soulis believed to be restored to its owner.Pining, sickness, great fright, and death are ascribed by the Bataks of Sumatra to theabsence of the soul from the body. At first they try to beckon the wanderer back, and tolure him, like a fowl, by strewing rice. Then the following form of words is commonlyrepeated: “Come back, O soul, whether thou art lingering in the wood, or on the hills, or inthe dale. See, I call thee with a toemba bras, with an egg of the fowl Rajah moelija, with theeleven healing leaves. Detain it not, let it come straight here, detain it not, neither in thewood, nor on the hill, nor in the dale. That may not be. O come straight home!” Once whena popular traveller was leaving a Kayan village, the mothers, fearing that their children’ssouls might follow him on his journey, brought him the boards on which they carry theirinfants and begged him to pray that the souls of the little ones would return to the familiarboards and not go away with him into the far country. To each board was fastened a"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"looped string for the purpose of tethering the vagrant spirits, and through the loop eachbaby was made to pass a chubby finger to make sure that its tiny soul would not wanderaway.In an Indian story a king conveys his soul into the dead body of a Brahman, and ahunchback conveys his soul into the deserted body of the king. The hunchback is now kingand the king is a Brahman. However, the hunchback is induced to show his skill bytransferring his soul to the dead body of a parrot, and the king seizes the opportunity toregain possession of his own body. A tale of the same type, with variations of detail,reappears among the Malays. A king has incautiously transferred his soul to an ape, uponwhich the vizier adroitly inserts his own soul into the king’s body and so takes possession ofthe queen and the kingdom, while the true king languishes at court in the outwardsemblance of an ape. But one day the false king, who played for high stakes, was watchinga combat of rams, and it happened that the animal on which he had laid his money felldown dead. All efforts to restore animation proved unavailing till the false king, with theinstinct of a true sportsman, transferred his own soul to the body of the deceased ram, andthus renewed the fray. The real king in the body of the ape saw his chance, and with greatpresence of mind darted back into his own body, which the vizier had rashly vacated. So hecame to his own again, and the usurper in the ram’s body met with the fate he richlydeserved. Similarly the Greeks told how the soul of Hermotimus of Clazomenae used toquit his body and roam far and wide, bringing back intelligence of what he had seen on hisrambles to his friends at home; until one day, when his spirit was abroad, his enemiescontrived to seize his deserted body and committed it to the flames.The departure of the soul is not always voluntary. It may be extracted from the bodyagainst its will by ghosts, demons, or sorcerers. Hence, when a funeral is passing the house,the Karens tie their children with a special kind of string to a particular part of the house,lest the souls of the children should leave their bodies and go into the corpse which ispassing. The children are kept tied in this way until the corpse is out of sight. And after thecorpse has been laid in the grave, but before the earth has been shovelled in, the mournersand friends range themselves round the grave, each with a bamboo split lengthwise in onehand and a little stick in the other; each man thrusts his bamboo into the grave, anddrawing the stick along the groove of the bamboo points out to his soul that in this way itmay easily climb up out of the tomb. While the earth is being shovelled in, the bamboos arekept out of the way, lest the souls should be in them, and so should be inadvertently buriedwith the earth as it is being thrown into the grave; and when the people leave the spot theycarry away the bamboos, begging their souls to come with them. Further, on returningfrom the grave each Karen provides himself with three little hooks made of branches oftrees, and calling his spirit to follow him, at short intervals, as he returns, he makes amotion as if hooking it, and then thrusts the hook into the ground. This is done to preventthe soul of the living from staying behind with the soul of the dead. When the Karo-Batakshave buried somebody and are filling in the grave, a sorceress runs about beating the airwith a stick. This she does in order to drive away the souls of the survivors, for if one ofthese souls happened to slip into the grave and to be covered up with earth, its ownerwould die.In Uea, one of the Loyalty Islands, the souls of the dead seem to have been credited with the"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"power of stealing the souls of the living. For when a man was sick the soul-doctor would gowith a large troop of men and women to the graveyard. Here the men played on flutes andthe women whistled softly to lure the soul home. After this had gone on for some time theyformed in procession and moved homewards, the flutes playing and the women whistlingall the way, while they led back the wandering soul and drove it gently along with openpalms. On entering the patient’s dwelling they commanded the soul in a loud voice to enterhis body.Often the abduction of a man’s soul is set down to demons. Thus fits and convulsions aregenerally ascribed by the Chinese to the agency of certain mischievous spirits who love todraw men’s souls out of their bodies. At Amoy the spirits who serve babies and children inthis way rejoice in the high-sounding titles of “celestial agencies bestriding gallopinghorses” and “literary graduates residing halfway up in the sky.” When an infant iswrithing in convulsions, the frightened mother hastens to the roof of the house, and, wavingabout a bamboo pole to which one of the child’s garments is attached, cries out severaltimes “My child So-and-so, come back, return home!” Meantime, another inmate of thehouse bangs away at a gong in the hope of attracting the attention of the strayed soul,which is supposed to recognise the familiar garment and to slip into it. The garmentcontaining the soul is then placed on or beside the child, and if the child does not dierecovery is sure to follow, sooner or later. Similarly some Indians catch a man’s lost soul inhis boots and restore it to his body by putting his feet into them.In the Moluccas when a man is unwell it is thought that some devil has carried away hissoul to the tree, mountain, or hill where he (the devil) resides. A sorcerer having pointedout the devil’s abode, the friends of the patient carry thither cooked rice, fruit, fish, raweggs, a hen, a chicken, a silken robe, gold, armlets, and so forth. Having set out the food inorder they pray, saying: “We come to offer to you, O devil, this offering of food, clothes,gold, and so on; take it and release the soul of the patient for whom we pray. Let it returnto his body, and he who now is sick shall be made whole.” Then they eat a little and let thehen loose as a ransom for the soul of the patient; also they put down the raw eggs; but thesilken robe, the gold, and the armlets they take home with them. As soon as they are cometo the house they place a flat bowl containing the offerings which have been brought backat the sick man’s head, and say to him: “Now is your soul released, and you shall fare welland live to grey hairs on the earth.”Demons are especially feared by persons who have just entered a new house. Hence at ahouse-warming among the Alfoors of Minahassa in Celebes the priest performs a ceremonyfor the purpose of restoring their souls to the inmates. He hangs up a bag at the place ofsacrifice and then goes through a list of the gods. There are so many of them that this takeshim the whole night through without stopping. In the morning he offers the gods an eggand some rice. By this time the souls of the household are supposed to be gathered in thebag. So the priest takes the bag, and holding it on the head of the master of the house, says,“Here you have your soul; go (soul) to-morrow away again.” He then does the same, sayingthe same words, to the housewife and all the other members of the family. Amongst thesame Alfoors one way of recovering a sick man’s soul is to let down a bowl by a belt out ofa window and fish for the soul till it is caught in the bowl and hauled up. And among thesame people, when a priest is bringing back a sick man’s soul which he has caught in a"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"cloth, he is preceded by a girl holding the large leaf of a certain palm over his head as anumbrella to keep him and the soul from getting wet, in case it should rain; and he isfollowed by a man brandishing a sword to deter other souls from any attempt at rescuingthe captured spirit.Sometimes the lost soul is brought back in a visible shape. The Salish or Flathead Indiansof Oregon believe that a man’s soul may be separated for a time from his body withoutcausing death and without the man being aware of his loss. It is necessary, however, thatthe lost soul should be soon found and restored to its owner or he will die. The name of theman who has lost his soul is revealed in a dream to the medicine-man, who hastens toinform the sufferer of his loss. Generally a number of men have sustained a like loss at thesame time; all their names are revealed to the medicine-man, and all employ him to recovertheir souls. The whole night long these soulless men go about the village from lodge tolodge, dancing and singing. Towards daybreak they go into a separate lodge, which isclosed up so as to be totally dark. A small hole is then made in the roof, through which themedicine-man, with a bunch of feathers, brushes in the souls, in the shape of bits of boneand the like, which he receives on a piece of matting. A fire is next kindled, by the light ofwhich the medicine-man sorts out the souls. First he puts aside the souls of dead people, ofwhich there are usually several; for if he were to give the soul of a dead person to a livingman, the man would die instantly. Next he picks out the souls of all the persons present,and making them all to sit down before him, he takes the soul of each, in the shape of asplinter of bone, wood, or shell, and placing it on the owner’s head, pats it with manyprayers and contortions till it descends into the heart and so resumes its proper place.Again, souls may be extracted from their bodies or detained on their wanderings not onlyby ghosts and demons but also by men, especially by sorcerers. In Fiji, if a criminal refusedto confess, the chief sent for a scarf with which “to catch away the soul of the rogue.” At thesight or even at the mention of the scarf the culprit generally made a clean breast. For if hedid not, the scarf would be waved over his head till his soul was caught in it, when it wouldbe carefully folded up and nailed to the end of a chief’s canoe; and for want of his soul thecriminal would pine and die. The sorcerers of Danger Island used to set snares for souls.The snares were made of stout cinet, about fifteen to thirty feet long, with loops on eitherside of different sizes, to suit the different sizes of souls; for fat souls there were large loops,for thin souls there were small ones. When a man was sick against whom the sorcerers hada grudge, they set up these soul-snares near his house and watched for the flight of his soul.If in the shape of a bird or an insect it was caught in the snare, the man would infalliblydie. In some parts of West Africa, indeed, wizards are continually setting traps to catchsouls that wander from their bodies in sleep; and when they have caught one, they tie it upover the fire, and as it shrivels in the heat the owner sickens. This is done, not out of anygrudge towards the sufferer, but purely as a matter of business. The wizard does not carewhose soul he has captured, and will readily restore it to its owner, if only he is paid fordoing so. Some sorcerers keep regular asylums for strayed souls, and anybody who has lostor mislaid his own soul can always have another one from the asylum on payment of theusual fee. No blame whatever attaches to men who keep these private asylums or set trapsfor passing souls; it is their profession, and in the exercise of it they are actuated by noharsh or unkindly feelings. But there are also wretches who from pure spite or for the sakeof lucre set and bait traps with the deliberate purpose of catching the soul of a particular"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"man; and in the bottom of the pot, hidden by the bait, are knives and sharp hooks whichtear and rend the poor soul, either killing it outright or mauling it so as to impair thehealth of its owner when it succeeds in escaping and returning to him. Miss Kingsley knewa Kruman who became very anxious about his soul, because for several nights he had smeltin his dreams the savoury smell of smoked crawfish seasoned with red pepper. Clearlysome ill-wisher had set a trap baited with this dainty for his dream-soul, intending to dohim grievous bodily, or rather spiritual, harm; and for the next few nights great pains weretaken to keep his soul from straying abroad in his sleep. In the sweltering heat of thetropical night he lay sweating and snorting under a blanket, his nose and mouth tied upwith a handkerchief to prevent the escape of his precious soul. In Hawaii there weresorcerers who caught souls of living people, shut them up in calabashes, and gave them topeople to eat. By squeezing a captured soul in their hands they discovered the place wherepeople had been secretly buried.Nowhere perhaps is the art of abducting human souls more carefully cultivated or carriedto higher perfection than in the Malay Peninsula. Here the methods by which the wizardworks his will are various, and so too are his motives. Sometimes he desires to destroy anenemy, sometimes to win the love of a cold or bashful beauty. Thus, to take an instance ofthe latter sort of charm, the following are the directions given for securing the soul of onewhom you wish to render distraught. When the moon, just risen, looks red above theeastern horizon, go out, and standing in the moonlight, with the big toe of your right footon the big toe of your left, make a speaking-trumpet of your right hand and recite throughit the following words:“OM. I loose my shaft, I loose it and the moon clouds over,I loose it, and the sun is extinguished.I loose it, and the stars burn dim.But it is not the sun, moon, and stars that I shoot at,It is the stalk of the heart of that child of the congregation,So-and-so.Cluck! Cluck! Soul of So-and-so, come and walk with me,Come and sit with me,Come and sleep and share my pillow.Cluck! Cluck! Soul.”Repeat this thrice and after every repetition blow through your hollow fist. Or you maycatch the soul in your turban, thus. Go out on the night of the full moon and the twosucceeding nights; sit down on an ant-hill facing the moon, burn incense, and recite thefollowing incantation:"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"“I bring you a betel leaf to chew,Dab the lime on to it, Prince Ferocious,For Somebody, Prince Distraction’s daughter, to chew.Somebody at sunrise be distraught for love of meSomebody at sunset be distraught for love of me.As you remember your parents, remember me;As you remember your house and houseladder, remember me;When thunder rumbles, remember me;When wind whistles, remember me;When the heavens rain, remember me;When cocks crow, remember me;When the dial-bird tells its tales, remember me;When you look up at the sun, remember me;When you look up at the moon, remember me,For in that self-same moon I am there.Cluck! Cluck! Soul of Somebody come hither to me.I do not mean to let you have my soul,Let your soul come hither to mine.”Now wave the end of your turban towards the moon seven times each night. Go home andput it under your pillow, and if you want to wear it in the daytime, burn incense and say,“It is not a turban that I carry in my girdle, but the soul of Somebody.”The Indians of the Nass River, in British Columbia, are impressed with a belief that aphysician may swallow his patient’s soul by mistake. A doctor who is believed to have doneso is made by the other members of the faculty to stand over the patient, while one of themthrusts his fingers down the doctor’s throat, another kneads him in the stomach with hisknuckles, and a third slaps him on the back. If the soul is not in him after all, and if thesame process has been repeated upon all the medical men without success, it is concludedthat the soul must be in the head-doctor’s box. A party of doctors, therefore, waits uponhim at his house and requests him to produce his box. When he has done so and arrangedits contents on a new mat, they take the votary of Aesculapius and hold him up by the heelswith his head in a hole in the floor. In this position they wash his head, and “any waterremaining from the ablution is taken and poured upon the sick man’s head.” No doubt thelost soul is in the water.3. The Soul as a Shadow and a ReflectionBUT the spiritual dangers I have enumerated are not the only ones which beset the savage.Often he regards his shadow or reflection as his soul, or at all events as a vital part ofhimself, and as such it is necessarily a source of danger to him. For if it is trampled upon,struck, or stabbed, he will feel the injury as if it were done to his person; and if it isdetached from him entirely (as he believes that it may be) he will die. In the island of Wetarthere are magicians who can make a man ill by stabbing his shadow with a pike or hacking"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"it with a sword. After Sankara had destroyed the Buddhists in India, it is said that hejourneyed to Nepaul, where he had some difference of opinion with the Grand Lama. Toprove his supernatural powers, he soared into the air. But as he mounted up the GrandLama, perceiving his shadow swaying and wavering on the ground, struck his knife into itand down fell Sankara and broke his neck.In the Banks Islands there are some stones of a remarkably long shape which go by thename of “eating ghosts,” because certain powerful and dangerous ghosts are believed tolodge in them. If a man’s shadow falls on one of these stones, the ghost will draw his soulout from him, so that he will die. Such stones, therefore, are set in a house to guard it; anda messenger sent to a house by the absent owner will call out the name of the sender, lestthe watchful ghost in the stone should fancy that he came with evil intent and should dohim a mischief. At a funeral in China, when the lid is about to be placed on the coffin, mostof the bystanders, with the exception of the nearest kin, retire a few steps or even retreat toanother room, for a person’s health is believed to be endangered by allowing his shadow tobe enclosed in a coffin. And when the coffin is about to be lowered into the grave most ofthe spectators recoil to a little distance lest their shadows should fall into the grave andharm should thus be done to their persons. The geomancer and his assistants stand on theside of the grave which is turned away from the sun; and the grave-diggers and coffin-bearers attach their shadows firmly to their persons by tying a strip of cloth tightly roundtheir waists. Nor is it human beings alone who are thus liable to be injured by means oftheir shadows. Animals are to some extent in the same predicament. A small snail, whichfrequents the neighbourhood of the limestone hills in Perak, is believed to suck the blood ofcattle through their shadows; hence the beasts grow lean and sometimes die from loss ofblood. The ancients supposed that in Arabia, if a hyaena trod on a man’s shadow, itdeprived him of the power of speech and motion; and that if a dog, standing on a roof inthe moonlight, cast a shadow on the ground and a hyaena trod on it, the dog would falldown as if dragged with a rope. Clearly in these cases the shadow, if not equivalent to thesoul, is at least regarded as a living part of the man or the animal, so that injury done to theshadow is felt by the person or animal as if it were done to his body.Conversely, if the shadow is a vital part of a man or an animal, it may under certaincircumstances be as hazardous to be touched by it as it would be to come into contact withthe person or animal. Hence the savage makes it a rule to shun the shadow of certainpersons whom for various reasons he regards as sources of dangerous influence. Amongstthe dangerous classes he commonly ranks mourners and women in general, but especiallyhis mother-in-law. The Shuswap Indians think that the shadow of a mourner falling upon aperson would make him sick. Amongst the Kurnai of Victoria novices at initiation werecautioned not to let a woman’s shadow fall across them, as this would make them thin, lazy,and stupid. An Australian native is said to have once nearly died of fright because theshadow of his mother-in-law fell on his legs as he lay asleep under a tree. The awe anddread with which the untutored savage contemplates his mother-in-law are amongst themost familiar facts of anthropology. In the Yuin tribes of New South Wales the rule whichforbade a man to hold any communication with his wife’s mother was very strict. He mightnot look at her or even in her direction. It was a ground of divorce if his shadow happenedto fall on his mother-in-law: in that case he had to leave his wife, and she returned to herparents. In New Britain the native imagination fails to conceive the extent and nature of the"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"calamities which would result from a man’s accidentally speaking to his wife’s mother;suicide of one or both would probably be the only course open to them. The most solemnform of oath a New Briton can take is, “Sir, if I am not telling the truth, I hope I may shakehands with my mother-in-law.”Where the shadow is regarded as so intimately bound up with the life of the man that itsloss entails debility or death, it is natural to expect that its diminution should be regardedwith solicitude and apprehension, as betokening a corresponding decrease in the vitalenergy of its owner. In Amboyna and Uliase, two islands near the equator, wherenecessarily there is little or no shadow cast at noon, the people make it a rule not to go outof the house at mid-day, because they fancy that by doing so a man may lose the shadow ofhis soul. The Mangaians tell of a mighty warrior, Tukaitawa, whose strength waxed andwaned with the length of his shadow. In the morning, when his shadow fell longest, hisstrength was greatest; but as the shadow shortened towards noon his strength ebbed withit, till exactly at noon it reached its lowest point; then, as the shadow stretched out in theafternoon, his strength returned. A certain hero discovered the secret of Tukaitawa’sstrength and slew him at noon. The savage Besisis of the Malay Peninsula fear to bury theirdead at noon, because they fancy that the shortness of their shadows at that hour wouldsympathetically shorten their own lives.Nowhere, perhaps, does the equivalence of the shadow to the life or soul come out moreclearly than in some customs practised to this day in South-eastern Europe. In modernGreece, when the foundation of a new building is being laid, it is the custom to kill a cock, aram, or a lamb, and to let its blood flow on the foundation-stone, under which the animal isafterwards buried. The object of the sacrifice is to give strength and stability to thebuilding. But sometimes, instead of killing an animal, the builder entices a man to thefoundation-stone, secretly measures his body, or a part of it, or his shadow, and buries themeasure under the foundation-stone; or he lays the foundation-stone upon the man’sshadow. It is believed that the man will die within the year. The Roumanians ofTransylvania think that he whose shadow is thus immured will die within forty days; sopersons passing by a building which is in course of erection may hear a warning cry,“Beware lest they take thy shadow!” Not long ago there were still shadow-traders whosebusiness it was to provide architects with the shadows necessary for securing their walls. Inthese cases the measure of the shadow is looked on as equivalent to the shadow itself, and tobury it is to bury the life or soul of the man, who, deprived of it, must die. Thus the customis a substitute for the old practice of immuring a living person in the walls, or crushing himunder the foundation-stone of a new building, in order to give strength and durability tothe structure, or more definitely in order that the angry ghost may haunt the place andguard it against the intrusion of enemies.As some peoples believe a man’s soul to be in his shadow, so other (or the same) peoplesbelieve it to be in his reflection in water or a mirror. Thus “the Andamanese do not regardtheir shadows but their reflections (in any mirror) as their souls.” When the Motumotu ofNew Guinea first saw their likenesses in a looking-glass, they thought that their reflectionswere their souls. In New Caledonia the old men are of opinion that a person’s reflection inwater or a mirror is his soul; but the younger men, taught by the Catholic priests, maintainthat it is a reflection and nothing more, just like the reflection of palm-trees in the water."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"The reflection-soul, being external to the man, is exposed to much the same dangers as theshadow-soul. The Zulus will not look into a dark pool because they think there is a beast init which will take away their reflections, so that they die. The Basutos say that crocodileshave the power of thus killing a man by dragging his reflection under water. When one ofthem dies suddenly and from no apparent cause, his relatives will allege that a crocodilemust have taken his shadow some time when he crossed a stream. In Saddle Island,Melanesia, there is a pool “into which if any one looks he dies; the malignant spirit takeshold upon his life by means of his reflection on the water.”We can now understand why it was a maxim both in ancient India and ancient Greece notto look at one’s reflection in water, and why the Greeks regarded it as an omen of death if aman dreamed of seeing himself so reflected. They feared that the water-spirits would dragthe person’s reflection or soul under water, leaving him soulless to perish. This wasprobably the origin of the classical story of the beautiful Narcissus, who languished anddied through seeing his reflection in the water.Further, we can now explain the widespread custom of covering up mirrors or turningthem to the wall after a death has taken place in the house. It is feared that the soul,projected out of the person in the shape of his reflection in the mirror, may be carried offby the ghost of the departed, which is commonly supposed to linger about the house till theburial. The custom is thus exactly parallel to the Aru custom of not sleeping in a houseafter a death for fear that the soul, projected out of the body in a dream, may meet theghost and be carried off by it. The reason why sick people should not see themselves in amirror, and why the mirror in a sick-room is therefore covered up, is also plain; in time ofsickness, when the soul might take flight so easily, it is particularly dangerous to project itout of the body by means of the reflection in a mirror. The rule is therefore preciselyparallel to the rule observed by some peoples of not allowing sick people to sleep; for insleep the soul is projected out of the body, and there is always a risk that it may not return.As with shadows and reflections, so with portraits; they are often believed to contain thesoul of the person portrayed. People who hold this belief are naturally loth to have theirlikenesses taken; for if the portrait is the soul, or at least a vital part of the personportrayed, whoever possesses the portrait will be able to exercise a fatal influence over theoriginal of it. Thus the Esquimaux of Bering Strait believe that persons dealing inwitchcraft have the power of stealing a person’s shade, so that without it he will pine awayand die. Once at a village on the lower Yukon River an explorer had set up his camera toget a picture of the people as they were moving about among their houses. While he wasfocusing the instrument, the headman of the village came up and insisted on peeping underthe cloth. Being allowed to do so, he gazed intently for a minute at the moving figures onthe ground glass, then suddenly withdrew his head and bawled at the top of his voice to thepeople, “He has all of your shades in this box.” A panic ensued among the group, and in aninstant they disappeared helterskelter into their houses. The Tepehuanes of Mexico stoodin mortal terror of the camera, and five days’ persuasion was necessary to induce them topose for it. When at last they consented, they looked like criminals about to be executed.They believed that by photographing people the artist could carry off their souls anddevour them at his leisure moments. They said that, when the pictures reached his country,they would die or some other evil would befall them. When Dr. Catat and some"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"companions were exploring the Bara country on the west coast of Madagascar, the peoplesuddenly became hostile. The day before the travellers, not without difficulty, hadphotographed the royal family, and now found themselves accused of taking the souls ofthe natives for the purpose of selling them when they returned to France. Denial was vain;in compliance with the custom of the country they were obliged to catch the souls, whichwere then put into a basket and ordered by Dr. Catat to return to their respective owners.Some villagers in Sikhim betrayed a lively horror and hid away whenever the lens of acamera, or “the evil eye of the box” as they called it, was turned on them. They thought ittook away their souls with their pictures, and so put it in the power of the owner of thepictures to cast spells on them, and they alleged that a photograph of the scenery blightedthe landscape. Until the reign of the late King of Siam no Siamese coins were ever stampedwith the image of the king, “for at that time there was a strong prejudice against themaking of portraits in any medium. Europeans who travel into the jungle have, even at thepresent time, only to point a camera at a crowd to procure its instant dispersion. When acopy of the face of a person is made and taken away from him, a portion of his life goeswith the picture. Unless the sovereign had been blessed with the years of a Methusaleh hecould scarcely have permitted his life to be distributed in small pieces together with thecoins of the realm.”Beliefs of the same sort still linger in various parts of Europe. Not very many years agosome old women in the Greek island of Carpathus were very angry at having theirlikenesses drawn, thinking that in consequence they would pine and die. There are personsin the West of Scotland “who refuse to have their likenesses taken lest it prove unlucky;and give as instances the cases of several of their friends who never had a day’s health afterbeing photographed.”XIX. Tabooed Acts1. Taboos on Intercourse with StrangersSO much for the primitive conceptions of the soul and the dangers to which it is exposed.These conceptions are not limited to one people or country; with variations of detail theyare found all over the world, and survive, as we have seen, in modern Europe. Beliefs sodeep-seated and so widespread must necessarily have contributed to shape the mould inwhich the early kingship was cast. For if every person was at such pains to save his ownsoul from the perils which threatened it on so many sides, how much more carefully musthe have been guarded upon whose life hung the welfare and even the existence of the wholepeople, and whom therefore it was the common interest of all to preserve? Therefore weshould expect to find the king’s life protected by a system of precautions or safeguards stillmore numerous and minute than those which in primitive society every man adopts for thesafety of his own soul. Now in point of fact the life of the early kings is regulated, as wehave seen and shall see more fully presently, by a very exact code of rules. May we not thenconjecture that these rules are in fact the very safeguards which we should expect to find"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"adopted for the protection of the king’s life? An examination of the rules themselvesconfirms this conjecture. For from this it appears that some of the rules observed by thekings are identical with those observed by private persons out of regard for the safety oftheir souls; and even of those which seem peculiar to the king, many, if not all, are mostreadily explained on the hypothesis that they are nothing but safeguards or lifeguards ofthe king. I will now enumerate some of these royal rules or taboos, offering on each of themsuch comments and explanations as may serve to set the original intention of the rule in itsproper light.As the object of the royal taboos is to isolate the king from all sources of danger, theirgeneral effect is to compel him to live in a state of seclusion, more or less complete,according to the number and stringency of the rules he observes. Now of all sources ofdanger none are more dreaded by the savage than magic and witchcraft, and he suspectsall strangers of practising these black arts. To guard against the baneful influence exertedvoluntarily or involuntarily by strangers is therefore an elementary dictate of savageprudence. Hence before strangers are allowed to enter a district, or at least before they arepermitted to mingle freely with the inhabitants, certain ceremonies are often performed bythe natives of the country for the purpose of disarming the strangers of their magicalpowers, of counteracting the baneful influence which is believed to emanate from them, orof disinfecting, so to speak, the tainted atmosphere by which they are supposed to besurrounded. Thus, when the ambassadors sent by Justin II., Emperor of the East, toconclude a peace with the Turks had reached their destination, they were received byshamans, who subjected them to a ceremonial purification for the purpose of exorcising allharmful influence. Having deposited the goods brought by the ambassadors in an openplace, these wizards carried burning branches of incense round them, while they rang abell and beat on a tambourine, snorting and falling into a state of frenzy in their efforts todispel the powers of evil. Afterwards they purified the ambassadors themselves by leadingthem through the flames. In the island of Nanumea (South Pacific) strangers from ships orfrom other islands were not allowed to communicate with the people until they all, or a fewas representatives of the rest, had been taken to each of the four temples in the island, andprayers offered that the god would avert any disease or treachery which these strangersmight have brought with them. Meat offerings were also laid upon the altars, accompaniedby songs and dances in honour of the god. While these ceremonies were going on, all thepeople except the priests and their attendants kept out of sight. Amongst the Ot Danoms ofBorneo it is the custom that strangers entering the territory should pay to the natives acertain sum, which is spent in the sacrifice of buffaloes or pigs to the spirits of the land andwater, in order to reconcile them to the presence of the strangers, and to induce them not towithdraw their favour from the people of the country, but to bless the rice-harvest, and soforth. The men of a certain district in Borneo, fearing to look upon a European travellerlest he should make them ill, warned their wives and children not to go near him. Thosewho could not restrain their curiosity killed fowls to appease the evil spirits and smearedthemselves with the blood. “More dreaded,” says a traveller in Central Borneo, “than theevil spirits of the neighbourhood are the evil spirits from a distance which accompanytravellers. When a company from the middle Mahakam River visited me among the Blu-uKayans in the year 1897, no woman showed herself outside her house without a burningbundle of plehiding bark, the stinking smoke of which drives away evil spirits.”"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"When Crevaux was travelling in South America he entered a village of the Apalai Indians.A few moments after his arrival some of the Indians brought him a number of large blackants, of a species whose bite is painful, fastened on palm leaves. Then all the people of thevillage, without distinction of age or sex, presented themselves to him, and he had to stingthem all with the ants on their faces, thighs, and other parts of their bodies. Sometimes,when he applied the ants too tenderly, they called out “More! more!” and were not satisfiedtill their skin was thickly studded with tiny swellings like what might have been producedby whipping them with nettles. The object of this ceremony is made plain by the customobserved in Amboyna and Uliase of sprinkling sick people with pungent spices, such asginger and cloves, chewed fine, in order by the prickling sensation to drive away the demonof disease which may be clinging to their persons. In Java a popular cure for gout orrheumatism is to rub Spanish pepper into the nails of the fingers and toes of the sufferer;the pungency of the pepper is supposed to be too much for the gout or rheumatism, whoaccordingly departs in haste. So on the Slave Coast the mother of a sick child sometimesbelieves that an evil spirit has taken possession of the child’s body, and in order to drivehim out, she makes small cuts in the body of the little sufferer and inserts green peppers orspices in the wounds, believing that she will thereby hurt the evil spirit and force him to begone. The poor child naturally screams with pain, but the mother hardens her heart in thebelief that the demon is suffering equally.It is probable that the same dread of strangers, rather than any desire to do them honour,is the motive of certain ceremonies which are sometimes observed at their reception, but ofwhich the intention is not directly stated. In the Ongtong Java Islands, which are inhabitedby Polynesians, the priests or sorcerers seem to wield great influence. Their main businessis to summon or exorcise spirits for the purpose of averting or dispelling sickness, and ofprocuring favourable winds, a good catch of fish, and so on. When strangers land on theislands, they are first of all received by the sorcerers, sprinkled with water, anointed withoil, and girt with dried pandanus leaves. At the same time sand and water are freelythrown about in all directions, and the newcomer and his boat are wiped with green leaves.After this ceremony the strangers are introduced by the sorcerers to the chief. InAfghanistan and in some parts of Persia the traveller, before he enters a village, isfrequently received with a sacrifice of animal life or food, or of fire and incense. TheAfghan Boundary Mission, in passing by villages in Afghanistan, was often met with fireand incense. Sometimes a tray of lighted embers is thrown under the hoofs of the traveller’shorse, with the words, “You are welcome.” On entering a village in Central Africa EminPasha was received with the sacrifice of two goats; their blood was sprinkled on the pathand the chief stepped over the blood to greet Emin. Sometimes the dread of strangers andtheir magic is too great to allow of their reception on any terms. Thus when Speke arrivedat a certain village, the natives shut their doors against him, “because they had neverbefore seen a white man nor the tin boxes that the men were carrying: ‘Who knows,’ theysaid, ‘but that these very boxes are the plundering Watuta transformed and come to killus? You cannot be admitted.’ No persuasion could avail with them, and the party had toproceed to the next village.”The fear thus entertained of alien visitors is often mutual. Entering a strange land thesavage feels that he is treading enchanted ground, and he takes steps to guard against thedemons that haunt it and the magical arts of its inhabitants. Thus on going to a strange"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"land the Maoris performed certain ceremonies to make it “common,” lest it might havebeen previously “sacred.” When Baron Miklucho-Maclay was approaching a village on theMaclay Coast of New Guinea, one of the natives who accompanied him broke a branchfrom a tree and going aside whispered to it for a while; then stepping up to each member ofthe party, one after another, he spat something upon his back and gave him some blowswith the branch. Lastly, he went into the forest and buried the branch under witheredleaves in the thickest part of the jungle. This ceremony was believed to protect the partyagainst all treachery and danger in the village they were approaching. The idea probablywas that the malignant influences were drawn off from the persons into the branch andburied with it in the depths of the forest. In Australia, when a strange tribe has beeninvited into a district and is approaching the encampment of the tribe which owns the land,“the strangers carry lighted bark or burning sticks in their hands, for the purpose, theysay, of clearing and purifying the air.” When the Toradjas are on a head-huntingexpedition and have entered the enemy’s country, they may not eat any fruits which the foehas planted nor any animal which he has reared until they have first committed an act ofhostility, as by burning a house or killing a man. They think that if they broke this rulethey would receive something of the soul or spiritual essence of the enemy into themselves,which would destroy the mystic virtue of their talismans.Again, it is believed that a man who has been on a journey may have contracted somemagic evil from the strangers with whom he has associated. Hence, on returning home,before he is readmitted to the society of his tribe and friends, he has to undergo certainpurificatory ceremonies. Thus the Bechuanas “cleanse or purify themselves after journeysby shaving their heads, etc., lest they should have contracted from strangers some evil bywitchcraft or sorcery.” In some parts of Western Africa, when a man returns home after along absence, before he is allowed to visit his wife, he must wash his person with aparticular fluid, and receive from the sorcerer a certain mark on his forehead, in order tocounteract any magic spell which a stranger woman may have cast on him in his absence,and which might be communicated through him to the women of his village. Two Hindooambassadors, who had been sent to England by a native prince and had returned to India,were considered to have so polluted themselves by contact with strangers that nothing butbeing born again could restore them to purity. “For the purpose of regeneration it isdirected to make an image of pure gold of the female power of nature, in the shape either ofa woman or of a cow. In this statue the person to be regenerated is enclosed, and draggedthrough the usual channel. As a statue of pure gold and of proper dimensions would be tooexpensive, it is sufficient to make an image of the sacred Yoni, through which the person tobe regenerated is to pass.” Such an image of pure gold was made at the prince’s command,and his ambassadors were born again by being dragged through it.When precautions like these are taken on behalf of the people in general against themalignant influence supposed to be exercised by strangers, it is no wonder that specialmeasures are adopted to protect the king from the same insidious danger. In the middleages the envoys who visited a Tartar Khan were obliged to pass between two fires beforethey were admitted to his presence, and the gifts they brought were also carried betweenthe fires. The reason assigned for the custom was that the fire purged away any magicinfluence which the strangers might mean to exercise over the Khan. When subject chiefscome with their retinues to visit Kalamba (the most powerful chief of the Bashilange in the"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Congo Basin) for the first time or after being rebellious, they have to bathe, men andwomen together, in two brooks on two successive days, passing the nights under the opensky in the market-place. After the second bath they proceed, entirely naked, to the house ofKalamba, who makes a long white mark on the breast and forehead of each of them. Thenthey return to the market-place and dress, after which they undergo the pepper ordeal.Pepper is dropped into the eyes of each of them, and while this is being done the suffererhas to make a confession of all his sins, to answer all questions that may be put to him, andto take certain vows. This ends the ceremony, and the strangers are now free to take uptheir quarters in the town for as long as they choose to remain.2. Taboos on Eating and DrinkingIN THE OPINION of savages the acts of eating and drinking are attended with specialdanger; for at these times the soul may escape from the mouth, or be extracted by themagic arts of an enemy present. Among the Ewe-speaking peoples of the Slave Coast “thecommon belief seems to be that the indwelling spirit leaves the body and returns to itthrough the mouth; hence, should it have gone out, it behoves a man to be careful aboutopening his mouth, lest a homeless spirit should take advantage of the opportunity andenter his body. This, it appears, is considered most likely to take place while the man iseating.” Precautions are therefore adopted to guard against these dangers. Thus of theBataks it is said that “since the soul can leave the body, they always take care to preventtheir soul from straying on occasions when they have most need of it. But it is only possibleto prevent the soul from straying when one is in the house. At feasts one may find the wholehouse shut up, in order that the soul may stay and enjoy the good things set before it.” TheZafimanelo in Madagascar lock their doors when they eat, and hardly any one ever seesthem eating. The Warua will not allow any one to see them eating and drinking, beingdoubly particular that no person of the opposite sex shall see them doing so. “I had to pay aman to let me see him drink; I could not make a man let a woman see him drink.” Whenoffered a drink they often ask that a cloth may be held up to hide them whilst drinking.If these are the ordinary precautions taken by common people, the precautions taken bykings are extraordinary. The king of Loango may not be seen eating or drinking by man orbeast under pain of death. A favourite dog having broken into the room where the king wasdining, the king ordered it to be killed on the spot. Once the king’s own son, a boy of twelveyears old, inadvertently saw the king drink. Immediately the king ordered him to be finelyapparelled and feasted, after which he commanded him to be cut in quarters, and carriedabout the city with a proclamation that he had seen the king drink. “When the king has amind to drink, he has a cup of wine brought; he that brings it has a bell in his hand, and assoon as he has delivered the cup to the king, he turns his face from him and rings the bell,on which all present fall down with their faces to the ground, and continue so till the kinghas drank... . His eating is much in the same style, for which he has a house on purpose,where his victuals are set upon a bensa or table: which he goes to, and shuts the door: whenhe has done, he knocks and comes out. So that none ever see the king eat or drink. For it isbelieved that if any one should, the king shall immediately die.” The remnants of his foodare buried, doubtless to prevent them from falling into the hands of sorcerers, who bymeans of these fragments might cast a fatal spell over the monarch. The rules observed by"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"the neighbouring king of Cacongo were similar; it was thought that the king would die ifany of his subjects were to see him drink. It is a capital offence to see the king of Dahomeyat his meals. When he drinks in public, as he does on extraordinary occasions, he hideshimself behind a curtain, or handkerchiefs are held up round his head, and all the peoplethrow themselves with their faces to the earth. When the king of Bunyoro in Central Africawent to drink milk in the dairy, every man must leave the royal enclosure and all thewomen had to cover their heads till the king returned. No one might see him drink. Onewife accompanied him to the dairy and handed him the milk-pot, but she turned away herface while he drained it.3. Taboos on Showing the FaceIN SOME of the preceding cases the intention of eating and drinking in strict seclusionmay perhaps be to hinder evil influences from entering the body rather than to prevent theescape of the soul. This certainly is the motive of some drinking customs observed bynatives of the Congo region. Thus we are told of these people that “there is hardly a nativewho would dare to swallow a liquid without first conjuring the spirits. One of them rings abell all the time he is drinking; another crouches down and places his left hand on theearth; another veils his head; another puts a stalk of grass or a leaf in his hair, or marks hisforehead with a line of clay. This fetish custom assumes very varied forms. To explainthem, the black is satisfied to say that they are an energetic mode of conjuring spirits.” Inthis part of the world a chief will commonly ring a bell at each draught of beer which heswallows, and at the same moment a lad stationed in front of him brandishes a spear “tokeep at bay the spirits which might try to sneak into the old chief’s body by the same roadas the beer.” The same motive of warding off evil spirits probably explains the customobserved by some African sultans of veiling their faces. The Sultan of Darfur wraps up hisface with a piece of white muslin, which goes round his head several times, covering hismouth and nose first, and then his forehead, so that only his eyes are visible. The samecustom of veiling the face as a mark of sovereignty is said to be observed in other parts ofCentral Africa. The Sultan of Wadai always speaks from behind a curtain; no one sees hisface except his intimates and a few favoured persons.4. Taboos on Quitting the HouseBY AN EXTENSION of the like precaution kings are sometimes forbidden ever to leavetheir palaces; or, if they are allowed to do so, their subjects are forbidden to see themabroad. The fetish king of Benin, who was worshipped as a deity by his subjects, might notquit his palace. After his coronation the king of Loango is confined to his palace, which hemay not leave. The king of Onitsha “does not step out of his house into the town unless ahuman sacrifice is made to propitiate the gods: on this account he never goes out beyondthe precincts of his premises.” Indeed we are told that he may not quit his palace underpain of death or of giving up one or more slaves to be executed in his presence. As thewealth of the country is measured in slaves, the king takes good care not to infringe thelaw. Yet once a year at the Feast of Yams the king is allowed, and even required by custom,"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"to dance before his people outside the high mud wall of the palace. In dancing he carries agreat weight, generally a sack of earth, on his back to prove that he is still able to supportthe burden and cares of state. Were he unable to discharge this duty, he would beimmediately deposed and perhaps stoned. The kings of Ethiopia were worshipped as gods,but were mostly kept shut up in their palaces. On the mountainous coast of Pontus theredwelt in antiquity a rude and warlike people named the Mosyni or Mosynoeci, throughwhose rugged country the Ten Thousand marched on their famous retreat from Asia toEurope. These barbarians kept their king in close custody at the top of a high tower, fromwhich after his election he was never more allowed to descend. Here he dispensed justice tohis people; but if he offended them, they punished him by stopping his rations for a wholeday, or even starving him to death. The kings of Sabaea or Sheba, the spice country ofArabia, were not allowed to go out of their palaces; if they did so, the mob stoned them todeath. But at the top of the palace there was a window with a chain attached to it. If anyman deemed he had suffered wrong, he pulled the chain, and the king perceived him andcalled him in and gave judgment.5. Taboos on Leaving Food overAGAIN, magic mischief may be wrought upon a man through the remains of the food hehas partaken of, or the dishes out of which he has eaten. On the principles of sympatheticmagic a real connexion continues to subsist between the food which a man has in hisstomach and the refuse of it which he has left untouched, and hence by injuring the refuseyou can simultaneously injure the eater. Among the Narrinyeri of South Australia everyadult is constantly on the look-out for bones of beasts, birds, or fish, of which the flesh hasbeen eaten by somebody, in order to construct a deadly charm out of them. Every one istherefore careful to burn the bones of the animals which he has eaten, lest they should fallinto the hands of a sorcerer. Too often, however, the sorcerer succeeds in getting hold ofsuch a bone, and when he does so he believes that he has the power of life and death overthe man, woman, or child who ate the flesh of the animal. To put the charm in operation hemakes a paste of red ochre and fish oil, inserts in it the eye of a cod and a small piece of theflesh of a corpse, and having rolled the compound into a ball sticks it on the top of the bone.After being left for some time in the bosom of a dead body, in order that it may derive adeadly potency by contact with corruption, the magical implement is set up in the groundnear the fire, and as the ball melts, so the person against whom the charm is directedwastes with disease; if the ball is melted quite away, the victim will die. When thebewitched man learns of the spell that is being cast upon him, he endeavours to buy thebone from the sorcerer, and if he obtains it he breaks the charm by throwing the bone intoa river or lake. In Tana, one of the New Hebrides, people bury or throw into the sea theleavings of their food, lest these should fall into the hands of the disease-makers. For if adisease-maker finds the remnants of a meal, say the skin of a banana, he picks it up andburns it slowly in the fire. As it burns, the person who ate the banana falls ill and sends tothe disease-maker, offering him presents if he will stop burning the banana skin. In NewGuinea the natives take the utmost care to destroy or conceal the husks and other remainsof their food, lest these should be found by their enemies and used by them for the injury ordestruction of the eaters. Hence they burn their leavings, throw them into the sea, or"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"otherwise put them out of harm’s way.From a like fear, no doubt, of sorcery, no one may touch the food which the king of Loangoleaves upon his plate; it is buried in a hole in the ground. And no one may drink out of theking’s vessel. In antiquity the Romans used immediately to break the shells of eggs and ofsnails which they had eaten, in order to prevent enemies from making magic with them.The common practice, still observed among us, of breaking egg-shells after the eggs havebeen eaten may very well have originated in the same superstition.The superstitious fear of the magic that may be wrought on a man through the leavings ofhis food has had the beneficial effect of inducing many savages to destroy refuse which, ifleft to rot, might through its corruption have proved a real, not a merely imaginary, sourceof disease and death. Nor is it only the sanitary condition of a tribe which has benefited bythis superstition; curiously enough the same baseless dread, the same false notion ofcausation, has indirectly strengthened the moral bonds of hospitality, honour, and goodfaith among men who entertain it. For it is obvious that no one who intends to harm a manby working magic on the refuse of his food will himself partake of that food, because if hedid so he would, on the principles of sympathetic magic, suffer equally with his enemy fromany injury done to the refuse. This is the idea which in primitive society lends sanctity tothe bond produced by eating together; by participation in the same food two men give, as itwere, hostages for their good behaviour; each guarantees the other that he will devise nomischief against him, since, being physically united with him by the common food in theirstomachs, any harm he might do to his fellow would recoil on his own head with preciselythe same force with which it fell on the head of his victim. In strict logic, however, thesympathetic bond lasts only so long as the food is in the stomach of each of the parties.Hence the covenant formed by eating together is less solemn and durable than the covenantformed by transfusing the blood of the covenanting parties into each other’s veins, for thistransfusion seems to knit them together for life.XX. Tabooed Persons1. Chiefs and Kings tabooedWE have seen that the Mikado’s food was cooked every day in new pots and served up innew dishes; both pots and dishes were of common clay, in order that they might be brokenor laid aside after they had been once used. They were generally broken, for it was believedthat if any one else ate his food out of these sacred dishes, his mouth and throat wouldbecome swollen and inflamed. The same ill effect was thought to be experienced by any onewho should wear the Mikado’s clothes without his leave; he would have swellings and painsall over his body. In Fiji there is a special name (kana lama) for the disease supposed to becaused by eating out of a chief’s dishes or wearing his clothes. “The throat and body swell,and the impious person dies. I had a fine mat given to me by a man who durst not use itbecause Thakombau’s eldest son had sat upon it. There was always a family or clan ofcommoners who were exempt from this danger. I was talking about this once to"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Thakombau. ‘Oh yes,’ said he. ‘Here, So-and-so! come and scratch my back.’ The manscratched; he was one of those who could do it with impunity.” The name of the men thushighly privileged was Na nduka ni, or the dirt of the chief.In the evil effects thus supposed to follow upon the use of the vessels or clothes of theMikado and a Fijian chief we see that other side of the god-man’s character to whichattention has been already called. The divine person is a source of danger as well as ofblessing; he must not only be guarded, he must also be guarded against. His sacredorganism, so delicate that a touch may disorder it, is also, as it were, electrically chargedwith a powerful magical or spiritual force which may discharge itself with fatal effect onwhatever comes in contact with it. Accordingly the isolation of the man-god is quite asnecessary for the safety of others as for his own. His magical virtue is in the strictest senseof the word contagious: his divinity is a fire, which, under proper restraints, confersendless blessings, but, if rashly touched or allowed to break bounds, burns and destroyswhat it touches. Hence the disastrous effects supposed to attend a breach of taboo; theoffender has thrust his hand into the divine fire, which shrivels up and consumes him onthe spot.The Nubas, for example, who inhabit the wooded and fertile range of Jebel Nuba inEastern Africa, believe that they would die if they entered the house of their priestly king;however, they can evade the penalty of their intrusion by baring the left shoulder andgetting the king to lay his hand on it. And were any man to sit on a stone which the kinghas consecrated to his own use, the transgressor would die within the year. The Cazembesof Angola regard their king as so holy that no one can touch him without being killed bythe magical power which pervades his sacred person. But since contact with him issometimes unavoidable, they have devised a means whereby the sinner can escape with hislife. Kneeling down before the king he touches the back of the royal hand with the back ofhis own, then snaps his fingers; afterwards he lays the palm of his hand on the palm of theking’s hand, then snaps his fingers again. This ceremony is repeated four or five times, andaverts the imminent danger of death. In Tonga it was believed that if any one fed himselfwith his own hands after touching the sacred person of a superior chief or anything thatbelonged to him, he would swell up and die; the sanctity of the chief, like a virulent poison,infected the hands of his inferior, and, being communicated through them to the food,proved fatal to the eater. A commoner who had incurred this danger could disinfecthimself by performing a certain ceremony, which consisted in touching the sole of a chief’sfoot with the palm and back of each of his hands, and afterwards rinsing his hands inwater. If there was no water near, he rubbed his hands with the juicy stem of a plantain orbanana. After that he was free to feed himself with his own hands without danger of beingattacked by the malady which would otherwise follow from eating with tabooed orsanctified hands. But until the ceremony of expiation or disinfection had been performed, ifhe wished to eat he had either to get some one to feed him, or else to go down on his kneesand pick up the food from the ground with his mouth like a beast. He might not even use atoothpick himself, but might guide the hand of another person holding the toothpick. TheTongans were subject to induration of the liver and certain forms of scrofula, which theyoften attributed to a failure to perform the requisite expiation after having inadvertentlytouched a chief or his belongings. Hence they often went through the ceremony as aprecaution, without knowing that they had done anything to call for it. The king of Tonga"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"could not refuse to play his part in the rite by presenting his foot to such as desired to touchit, even when they applied to him at an inconvenient time. A fat unwieldy king, whoperceived his subjects approaching with this intention, while he chanced to be taking hiswalks abroad, has been sometimes seen to waddle as fast as his legs could carry him out oftheir way, in order to escape the importunate and not wholly disinterested expression oftheir homage. If any one fancied he might have already unwittingly eaten with tabooedhands, he sat down before the chief, and, taking the chief’s foot, pressed it against his ownstomach, that the food in his belly might not injure him, and that he might not swell up anddie. Since scrofula was regarded by the Tongans as a result of eating with tabooed hands,we may conjecture that persons who suffered from it among them often resorted to thetouch or pressure of the king’s foot as a cure for their malady. The analogy of the customwith the old English practice of bringing scrofulous patients to the king to be healed by histouch is sufficiently obvious, and suggests, as I have already pointed out elsewhere, thatamong our own remote ancestors scrofula may have obtained its name of the King’s Evil,from a belief, like that of the Tongans, that it was caused as well as cured by contact withthe divine majesty of kings.In New Zealand the dread of the sanctity of chiefs was at least as great as in Tonga. Theirghostly power, derived from an ancestral spirit, diffused itself by contagion over everythingthey touched, and could strike dead all who rashly or unwittingly meddled with it. Forinstance, it once happened that a New Zealand chief of high rank and great sanctity hadleft the remains of his dinner by the wayside. A slave, a stout, hungry fellow, coming upafter the chief had gone, saw the unfinished dinner, and ate it up without asking questions.Hardly had he finished when he was informed by a horror-stricken spectator that the foodof which he had eaten was the chief’s. “I knew the unfortunate delinquent well. He wasremarkable for courage, and had signalised himself in the wars of the tribe,” but “nosooner did he hear the fatal news than he was seized by the most extraordinary convulsionsand cramp in the stomach, which never ceased till he died, about sundown the same day.He was a strong man, in the prime of life, and if any pakeha [European] freethinker shouldhave said he was not killed by the tapu of the chief, which had been communicated to thefood by contact, he would have been listened to with feelings of contempt for his ignoranceand inability to understand plain and direct evidence.” This is not a solitary case. A Maoriwoman having eaten of some fruit, and being afterwards told that the fruit had been takenfrom a tabooed place, exclaimed that the spirit of the chief, whose sanctity had been thusprofaned, would kill her. This was in the afternoon, and next day by twelve o’clock she wasdead. A Maori chief’s tinder-box was once the means of killing several persons; for, havingbeen lost by him, and found by some men who used it to light their pipes, they died of frighton learning to whom it had belonged. So, too, the garments of a high New Zealand chiefwill kill any one else who wears them. A chief was observed by a missionary to throw downa precipice a blanket which he found too heavy to carry. Being asked by the missionarywhy he did not leave it on a tree for the use of a future traveller, the chief replied that “itwas the fear of its being taken by another which caused him to throw it where he did, for ifit were worn, his tapu” (that is, his spiritual power communicated by contact to the blanketand through the blanket to the man) “would kill the person.” For a similar reason a Maorichief would not blow a fire with his mouth; for his sacred breath would communicate itssanctity to the fire, which would pass it on to the pot on the fire, which would pass it on tothe meat in the pot, which would pass it on to the man who ate the meat, which was in the"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"pot, which stood on the fire, which was breathed on by the chief; so that the eater, infectedby the chief’s breath conveyed through these intermediaries, would surely die.Thus in the Polynesian race, to which the Maoris belong, superstition erected round thepersons of sacred chiefs a real, though at the same time purely imaginary barrier, totransgress which actually entailed the death of the transgressor whenever he became awareof what he had done. This fatal power of the imagination working through superstitiousterrors is by no means confined to one race; it appears to be common among savages. Forexample, among the aborigines of Australia a native will die after the infliction of even themost superficial wound, if only he believes that the weapon which inflicted the wound hadbeen sung over and thus endowed with magical virtue. He simply lies down, refuses food,and pines away. Similarly among some of the Indian tribes of Brazil, if the medicine-manpredicted the death of any one who had offended him, “the wretch took to his hammockinstantly in such full expectation of dying, that he would neither eat nor drink, and theprediction was a sentence which faith effectually executed.”2. Mourners tabooedTHUS regarding his sacred chiefs and kings as charged with a mysterious spiritual forcewhich so to say explodes at contact, the savage naturally ranks them among the dangerousclasses of society, and imposes upon them the same sort of restraints that he lays onmanslayers, menstruous women, and other persons whom he looks upon with a certain fearand horror. For example, sacred kings and priests in Polynesia were not allowed to touchfood with their hands, and had therefore to be fed by others; and as we have just seen, theirvessels, garments, and other property might not be used by others on pain of disease anddeath. Now precisely the same observances are exacted by some savages from girls at theirfirst menstruation, women after childbirth, homicides, mourners, and all persons who havecome into contact with the dead. Thus, for example, to begin with the last class of persons,among the Maoris any one who had handled a corpse, helped to convey it to the grave, ortouched a dead man’s bones, was cut off from all intercourse and almost all communicationwith mankind. He could not enter any house, or come into contact with any person orthing, without utterly bedevilling them. He might not even touch food with his hands,which had become so frightfully tabooed or unclean as to be quite useless. Food would beset for him on the ground, and he would then sit or kneel down, and, with his handscarefully held behind his back, would gnaw at it as best he could. In some cases he wouldbe fed by another person, who with outstretched arm contrived to do it without touchingthe tabooed man; but the feeder was himself subjected to many severe restrictions, littleless onerous than those which were imposed upon the other. In almost every populousvillage there lived a degraded wretch, the lowest of the low, who earned a sorry pittance bythus waiting upon the defiled. Clad in rags, daubed from head to foot with red ochre andstinking shark oil, always solitary and silent, generally old, haggard, and wizened, oftenhalf crazed, he might be seen sitting motionless all day apart from the common path orthoroughfare of the village, gazing with lack-lustre eyes on the busy doings in which hemight never take a part. Twice a day a dole of food would be thrown on the ground beforehim to munch as well as he could without the use of his hands; and at night, huddling hisgreasy tatters about him, he would crawl into some miserable lair of leaves and refuse,"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"where, dirty, cold, and hungry, he passed, in broken ghost-haunted slumbers, a wretchednight as a prelude to another wretched day. Such was the only human being deemed fit toassociate at arm’s length with one who had paid the last offices of respect and friendship tothe dead. And when, the dismal term of his seclusion being over, the mourner was about tomix with his fellows once more, all the dishes he had used in his seclusion were diligentlysmashed, and all the garments he had worn were carefully thrown away, lest they shouldspread the contagion of his defilement among others, just as the vessels and clothes ofsacred kings and chiefs are destroyed or cast away for a similar reason. So complete inthese respects is the analogy which the savage traces between the spiritual influences thatemanate from divinities and from the dead, between the odour of sanctity and the stench ofcorruption.The rule which forbids persons who have been in contact with the dead to touch food withtheir hands would seem to have been universal in Polynesia. Thus in Samoa “those whoattended the deceased were most careful not to handle food, and for days were fed byothers as if they were helpless infants. Baldness and the loss of teeth were supposed to bethe punishment inflicted by the household god if they violated the rule.” Again, in Tonga,“no person can touch a dead chief without being taboo’d for ten lunar months, exceptchiefs, who are only taboo’d for three, four, or five months, according to the superiority ofthe dead chief; except again it be the body of Tooitonga [the great divine chief], and theneven the greatest chief would be taboo’d ten months... . During the time a man is taboo’dhe must not feed himself with his own hands, but must be fed by somebody else: he mustnot even use a toothpick himself, but must guide another person’s hand holding thetoothpick. If he is hungry and there is no one to feed him, he must go down upon his handsand knees, and pick up his victuals with his mouth: and if he infringes upon any of theserules, it is firmly expected that he will swell up and die.”Among the Shuswap of British Columbia widows and widowers in mourning are secludedand forbidden to touch their own head or body; the cups and cooking-vessels which theyuse may be used by no one else. They must build a sweat-house beside a creek, sweat thereall night and bathe regularly, after which they must rub their bodies with branches ofspruce. The branches may not be used more than once, and when they have served theirpurpose they are stuck into the ground all round the hut. No hunter would come near suchmourners, for their presence is unlucky. If their shadow were to fall on any one, he wouldbe taken ill at once. They employ thorn bushes for bed and pillow, in order to keep awaythe ghost of the deceased; and thorn bushes are also laid all around their beds. This lastprecaution shows clearly what the spiritual danger is which leads to the exclusion of suchpersons from ordinary society; it is simply a fear of the ghost who is supposed to behovering near them. In the Mekeo district of British New Guinea a widower loses all hiscivil rights and becomes a social outcast, an object of fear and horror, shunned by all. Hemay not cultivate a garden, nor show himself in public, nor traverse the village, nor walkon the roads and paths. Like a wild beast he must skulk in the long grass and the bushes;and if he sees or hears any one coming, especially a woman, he must hide behind a tree or athicket. If he wishes to fish or hunt, he must do it alone and at night. If he would consultany one, even the missionary, he does so by stealth and at night; he seems to have lost hisvoice and speaks only in whispers. Were he to join a party of fishers or hunters, hispresence would bring misfortune on them; the ghost of his dead wife would frighten away"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"the fish or the game. He goes about everywhere and at all times armed with a tomahawk todefend himself, not only against wild boars in the jungle, but against the dreaded spirit ofhis departed spouse, who would do him an ill turn if she could; for all the souls of the deadare malignant and their only delight is to harm the living.3. Women tabooed at Menstruation and ChildbirthIN GENERAL, we may say that the prohibition to use the vessels, garments, and so forth ofcertain persons, and the effects supposed to follow an infraction of the rule, are exactly thesame whether the persons to whom the things belong are sacred or what we might callunclean and polluted. As the garments which have been touched by a sacred chief kill thosewho handle them, so do the things which have been touched by a menstruous women. AnAustralian blackfellow, who discovered that his wife had lain on his blanket at hermenstrual period, killed her and died of terror himself within a fortnight. Hence Australianwomen at these times are forbidden under pain of death to touch anything that men use, oreven to walk on a path that any man frequents. They are also secluded at childbirth, and allvessels used by them during their seclusion are burned. In Uganda the pots which a womantouches, while the impurity of childbirth or of menstruation is on her, should be destroyed;spears and shields defiled by her touch are not destroyed, but only purified. “Among all theDéné and most other American tribes, hardly any other being was the object of so muchdread as a menstruating woman. As soon as signs of that condition made themselvesapparent in a young girl she was carefully segregated from all but female company, andhad to live by herself in a small hut away from the gaze of the villagers or of the malemembers of the roving band. While in that awful state, she had to abstain from touchinganything belonging to man, or the spoils of any venison or other animal, lest she wouldthereby pollute the same, and condemn the hunters to failure, owing to the anger of thegame thus slighted. Dried fish formed her diet, and cold water, absorbed through adrinking tube, was her only beverage. Moreover, as the very sight of her was dangerous tosociety, a special skin bonnet, with fringes falling over her face down to her breast, hid herfrom the public gaze, even some time after she had recovered her normal state.” Amongthe Bribri Indians of Costa Rica a menstruous woman is regarded as unclean. The onlyplates she may use for her food are banana leaves, which, when she has done with them,she throws away in some sequestered spot; for were a cow to find them and eat them, theanimal would waste away and perish. And she drinks out of a special vessel for a likereason; because if any one drank out of the same cup after her, he would surely die.Among many peoples similar restrictions are imposed on women in childbed andapparently for similar reasons; at such periods women are supposed to be in a dangerouscondition which would infect any person or thing they might touch; hence they are put intoquarantine until, with the recovery of their health and strength, the imaginary danger haspassed away. Thus, in Tahiti a woman after childbirth was secluded for a fortnight or threeweeks in a temporary hut erected on sacred ground; during the time of her seclusion shewas debarred from touching provisions, and had to be fed by another. Further, if any oneelse touched the child at this period, he was subjected to the same restrictions as the motheruntil the ceremony of her purification had been performed. Similarly in the island ofKadiak, off Alaska, a woman about to be delivered retires to a miserable low hovel built of"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"reeds, where she must remain for twenty days after the birth of her child, whatever theseason may be, and she is considered so unclean that no one will touch her, and food isreached to her on sticks. The Bribri Indians regard the pollution of childbed as much moredangerous even than that of menstruation. When a woman feels her time approaching, sheinforms her husband, who makes haste to build a hut for her in a lonely spot. There shemust live alone, holding no converse with anybody save her mother or another woman.After her delivery the medicine-man purifies her by breathing on her and laying an animal,it matters not what, upon her. But even this ceremony only mitigates her uncleanness into astate considered to be equivalent to that of a menstruous woman; and for a full lunarmonth she must live apart from her housemates, observing the same rules with regard toeating and drinking as at her monthly periods. The case is still worse, the pollution is stillmore deadly, if she has had a miscarriage or has been delivered of a stillborn child. In thatcase she may not go near a living soul: the mere contact with things she has used isexceedingly dangerous: her food is handed to her at the end of a long stick. This lastsgenerally for three weeks, after which she may go home, subject only to the restrictionsincident to an ordinary confinement.Some Bantu tribes entertain even more exaggerated notions of the virulent infection spreadby a woman who has had a miscarriage and has concealed it. An experienced observer ofthese people tells us that the blood of childbirth “appears to the eyes of the South Africansto be tainted with a pollution still more dangerous than that of the menstrual fluid. Thehusband is excluded from the hut for eight days of the lying-in period, chiefly from fearthat he might be contaminated by this secretion. He dare not take his child in his arms forthe three first months after the birth. But the secretion of childbed is particularly terriblewhen it is the product of a miscarriage, especially a concealed miscarriage. In this case it isnot merely the man who is threatened or killed, it is the whole country, it is the sky itselfwhich suffers. By a curious association of ideas a physiological fact causes cosmictroubles!” As for the disastrous effect which a miscarriage may have on the whole countryI will quote the words of a medicine-man and rain-maker of the Ba-Pedi tribe: “When awoman has had a miscarriage, when she has allowed her blood to flow, and has hidden thechild, it is enough to cause the burning winds to blow and to parch the country with heat.The rain no longer falls, for the country is no longer in order. When the rain approachesthe place where the blood is, it will not dare to approach. It will fear and remain at adistance. That woman has committed a great fault. She has spoiled the country of the chief,for she has hidden blood which had not yet been well congealed to fashion a man. Thatblood is taboo. It should never drip on the road! The chief will assemble his men and say tothem, ‘Are you in order in your villages?’ Some one will answer, ‘Such and such a womanwas pregnant and we have not yet seen the child which she has given birth to.’ Then theygo and arrest the woman. They say to her, ‘Show us where you have hidden it.’ They goand dig at the spot, they sprinkle the hole with a decoction of two sorts of roots prepared ina special pot. They take a little of the earth of this grave, they throw it into the river, thenthey bring back water from the river and sprinkle it where she shed her blood. She herselfmust wash every day with the medicine. Then the country will be moistened again (byrain). Further, we (medicine-men), summon the women of the country; we tell them toprepare a ball of the earth which contains the blood. They bring it to us one morning. If wewish to prepare medicine with which to sprinkle the whole country, we crumble this earthto powder; at the end of five days we send little boys and little girls, girls that yet know"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"nothing of women’s affairs and have not yet had relations with men. We put the medicinein the horns of oxen, and these children go to all the fords, to all the entrances of thecountry. A little girl turns up the soil with her mattock, the others dip a branch in the hornand sprinkle the inside of the hole saying, ‘Rain! rain!’ So we remove the misfortune whichthe women have brought on the roads; the rain will be able to come. The country ispurified!4. Warriors tabooedONCE more, warriors are conceived by the savage to move, so to say, in an atmosphere ofspiritual danger which constrains them to practise a variety of superstitious observancesquite different in their nature from those rational precautions which, as a matter of course,they adopt against foes of flesh and blood. The general effect of these observances is toplace the warrior, both before and after victory, in the same state of seclusion or spiritualquarantine in which, for his own safety, primitive man puts his human gods and otherdangerous characters. Thus when the Maoris went out on the war-path they were sacred ortaboo in the highest degree, and they and their friends at home had to observe strictlymany curious customs over and above the numerous taboos of ordinary life. They became,in the irreverent language of Europeans who knew them in the old fighting days, “tabooedan inch thick”; and as for the leader of the expedition, he was quite unapproachable.Similarly, when the Israelites marched forth to war they were bound by certain rules ofceremonial purity identical with rules observed by Maoris and Australian blackfellows onthe war-path. The vessels they used were sacred, and they had to practise continence and acustom of personal cleanliness of which the original motive, if we may judge from theavowed motive of savages who conform to the same custom, was a fear lest the enemyshould obtain the refuse of their persons, and thus be enabled to work their destruction bymagic. Among some Indian tribes of North America a young warrior in his first campaignhad to conform to certain customs, of which two were identical with the observancesimposed by the same Indians on girls at their first menstruation: the vessels he ate anddrank out of might be touched by no other person, and he was forbidden to scratch hishead or any other part of his body with his fingers; if he could not help scratching himself,he had to do it with a stick. The latter rule, like the one which forbids a tabooed person tofeed himself with his own fingers, seems to rest on the supposed sanctity or pollution,whichever we choose to call it, of the tabooed hands. Moreover among these Indian tribesthe men on the war-path had always to sleep at night with their faces turned towards theirown country; however uneasy the posture, they might not change it. They might not situpon the bare ground, nor wet their feet, nor walk on a beaten path if they could help it;when they had no choice but to walk on a path, they sought to counteract the ill effect ofdoing so by doctoring their legs with certain medicines or charms which they carried withthem for the purpose. No member of the party was permitted to step over the legs, hands,or body of any other member who chanced to be sitting or lying on the ground; and it wasequally forbidden to step over his blanket, gun, tomahawk, or anything that belonged tohim. If this rule was inadvertently broken, it became the duty of the member whose personor property had been stepped over to knock the other member down, and it was similarlythe duty of that other to be knocked down peaceably and without resistance. The vessels"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"out of which the warriors ate their food were commonly small bowls of wood or birch bark,with marks to distinguish the two sides; in marching from home the Indians invariablydrank out of one side of the bowl, and in returning they drank out of the other. When ontheir way home they came within a day’s march of the village, they hung up all their bowlson trees, or threw them away on the prairie, doubtless to prevent their sanctity ordefilement from being communicated with disastrous effects to their friends, just as wehave seen that the vessels and clothes of the sacred Mikado, of women at childbirth andmenstruation, and of persons defiled by contact with the dead are destroyed or laid asidefor a similar reason. The first four times that an Apache Indian goes out on the war-path,he is bound to refrain from scratching his head with his fingers and from letting watertouch his lips. Hence he scratches his head with a stick, and drinks through a hollow reedor cane. Stick and reed are attached to the warrior’s belt and to each other by a leathernthong. The rule not to scratch their heads with their fingers, but to use a stick for thepurpose instead, was regularly observed by Ojebways on the war-path.With regard to the Creek Indians and kindred tribes we are told they “will not cohabitwith women while they are out at war; they religiously abstain from every kind ofintercourse even with their own wives, for the space of three days and nights before they goto war, and so after they return home, because they are to sanctify themselves.” Among theBa-Pedi and Ba-Thonga tribes of South Africa not only have the warriors to abstain fromwomen, but the people left behind in the villages are also bound to continence; they thinkthat any incontinence on their part would cause thorns to grow on the ground traversed bythe warriors, and that success would not attend the expedition.Why exactly many savages have made it a rule to refrain from women in time of war, wecannot say for certain, but we may conjecture that their motive was a superstitious fearlest, on the principles of sympathetic magic, close contact with women should infect themwith feminine weakness and cowardice. Similarly some savages imagine that contact with awoman in childbed enervates warriors and enfeebles their weapons. Indeed the Kayans ofCentral Borneo go so far as to hold that to touch a loom or women’s clothes would soweaken a man that he would have no success in hunting, fishing, and war. Hence it is notmerely sexual intercourse with women that the savage warrior sometimes shuns; he iscareful to avoid the sex altogether. Thus among the hill tribes of Assam, not only are menforbidden to cohabit with their wives during or after a raid, but they may not eat foodcooked by a woman; nay, they should not address a word even to their own wives. Once awoman, who unwittingly broke the rule by speaking to her husband while he was under thewar taboo, sickened and died when she learned the awful crime she had committed.5. Manslayers tabooedIF THE READER still doubts whether the rules of conduct which we have just beenconsidering are based on superstitious fears or dictated by a rational prudence, his doubtswill probably be dissipated when he learns that rules of the same sort are often imposedeven more stringently on warriors after the victory has been won and when all fear of theliving corporeal foe is at an end. In such cases one motive for the inconvenient restrictionslaid on the victors in their hour of triumph is probably a dread of the angry ghosts of the"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"slain; and that the fear of the vengeful ghosts does influence the behaviour of the slayers isoften expressly affirmed. The general effect of the taboos laid on sacred chiefs, mourners,women at childbirth, men on the war-path, and so on, is to seclude or isolate the tabooedpersons from ordinary society, this effect being attained by a variety of rules, which obligethe men or women to live in separate huts or in the open air, to shun the commerce of thesexes, to avoid the use of vessels employed by others, and so forth. Now the same effect isproduced by similar means in the case of victorious warriors, particularly such as haveactually shed the blood of their enemies. In the island of Timor, when a warlike expeditionhas returned in triumph bringing the heads of the vanquished foe, the leader of theexpedition is forbidden by religion and custom to return at once to his own house. A specialhut is prepared for him, in which he has to reside for two months, undergoing bodily andspiritual purification. During this time he may not go to his wife nor feed himself; the foodmust be put into his mouth by another person. That these observances are dictated by fearof the ghosts of the slain seems certain; for from another account of the ceremoniesperformed on the return of a successful head-hunter in the same island we learn thatsacrifices are offered on this occasion to appease the soul of the man whose head has beentaken; the people think that some misfortune would befall the victor were such offeringsomitted. Moreover, a part of the ceremony consists of a dance accompanied by a song, inwhich the death of the slain man is lamented and his forgiveness is entreated. “Be notangry,” they say, “because your head is here with us; had we been less lucky, our headsmight now have been exposed in your village. We have offered the sacrifice to appease you.Your spirit may now rest and leave us at peace. Why were you our enemy? Would it nothave been better that we should remain friends? Then your blood would not have beenspilt and your head would not have been cut off.” The people of Paloo in Central Celebestake the heads of their enemies in war and afterwards propitiate the souls of the slain in thetemple.Among the tribes at the mouth of the Wanigela River, in New Guinea, “a man who hastaken life is considered to be impure until he has undergone certain ceremonies: as soon aspossible after the deed he cleanses himself and his weapon. This satisfactorilyaccomplished, he repairs to his village and seats himself on the logs of sacrificial staging.No one approaches him or takes any notice whatever of him. A house is prepared for himwhich is put in charge of two or three small boys as servants. He may eat only toastedbananas, and only the centre portion of them—the ends being thrown away. On the thirdday of his seclusion a small feast is prepared by his friends, who also fashion some newperineal bands for him. This is called ivi poro. The next day the man dons all his bestornaments and badges for taking life, and sallies forth fully armed and parades the village.The next day a hunt is organised, and a kangaroo selected from the game captured. It is cutopen and the spleen and liver rubbed over the back of the man. He then walks solemnlydown to the nearest water, and standing straddle-legs in it washes himself. All the younguntried warriors swim between his legs. This is supposed to impart courage and strength tothem. The following day, at early dawn, he dashes out of his house, fully armed, and callsaloud the name of his victim. Having satisfied himself that he has thoroughly scared theghost of the dead man, he returns to his house. The beating of flooring-boards and thelighting of fires is also a certain method of scaring the ghost. A day later his purification isfinished. He can then enter his wife’s house.”"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"In Windessi, Dutch New Guinea, when a party of head-hunters has been successful, andthey are nearing home, they announce their approach and success by blowing on tritonshells. Their canoes are also decked with branches. The faces of the men who have taken ahead are blackened with charcoal. If several have taken part in killing the same victim, hishead is divided among them. They always time their arrival so as to reach home in theearly morning. They come rowing to the village with a great noise, and the women standready to dance in the verandahs of the houses. The canoes row past the room sram or housewhere the young men live; and as they pass, the murderers throw as many pointed sticks orbamboos at the wall or the roof as there were enemies killed. The day is spent very quietly.Now and then they drum or blow on the conch; at other times they beat the walls of thehouses with loud shouts to drive away the ghosts of the slain. So the Yabim of New Guineabelieve that the spirit of a murdered man pursues his murderer and seeks to do him amischief. Hence they drive away the spirit with shouts and the beating of drums. When theFijians had buried a man alive, as they often did, they used at nightfall to make a greatuproar by means of bamboos, trumpet-shells, and so forth, for the purpose of frighteningaway his ghost, lest he should attempt to return to his old home. And to render his houseunattractive to him they dismantled it and clothed it with everything that to their ideasseemed most repulsive. On the evening of the day on which they had tortured a prisoner todeath, the American Indians were wont to run through the village with hideous yells,beating with sticks on the furniture, the walls, and the roofs of the huts to prevent theangry ghost of their victim from settling there and taking vengeance for the torments thathis body had endured at their hands. “Once,” says a traveller, “on approaching in the nighta village of Ottawas, I found all the inhabitants in confusion: they were all busily engagedin raising noises of the loudest and most inharmonious kind. Upon inquiry, I found that abattle had been lately fought between the Ottawas and the Kickapoos, and that the objectof all this noise was to prevent the ghosts of the departed combatants from entering thevillage.”Among the Basutos “ablution is specially performed on return from battle. It is absolutelynecessary that the warriors should rid themselves, as soon as possible, of the blood theyhave shed, or the shades of their victims would pursue them incessantly, and disturb theirslumbers. They go in a procession, and in full armour, to the nearest stream. At themoment they enter the water a diviner, placed higher up, throws some purifying substancesinto the current. This is, however, not strictly necessary. The javelins and battle-axes alsoundergo the process of washing.” Among the Bageshu of East Africa a man who has killedanother may not return to his own house on the same day, though he may enter the villageand spend the night in a friend’s house. He kills a sheep and smears his chest, his rightarm, and his head with the contents of the animal’s stomach. His children are brought tohim and he smears them in like manner. Then he smears each side of the doorway with thetripe and entrails, and finally throws the rest of the stomach on the roof of his house. For awhole day he may not touch food with his hands, but picks it up with two sticks and soconveys it to his mouth. His wife is not under any such restrictions. She may even go tomourn for the man whom her husband has killed, if she wishes to do so. Among theAngoni, to the north of the Zambesi, warriors who have slain foes on an expedition smeartheir bodies and faces with ashes, hang garments of their victims on their persons, and tiebark ropes round their necks, so that the ends hang down over their shoulders or breasts.This costume they wear for three days after their return, and rising at break of day they"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"run through the village uttering frightful yells to drive away the ghosts of the slain, which,if they were not thus banished from the houses, might bring sickness and misfortune on theinmates.In some of these accounts nothing is said of an enforced seclusion, at least after theceremonial cleansing, but some South African tribes certainly require the slayer of a verygallant foe in war to keep apart from his wife and family for ten days after he has washedhis body in running water. He also receives from the tribal doctor a medicine which hechews with his food. When a Nandi of East Africa has killed a member of another tribe, hepaints one side of his body, spear, and sword red, and the other side white. For four daysafter the slaughter he is considered unclean and may not go home. He has to build a smallshelter by a river and live there; he may not associate with his wife or sweetheart, and hemay eat nothing but porridge, beef, and goat’s flesh. At the end of the fourth day he mustpurify himself by taking a strong purge made from the bark of the segetet tree and bydrinking goat’s milk mixed with blood. Among the Bantu tribes of Kavirondo, when a manhas killed an enemy in warfare he shaves his head on his return home, and his friends rub amedicine, which generally consists of goat’s dung, over his body to prevent the spirit of theslain man from troubling him. Exactly the same custom is practised for the same reason bythe Wageia of East Africa. With the Ja-Luo of Kavirondo the custom is somewhatdifferent. Three days after his return from the fight the warrior shaves his head. But beforehe may enter his village he has to hang a live fowl, head uppermost, round his neck; thenthe bird is decapitated and its head left hanging round his neck. Soon after his return afeast is made for the slain man, in order that his ghost may not haunt his slayer. In thePelew Islands, when the men return from a warlike expedition in which they have taken alife, the young warriors who have been out fighting for the first time, and all who handledthe slain, are shut up in the large council-house and become tabooed. They may not quitthe edifice, nor bathe, nor touch a woman, nor eat fish; their food is limited to coco-nutsand syrup. They rub themselves with charmed leaves and chew charmed betel. After threedays they go together to bathe as near as possible to the spot where the man was killed.Among the Natchez Indians of North America young braves who had taken their firstscalps were obliged to observe certain rules of abstinence for six months. They might notsleep with their wives nor eat flesh; their only food was fish and hasty-pudding. If theybroke these rules, they believed that the soul of the man they had killed would work theirdeath by magic, that they would gain no more successes over the enemy, and that the leastwound inflicted on them would prove mortal. When a Choctaw had killed an enemy andtaken his scalp, he went into mourning for a month, during which he might not comb hishair, and if his head itched he might not scratch it except with a little stick which he worefastened to his wrist for the purpose. This ceremonial mourning for the enemies they hadslain was not uncommon among the North American Indians.Thus we see that warriors who have taken the life of a foe in battle are temporarily cut offfrom free intercourse with their fellows, and especially with their wives, and must undergocertain rites of purification before they are readmitted to society. Now if the purpose oftheir seclusion and of the expiatory rites which they have to perform is, as we have been ledto believe, no other than to shake off, frighten, or appease the angry spirit of the slain man,we may safely conjecture that the similar purification of homicides and murderers, who"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"have imbrued their hands in the blood of a fellow-tribesman, had at first the samesignificance, and that the idea of a moral or spiritual regeneration symbolised by thewashing, the fasting, and so on, was merely a later interpretation put upon the old customby men who had outgrown the primitive modes of thought in which the custom originated.The conjecture will be confirmed if we can show that savages have actually imposed certainrestrictions on the murderer of a fellow-tribesman from a definite fear that he is hauntedby the ghost of his victim. This we can do with regard to the Omahas of North America.Among these Indians the kinsmen of a murdered man had the right to put the murderer todeath, but sometimes they waived their right in consideration of presents which theyconsented to accept. When the life of the murderer was spared, he had to observe certainstringent rules for a period which varied from two to four years. He must walk barefoot,and he might eat no warm food, nor raise his voice, nor look around. He was compelled topull his robe about him and to have it tied at the neck even in hot weather; he might not letit hang loose or fly open. He might not move his hands about, but had to keep them close tohis body. He might not comb his hair, and it might not be blown about by the wind. Whenthe tribe went out hunting, he was obliged to pitch his tent about a quarter of mile from therest of the people “lest the ghost of his victim should raise a high wind, which might causedamage.” Only one of his kindred was allowed to remain with him at his tent. No onewished to eat with him, for they said, “If we eat with him whom Wakanda hates, Wakandawill hate us.” Sometimes he wandered at night crying and lamenting his offence. At the endof his long isolation the kinsmen of the murdered man heard his crying and said, “It isenough. Begone, and walk among the crowd. Put on moccasins and wear a good robe.”Here the reason alleged for keeping the murderer at a considerable distance from thehunters gives the clue to all the other restrictions laid on him: he was haunted andtherefore dangerous. The ancient Greeks believed that the soul of a man who had just beenkilled was wroth with his slayer and troubled him; wherefore it was needful even for theinvoluntary homicide to depart from his country for a year until the anger of the dead manhad cooled down; nor might the slayer return until sacrifice had been offered andceremonies of purification performed. If his victim chanced to be a foreigner, the homicidehad to shun the native country of the dead man as well as his own. The legend of thematricide Orestes, how he roamed from place to place pursued by the Furies of hismurdered mother, and none would sit at meat with him, or take him in, till he had beenpurified, reflects faithfully the real Greek dread of such as were still haunted by an angryghost.6. Hunters and Fishers tabooedIN SAVAGE society the hunter and the fisherman have often to observe rules of abstinenceand to submit to ceremonies of purification of the same sort as those which are obligatoryon the warrior and the manslayer; and though we cannot in all cases perceive the exactpurpose which these rules and ceremonies are supposed to serve, we may with someprobability assume that, just as the dread of the spirits of his enemies is the main motivefor the seclusion and purification of the warrior who hopes to take or has already takentheir lives, so the huntsman or fisherman who complies with similar customs is principallyactuated by a fear of the spirits of the beasts, birds, or fish which he has killed or intends to"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"kill. For the savage commonly conceives animals to be endowed with souls and intelligenceslike his own, and hence he naturally treats them with similar respect. Just as he attempts toappease the ghosts of the men he has slain, so he essays to propitiate the spirits of theanimals he has killed. These ceremonies of propitiation will be described later on in thiswork; here we have to deal, first, with the taboos observed by the hunter and the fishermanbefore or during the hunting and fishing seasons, and, second, with the ceremonies ofpurification which have to be practised by these men on returning with their booty from asuccessful chase.While the savage respects, more or less, the souls of all animals, he treats with particulardeference the spirits of such as are either especially useful to him or formidable on accountof their size, strength, or ferocity. Accordingly the hunting and killing of these valuable ordangerous beasts are subject to more elaborate rules and ceremonies than the slaughter ofcomparatively useless and insignificant creatures. Thus the Indians of Nootka Soundprepared themselves for catching whales by observing a fast for a week, during which theyate very little, bathed in the water several times a day, sang, and rubbed their bodies,limbs, and faces with shells and bushes till they looked as if they had been severely tornwith briars. They were likewise required to abstain from any commerce with their womenfor the like period, this last condition being considered indispensable to their success. Achief who failed to catch a whale has been known to attribute his failure to a breach ofchastity on the part of his men. It should be remarked that the conduct thus prescribed as apreparation for whaling is precisely that which in the same tribe of Indians was required ofmen about to go on the war-path. Rules of the same sort are, or were formerly, observed byMalagasy whalers. For eight days before they went to sea the crew of a whaler used to fast,abstaining from women and liquor, and confessing their most secret faults to each other;and if any man was found to have sinned deeply, he was forbidden to share in theexpedition. In the island of Mabuiag continence was imposed on the people both beforethey went to hunt the dugong and while the turtles were pairing. The turtle-season lastsduring parts of October and November; and if at that time unmarried persons had sexualintercourse with each other, it was believed that when the canoe approached the floatingturtle, the male would separate from the female and both would dive down in differentdirections. So at Mowat in New Guinea men have no relation with women when the turtlesare coupling, though there is considerable laxity of morals at other times. In the island ofUap, one of the Caroline group, every fisherman plying his craft lies under a most stricttaboo during the whole of the fishing season, which lasts for six or eight weeks. Wheneverhe is on shore he must spend all his time in the men’s clubhouse, and under no pretextwhatever may he visit his own house or so much as look upon the faces of his wife andwomenkind. Were he but to steal a glance at them, they think that flying fish mustinevitably bore out his eyes at night. If his wife, mother, or daughter brings any gift for himor wishes to talk with him, she must stand down towards the shore with her back turned tothe men’s clubhouse. Then the fisherman may go out and speak to her, or with his backturned to her he may receive what she has brought him; after which he must return at onceto his rigorous confinement. Indeed the fishermen may not even join in dance and songwith the other men of the clubhouse in the evening; they must keep to themselves and besilent. In Mirzapur, when the seed of the silkworm is brought into the house, the Kol orBhuiyar puts it in a place which has been carefully plastered with holy cowdung to bringgood luck. From that time the owner must be careful to avoid ceremonial impurity. He"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"must give up cohabitation with his wife; he may not sleep on a bed, nor shave himself, norcut his nails, nor anoint himself with oil, nor eat food cooked with butter, nor tell lies, nordo anything else that he deems wrong. He vows to Singarmati Devi that, if the worms areduly born, he will make her an offering. When the cocoons open and the worms appear, heassembles the women of the house and they sing the same song as at the birth of a baby,and red lead is smeared on the parting of the hair of all the married women of theneighbourhood. When the worms pair, rejoicings are made as at a marriage. Thus thesilkworms are treated as far as possible like human beings. Hence the custom whichprohibits the commerce of the sexes while the worms are hatching may be only anextension, by analogy, of the rule which is observed by many races, that the husband maynot cohabit with his wife during pregnancy and lactation.In the island of Nias the hunters sometimes dig pits, cover them lightly over with twigs,grass, and leaves, and then drive the game into them. While they are engaged in digging thepits, they have to observe a number of taboos. They may not spit, or the game would turnback in disgust from the pits. They may not laugh, or the sides of the pit would fall in. Theymay eat no salt, prepare no fodder for swine, and in the pit they may not scratchthemselves, for if they did, the earth would be loosened and would collapse. And the nightafter digging the pit they may have no intercourse with a woman, or all their labour wouldbe in vain.This practice of observing strict chastity as a condition of success in hunting and fishing isvery common among rude races; and the instances of it which have been cited render itprobable that the rule is always based on a superstition rather than on a consideration ofthe temporary weakness which a breach of the custom may entail on the hunter orfisherman. In general it appears to be supposed that the evil effect of incontinence is not somuch that it weakens him, as that, for some reason or other, it offends the animals, who inconsequence will not suffer themselves to be caught. A Carrier Indian of British Columbiaused to separate from his wife for a full month before he set traps for bears, and duringthis time he might not drink from the same vessel as his wife, but had to use a special cupmade of birch bark. The neglect of these precautions would cause the game to escape afterit had been snared. But when he was about to snare martens, the period of continence wascut down to ten days.An examination of all the many cases in which the savage bridles his passions and remainschaste from motives of superstition, would be instructive, but I cannot attempt it now. I willonly add a few miscellaneous examples of the custom before passing to the ceremonies ofpurification which are observed by the hunter and fisherman after the chase and thefishing are over. The workers in the salt-pans near Siphoum, in Laos, must abstain from allsexual relations at the place where they are at work; and they may not cover their headsnor shelter themselves under an umbrella from the burning rays of the sun. Among theKachins of Burma the ferment used in making beer is prepared by two women, chosen bylot, who during the three days that the process lasts may eat nothing acid and may have noconjugal relations with their husbands; otherwise it is supposed that the beer would besour. Among the Masai honey-wine is brewed by a man and a woman who live in a hut setapart for them till the wine is ready for drinking. But they are strictly forbidden to havesexual intercourse with each other during this time; it is deemed essential that they should"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"be chaste for two days before they begin to brew and for the whole of the six days that thebrewing lasts. The Masai believe that were the couple to commit a breach of chastity, notonly would the wine be undrinkable but the bees which made the honey would fly away.Similarly they require that a man who is making poison should sleep alone and observeother taboos which render him almost an outcast. The Wandorobbo, a tribe of the sameregion as the Masai, believe that the mere presence of a woman in the neighbourhood of aman who is brewing poison would deprive the poison of its venom, and that the same thingwould happen if the wife of the poison-maker were to commit adultery while her husbandwas brewing the poison. In this last case it is obvious that a rationalistic explanation of thetaboo is impossible. How could the loss of virtue in the poison be a physical consequence ofthe loss of virtue in the poison-maker’s wife? Clearly the effect which the wife’s adultery issupposed to have on the poison is a case of sympathetic magic; her misconductsympathetically affects her husband and his work at a distance. We may, accordingly, inferwith some confidence that the rule of continence imposed on the poison-maker himself isalso a simple case of sympathetic magic, and not, as a civilised reader might be disposed toconjecture, a wise precaution designed to prevent him from accidentally poisoning his wife.Among the Ba-Pedi and Ba-Thonga tribes of South Africa, when the site of a new villagehas been chosen and the houses are building, all the married people are forbidden to haveconjugal relations with each other. If it were discovered that any couple had broken thisrule, the work of building would immediately be stopped, and another site chosen for thevillage. For they think that a breach of chastity would spoil the village which was growingup, that the chief would grow lean and perhaps die, and that the guilty woman would neverbear another child. Among the Chams of Cochin-China, when a dam is made or repairedon a river for the sake of irrigation, the chief who offers the traditional sacrifices andimplores the protection of the deities on the work has to stay all the time in a wretchedhovel of straw, taking no part in the labour, and observing the strictest continence; for thepeople believe that a breach of his chastity would entail a breach of the dam. Here, it isplain, there can be no idea of maintaining the mere bodily vigour of the chief for theaccomplishment of a task in which he does not even bear a hand.If the taboos or abstinences observed by hunters and fishermen before and during thechase are dictated, as we have seen reason to believe, by superstitious motives, and chieflyby a dread of offending or frightening the spirits of the creatures whom it is proposed tokill, we may expect that the restraints imposed after the slaughter has been perpetratedwill be at least as stringent, the slayer and his friends having now the added fear of theangry ghosts of his victims before their eyes. Whereas on the hypothesis that theabstinences in question, including those from food, drink, and sleep, are merely salutaryprecautions for maintaining the men in health and strength to do their work, it is obviousthat the observance of these abstinences or taboos after the work is done, that is, when thegame is killed and the fish caught, must be wholly superfluous, absurd, and inexplicable.But as I shall now show, these taboos often continue to be enforced or even increased instringency after the death of the animals, in other words, after the hunter or fisher hasaccomplished his object by making his bag or landing his fish. The rationalistic theory ofthem therefore breaks down entirely; the hypothesis of superstition is clearly the only oneopen to us."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Among the Inuit or Esquimaux of Bering Strait “the dead bodies of various animals mustbe treated very carefully by the hunter who obtains them, so that their shades may not beoffended and bring bad luck or even death upon him or his people.” Hence the Unalithunter who has had a hand in the killing of a white whale, or even has helped to take onefrom the net, is not allowed to do any work for the next four days, that being the timeduring which the shade or ghost of the whale is supposed to stay with its body. At the sametime no one in the village may use any sharp or pointed instrument for fear of woundingthe whale’s shade, which is believed to be hovering invisible in the neighbourhood; and noloud noise may be made lest it should frighten or offend the ghost. Whoever cuts a whale’sbody with an iron axe will die. Indeed the use of all iron instruments is forbidden in thevillage during these four days.These same Esquimaux celebrate a great annual festival in December when the bladders ofall the seals, whales, walrus, and white bears that have been killed in the year are takeninto the assembly-house of the village. They remain there for several days, and so long asthey do so the hunters avoid all intercourse with women, saying that if they failed in thatrespect the shades of the dead animals would be offended. Similarly among the Aleuts ofAlaska the hunter who had struck a whale with a charmed spear would not throw again,but returned at once to his home and separated himself from his people in a hut speciallyconstructed for the purpose, where he stayed for three days without food or drink, andwithout touching or looking upon a woman. During this time of seclusion he snortedoccasionally in imitation of the wounded and dying whale, in order to prevent the whalewhich he had struck from leaving the coast. On the fourth day he emerged from hisseclusion and bathed in the sea, shrieking in a hoarse voice and beating the water with hishands. Then, taking with him a companion, he repaired to that part of the shore where heexpected to find the whale stranded. If the beast was dead, he at once cut out the placewhere the death-wound had been inflicted. If the whale was not dead, he again returned tohis home and continued washing himself until the whale died. Here the hunter’s imitationof the wounded whale is probably intended by means of homoeopathic magic to make thebeast die in earnest. Once more the soul of the grim polar bear is offended if the tabooswhich concern him are not observed. His soul tarries for three days near the spot where itleft his body, and during these days the Esquimaux are particularly careful to conformrigidly to the laws of taboo, because they believe that punishment overtakes thetransgressor who sins against the soul of a bear far more speedily than him who sinsagainst the souls of the sea-beasts.When the Kayans have shot one of the dreaded Bornean panthers, they are very anxiousabout the safety of their souls, for they think that the soul of a panther is almost morepowerful than their own. Hence they step eight times over the carcase of the dead beastreciting the spell, “Panther, thy soul under my soul.” On returning home they smearthemselves, their dogs, and their weapons with the blood of fowls in order to calm theirsouls and hinder them from fleeing away; for, being themselves fond of the flesh of fowls,they ascribe the same taste to their souls. For eight days afterwards they must bathe by dayand by night before going out again to the chase. Among the Hottentots, when a man haskilled a lion, leopard, elephant, or rhinoceros, he is esteemed a great hero, but he has toremain at home quite idle for three days, during which his wife may not come near him;she is also enjoined to restrict herself to a poor diet and to eat no more than is barely"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"necessary to keep her in health. Similarly the Lapps deem it the height of glory to kill abear, which they consider the king of beasts. Nevertheless, all the men who take part in theslaughter are regarded as unclean, and must live by themselves for three days in a hut ortent made specially for them, where they cut up and cook the bear’s carcase. The reindeerwhich brought in the carcase on a sledge may not be driven by a woman for a whole year;indeed, according to one account, it may not be used by anybody for that period. Before themen go into the tent where they are to be secluded, they strip themselves of the garmentsthey had worn in killing the bear, and their wives spit the red juice of alder bark in theirfaces. They enter the tent not by the ordinary door but by an opening at the back. Whenthe bear’s flesh has been cooked, a portion of it is sent by the hands of two men to thewomen, who may not approach the men’s tent while the cooking is going on. The men whoconvey the flesh to the women pretend to be strangers bringing presents from a foreignland; the women keep up the pretence and promise to tie red threads round the legs of thestrangers. The bear’s flesh may not be passed in to the women through the door of theirtent, but must be thrust in at a special opening made by lifting up the hem of the tent-cover.When the three days’ seclusion is over and the men are at liberty to return to their wives,they run, one after the other, round the fire, holding the chain by which pots are suspendedover it. This is regarded as a form of purification; they may now leave the tent by theordinary door and rejoin the women. But the leader of the party must still abstain fromcohabitation with his wife for two days more.Again, the Caffres are said to dread greatly the boa-constrictor or an enormous serpentresembling it; “and being influenced by certain superstitious notions they even fear to killit. The man who happened to put it to death, whether in self-defence or otherwise, wasformerly required to lie in a running stream of water during the day for several weekstogether; and no beast whatever was allowed to be slaughtered at the hamlet to which hebelonged, until this duty had been fully performed. The body of the snake was then takenand carefully buried in a trench, dug close to the cattle-fold, where its remains, like those ofa chief, were henceforward kept perfectly undisturbed. The period of penance, as in thecase of mourning for the dead, is now happily reduced to a few days.” In Madras it isconsidered a great sin to kill a cobra. When this has happened, the people generally burnthe body of the serpent, just as they burn the bodies of human beings. The murderer deemshimself polluted for three days. On the second day milk is poured on the remains of thecobra. On the third day the guilty wretch is free from pollution.In these last cases the animal whose slaughter has to be atoned for is sacred, that is, it is onewhose life is commonly spared from motives of superstition. Yet the treatment of thesacrilegious slayer seems to resemble so closely the treatment of hunters and fishermenwho have killed animals for food in the ordinary course of business, that the ideas on whichboth sets of customs are based may be assumed to be substantially the same. Those ideas, ifI am right, are the respect which the savage feels for the souls of beasts, especially valuableor formidable beasts, and the dread which he entertains of their vengeful ghosts. Someconfirmation of this view may be drawn from the ceremonies observed by fishermen ofAnnam when the carcase of a whale is washed ashore. These fisherfolk, we are told,worship the whale on account of the benefits they derive from it. There is hardly a villageon the sea-shore which has not its small pagoda, containing the bones, more or lessauthentic, of a whale. When a dead whale is washed ashore, the people accord it a solemn"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"burial. The man who first caught sight of it acts as chief mourner, performing the riteswhich as chief mourner and heir he would perform for a human kinsman. He puts on allthe garb of woe, the straw hat, the white robe with long sleeves turned inside out, and theother paraphernalia of full mourning. As next of kin to the deceased he presides over thefuneral rites. Perfumes are burned, sticks of incense kindled, leaves of gold and silverscattered, crackers let off. When the flesh has been cut off and the oil extracted, theremains of the carcase are buried in the sand. After wards a shed is set up and offerings aremade in it. Usually some time after the burial the spirit of the dead whale takes possessionof some person in the village and declares by his mouth whether he is a male or a female.XXI. Tabooed Things1. The Meaning of TabooTHUS in primitive society the rules of ceremonial purity observed by divine kings, chiefs,and priests agree in many respects with the rules observed by homicides, mourners, womenin childbed, girls at puberty, hunters and fishermen, and so on. To us these various classesof persons appear to differ totally in character and condition; some of them we should callholy, others we might pronounce unclean and polluted. But the savage makes no suchmoral distinction between them; the conceptions of holiness and pollution are not yetdifferentiated in his mind. To him the common feature of all these persons is that they aredangerous and in danger, and the danger in which they stand and to which they exposeothers is what we should call spiritual or ghostly, and therefore imaginary. The danger,however, is not less real because it is imaginary; imagination acts upon man as really asdoes gravitation, and may kill him as certainly as a dose of prussic acid. To seclude thesepersons from the rest of the world so that the dreaded spiritual danger shall neither reachthem nor spread from them, is the object of the taboos which they have to observe. Thesetaboos act, so to say, as electrical insulators to preserve the spiritual force with which thesepersons are charged from suffering or inflicting harm by contact with the outer world.To the illustrations of these general principles which have been already given I shall nowadd some more, drawing my examples, first, from the class of tabooed things, and, second,from the class of tabooed words; for in the opinion of the savage both things and wordsmay, like persons, be charged or electrified, either temporarily or permanently, with themysterious virtue of taboo, and may therefore require to be banished for a longer orshorter time from the familiar usage of common life. And the examples will be chosen withspecial reference to those sacred chiefs, kings and priests, who, more than anybody else,live fenced about by taboo as by a wall. Tabooed things will be illustrated in the presentchapter, and tabooed words in the next.2. Iron tabooedIN THE FIRST place we may observe that the awful sanctity of kings naturally leads to a"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"prohibition to touch their sacred persons. Thus it was unlawful to lay hands on the personof a Spartan king: no one might touch the body of the king or queen of Tahiti: it isforbidden to touch the person of the king of Siam under pain of death; and no one maytouch the king of Cambodia, for any purpose whatever, without his express command. InJuly 1874 the king was thrown from his carriage and lay insensible on the ground, but notone of his suite dared to touch him; a European coming to the spot carried the injuredmonarch to his palace. Formerly no one might touch the king of Corea; and if he deigned totouch a subject, the spot touched became sacred, and the person thus honoured had towear a visible mark (generally a cord of red silk) for the rest of his life. Above all, no ironmight touch the king’s body. In 1800 King Tieng-tsong-tai-oang died of a tumour in theback, no one dreaming of employing the lancet, which would probably have saved his life.It is said that one king suffered terribly from an abscess in the lip, till his physician calledin a jester, whose pranks made the king laugh heartily, and so the abscess burst. Romanand Sabine priests might not be shaved with iron but only with bronze razors or shears;and whenever an iron graving-tool was brought into the sacred grove of the Arval Brothersat Rome for the purpose of cutting an inscription in stone, an expiatory sacrifice of a lamband a pig must be offered, which was repeated when the graving-tool was removed fromthe grove. As a general rule iron might not be brought into Greek sanctuaries. In Cretesacrifices were offered to Menedemus without the use of iron, because the legend ran thatMenedemus had been killed by an iron weapon in the Trojan war. The Archon of Plataeamight not touch iron; but once a year, at the annual commemoration of the men who fell atthe battle of Plataea, he was allowed to carry a sword wherewith to sacrifice a bull. To thisday a Hottentot priest never uses an iron knife, but always a sharp splint of quartz, insacrificing an animal or circumcising a lad. Among the Ovambo of South-west Africacustom requires that lads should be circumcised with a sharp flint; if none is to hand, theoperation may be performed with iron, but the iron must afterwards be buried. Amongstthe Moquis of Arizona stone knives, hatchets, and so on have passed out of common use,but are retained in religious ceremonies. After the Pawnees had ceased to use stone arrow-heads for ordinary purposes, they still employed them to slay the sacrifices, whetherhuman captives or buffalo and deer. Amongst the Jews no iron tool was used in buildingthe Temple at Jerusalem or in making an altar. The old wooden bridge (Pons Sublicius) atRome, which was considered sacred, was made and had to be kept in repair without the useof iron or bronze. It was expressly provided by law that the temple of Jupiter Liber atFurfo might be repaired with iron tools. The council chamber at Cyzicus was constructedof wood without any iron nails, the beams being so arranged that they could be taken outand replaced.This superstitious objection to iron perhaps dates from that early time in the history ofsociety when iron was still a novelty, and as such was viewed by many with suspicion anddislike. For everything new is apt to excite the awe and dread of the savage. “It is a curioussuperstition,” says a pioneer in Borneo, “this of the Dusuns, to attribute anything—whether good or bad, lucky or unlucky—that happens to them to something novel whichhas arrived in their country. For instance, my living in Kindram has caused the intenselyhot weather we have experienced of late.” The unusually heavy rains which happened tofollow the English survey of the Nicobar Islands in the winter of 1886–1887 were imputedby the alarmed natives to the wrath of the spirits at the theodolites, dumpy-levellers, andother strange instruments which had been set up in so many of their favourite haunts; and"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"some of them proposed to soothe the anger of the spirits by sacrificing a pig. In theseventeenth century a succession of bad seasons excited a revolt among the Esthonianpeasantry, who traced the origin of the evil to a watermill, which put a stream to someinconvenience by checking its flow. The first introduction of iron ploughshares into Polandhaving been followed by a succession of bad harvests, the farmers attributed the badness ofthe crops to the iron ploughshares, and discarded them for the old wooden ones. To thisday the primitive Baduwis of Java, who live chiefly by husbandry, will use no iron tools intilling their fields.The general dislike of innovation, which always makes itself strongly felt in the sphere ofreligion, is sufficient by itself to account for the superstitious aversion to iron entertainedby kings and priests and attributed by them to the gods; possibly this aversion may havebeen intensified in places by some such accidental cause as the series of bad seasons whichcast discredit on iron ploughshares in Poland. But the disfavour in which iron is held by thegods and their ministers has another side. Their antipathy to the metal furnishes men witha weapon which may be turned against the spirits when occasion serves. As their dislike ofiron is supposed to be so great that they will not approach persons and things protected bythe obnoxious metal, iron may obviously be employed as a charm for banning ghosts andother dangerous spirits. And often it is so used. Thus in the Highlands of Scotland the greatsafeguard against the elfin race is iron, or, better yet, steel. The metal in any form, whetheras a sword, a knife, a gun-barrel, or what not, is all-powerful for this purpose. Wheneveryou enter a fairy dwelling you should always remember to stick a piece of steel, such as aknife, a needle, or a fish-hook, in the door; for then the elves will not be able to shut thedoor till you come out again. So, too, when you have shot a deer and are bringing it homeat night, be sure to thrust a knife into the carcase, for that keeps the fairies from layingtheir weight on it. A knife or nail in your pocket is quite enough to prevent the fairies fromlifting you up at night. Nails in the front of a bed ward off elves from women “in the straw”and from their babes; but to make quite sure it is better to put the smoothing-iron underthe bed, and the reaping-hook in the window. If a bull has fallen over a rock and beenkilled, a nail stuck into it will preserve the flesh from the fairies. Music discoursed on aJew’s harp keeps the elfin women away from the hunter, because the tongue of theinstrument is of steel. In Morocco iron is considered a great protection against demons;hence it is usual to place a knife or dagger under a sick man’s pillow. The Singhalesebelieve that they are constantly surrounded by evil spirits, who lie in wait to do them harm.A peasant would not dare to carry good food, such as cakes or roast meat, from one placeto another without putting an iron nail on it to prevent a demon from taking possession ofthe viands and so making the eater ill. No sick person, whether man or woman, wouldventure out of the house without a bunch of keys or a knife in his hand, for without such atalisman he would fear that some devil might take advantage of his weak state to slip intohis body. And if a man has a large sore on his body he tries to keep a morsel of iron on it asa protection against demons. On the Slave Coast when a mother sees her child graduallywasting away, she concludes that a demon has entered into the child, and takes hermeasures accordingly. To lure the demon out of the body of her offspring, she offers asacrifice of food; and while the devil is bolting it, she attaches iron rings and small bells toher child’s ankles and hangs iron chains round his neck. The jingling of the iron and thetinkling of the bells are supposed to prevent the demon, when he has concluded his repast,from entering again into the body of the little sufferer. Hence many children may be seen in"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"this part of Africa weighed down with iron ornaments.3. Sharp Weapons tabooedTHERE is a priestly king to the north of Zengwih in Burma, revered by the Sotih as thehighest spiritual and temporal authority, into whose house no weapon or cuttinginstrument may be brought. This rule may perhaps be explained by a custom observed byvarious peoples after a death; they refrain from the use of sharp instruments so long as theghost of the deceased is supposed to be near, lest they should wound it. Thus among theEsquimaux of Bering Strait “during the day on which a person dies in the village no one ispermitted to work, and the relatives must perform no labour during the three followingdays. It is especially forbidden during this period to cut with any edged instrument, such asa knife or an axe; and the use of pointed instruments, like needles or bodkins, is alsoforbidden. This is said to be done to avoid cutting or injuring the shade, which may bepresent at any time during this period, and, if accidentally injured by any of these things, itwould become very angry and bring sickness or death to the people. The relatives must alsobe very careful at this time not to make any loud or harsh noises that may startle or angerthe shade.” We have seen that in like manner after killing a white whale these Esquimauxabstain from the use of cutting or pointed instruments for four days, lest they shouldunwittingly cut or stab the whale’s ghost. The same taboo is sometimes observed by themwhen there is a sick person in the village, probably from a fear of injuring his shade whichmay be hovering outside of his body. After a death the Roumanians of Transylvania arecareful not to leave a knife lying with the sharp edge uppermost so long as the corpseremains in the house, “or else the soul will be forced to ride on the blade.” For seven daysafter a death, the corpse being still in the house, the Chinese abstain from the use of knivesand needles, and even of chopsticks, eating their food with their fingers. On the third, sixth,ninth, and fortieth days after the funeral the old Prussians and Lithuanians used toprepare a meal, to which, standing at the door, they invited the soul of the deceased. Atthese meals they sat silent round the table and used no knives and the women who servedup the food were also without knives. If any morsels fell from the table they were left lyingthere for the lonely souls that had no living relations or friends to feed them. When themeal was over the priest took a broom and swept the souls out of the house, saying, “Dearsouls, ye have eaten and drunk. Go forth, go forth.” We can now understand why nocutting instrument may be taken into the house of the Burmese pontiff. Like so manypriestly kings, he is probably regarded as divine, and it is therefore right that his sacredspirit should not be exposed to the risk of being cut or wounded whenever it quits his bodyto hover invisible in the air or to fly on some distant mission.4. Blood tabooedWE have seen that the Flamen Dialis was forbidden to touch or even name raw flesh. Atcertain times a Brahman teacher is enjoined not to look on raw flesh, blood, or personswhose hands have been cut off. In Uganda the father of twins is in a state of taboo for sometime after birth; among other rules he is forbidden to kill anything or to see blood. In the"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Pelew Islands when a raid has been made on a village and a head carried off, the relationsof the slain man are tabooed and have to submit to certain observances in order to escapethe wrath of his ghost. They are shut up in the house, touch no raw flesh, and chew betelover which an incantation has been uttered by the exorcist. After this the ghost of theslaughtered man goes away to the enemy’s country in pursuit of his murderer. The taboo isprobably based on the common belief that the soul or spirit of the animal is in the blood. Astabooed persons are believed to be in a perilous state—for example, the relations of theslain man are liable to the attacks of his indignant ghost—it is especially necessary toisolate them from contact with spirits; hence the prohibition to touch raw meat. But asusual the taboo is only the special enforcement of a general precept; in other words, itsobservance is particularly enjoined in circumstances which seem urgently to call for itsapplication, but apart from such circumstances the prohibition is also observed, thoughless strictly, as a common rule of life. Thus some of the Esthonians will not taste bloodbecause they believe that it contains the animal’s soul, which would enter the body of theperson who tasted the blood. Some Indian tribes of North America, “through a strongprinciple of religion, abstain in the strictest manner from eating the blood of any animal, asit contains the life and spirit of the beast.” Jewish hunters poured out the blood of the gamethey had killed and covered it up with dust. They would not taste the blood, believing thatthe soul or life of the animal was in the blood, or actually was the blood.It is a common rule that royal blood may not be shed upon the ground. Hence when a kingor one of his family is to be put to death a mode of execution is devised by which the royalblood shall not be spilt upon the earth. About the year 1688 the generalissimo of the armyrebelled against the king of Siam and put him to death “after the manner of royalcriminals, or as princes of the blood are treated when convicted of capital crimes, which isby putting them into a large iron caldron, and pounding them to pieces with woodenpestles, because none of their royal blood must be spilt on the ground, it being, by theirreligion, thought great impiety to contaminate the divine blood by mixing it with earth.”When Kublai Khan defeated and took his uncle Nayan, who had rebelled against him, hecaused Nayan to be put to death by being wrapt in a carpet and tossed to and fro till hedied, “because he would not have the blood of his Line Imperial spilt upon the ground orexposed in the eye of Heaven and before the Sun.” “Friar Ricold mentions the Tartarmaxim: ‘One Khan will put another to death to get possession of the throne, but he takesgreat care that the blood be not spilt. For they say that it is highly improper that the bloodof the Great Khan should be spilt upon the ground; so they cause the victim to besmothered somehow or other.’ The like feeling prevails at the court of Burma, where apeculiar mode of execution without bloodshed is reserved for princes of the blood.”The reluctance to spill royal blood seems to be only a particular case of a generalunwillingness to shed blood or at least to allow it to fall on the ground. Marco Polo tells usthat in his day persons caught in the streets of Cambaluc (Peking) at unseasonable hourswere arrested, and if found guilty of a misdemeanor were beaten with a stick. “Under thispunishment people sometimes die, but they adopt it in order to eschew bloodshed, for theirBacsis say that it is an evil thing to shed man’s blood.” In West Sussex people believe thatthe ground on which human blood has been shed is accursed and will remain barren forever. Among some primitive peoples, when the blood of a tribesman has to be spilt it is notsuffered to fall upon the ground, but is received upon the bodies of his fellow-tribesmen."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Thus in some Australian tribes boys who are being circumcised are laid on a platform,formed by the living bodies of the tribesmen; and when a boy’s tooth is knocked out as aninitiatory ceremony, he is seated on the shoulders of a man, on whose breast the blood flowsand may not be wiped away. “Also the Gauls used to drink their enemies’ blood and paintthemselves therewith. So also they write that the old Irish were wont; and so have I seensome of the Irish do, but not their enemies’ but friends’ blood, as, namely, at the executionof a notable traitor at Limerick, called Murrogh O’Brien, I saw an old woman, which washis foster-mother, take up his head whilst he was quartered and suck up all the blood thatran thereout, saying that the earth was not worthy to drink it, and therewith also steepedher face and breast and tore her hair, crying out and shrieking most terribly.” Among theLatuka of Central Africa the earth on which a drop of blood has fallen at childbirth iscarefully scraped up with an iron shovel, put into a pot along with the water used inwashing the mother, and buried tolerably deep outside the house on the left-hand side. InWest Africa, if a drop of your blood has fallen on the ground, you must carefully cover itup, rub and stamp it into the soil; if it has fallen on the side of a canoe or a tree, the place iscut out and the chip destroyed. One motive of these African customs may be a wish toprevent the blood from falling into the hands of magicians, who might make an evil use ofit. That is admittedly the reason why people in West Africa stamp out any blood of theirswhich has dropped on the ground or cut out any wood that has been soaked with it. From alike dread of sorcery natives of New Guinea are careful to burn any sticks, leaves, or ragswhich are stained with their blood; and if the blood has dripped on the ground they turnup the soil and if possible light a fire on the spot. The same fear explains the curious dutiesdischarged by a class of men called ramanga or “blue blood” among the Betsileo ofMadagascar. It is their business to eat all the nail-parings and to lick up all the spilt bloodof the nobles. When the nobles pare their nails, the parings are collected to the last scrapand swallowed by these ramanga. If the parings are too large, they are minced small and sogulped down. Again, should a nobleman wound himself, say in cutting his nails or treadingon something, the ramanga lick up the blood as fast as possible. Nobles of high rank hardlygo anywhere without these humble attendants; but if it should happen that there are noneof them present, the cut nails and the spilt blood are carefully collected to be afterwardsswallowed by the ramanga. There is scarcely a nobleman of any pretensions who does notstrictly observe this custom, the intention of which probably is to prevent these parts of hisperson from falling into the hands of sorcerers, who on the principles of contagious magiccould work him harm thereby.The general explanation of the reluctance to shed blood on the ground is probably to befound in the belief that the soul is in the blood, and that therefore any ground on which itmay fall necessarily becomes taboo or sacred. In New Zealand anything upon which even adrop of a high chief’s blood chances to fall becomes taboo or sacred to him. For instance, aparty of natives having come to visit a chief in a fine new canoe, the chief got into it, but indoing so a splinter entered his foot, and the blood trickled on the canoe, which at oncebecame sacred to him. The owner jumped out, dragged the canoe ashore opposite thechief’s house, and left it there. Again, a chief in entering a missionary’s house knocked hishead against a beam, and the blood flowed. The natives said that in former times the housewould have belonged to the chief. As usually happens with taboos of universal application,the prohibition to spill the blood of a tribesman on the ground applies with peculiarstringency to chiefs and kings, and is observed in their case long after it has ceased to be"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"observed in the case of others.5. The Head tabooedMANY peoples regard the head as peculiarly sacred; the special sanctity attributed to it issometimes explained by a belief that it contains a spirit which is very sensitive to injury ordisrespect. Thus the Yorubas hold that every man has three spiritual inmates, of whom thefirst, called Olori, dwells in the head and is the man’s protector, guardian, and guide.Offerings are made to this spirit, chiefly of fowls, and some of the blood mixed with palmoilis rubbed on the forehead. The Karens suppose that a being called the tso resides in theupper part of the head, and while it retains its seat no harm can befall the person from theefforts of the seven Kelahs, or personified passions. “But if the tso becomes heedless orweak certain evil to the person is the result. Hence the head is carefully attended to, and allpossible pains are taken to provide such dress and attire as will be pleasing to the tso.” TheSiamese think that a spirit called khuan or kwun dwells in the human head, of which it isthe guardian spirit. The spirit must be carefully protected from injury of every kind; hencethe act of shaving or cutting the hair is accompanied with many ceremonies. The kwun isvery sensitive on points of honour, and would feel mortally insulted if the head in which heresides were touched by the hand of a stranger. The Cambodians esteem it a grave offenceto touch a man’s head; some of them will not enter a place where anything whatever issuspended over their heads; and the meanest Cambodian would never consent to live underan inhabited room. Hence the houses are built of one story only; and even the Governmentrespects the prejudice by never placing a prisoner in the stocks under the floor of a house,though the houses are raised high above the ground. The same superstition exists amongstthe Malays; for an early traveller reports that in Java people “wear nothing on their heads,and say that nothing must be on their heads ... and if any person were to put his hand upontheir head they would kill him; and they do not build houses with storeys, in order thatthey may not walk over each other’s heads.”The same superstition as to the head is found in full force throughout Polynesia. Thus ofGattanewa, a Marquesan chief, it is said that “to touch the top of his head, or anythingwhich had been on his head, was sacrilege. To pass over his head was an indignity never tobe forgotten.” The son of a Marquesan high priest has been seen to roll on the ground in anagony of rage and despair, begging for death, because some one had desecrated his headand deprived him of his divinity by sprinkling a few drops of water on his hair. But it wasnot the Marquesan chiefs only whose heads were sacred. The head of every Marquesan wastaboo, and might neither be touched nor stepped over by another; even a father might notstep over the head of his sleeping child; women were forbidden to carry or touch anythingthat had been in contact with, or had merely hung over, the head of their husband orfather. No one was allowed to be over the head of the king of Tonga. In Tahiti any one whostood over the king or queen, or passed his hand over their heads, might be put to death.Until certain rites were performed over it, a Tahitian infant was especially taboo; whatevertouched the child’s head, while it was in this state, became sacred and was deposited in aconsecrated place railed in for the purpose at the child’s house. If a branch of a treetouched the child’s head, the tree was cut down; and if in its fall it injured another tree soas to penetrate the bark, that tree also was cut down as unclean and unfit for use. After the"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"rites were performed these special taboos ceased; but the head of a Tahitian was alwayssacred, he never carried anything on it, and to touch it was an offence. So sacred was thehead of a Maori chief that “if he only touched it with his fingers, he was obligedimmediately to apply them to his nose, and snuff up the sanctity which they had acquiredby the touch, and thus restore it to the part from whence it was taken.” On account of thesacredness of his head a Maori chief “could not blow the fire with his mouth, for the breathbeing sacred, communicated his sanctity to it, and a brand might be taken by a slave, or aman of another tribe, or the fire might be used for other purposes, such as cooking, and socause his death.”6. Hair tabooedWHEN the head was considered so sacred that it might not even be touched without graveoffence, it is obvious that the cutting of the hair must have been a delicate and difficultoperation. The difficulties and dangers which, on the primitive view, beset the operationare of two kinds. There is first the danger of disturbing the spirit of the head, which may beinjured in the process and may revenge itself upon the person who molests him. Secondly,there is the difficulty of disposing of the shorn locks. For the savage believes that thesympathetic connexion which exists between himself and every part of his body continuesto exist even after the physical connexion has been broken, and that therefore he will sufferfrom any harm that may befall the several parts of his body, such as the clippings of hishair or the parings of his nails. Accordingly he takes care that these severed portions ofhimself shall not be left in places where they might either be exposed to accidental injury orfall into the hands of malicious persons who might work magic on them to his detriment ordeath. Such dangers are common to all, but sacred persons have more to fear from themthan ordinary people, so the precautions taken by them are proportionately stringent. Thesimplest way of evading the peril is not to cut the hair at all; and this is the expedientadopted where the risk is thought to be more than usually great. The Frankish kings werenever allowed to crop their hair; from their childhood upwards they had to keep itunshorn. To poll the long locks that floated on their shoulders would have been to renouncetheir right to the throne. When the wicked brothers Clotaire and Childebert coveted thekingdom of their dead brother Clodomir, they inveigled into their power their littlenephews, the two sons of Clodomir; and having done so, they sent a messenger bearingscissors and a naked sword to the children’s grandmother, Queen Clotilde, at Paris. Theenvoy showed the scissors and the sword to Clotilde, and bade her choose whether thechildren should be shorn and live or remain unshorn and die. The proud queen replied thatif her grandchildren were not to come to the throne she would rather see them dead thanshorn. And murdered they were by their ruthless uncle Clotaire with his own hand. Theking of Ponape, one of the Caroline Islands, must wear his hair long, and so must hisgrandees. Among the Hos, a negro tribe of West Africa, “there are priests on whose headno razor may come during the whole of their lives. The god who dwells in the man forbidsthe cutting of his hair on pain of death. If the hair is at last too long, the owner must prayto his god to allow him at least to clip the tips of it. The hair is in fact conceived as the seatand lodging-place of his god, so that were it shorn the god would lose his abode in thepriest.” The members of a Masai clan, who are believed to possess the art of making rain,"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"may not pluck out their beards, because the loss of their beards would, it is supposed, entailthe loss of their rain-making powers. The head chief and the sorcerers of the Masai observethe same rule for a like reason: they think that were they to pull out their beards, theirsupernatural gifts would desert them.Again, men who have taken a vow of vengeance sometimes keep their hair unshorn till theyhave fulfilled their vow. Thus of the Marquesans we are told that “occasionally they havetheir head entirely shaved, except one lock on the crown, which is worn loose or put up in aknot. But the latter mode of wearing the hair is only adopted by them when they have asolemn vow, as to revenge the death of some near relation, etc. In such case the lock isnever cut off until they have fulfilled their promise.” A similar custom was sometimesobserved by the ancient Germans; among the Chatti the young warriors never clippedtheir hair or their beard till they had slain an enemy. Among the Toradjas, when a child’shair is cut to rid it of vermin, some locks are allowed to remain on the crown of the head asa refuge for one of the child’s souls. Otherwise the soul would have no place in which tosettle, and the child would sicken. The Karo-Bataks are much afraid of frightening awaythe soul of a child; hence when they cut its hair, they always leave a patch unshorn, towhich the soul can retreat before the shears. Usually this lock remains unshorn all throughlife, or at least up till manhood.7. Ceremonies at Hair-cuttingBUT when it becomes necessary to crop the hair, measures are taken to lessen the dangerswhich are supposed to attend the operation. The chief of Namosi in Fiji always ate a manby way of precaution when he had had his hair cut. “There was a certain clan that had toprovide the victim, and they used to sit in solemn council among themselves to choose him.It was a sacrificial feast to avert evil from the chief.” Amongst the Maoris many spells wereuttered at hair-cutting; one, for example, was spoken to consecrate the obsidian knife withwhich the hair was cut; another was pronounced to avert the thunder and lightning whichhair-cutting was believed to cause. “He who has had his hair cut is in immediate charge ofthe Atua (spirit); he is removed from the contact and society of his family and his tribe; hedare not touch his food himself; it is put into his mouth by another person; nor can he forsome days resume his accustomed occupations or associate with his fellow-men.” Theperson who cuts the hair is also tabooed; his hands having been in contact with a sacredhead, he may not touch food with them or engage in any other employment; he is fed byanother person with food cooked over a sacred fire. He cannot be released from the taboobefore the following day, when he rubs his hands with potato or fern root which has beencooked on a sacred fire; and this food having been taken to the head of the family in thefemale line and eaten by her, his hands are freed from the taboo. In some parts of NewZealand the most sacred day of the year was that appointed for hair-cutting; the peopleassembled in large numbers on that day from all the neighbourhood."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"8. Disposal of Cut Hair and NailsBUT even when the hair and nails have been safely cut, there remains the difficulty ofdisposing of them, for their owner believes himself liable to suffer from any harm that maybefall them. The notion that a man may be bewitched by means of the clippings of his hair,the parings of his nails, or any other severed portion of his person is almost world-wide,and attested by evidence too ample, too familiar, and too tedious in its uniformity to behere analysed at length. The general idea on which the superstition rests is that of thesympathetic connexion supposed to persist between a person and everything that has oncebeen part of his body or in any way closely related to him. A very few examples mustsuffice. They belong to that branch of sympathetic magic which may be called contagious.Dread of sorcery, we are told, formed one of the most salient characteristics of theMarquesan islanders in the old days. The sorcerer took some of the hair, spittle, or otherbodily refuse of the man he wished to injure, wrapped it up in a leaf, and placed the packetin a bag woven of threads or fibres, which were knotted in an intricate way. The whole wasthen buried with certain rites, and thereupon the victim wasted away of a languishingsickness which lasted twenty days. His life, however, might be saved by discovering anddigging up the buried hair, spittle, or what not; for as soon as this was done the power ofthe charm ceased. A Maori sorcerer intent on bewitching somebody sought to get a tress ofhis victim’s hair, the parings of his nails, some of his spittle, or a shred of his garment.Having obtained the object, whatever it was, he chanted certain spells and curses over it ina falsetto voice and buried it in the ground. As the thing decayed, the person to whom ithad belonged was supposed to waste away. When an Australian blackfellow wishes to getrid of his wife, he cuts off a lock of her hair in her sleep, ties it to his spear-thrower, andgoes with it to a neighbouring tribe, where he gives it to a friend. His friend sticks thespear-thrower up every night before the camp fire, and when it falls down it is a sign thatthe wife is dead. The way in which the charm operates was explained to Dr. Howitt by aWirajuri man. “You see,” he said, “when a blackfellow doctor gets hold of somethingbelonging to a man and roasts it with things, and sings over it, the fire catches hold of thesmell of the man, and that settles the poor fellow.”The Huzuls of the Carpathians imagine that if mice get a person’s shorn hair and make anest of it, the person will suffer from headache or even become idiotic. Similarly inGermany it is a common notion that if birds find a person’s cut hair, and build their nestswith it, the person will suffer from headache; sometimes it is thought that he will have aneruption on the head. The same superstition prevails, or used to prevail, in West Sussex.Again it is thought that cut or combed-out hair may disturb the weather by producing rainand hail, thunder and lightning. We have seen that in New Zealand a spell was uttered athair-cutting to avert thunder and lightning. In the Tyrol, witches are supposed to use cut orcombed-out hair to make hailstones or thunderstorms with. Thlinkeet Indians have beenknown to attribute stormy weather to the rash act of a girl who had combed her hairoutside of the house. The Romans seem to have held similar views, for it was a maxim withthem that no one on shipboard should cut his hair or nails except in a storm, that is, whenthe mischief was already done. In the Highlands of Scotland it is said that no sister shouldcomb her hair at night if she have a brother at sea. In West Africa, when the Mani ofChitombe or Jumba died, the people used to run in crowds to the corpse and tear out his"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"hair, teeth, and nails, which they kept as a rain-charm, believing that otherwise no rainwould fall. The Makoko of the Anzikos begged the missionaries to give him half theirbeards as a rain-charm.If cut hair and nails remain in sympathetic connexion with the person from whose bodythey have been severed, it is clear that they can be used as hostages for his good behaviourby any one who may chance to possess them; for on the principles of contagious magic hehas only to injure the hair or nails in order to hurt simultaneously their original owner.Hence when the Nandi have taken a prisoner they shave his head and keep the shorn hairas a surety that he will not attempt to escape; but when the captive is ransomed, theyreturn his shorn hair with him to his own people.To preserve the cut hair and nails from injury and from the dangerous uses to which theymay be put by sorcerers, it is necessary to deposit them in some safe place. The shorn locksof a Maori chief were gathered with much care and placed in an adjoining cemetery. TheTahitians buried the cuttings of their hair at the temples. In the streets of Soku a moderntraveller observed cairns of large stones piled against walls with tufts of human hairinserted in the crevices. On asking the meaning of this, he was told that when any native ofthe place polled his hair he carefully gathered up the clippings and deposited them in oneof these cairns, all of which were sacred to the fetish and therefore inviolable. These cairnsof sacred stones, he further learned, were simply a precaution against witchcraft, for if aman were not thus careful in disposing of his hair, some of it might fall into the hands of hisenemies, who would, by means of it, be able to cast spells over him and so compass hisdestruction. When the top-knot of a Siamese child has been cut with great ceremony, theshort hairs are put into a little vessel made of plantain leaves and set adrift on the nearestriver or canal. As they float away, all that was wrong or harmful in the child’s dispositionis believed to depart with them. The long hairs are kept till the child makes a pilgrimage tothe holy Footprint of Buddha on the sacred hill at Prabat. They are then presented to thepriests, who are supposed to make them into brushes with which they sweep the Footprint;but in fact so much hair is thus offered every year that the priests cannot use it all, so theyquietly burn the superfluity as soon as the pilgrims’ backs are turned. The cut hair andnails of the Flamen Dialis were buried under a lucky tree. The shorn tresses of the VestalVirgins were hung on an ancient lotus-tree.Often the clipped hair and nails are stowed away in any secret place, not necessarily in atemple or cemetery or at a tree, as in the cases already mentioned. Thus in Swabia you arerecommended to deposit your clipped hair in some spot where neither sun nor moon canshine on it, for example in the earth or under a stone. In Danzig it is buried in a bag underthe threshold. In Ugi, one of the Solomon Islands, men bury their hair lest it should fall intothe hands of an enemy, who would make magic with it and so bring sickness or calamity onthem. The same fear seems to be general in Melanesia, and has led to a regular practice ofhiding cut hair and nails. The same practice prevails among many tribes of South Africa,from a fear lest wizards should get hold of the severed particles and work evil with them.The Caffres carry still further this dread of allowing any portion of themselves to fall intothe hands of an enemy; for not only do they bury their cut hair and nails in a secret spot,but when one of them cleans the head of another he preserves the vermin which he catches,“carefully delivering them to the person to whom they originally appertained, supposing,"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"according to their theory, that as they derived their support from the blood of the manfrom whom they were taken, should they be killed by another, the blood of his neighbourwould be in his possession, thus placing in his hands the power of some superhumaninfluence.”Sometimes the severed hair and nails are preserved, not to prevent them from falling intothe hands of a magician, but that the owner may have them at the resurrection of the body,to which some races look forward. Thus the Incas of Peru “took extreme care to preservethe nail-parings and the hairs that were shorn off or torn out with a comb; placing them inholes or niches in the walls; and if they fell out, any other Indian that saw them pickedthem up and put them in their places again. I very often asked different Indians, at varioustimes, why they did this, in order to see what they would say, and they all replied in thesame words saying, ‘Know that all persons who are born must return to life’ (they have noword to express resurrection), ‘and the souls must rise out of their tombs with all thatbelonged to their bodies. We, therefore, in order that we may not have to search for ourhair and nails at a time when there will be much hurry and confusion, place them in oneplace, that they may be brought together more conveniently, and, whenever it is possible,we are also careful to spit in one place.’” Similarly the Turks never throw away the paringsof their nails, but carefully stow them in cracks of the walls or of the boards, in the beliefthat they will be needed at the resurrection. The Armenians do not throw away their cuthair and nails and extracted teeth, but hide them in places that are esteemed holy, such as acrack in the church wall, a pillar of the house, or a hollow tree. They think that all thesesevered portions of themselves will be wanted at the resurrection, and that he who has notstowed them away in a safe place will have to hunt about for them on the great day. In thevillage of Drumconrath in Ireland there used to be some old women who, havingascertained from Scripture that the hairs of their heads were all numbered by theAlmighty, expected to have to account for them at the day of judgment. In order to be ableto do so they stuffed the severed hair away in the thatch of their cottages.Some people burn their loose hair to save it from falling into the hands of sorcerers. This isdone by the Patagonians and some of the Victorian tribes. In the Upper Vosges they saythat you should never leave the clippings of your hair and nails lying about, but burn themto hinder the sorcerers from using them against you. For the same reason Italian womeneither burn their loose hairs or throw them into a place where no one is likely to look forthem. The almost universal dread of witchcraft induces the West African negroes, theMakololo of South Africa, and the Tahitians to burn or bury their shorn hair. In the Tyrolmany people burn their hair lest the witches should use it to raise thunderstorms; othersburn or bury it to prevent the birds from lining their nests with it, which would cause theheads from which the hair came to ache.This destruction of the hair and nails plainly involves an inconsistency of thought. Theobject of the destruction is avowedly to prevent these severed portions of the body frombeing used by sorcerers. But the possibility of their being so used depends upon thesupposed sympathetic connexion between them and the man from whom they weresevered. And if this sympathetic connexion still exists, clearly these severed portions cannotbe destroyed without injury to the man."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"9. Spittle tabooedTHE SAME fear of witchcraft which has led so many people to hide or destroy their loosehair and nails has induced other or the same people to treat their spittle in a like fashion.For on the principles of sympathetic magic the spittle is part of the man, and whatever isdone to it will have a corresponding effect on him. A Chilote Indian, who has gathered upthe spittle of an enemy, will put it in a potato, and hang the potato in the smoke, utteringcertain spells as he does so in the belief that his foe will waste away as the potato dries inthe smoke. Or he will put the spittle in a frog and throw the animal into an inaccessible,unnavigable river, which will make the victim quake and shake with ague. The natives ofUrewera, a district of New Zealand, enjoyed a high reputation for their skill in magic. Itwas said that they made use of people’s spittle to bewitch them. Hence visitors were carefulto conceal their spittle, lest they should furnish these wizards with a handle for workingthem harm. Similarly among some tribes of South Africa no man will spit when an enemyis near, lest his foe should find the spittle and give it to a wizard, who would then mix itwith magical ingredients so as to injure the person from whom it fell. Even in a man’s ownhouse his saliva is carefully swept away and obliterated for a similar reason.If common folk are thus cautious, it is natural that kings and chiefs should be doubly so. Inthe Sandwich Islands chiefs were attended by a confidential servant bearing a portablespittoon, and the deposit was carefully buried every morning to put it out of the reach ofsorcerers. On the Slave Coast, for the same reason, whenever a king or chief expectorates,the saliva is scrupulously gathered up and hidden or buried. The same precautions aretaken for the same reason with the spittle of the chief of Tabali in Southern Nigeria.The magical use to which spittle may be put marks it out, like blood or nail-parings, as asuitable material basis for a covenant, since by exchanging their saliva the covenantingparties give each other a guarantee of good faith. If either of them afterwards foreswearshimself, the other can punish his perfidy by a magical treatment of the purjurer’s spittlewhich he has in his custody. Thus when the Wajagga of East Africa desire to make acovenant, the two parties will sometimes sit down with a bowl of milk or beer betweenthem, and after uttering an incantation over the beverage they each take a mouthful of themilk or beer and spit it into the other’s mouth. In urgent cases, when there is no time tospend on ceremony, the two will simply spit into each other’s mouth, which seals thecovenant just as well.10. Foods tabooedAS MIGHT have been expected, the superstitions of the savage cluster thick about thesubject of food; and he abstains from eating many animals and plants, wholesome enoughin themselves, which for one reason or another he fancies would prove dangerous or fatalto the eater. Examples of such abstinence are too familiar and far too numerous to quote.But if the ordinary man is thus deterred by superstitious fear from partaking of variousfoods, the restraints of this kind which are laid upon sacred or tabooed persons, such askings and priests, are still more numerous and stringent. We have already seen that theFlamen Dialis was forbidden to eat or even name several plants and animals, and that the"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"flesh diet of Egyptian kings was restricted to veal and goose. In antiquity many priests andmany kings of barbarous peoples abstained wholly from a flesh diet. The Gangas or fetishpriests of the Loango Coast are forbidden to eat or even see a variety of animals and fish, inconsequence of which their flesh diet is extremely limited; often they live only on herbs androots, though they may drink fresh blood. The heir to the throne of Loango is forbiddenfrom infancy to eat pork; from early childhood he is interdicted the use of the cola fruit incompany; at puberty he is taught by a priest not to partake of fowls except such as he hashimself killed and cooked; and so the number of taboos goes on increasing with his years.In Fernando Po the king after installation is forbidden to eat cocco (arum acaule), deer, andporcupine, which are the ordinary foods of the people. The head chief of the Masai may eatnothing but milk, honey, and the roasted livers of goats; for if he partook of any other foodhe would lose his power of soothsaying and of compounding charms.11. Knots and Rings tabooedWE have seen that among the many taboos which the Flamen Dialis at Rome had toobserve, there was one that forbade him to have a knot on any part of his garments, andanother that obliged him to wear no ring unless it were broken. In like manner Moslempilgrims to Mecca are in a state of sanctity or taboo and may wear on their persons neitherknots nor rings. These rules are probably of kindred significance, and may conveniently beconsidered together. To begin with knots, many people in different parts of the worldentertain a strong objection to having any knot about their person at certain criticalseasons, particularly childbirth, marriage, and death. Thus among the Saxons ofTransylvania, when a woman is in travail all knots on her garments are untied, because itis believed that this will facilitate her delivery, and with the same intention all the locks inthe house, whether on doors or boxes, are unlocked. The Lapps think that a lying-inwoman should have no knot on her garments, because a knot would have the effect ofmaking the delivery difficult and painful. In the East Indies this superstition is extended tothe whole time of pregnancy; the people believe that if a pregnant woman were to tie knots,or braid, or make anything fast, the child would thereby be constricted or the womanwould herself be “tied up” when her time came. Nay, some of them enforce the observanceof the rule on the father as well as the mother of the unborn child. Among the Sea Dyaksneither of the parents may bind up anything with a string or make anything fast during thewife’s pregnancy. In the Toumbuluh tribe of North Celebes a ceremony is performed in thefourth or fifth month of a woman’s pregnancy, and after it her husband is forbidden,among many other things, to tie any fast knots and to sit with his legs crossed over eachother.In all these cases the idea seems to be that the tying of a knot would, as they say in the EastIndies, “tie up” the woman, in other words, impede and perhaps prevent her delivery, ordelay her convalescence after the birth. On the principles of homoeopathic or imitativemagic the physical obstacle or impediment of a knot on a cord would create acorresponding obstacle or impediment in the body of the woman. That this is really theexplanation of the rule appears from a custom observed by the Hos of West Africa at adifficult birth. When a woman is in hard labour and cannot bring forth, they call in amagician to her aid. He looks at her and says, “The child is bound in the womb, that is why"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"she cannot be delivered.” On the entreaties of her female relations he then promises toloosen the bond so that she may bring forth. For that purpose he orders them to fetch atough creeper from the forest, and with it he binds the hands and feet of the sufferer on herback. Then he takes a knife and calls out the woman’s name, and when she answers he cutsthrough the creeper with a knife, saying, “I cut through to-day thy bonds and thy child’sbonds.” After that he chops up the creeper small, puts the bits in a vessel of water, andbathes the woman with the water. Here the cutting of the creeper with which the woman’shands and feet are bound is a simple piece of homoeopathic or imitative magic: byreleasing her limbs from their bonds the magician imagines that he simultaneously releasesthe child in her womb from the trammels which impede its birth. The same train ofthought underlies a practice observed by some peoples of opening all locks, doors, and soon, while a birth is taking place in the house. We have seen that at such a time the Germansof Transylvania open all the locks, and the same thing is done also in Voigtland andMecklenburg. In North-western Argyllshire superstitious people used to open every lock inthe house at childbirth. In the island of Salsette near Bombay, when a woman is in hardlabour, all locks of doors or drawers are opened with a key to facilitate her delivery.Among the Mandelings of Sumatra the lids of all chests, boxes, pans, and so forth areopened; and if this does not produce the desired effect, the anxious husband has to strikethe projecting ends of some of the house-beams in order to loosen them; for they think that“everything must be open and loose to facilitate the delivery.” In Chittagong, when awoman cannot bring her child to the birth, the midwife gives orders to throw all doors andwindows wide open, to uncork all bottles, to remove the bungs from all casks, to unloosethe cows in the stall, the horses in the stable, the watchdog in his kennel, to set free sheep,fowls, ducks, and so forth. This universal liberty accorded to the animals and even toinanimate things is, according to the people, an infallible means of ensuring the woman’sdelivery and allowing the babe to be born. In the island of Saghalien, when a woman is inlabour, her husband undoes everything that can be undone. He loosens the plaits of his hairand the laces of his shoes. Then he unties whatever is tied in the house or its vicinity. In thecourtyard he takes the axe out of the log in which it is stuck; he unfastens the boat, if it ismoored to a tree, he withdraws the cartridges from his gun, and the arrows from hiscrossbow.Again, we have seen that a Toumbuluh man abstains not only from tying knots, but alsofrom sitting with crossed legs during his wife’s pregnancy. The train of thought is the samein both cases. Whether you cross threads in tying a knot, or only cross your legs in sittingat your ease, you are equally, on the principles of homoeopathic magic, crossing orthwarting the free course of things, and your action cannot but check and impede whatevermay be going forward in your neighbourhood. Of this important truth the Romans werefully aware. To sit beside a pregnant woman or a patient under medical treatment withclasped hands, says the grave Pliny, is to cast a malignant spell over the person, and it isworse still if you nurse your leg or legs with your clasped hands, or lay one leg over theother. Such postures were regarded by the old Romans as a let and hindrance to businessof every sort, and at a council of war or a meeting of magistrates, at prayers and sacrifices,no man was suffered to cross his legs or clasp his hands. The stock instance of the dreadfulconsequences that might flow from doing one or the other was that of Alcmena, whotravailed with Hercules for seven days and seven nights, because the goddess Lucina sat infront of the house with clasped hands and crossed legs, and the child could not be born"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"until the goddess had been beguiled into changing her attitude. It is a Bulgariansuperstition that if a pregnant woman is in the habit of sitting with crossed legs, she willsuffer much in childbed. In some parts of Bavaria, when conversation comes to a standstilland silence ensues, they say, “Surely somebody has crossed his legs.”The magical effect of knots in trammelling and obstructing human activity was believed tobe manifested at marriage not less than at birth. During the Middle Ages, and down to theeighteenth century, it seems to have been commonly held in Europe that the consummationof marriage could be prevented by any one who, while the wedding ceremony was takingplace, either locked a lock or tied a knot in a cord, and then threw the lock or the cordaway. The lock or the knotted cord had to be flung into water; and until it had been foundand unlocked, or untied, no real union of the married pair was possible. Hence it was agrave offence, not only to cast such a spell, but also to steal or make away with the materialinstrument of it, whether lock or knotted cord. In the year 1718 the parliament ofBordeaux sentenced some one to be burned alive for having spread desolation through awhole family by means of knotted cords; and in 1705 two persons were condemned to deathin Scotland for stealing certain charmed knots which a woman had made, in order therebyto mar the wedded happiness of Spalding of Ashintilly. The belief in the efficacy of thesecharms appears to have lingered in the Highlands of Pertshire down to the end of theeighteenth century, for at that time it was still customary in the beautiful parish ofLogierait, between the river Tummel and the river Tay, to unloose carefully every knot inthe clothes of the bride and bridegroom before the celebration of the marriage ceremony.We meet with the same superstition and the same custom at the present day in Syria. Thepersons who help a Syrian bridegroom to don his wedding garments take care that no knotis tied on them and no button buttoned, for they believe that a button buttoned or a knottied would put it within the power of his enemies to deprive him of his nuptial rights bymagical means. The fear of such charms is diffused all over North Africa at the presentday. To render a bridegroom impotent the enchanter has only to tie a knot in ahandkerchief which he had previously placed quietly on some part of the bridegroom’sbody when he was mounted on horseback ready to fetch his bride: so long as the knot inthe handkerchief remains tied, so long will the bridegroom remain powerless toconsummate the marriage.The maleficent power of knots may also be manifested in the infliction of sickness, disease,and all kinds of misfortune. Thus among the Hos of West Africa a sorcerer will sometimescurse his enemy and tie a knot in a stalk of grass, saying, “I have tied up So-and-so in thisknot. May all evil light upon him! When he goes into the field, may a snake sting him!When he goes to the chase, may a ravening beast attack him! And when he steps into ariver, may the water sweep him away! When it rains, may the lightning strike him! Mayevil nights be his!” It is believed that in the knot the sorcerer has bound up the life of hisenemy. In the Koran there is an allusion to the mischief of “those who puff into the knots,”and an Arab commentator on the passage explains that the words refer to women whopractise magic by tying knots in cords, and then blowing and spitting upon them. He goeson to relate how, once upon a time, a wicked Jew bewitched the prophet Mohammedhimself by tying nine knots on a string, which he then hid in a well. So the prophet fell ill,and nobody knows what might have happened if the archangel Gabriel had notopportunely revealed to the holy man the place where the knotted cord was concealed. The"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"trusty Ali soon fetched the baleful thing from the well; and the prophet recited over itcertain charms, which were specially revealed to him for the purpose. At every verse of thecharms a knot untied itself, and the prophet experienced a certain relief.If knots are supposed to kill, they are also supposed to cure. This follows from the beliefthat to undo the knots which are causing sickness will bring the sufferer relief. But apartfrom this negative virtue of maleficent knots, there are certain beneficent knots to which apositive power of healing is ascribed. Pliny tells us that some folk cured diseases of thegroin by taking a thread from a web, tying seven or nine knots on it, and then fastening itto the patient’s groin; but to make the cure effectual it was necessary to name some widowas each knot was tied. O’Donovan describes a remedy for fever employed among theTurcomans. The enchanter takes some camel hair and spins it into a stout thread, droninga spell the while. Next he ties seven knots on the thread, blowing on each knot before hepulls it tight. This knotted thread is then worn as a bracelet on his wrist by the patient.Every day one of the knots is untied and blown upon, and when the seventh knot is undonethe whole thread is rolled up into a ball and thrown into a river, bearing away (as theyimagine) the fever with it.Again knots may be used by an enchantress to win a lover and attach him firmly to herself.Thus the love-sick maid in Virgil seeks to draw Daphnis to her from the city by spells andby tying three knots on each of three strings of different colours. So an Arab maiden, whohad lost her heart to a certain man, tried to gain his love and bind him to herself by tyingknots in his whip; but her jealous rival undid the knots. On the same principle magic knotsmay be employed to stop a runaway. In Swazieland you may often see grass tied in knots atthe side of the footpaths. Every one of these knots tells of a domestic tragedy. A wife hasrun away from her husband, and he and his friends have gone in pursuit, binding up thepaths, as they call it, in this fashion to prevent the fugitive from doubling back over them.A net, from its affluence of knots, has always been considered in Russia very efficaciousagainst sorcerers; hence in some places, when a bride is being dressed in her weddingattire, a fishing-net is flung over her to keep her out of harm’s way. For a similar purposethe bridegroom and his companions are often girt with pieces of net, or at least with tight-drawn girdles, for before a wizard can begin to injure them he must undo all the knots inthe net, or take off the girdles. But often a Russian amulet is merely a knotted thread. Askein of red wool wound about the arms and legs is thought to ward off agues and fevers;and nine skeins, fastened round a child’s neck, are deemed a preservative againstscarlatina. In the Tver Government a bag of a special kind is tied to the neck of the cowwhich walks before the rest of a herd, in order to keep off wolves; its force binds the mawof the ravening beast. On the same principle, a padlock is carried thrice round a herd ofhorses before they go afield in the spring, and the bearer locks and unlocks it as he goes,saying, “I lock from my herd the mouths of the grey wolves with this steel lock.”Knots and locks may serve to avert not only wizards and wolves but death itself. When theybrought a woman to the stake at St. Andrews in 1572 to burn her alive for a witch, theyfound on her a white cloth like a collar, with strings and many knots on the strings. Theytook it from her, sorely against her will, for she seemed to think that she could not die inthe fire, if only the cloth with the knotted strings was on her. When it was taken away, shesaid, “Now I have no hope of myself.” In many parts of England it is thought that a person"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"cannot die so long as any locks are locked or bolts shot in the house. It is therefore a verycommon practice to undo all locks and bolts when the sufferer is plainly near his end, inorder that his agony may not be unduly prolonged. For example, in the year 1863, atTaunton, a child lay sick of scarlatina and death seemed inevitable. “A jury of matronswas, as it were, empanelled, and to prevent the child ‘dying hard’ all the doors in the house,all the drawers, all the boxes, all the cupboards were thrown wide open, the keys taken out,and the body of the child placed under a beam, whereby a sure, certain, and easy passageinto eternity could be secured.” Strange to say, the child declined to avail itself of thefacilities for dying so obligingly placed at its disposal by the sagacity and experience of theBritish matrons of Taunton; it preferred to live rather than give up the ghost just then.The rule which prescribes that at certain magical and religious ceremonies the hair shouldhang loose and the feet should be bare is probably based on the same fear of trammellingand impeding the action in hand, whatever it may be, by the presence of any knot orconstriction, whether on the head or on the feet of the performer. A similar power to bindand hamper spiritual as well as bodily activities is ascribed by some people to rings. Thusin the island of Carpathus people never button the clothes they put upon a dead body andthey are careful to remove all rings from it; “for the spirit, they say, can even be detainedin the little finger, and cannot rest.” Here it is plain that even if the soul is not definitelysupposed to issue at death from the finger-tips, yet the ring is conceived to exercise acertain constrictive influence which detains and imprisons the immortal spirit in spite of itsefforts to escape from the tabernacle of clay; in short the ring, like the knot, acts as aspiritual fetter. This may have been the reason of an ancient Greek maxim, attributed toPythagoras, which forbade people to wear rings. Nobody might enter the ancient Arcadiansanctuary of the Mistress at Lycosura with a ring on his or her finger. Persons whoconsulted the oracle of Faunus had to be chaste, to eat no flesh, and to wear no rings.On the other hand, the same constriction which hinders the egress of the soul may preventthe entrance of evil spirits; hence we find rings used as amulets against demons, witches,and ghosts. In the Tyrol it is said that a woman in childbed should never take off herwedding-ring, or spirits and witches will have power over her. Among the Lapps, theperson who is about to place a corpse in the coffin receives from the husband, wife, orchildren of the deceased a brass ring, which he must wear fastened to his right arm untilthe corpse is safely deposited in the grave. The ring is believed to serve the person as anamulet against any harm which the ghost might do to him. How far the custom of wearingfinger-rings may have been influenced by, or even have sprung from, a belief in theirefficacy as amulets to keep the soul in the body, or demons out of it, is a question whichseems worth considering. Here we are only concerned with the belief in so far as it seems tothrow light on the rule that the Flamen Dialis might not wear a ring unless it were broken.Taken in conjunction with the rule which forbade him to have a knot on his garments, itpoints to a fear that the powerful spirit embodied in him might be trammelled andhampered in its goings-out and comings-in by such corporeal and spiritual fetters as ringsand knots."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"XXII. Tabooed Words1. Personal Names tabooedUNABLE to discriminate clearly between words and things, the savage commonly fanciesthat the link between a name and the person or thing denominated by it is not a merearbitrary and ideal association, but a real and substantial bond which unites the two insuch a way that magic may be wrought on a man just as easily through his name asthrough his hair, his nails, or any other material part of his person. In fact, primitive manregards his name as a vital portion of himself and takes care of it accordingly. Thus, forexample, the North American Indian “regards his name, not as a mere label, but as adistinct part of his personality, just as much as are his eyes or his teeth, and believes thatinjury will result as surely from the malicious handling of his name as from a woundinflicted on any part of his physical organism. This belief was found among the varioustribes from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and has occasioned a number of curious regulationsin regard to the concealment and change of names.” Some Esquimaux take new nameswhen they are old, hoping thereby to get a new lease of life. The Tolampoos of Celebesbelieve that if you write a man’s name down you can carry off his soul along with it. Manysavages at the present day regard their names as vital parts of themselves, and thereforetake great pains to conceal their real names, lest these should give to evil-disposed personsa handle by which to injure their owners.Thus, to begin with the savages who rank at the bottom of the social scale, we are told thatthe secrecy with which among the Australian aborigines personal names are often keptfrom general knowledge “arises in great measure from the belief that an enemy, whoknows your name, has in it something which he can use magically to your detriment.” “AnAustralian black,” says another writer, “is always very unwilling to tell his real name, andthere is no doubt that this reluctance is due to the fear that through his name he may beinjured by sorcerers.” Amongst the tribes of Central Australia every man, woman, andchild has, besides a personal name which is in common use, a secret or sacred name whichis bestowed by the older men upon him or her soon after birth, and which is known to nonebut the fully initiated members of the group. This secret name is never mentioned exceptupon the most solemn occasions; to utter it in the hearing of women or of men of anothergroup would be a most serious breach of tribal custom, as serious as the most flagrant caseof sacrilege among ourselves. When mentioned at all, the name is spoken only in a whisper,and not until the most elaborate precautions have been taken that it shall be heard by noone but members of the group. “The native thinks that a stranger knowing his secret namewould have special power to work him ill by means of magic.”The same fear seems to have led to a custom of the same sort amongst the ancientEgyptians, whose comparatively high civilisation was strangely dashed and chequered withrelics of the lowest savagery. Every Egyptian received two names, which were knownrespectively as the true name and the good name, or the great name and the little name;and while the good or little name was made public, the true or great name appears to havebeen carefully concealed. A Brahman child receives two names, one for common use, theother a secret name which none but his father and mother should know. The latter is only"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"used at ceremonies such as marriage. The custom is intended to protect the person againstmagic, since a charm only becomes effectual in combination with the real name. Similarly,the natives of Nias believe that harm may be done to a person by the demons who hear hisname pronounced. Hence the names of infants, who are especially exposed to the assaults ofevil sprits, are never spoken; and often in haunted spots, such as the gloomy depths of theforest, the banks of a river, or beside a bubbling spring, men will abstain from calling eachother by their names for a like reason.The Indians of Chiloe keep their names secret and do not like to have them uttered aloud;for they say that there are fairies or imps on the mainland or neighbouring islands who, ifthey knew folk’s names, would do them an injury; but so long as they do not know thenames, these mischievous sprites are powerless. The Araucanians will hardly ever tell astranger their names because they fear that he would thereby acquire some supernaturalpower over themselves. Asked his name by a stranger, who is ignorant of theirsuperstitions, an Araucanian will answer, “I have none.” When an Ojebway is asked hisname, he will look at some bystander and ask him to answer. “This reluctance arises froman impression they receive when young, that if they repeat their own names it will preventtheir growth, and they will be small in stature. On account of this unwillingness to tell theirnames, many strangers have fancied that they either have no names or have forgottenthem.”In this last case no scruple seems to be felt about communicating a man’s name tostrangers, and no ill effects appear to be dreaded as a consequence of divulging it; harm isonly done when a name is spoken by its owner. Why is this? and why in particular should aman be thought to stunt his growth by uttering his own name? We may conjecture that tosavages who act and think thus a person’s name only seems to be a part of himself when itis uttered with his own breath; uttered by the breath of others it has no vital connexionwith him, and no harm can come to him through it. Whereas, so these primitivephilosophers may have argued, when a man lets his own name pass his lips, he is partingwith a living piece of himself, and if he persists in so reckless a course he must certainly endby dissipating his energy and shattering his constitution. Many a broken-down debauchee,many a feeble frame wasted with disease, may have been pointed out by these simplemoralists to their awe-struck disciples as a fearful example of the fate that must sooner orlater overtake the profligate who indulges immoderately in the seductive habit ofmentioning his own name.However we may explain it, the fact is certain that many a savage evinces the strongestreluctance to pronounce his own name, while at the same time he makes no objection at allto other people pronouncing it, and will even invite them to do so for him in order to satisfythe curiosity of an inquisitive stranger. Thus in some parts of Madagascar it is taboo for aperson to tell his own name, but a slave or attendant will answer for him. The same curiousinconsistency, as it may seem to us, is recorded of some tribes of American Indians. Thuswe are told that “the name of an American Indian is a sacred thing, not to be divulged bythe owner himself without due consideration. One may ask a warrior of any tribe to givehis name, and the question will be met with either a point-blank refusal or the morediplomatic evasion that he cannot understand what is wanted of him. The moment a friendapproaches, the warrior first interrogated will whisper what is wanted, and the friend can"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"tell the name, receiving a reciprocation of the courtesy from the other.” This generalstatement applies, for example, to the Indian tribes of British Columbia, as to whom it issaid that “one of their strangest prejudices, which appears to pervade all tribes alike, is adislike to telling their names—thus you never get a man’s right name from himself; butthey will tell each other’s names without hesitation.” In the whole of the East IndianArchipelago the etiquette is the same. As a general rule no one will utter his own name. Toenquire, “What is your name?” is a very indelicate question in native society. When in thecourse of administrative or judicial business a native is asked his name, instead of replyinghe will look at his comrade to indicate that he is to answer for him, or he will say straightout, “Ask him.” The superstition is current all over the East Indies without exception, andit is found also among the Motu and Motumotu tribes, the Papuans of Finsch Haven inNorth New Guinea, the Nufoors of Dutch New Guinea, and the Melanesians of theBismarck Archipelago. Among many tribes of South Africa men and women never mentiontheir names if they can get any one else to do it for them, but they do not absolutely refusewhen it cannot be avoided.Sometimes the embargo laid on personal names is not permanent; it is conditional oncircumstances, and when these change it ceases to operate. Thus when the Nandi men areaway on a foray, nobody at home may pronounce the names of the absent warriors; theymust be referred to as birds. Should a child so far forget itself as to mention one of thedistant ones by name, the mother would rebuke it, saying, “Don’t talk of the birds who arein the heavens.” Among the Bangala of the Upper Congo, while a man is fishing and whenhe returns with his catch, his proper name is in abeyance and nobody may mention it.Whatever the fisherman’s real name may be, he is called mwele without distinction. Thereason is that the river is full of spirits, who, if they heard the fisherman’s real name, mightso work against him that he would catch little or nothing. Even when he has caught his fishand landed with them, the buyer must still not address him by his proper name, but mustonly call him mwele; for even then, if the spirits were to hear his proper name, they wouldeither bear it in mind and serve him out another day, or they might so mar the fish he hadcaught that he would get very little for them. Hence the fisherman can extract heavydamages from anybody who mentions his name, or can compel the thoughtless speaker torelieve him of the fish at a good price so as to restore his luck. When the Sulka of NewBritain are near the territory of their enemies the Gaktei, they take care not to mentionthem by their proper name, believing that were they to do so, their foes would attack andslay them. Hence in these circumstances they speak of the Gaktei as o lapsiek, that is, “therotten tree-trunks,” and they imagine that by calling them that they make the limbs of theirdreaded enemies ponderous and clumsy like logs. This example illustrates the extremelymaterialistic view which these savages take of the nature of words; they suppose that themere utterance of an expression signifying clumsiness will homoeopathically affect withclumsiness the limbs of their distant foemen. Another illustration of this curiousmisconception is furnished by a Caffre superstition that the character of a young thief canbe reformed by shouting his name over a boiling kettle of medicated water, then clapping alid on the kettle and leaving the name to steep in the water for several days. It is not in theleast necessary that the thief should be aware of the use that is being made of his namebehind his back; the moral reformation will be effected without his knowledge.When it is deemed necessary that a man’s real name should be kept secret, it is often"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"customary, as we have seen, to call him by a surname or nickname. As distinguished fromthe real or primary names, these secondary names are apparently held to be no part of theman himself, so that they may be freely used and divulged to everybody withoutendangering his safety thereby. Sometimes in order to avoid the use of his own name a manwill be called after his child. Thus we are informed that “the Gippsland blacks objectedstrongly to let any one outside the tribe know their names, lest their enemies, learningthem, should make them vehicles of incantation, and so charm their lives away. As childrenwere not thought to have enemies, they used to speak of a man as ‘the father, uncle, orcousin of So-and-so,’ naming a child; but on all occasions abstained from mentioning thename of a grown-up person.” The Alfoors of Poso in Celebes will not pronounce their ownnames. Among them, accordingly, if you wish to ascertain a person’s name, you ought notto ask the man himself, but should enquire of others. But if this is impossible, for example,when there is no one else near, you should ask him his child’s name, and then address himas the “Father of So-and-so.” Nay, these Alfoors are shy of uttering the names even ofchildren; so when a boy or girl has a nephew or niece, he or she is addressed as “Uncle ofSo-and-so,” or “Aunt of So-and-so.” In pure Malay society, we are told, a man is neverasked his name, and the custom of naming parents after their children is adopted only as ameans of avoiding the use of the parents’ own names. The writer who makes this statementadds in confirmation of it that childless persons are named after their younger brothers.Among the Land Dyaks children as they grow up are called, according to their sex, thefather or mother of a child of their father’s or mother’s younger brother or sister, that is,they are called the father or mother of what we should call their first cousin. The Caffresused to think it discourteous to call a bride by her own name, so they would call her “theMother of So-and-so,” even when she was only betrothed, far less a wife and a mother.Among the Kukis and Zemis or Kacha Nagas of Assam parents drop their names after thebirth of a child and are named Father and Mother of So-and-so. Childless couples go by thename of “the childless father,” “the childless mother,” “the father of no child,” “the motherof no child.” The widespread custom of naming a father after his child has sometimes beensupposed to spring from a desire on the father’s part to assert his paternity, apparently asa means of obtaining those rights over his children which had previously, under a system ofmother-kin, been possessed by the mother. But this explanation does not account for theparallel custom of naming the mother after her child, which seems commonly to co-existwith the practice of naming the father after the child. Still less, if possible, does it apply tothe customs of calling childless couples the father and mother of children which do notexist, of naming people after their younger brothers, and of designating children as theuncles and aunts of So-and-so, or as the fathers and mothers of their first cousins. But allthese practices are explained in a simple and natural way if we suppose that they originatein a reluctance to utter the real names of persons addressed or directly referred to. Thatreluctance is probably based partly on a fear of attracting the notice of evil spirits, partlyon a dread of revealing the name to sorcerers, who would thereby obtain a handle forinjuring the owner of the name.2. Names of Relations tabooedIT might naturally be expected that the reserve so commonly maintained with regard to"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"personal names would be dropped or at least relaxed among relations and friends. But thereverse of this is often the case. It is precisely the persons most intimately connected byblood and especially by marriage to whom the rule applies with the greatest stringency.Such people are often forbidden, not only to pronounce each other’s names, but even toutter ordinary words which resemble or have a single syllable in common with thesenames. The persons who are thus mutually debarred from mentioning each other’s namesare especially husbands and wives, a man and his wife’s parents, and a woman and herhusband’s father. For example, among the Caffres a woman may not publicly pronouncethe birth-name of her husband or of any of his brothers, nor may she use the interdictedword in its ordinary sense. If her husband, for instance, be called u-Mpaka, from impaka, asmall feline animal, she must speak of that beast by some other name. Further, a Caffrewife is forbidden to pronounce even mentally the names of her father-in-law and of all herhusband’s male relations in the ascending line; and whenever the emphatic syllable of anyof their names occurs in another word, she must avoid it by substituting either an entirelynew word, or, at least, another syllable in its place. Hence this custom has given rise to analmost distinct language among the women, which the Caffres call “women’s speech.” Theinterpretation of this “women’s speech” is naturally very difficult, “for no definite rulescan be given for the formation of these substituted words, nor is it possible to form adictionary of them, their number being so great—since there may be many women, even inthe same tribe, who would be no more at liberty to use the substitutes employed by someothers, than they are to use the original words themselves.” A Caffre man, on his side, maynot mention the name of his mother-in-law, nor may she pronounce his; but he is free toutter words in which the emphatic syllable of her name occurs. A Kirghiz woman dares notpronounce the names of the older relations of her husband, nor even use words whichresemble them in sound. For example, if one of these relations is called Shepherd, she maynot speak of sheep, but must call them “the bleating ones”; if his name is Lamb, she mustrefer to lambs as “the young bleating ones.” In Southern India wives believe that to telltheir husband’s name or to pronounce it even in a dream would bring him to an untimelyend. Among the Sea Dyaks a man may not pronounce the name of his father-in-law ormother-in-law without incurring the wrath of the spirits. And since he reckons as hisfather-in-law and mother-in-law not only the father and mother of his own wife, but alsothe fathers and mothers of his brothers’ wives and sisters’ husbands, and likewise thefathers and mothers of all his cousins, the number of tabooed names may be veryconsiderable and the opportunities of error correspondingly numerous. To make confusionworse confounded, the names of persons are often the names of common things, such asmoon, bridge, barley, cobra, leopard; so that when any of a man’s many fathers-in-law andmothers-in-law are called by such names, these common words may not pass his lips.Among the Alfoors of Minahassa, in Celebes, the custom is carried still further so as toforbid the use even of words which merely resemble the personal names in sound. It isespecially the name of a father-in-law which is thus laid under an interdict. If he, forexample, is called Kalala, his son-in-law may not speak of a horse by its common namekawalo; he must call it a “riding-beast” (sasakajan). So among the Alfoors of the island ofBuru it is taboo to mention the names of parents and parents-in-law, or even to speak ofcommon objects by words which resemble these names in sound. Thus, if your mother-in-law is called Dalu, which means “betel,” you may not ask for betel by its ordinary name,you must ask for “red mouth”; if you want betel-leaf, you may not say betel-leaf (dalu"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"’mun), you must say karon fenna. In the same island it is also taboo to mention the name ofan elder brother in his presence. Transgressions of these rules are punished with fines. InSunda it is thought that a particular crop would be spoilt if a man were to mention thenames of his father and mother.Among the Nufoors of Dutch New Guinea persons who are related to each other bymarriage are forbidden to mention each other’s names. Among the connexions whosenames are thus tabooed are wife, mother-in-law, father-in-law, your wife’s uncles andaunts and also her grand-uncles and grand-aunts, and the whole of your wife’s or yourhusband’s family in the same generation as yourself, except that men may mention thenames of their brothers-in-law, though women may not. The taboo comes into operation assoon as the betrothal has taken place and before the marriage has been celebrated.Families thus connected by the betrothal of two of their members are not only forbidden topronounce each other’s names; they may not even look at each other, and the rule givesrise to the most comical scenes when they happen to meet unexpectedly. And not merely thenames themselves, but any words that sound like them are scrupulously avoided and otherwords used in their place. If it should chance that a person has inadvertently uttered aforbidden name, he must at once throw himself on the floor and say, “I have mentioned awrong name. I throw it through the chinks of the floor in order that I may eat well.”In the western islands of Torres Straits a man never mentioned the personal names of hisfather-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, and sister-in-law; and a woman was subjectto the same restrictions. A brother-in-law might be spoken of as the husband or brother ofsome one whose name it was lawful to mention; and similarly a sister-in-law might becalled the wife of So-and-so. If a man by chance used the personal name of his brother-in-law, he was ashamed and hung his head. His shame was only relieved when he had made apresent as compensation to the man whose name he had taken in vain. The samecompensation was made to a sister-in-law, a father-in-law, and a mother-in-law for theaccidental mention of their names. Among the natives who inhabit the coast of the GazellePeninsula in New Britain to mention the name of a brother-in-law is the grossest possibleaffront you can offer to him; it is a crime punishable with death. In the Banks’ Islands,Melanesia, the taboos laid on the names of persons connected by marriage are very strict.A man will not mention the name of his father-in-law, much less the name of his mother-in-law, nor may he name his wife’s brother; but he may name his wife’s sister—she is nothingto him. A woman may not name her father-in-law, nor on any account her son-in-law. Twopeople whose children have intermarried are also debarred from mentioning each other’snames. And not only are all these persons forbidden to utter each other’s names; they maynot even pronounce ordinary words which chance to be either identical with these names orto have any syllables in common with them. Thus we hear of a native of these islands whomight not use the common words for “pig” and “to die,” because these words occurred inthe polysyllabic name of his son-in-law; and we are told of another unfortunate who mightnot pronounce the everyday words for “hand” and “hot” on account of his wife’s brother’sname, and who was even debarred from mentioning the number “one,” because the wordfor “one” formed part of the name of his wife’s cousin.The reluctance to mention the names or even syllables of the names of persons connectedwith the speaker by marriage can hardly be separated from the reluctance evinced by so"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"many people to utter their own names or the names of the dead or of the dead or of chiefsand kings; and if the reticence as to these latter names springs mainly from superstition, wemay infer that the reticence as to the former has no better foundation. That the savage’sunwillingness to mention his own name is based, at least in part, on a superstitious fear ofthe ill use that might be made of it by his foes, whether human or spiritual, has alreadybeen shown. It remains to examine the similar usage in regard to the names of the dead andof royal personages.3. Names of the Dead tabooedTHE CUSTOM of abstaining from all mention of the names of the dead was observed inantiquity by the Albanians of the Caucasus, and at the present day it is in full force amongmany savage tribes. Thus we are told that one of the customs most rigidly observed andenforced amongst the Australian aborigines is never to mention the name of a deceasedperson, whether male or female; to name aloud one who has departed this life would be agross violation of their most sacred prejudices, and they carefully abstain from it. The chiefmotive for this abstinence appears to be a fear of evoking the ghost, although the naturalunwillingness to revive past sorrows undoubtedly operates also to draw the veil of oblivionover the names of the dead. Once Mr. Oldfield so terrified a native by shouting out thename of a deceased person, that the man fairly took to his heels and did not venture toshow himself again for several days. At their next meeting he bitterly reproached the rashwhite man for his indiscretion; “nor could I,” adds Mr. Oldfield, “induce him by anymeans to utter the awful sound of a dead man’s name, for by so doing he would haveplaced himself in the power of the malign spirits.” Among the aborigines of Victoria thedead were very rarely spoken of, and then never by their names; they were referred to in asubdued voice as “the lost one” or “the poor fellow that is no more.” To speak of them byname would, it was supposed, excite the malignity of Couit-gil, the spirit of the departed,which hovers on earth for a time before it departs for ever towards the setting sun. Of thetribes on the Lower Murray River we are told that when a person dies “they carefullyavoid mentioning his name; but if compelled to do so, they pronounce it in a very lowwhisper, so faint that they imagine the spirit cannot hear their voice.” Amongst the tribesof Central Australia no one may utter the name of the deceased during the period ofmourning, unless it is absolutely necessary to do so, and then it is only done in a whisperfor fear of disturbing and annoying the man’s spirit which is walking about in ghostlyform. If the ghost hears his name mentioned he concludes that his kinsfolk are notmourning for him properly; if their grief were genuine they could not bear to bandy hisname about. Touched to the quick by their hard-hearted indifference the indignant ghostwill come and trouble them in dreams.The same reluctance to utter the names of the dead appears to prevail among all the Indiantribes of America from Hudson’s Bay Territory to Patagonia. Among the Goajiros ofColombia to mention the dead before his kinsmen is a dreadful offence, which is oftenpunished with death; for if it happens on the rancho of the deceased, in presence of hisnephew or uncle, they will assuredly kill the offender on the spot if they can. But if heescapes, the penalty resolves itself into a heavy fine, usually of two or more oxen."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"A similar reluctance to mention the names of the dead is reported of peoples so widelyseparated from each other as the Samoyeds of Siberia and the Todas of Southern India; theMongols of Tartary and the Tuaregs of the Sahara; the Ainos of Japan and the Akambaand Nandi of Eastern Africa; the Tinguianes of the Philippines and the inhabitants of theNicobar Islands, of Borneo, of Madagascar, and of Tasmania. In all cases, even where it isnot expressly stated, the fundamental reason for this avoidance is probably the fear of theghost. That this is the real motive with the Tuaregs we are positively informed. They dreadthe return of the dead man’s spirit, and do all they can to avoid it by shifting their campafter a death, ceasing for ever to pronounce the name of the departed, and eschewingeverything that might be regarded as an evocation or recall of his soul. Hence they do not,like the Arabs, designate individuals by adding to their personal names the names of theirfathers; they never speak of So-and-so, son of So-and-so; they give to every man a namewhich will live and die with him. So among some of the Victorian tribes in Australiapersonal names were rarely perpetuated, because the natives believed that any one whoadopted the name of a deceased person would not live long; probably his ghostly namesakewas supposed to come and fetch him away to the spirit-land.The same fear of the ghost, which moves people to suppress his old name, naturally leadsall persons who bear a similar name to exchange it for another, lest its utterance shouldattract the attention of the ghost, who cannot reasonably be expected to discriminatebetween all the different applications of the same name. Thus we are told that in theAdelaide and Encounter Bay tribes of South Australia the repugnance to mentioning thenames of those who have died lately is carried so far, that persons who bear the same nameas the deceased abandon it, and either adopt temporary names or are known by any othersthat happen to belong to them. A similar custom prevails among some of the Queenslandtribes; but the prohibition to use the names of the dead is not permanent, though it maylast for many years. In some Australian tribes the change of name thus brought about ispermanent; the old name is laid aside for ever, and the man is known by his new name forthe rest of his life, or at least until he is obliged to change it again for a like reason. Amongthe North American Indians all persons, whether men or women, who bore the name of onewho had just died were obliged to abandon it and to adopt other names, which wasformally done at the first ceremony of mourning for the dead. In some tribes to the east ofthe Rocky Mountains this change of name lasted only during the season of mourning, butin other tribes on the Pacific Coast of North America it seems to have been permanent.Sometimes by an extension of the same reasoning all the near relations of the deceasedchange their names, whatever they may happen to be, doubtless from a fear that the soundof the familiar names might lure back the vagrant spirit to its old home. Thus in someVictorian tribes the ordinary names of all the next of kin were disused during the period ofmourning, and certain general terms, prescribed by custom, were substituted for them. Tocall a mourner by his own name was considered an insult to the departed, and often led tofighting and bloodshed. Among Indian tribes of North-western America near relations ofthe deceased often change their names “under an impression that spirits will be attractedback to earth if they hear familiar names often repeated.” Among the Kiowa Indians thename of the dead is never spoken in the presence of the relatives, and on the death of anymember of a family all the others take new names. This custom was noted by Raleigh’scolonists on Roanoke Island more than three centuries ago. Among the Lengua Indians not"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"only is a dead man’s name never mentioned, but all the survivors change their names also.They say that Death has been among them and has carried off a list of the living, and thathe will soon come back for more victims; hence in order to defeat his fell purpose theychange their names, believing that on his return Death, though he has got them all on hislist, will not be able to identify them under their new names, and will depart to pursue thesearch elsewhere. Nicobarese mourners take new names in order to escape the unwelcomeattentions of the ghost; and for the same purpose they disguise themselves by shaving theirheads so that the ghost is unable to recognise them.Further, when the name of the deceased happens to be that of some common object, such asan animal, or plant, or fire, or water, it is sometimes considered necessary to drop thatword in ordinary speech and replace it by another. A custom of this sort, it is plain, mayeasily be a potent agent of change in language; for where it prevails to any considerableextent many words must constantly become obsolete and new ones spring up. And thistendency has been remarked by observers who have recorded the custom in Australia,America, and elsewhere. For example, with regard to the Australian aborigines it has beennoted that “the dialects change with almost every tribe. Some tribes name their childrenafter natural objects; and when the person so named dies, the word is never againmentioned; another word has therefore to be invented for the object after which the childwas called.” The writer gives as an instance the case of a man whose name Karla signified“fire”; when Karla died, a new word for fire had to be introduced. “Hence,” adds thewriter, “the language is always changing.” Again, in the Encounter Bay tribe of SouthAustralia, if a man of the name of Ngnke, which means “water,” were to die, the wholetribe would be obliged to use some other word to express water for a considerable timeafter his decease. The writer who records this custom surmises that it may explain thepresence of a number of synonyms in the language of the tribe. This conjecture isconfirmed by what we know of some Victorian tribes whose speech comprised a regular setof synonyms to be used instead of the common terms by all members of a tribe in times ofmourning. For instance, if a man called Waa ( “crow”) departed this life, during the periodof mourning for him nobody might call a crow a waa; everybody had to speak of the birdas a narrapart. When a person who rejoiced in the title of Ringtail Opossum (weearn) hadgone the way of all flesh, his sorrowing relations and the tribe at large were bound for atime to refer to ringtail opossums by the more sonorous name of manuungkuurt. If thecommunity were plunged in grief for the loss of a respected female who bore thehonourable name of Turkey Bustard, the proper name for turkey bustards, which wasbarrim barrim, went out, and tillit tilliitsh came in. And so mutatis mutandis with the namesof Black Cockatoo, Grey Duck, Gigantic Crane, Kangaroo, Eagle, Dingo, and the rest.A similar custom used to be constantly transforming the language of the Abipones ofParaguay, amongst whom, however, a word once abolished seems never to have beenrevived. New words, says the missionary Dobrizhoffer, sprang up every year likemushrooms in a night, because all words that resembled the names of the dead wereabolished by proclamation and others coined in their place. The mint of words was in thehands of the old women of the tribe, and whatever term they stamped with their approvaland put in circulation was immediately accepted without a murmur by high and low alike,and spread like wildfire through every camp and settlement of the tribe. You would beastonished, says the same missionary, to see how meekly the whole nation acquiesces in the"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"decision of a withered old hag, and how completely the old familiar words fall instantly outof use and are never repeated either through force of habit or forgetfulness. In the sevenyears that Dobrizhoffer spent among these Indians the native word for jaguar was changedthrice, and the words for crocodile, thorn, and the slaughter of cattle underwent similarthough less varied vicissitudes. As a result of this habit, the vocabularies of the missionariesteemed with erasures, old words having constantly to be struck out as obsolete and newones inserted in their place. In many tribes of British New Guinea the names of persons arealso the names of common things. The people believe that if the name of a deceased personis pronounced, his spirit will return, and as they have no wish to see it back among themthe mention of his name is tabooed and a new word is created to take its place, wheneverthe name happens to be a common term of the language. Consequently many words arepermanently lost or revived with modified or new meanings. In the Nicobar Islands asimilar practice has similarly affected the speech of the natives. “A most singular custom,”says Mr. de Roepstorff, “prevails among them which one would suppose must mosteffectually hinder the ‘making of history,’ or, at any rate, the transmission of historicalnarrative. By a strict rule, which has all the sanction of Nicobar superstition, no man’sname may be mentioned after his death! To such a length is this carried that when, as veryfrequently happens, the man rejoiced in the name of ‘Fowl,’ ‘Hat’, ‘Fire,’ ‘Road,’ etc., in itsNicobarese equivalent, the use of these words is carefully eschewed for the future, not onlyas being the personal designation of the deceased, but even as the names of the commonthings they represent; the words die out of the language, and either new vocables arecoined to express the thing intended, or a substitute for the disused word is found in otherNicobarese dialects or in some foreign tongue. This extraordinary custom not only adds anelement of instability to the language, but destroys the continuity of political life, andrenders the record of past events precarious and vague, if not impossible.”That a superstition which suppresses the names of the dead must cut at the very root ofhistorical tradition has been remarked by other workers in this field. “The Klamathpeople,” observes Mr. A. S. Gatschet, “possess no historic traditions going further back intime than a century, for the simple reason that there was a strict law prohibiting themention of the person or acts of a deceased individual by using his name. This law wasrigidly observed among the Californians no less than among the Oregonians, and on itstransgression the death penalty could be inflicted. This is certainly enough to suppress allhistorical knowledge within a people. How can history be written without names?”In many tribes, however, the power of this superstition to blot out the memory of the past isto some extent weakened and impaired by a natural tendency of the human mind. Time,which wears out the deepest impressions, inevitably dulls, if it does not wholly efface, theprint left on the savage mind by the mystery and horror of death. Sooner or later, as thememory of his loved ones fades slowly away, he becomes more willing to speak of them, andthus their rude names may sometimes be rescued by the philosophic enquirer before theyhave vanished, like autumn leaves or winter snows, into the vast undistinguished limbo ofthe past. In some of the Victorian tribes the prohibition to mention the names of the deadremained in force only during the period of mourning; in the Port Lincoln tribe of SouthAustralia it lasted many years. Among the Chinook Indians of North America “customforbids the mention of a dead man’s name, at least till many years have elapsed after thebereavement.” Among the Puyallup Indians the observance of the taboo is relaxed after"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"several years, when the mourners have forgotten their grief; and if the deceased was afamous warrior, one of his descendants, for instance a great-grandson, may be named afterhim. In this tribe the taboo is not much observed at any time except by the relations of thedead. Similarly the Jesuit missionary Lafitau tells us that the name of the departed and thesimilar names of the survivors were, so to say, buried with the corpse until, the poignancyof their grief being abated, it pleased the relations “to lift up the tree and raise the dead.”By raising the dead they meant bestowing the name of the departed upon some one else,who thus became to all intents and purposes a reincarnation of the deceased, since on theprinciples of savage philosophy the name is a vital part, if not the soul, of the man.Among the Lapps, when a woman was with child and near the time of her delivery, adeceased ancestor or relation used to appear to her in a dream and inform her what deadperson was to be born again in her infant, and whose name the child was therefore to bear.If the woman had no such dream, it fell to the father or the relatives to determine the nameby divination or by consulting a wizard. Among the Khonds a birth is celebrated on theseventh day after the event by a feast given to the priest and to the whole village. Todetermine the child’s name the priest drops grains of rice into a cup of water, naming witheach grain a deceased ancestor. From the movements of the seed in the water, and fromobservations made on the person of the infant, he pronounces which of his progenitors hasreappeared in him, and the child generally, at least among the northern tribes, receives thename of that ancestor. Among the Yorubas, soon after a child has been born, a priest of Ifa,the god of divination, appears on the scene to ascertain what ancestral soul has been rebornin the infant. As soon as this has been decided, the parents are told that the child mustconform in all respects to the manner of life of the ancestor who now animates him or her,and if, as often happens, they profess ignorance, the priest supplies the necessaryinformation. The child usually receives the name of the ancestor who has been born againin him.4. Names of Kings and other Sacred Persons tabooedWHEN we see that in primitive society the names of mere commoners, whether alive ordead, are matters of such anxious care, we need not be surprised that great precautionsshould be taken to guard from harm the names of sacred kings and priests. Thus the nameof the king of Dahomey is always kept secret, lest the knowledge of it should enable someevil-minded person to do him a mischief. The appellations by which the different kings ofDahomey have been known to Europeans are not their true names, but mere titles, or whatthe natives call “strong names.” The natives seem to think that no harm comes of such titlesbeing known, since they are not, like the birth-names, vitally connected with their owners.In the Galla kingdom of Ghera the birth-name of the sovereign may not be pronounced bya subject under pain of death, and common words which resemble it in sound are changedfor others. Among the Bahima of Central Africa, when the king dies, his name is abolishedfrom the language, and if his name was that of an animal, a new appellation must be foundfor the creature at once. For example, the king is often called a lion; hence at the death of aking named Lion a new name for lions in general has to be coined. In Siam it used to bedifficult to ascertain the king’s real name, since it was carefully kept secret from fear ofsorcery; any one who mentioned it was clapped into gaol. The king might only be referred"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"to under certain high-sounding titles, such as “the august,” “the perfect,” “the supreme,”“the great emperor,” “descendant of the angels,” and so on. In Burma it was accounted animpiety of the deepest dye to mention the name of the reigning sovereign; Burmesesubjects, even when they were far from their country, could not be prevailed upon to do so;after his accession to the throne the king was known by his royal titles only.Among the Zulus no man will mention the name of the chief of his tribe or the names of theprogenitors of the chief, so far as he can remember them; nor will he utter common wordswhich coincide with or merely resemble in sound tabooed names. In the tribe of theDwandwes there was a chief called Langa, which means the sun; hence the name of the sunwas changed from langa to gala, and so remains to this day, though Langa died more thana hundred years ago. Again, in the Xnumayo tribe the word meaning “to herd cattle” waschanged from alusa or ayusa to kagesa, because u-Mayusi was the name of the chief.Besides these taboos, which were observed by each tribe separately, all the Zulu tribesunited in tabooing the name of the king who reigned over the whole nation. Hence, forexample, when Panda was king of Zululand, the word for “a root of a tree,” which isimpando, was changed to nxabo. Again, the word for “lies” or “slander” was altered fromamacebo to amakwata, because amacebo contains a syllable of the name of the famous KingCetchwayo. These substitutions are not, however, carried so far by the men as by thewomen, who omit every sound even remotely resembling one that occurs in a tabooedname. At the king’s kraal, indeed, it is sometimes difficult to understand the speech of theroyal wives, as they treat in this fashion the names not only of the king and his forefathers,but even of his and their brothers back for generations. When to these tribal and nationaltaboos we add those family taboos on the names of connexions by marriage which havebeen already described, we can easily understand how it comes about that in Zululandevery tribe has words peculiar to itself, and that the women have a considerable vocabularyof their own. Members, too, of one family may be debarred from using words employed bythose of another. The women of one kraal, for instance, may call a hyaena by its ordinaryname; those of the next may use the common substitute; while in a third the substitute mayalso be unlawful and another term may have to be invented to supply its place. Hence theZulu language at the present day almost presents the appearance of being a double one;indeed, for multitudes of things it possesses three or four synonyms, which through theblending of tribes are known all over Zululand.In Madagascar a similar custom everywhere prevails and has resulted, as among the Zulus,in producing certain dialectic differences in the speech of the various tribes. There are nofamily names in Madagascar, and almost every personal name is drawn from the languageof daily life and signifies some common object or action or quality, such as a bird, a beast, atree, a plant, a colour, and so on. Now, whenever one of these common words forms thename or part of the name of the chief of the tribe, it becomes sacred and may no longer beused in its ordinary signification as the name of a tree, an insect, or what not. Hence a newname for the object must be invented to replace the one which has been discarded. It is easyto conceive what confusion and uncertainty may thus be introduced into a language when itis spoken by many little local tribes each ruled by a petty chief with his own sacred name.Yet there are tribes and people who submit to this tyranny of words as their fathers didbefore them from time immemorial. The inconvenient results of the custom are especiallymarked on the western coast of the island, where, on account of the large number of"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"independent chieftains, the names of things, places, and rivers have suffered so manychanges that confusion often arises, for when once common words have been banned by thechiefs the natives will not acknowledge to have ever known them in their old sense.But it is not merely the names of living kings and chiefs which are tabooed in Madagascar;the names of dead sovereigns are equally under a ban, at least in some parts of the island.Thus among the Sakalavas, when a king has died, the nobles and people meet in councilround the dead body and solemnly choose a new name by which the deceased monarchshall be henceforth known. After the new name has been adopted, the old name by whichthe king was known during his life becomes sacred and may not be pronounced under painof death. Further, words in the common language which bear any resemblance to theforbidden name also become sacred and have to be replaced by others. Persons whouttered these forbidden words were looked on not only as grossly rude, but even as felons;they had committed a capital crime. However, these changes of vocabulary are confined tothe district over which the deceased king reigned; in the neighbouring districts the oldwords continue to be employed in the old sense.The sanctity attributed to the persons of chiefs in Polynesia naturally extended also to theirnames, which on the primitive view are hardly separable from the personality of theirowners. Hence in Polynesia we find the same systematic prohibition to utter the names ofchiefs or of common words resembling them which we have already met with in Zululandand Madagascar. Thus in New Zealand the name of a chief is held so sacred that, when ithappens to be a common word, it may not be used in the language, and another has to befound to replace it. For example, a chief of the southward of East Cape bore the name ofMaripi, which signified a knife, hence a new word (nekra) for knife was introduced, and theold one became obsolete. Elsewhere the word for water (wai) had to be changed, because itchanced to be the name of the chief, and would have been desecrated by being applied tothe vulgar fluid as well as to his sacred person. This taboo naturally produced a plentifulcrop of synonyms in the Maori language, and travellers newly arrived in the country weresometimes puzzled at finding the same things called by quite different names inneighbouring tribes. When a king comes to the throne in Tahiti, any words in the languagethat resemble his name in sound must be changed for others. In former times, if any manwere so rash as to disregard this custom and to use the forbidden words, not only he but allhis relations were immediately put to death. But the changes thus introduced were onlytemporary; on the death of the king the new words fell into disuse, and the original oneswere revived.In ancient Greece the names of the priests and other high officials who had to do with theperformance of the Eleusinian mysteries might not be uttered in their lifetime. Topronounce them was a legal offence The pedant in Lucian tells how he fell in with theseaugust personages haling along to the police court a ribald fellow who had dared to namethem, though well he knew that ever since their consecration it was unlawful to do so,because they had become anonymous, having lost their old names and acquired new andsacred titles. From two inscriptions found at Eleusis it appears that the names of the priestswere committed to the depths of the sea; probably they were engraved on tablets of bronzeor lead, which were then thrown into deep water in the Gulf of Salamis. The intentiondoubtless was to keep the names a profound secret; and how could that be done more"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"surely than by sinking them in the sea? what human vision could spy them glimmering fardown in the dim depths of the green water? A clearer illustration of the confusion betweenthe incorporeal and the corporeal, between the name and its material embodiment, couldhardly be found than in this practice of civilised Greece.5. Names of Gods tabooedPRIMITIVE man creates his gods in his own image. Xenophanes remarked long ago thatthe complexion of negro gods was black and their noses flat; that Thracian gods wereruddy and blue-eyed; and that if horses, oxen, and lions only believed in gods and hadhands wherewith to portray them, they would doubtless fashion their deities in the form ofhorses, and oxen, and lions. Hence just as the furtive savage conceals his real name becausehe fears that sorcerers might make an evil use of it, so he fancies that his gods must likewisekeep their true name secret, lest other gods or even men should learn the mystic soundsand thus be able to conjure with them. Nowhere was this crude conception of the secrecyand magical virtue of the divine name more firmly held or more fully developed than inancient Egypt, where the superstitions of a dateless past were embalmed in the hearts of thepeople hardly less effectually than the bodies of cats and crocodiles and the rest of thedivine menagerie in their rock-cut tombs. The conception is well illustrated by a storywhich tells how the subtle Isis wormed his secret name from Ra, the great Egyptian god ofthe sun. Isis, so runs the tale, was a woman mighty in words, and she was weary of theworld of men, and yearned after the world of the gods. And she meditated in her heart,saying, “Cannot I by virtue of the great name of Ra make myself a goddess and reign likehim in heaven and earth?” For Ra had many names, but the great name which gave him allpower over gods and men was known to none but himself. Now the god was by this timegrown old; he slobbered at the mouth and his spittle fell upon the ground. So Isis gatheredup the spittle and the earth with it, and kneaded thereof a serpent and laid it in the pathwhere the great god passed every day to his double kingdom after his heart’s desire. Andwhen he came forth according to his wont, attended by all his company of gods, the sacredserpent stung him, and the god opened his mouth and cried, and his cry went up to heaven.And the company of gods cried, “What aileth thee?” and the gods shouted, “Lo andbehold!” But he could not answer; his jaws rattled, his limbs shook, the poison ran throughhis flesh as the Nile floweth over the land. When the great god had stilled his heart, he criedto his followers, “Come to me, O my children, offspring of my body. I am a prince, the sonof a prince, the divine seed of a god. My father devised my name; my father and my mothergave me my name, and it remained hidden in my body since my birth, that no magicianmight have magic power over me. I went out to behold that which I have made, I walked inthe two lands which I have created, and lo! something stung me. What it was, I know not.Was it fire? was it water? My heart is on fire, my flesh trembleth, all my limbs do quake.Bring me the children of the gods with healing words and understanding lips, whose powerreacheth to heaven.” Then came to him the children of the gods, and they were verysorrowful. And Isis came with her craft, whose mouth is full of the breath of life, whosespells chase pain away, whose word maketh the dead to live. She said, “What is it, divineFather? what is it?” The holy god opened his mouth, he spake and said, “I went upon myway, I walked after my heart’s desire in the two regions which I have made to behold that"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"which I have created, and lo! a serpent that I saw not stung me. Is it fire? is it water? I amcolder than water, I am hotter than fire, all my limbs sweat, I tremble, mine eye is notsteadfast, I behold not the sky, the moisture bedeweth my face as in summer-time.” Thenspake Isis, “Tell me thy name, divine Father, for the man shall live who is called by hisname.” Then answered Ra, “I created the heavens and the earth, I ordered the mountains,I made the great and wide sea, I stretched out the two horizons like a curtain. I am he whoopeneth his eyes and it is light, and who shutteth them and it is dark. At his command theNile riseth, but the gods know not his name. I am Khepera in the morning, I am Ra atnoon, I am Tum at eve.” But the poison was not taken away from him; it pierced deeper,and the great god could no longer walk. Then said Isis to him, “That was not thy name thatthou spakest unto me. Oh tell it me, that the poison may depart; for he shall live whosename is named.” Now the poison burned like fire, it was hotter than the flame of fire. Thegod said, “I consent that Isis shall search into me, and that my name shall pass from mybreast into hers.” Then the god hid himself from the gods, and his place in the ship ofeternity was empty. Thus was the name of the great god taken from him, and Isis, thewitch, spake, “Flow away, poison, depart from Ra. It is I, even I, who overcome the poisonand cast it to the earth; for the name of the great god hath been taken away from him. LetRa live and let the poison die.” Thus spake great Isis, the queen of the gods, she who knowsRa and his true name.From this story it appears that the real name of the god, with which his power wasinextricably bound up, was supposed to be lodged, in an almost physical sense, somewherein his breast, from which Isis extracted it by a sort of surgical operation and transferred itwith all its supernatural powers to herself. In Egypt attempts like that of Isis to appropriatethe power of a high god by possessing herself of his name were not mere legends told of themythical beings of a remote past; every Egyptian magician aspired to wield like powers bysimilar means. For it was believed that he who possessed the true name possessed the verybeing of god or man, and could force even a deity to obey him as a slave obeys his master.Thus the art of the magician consisted in obtaining from the gods a revelation of theirsacred names, and he left no stone unturned to accomplish his end. When once a god in amoment of weakness or forgetfulness had imparted to the wizard the wondrous lore, thedeity had no choice but to submit humbly to the man or pay the penalty of his contumacy.The belief in the magic virtue of divine names was shared by the Romans. When they satdown before a city, the priests addressed the guardian deity of the place in a set form ofprayer or incantation, inviting him to abandon the beleaguered city and come over to theRomans, who would treat him as well as or better than he had ever been treated in his oldhome. Hence the name of the guardian deity of Rome was kept a profound secret, lest theenemies of the republic might lure him away, even as the Romans themselves had inducedmany gods to desert, like rats, the falling fortunes of cities that had sheltered them inhappier days. Nay, the real name, not merely of its guardian deity, but of the city itself, waswrapt in mystery and might never be uttered, not even in the sacred rites. A certainValerius Soranus, who dared to divulge the priceless secret, was put to death or came to abad end. In like manner, it seems, the ancient Assyrians were forbidden to mention themystic names of their cities; and down to modern times the Cheremiss of the Caucasuskeep the names of their communal villages secret from motives of superstition."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"If the reader has had the patience to follow this examination of the superstitions attachingto personal names, he will probably agree that the mystery in which the names of royalpersonages are so often shrouded is no isolated phenomenon, no arbitrary expression ofcourtly servility and adulation, but merely the particular application of a general law ofprimitive thought, which includes within its scope common folk and gods as well as kingsand priests.XXIII. Our Debt to the SavageIT would be easy to extend the list of royal and priestly taboos, but the instances collectedin the preceding pages may suffice as specimens. To conclude this part of our subject itonly remains to state summarily the general conclusions to which our enquiries have thusfar conducted us. We have seen that in savage or barbarous society there are often foundmen to whom the superstition of their fellows ascribes a controlling influence over thegeneral course of nature. Such men are accordingly adored and treated as gods. Whetherthese human divinities also hold temporal sway over the lives and fortunes of their adorers,or whether their functions are purely spiritual and supernatural, in other words, whetherthey are kings as well as gods or only the latter, is a distinction which hardly concerns ushere. Their supposed divinity is the essential fact with which we have to deal. In virtue of itthey are a pledge and guarantee to their worshippers of the continuance and orderlysuccession of those physical phenomena upon which mankind depends for subsistence.Naturally, therefore, the life and health of such a god-man are matters of anxious concernto the people whose welfare and even existence are bound up with his; naturally he isconstrained by them to conform to such rules as the wit of early man has devised foraverting the ills to which flesh is heir, including the last ill, death. These rules, as anexamination of them has shown, are nothing but the maxims with which, on the primitiveview, every man of common prudence must comply if he would live long in the land. Butwhile in the case of ordinary men the observance of the rules is left to the choice of theindividual, in the case of the god-man it is enforced under penalty of dismissal from hishigh station, or even of death. For his worshippers have far too great a stake in his life toallow him to play fast and loose with it. Therefore all the quaint superstitions, the old-world maxims, the venerable saws which the ingenuity of savage philosophers elaboratedlong ago, and which old women at chimney corners still impart as treasures of great priceto their descendants gathered round the cottage fire on winter evenings—all these antiquefancies clustered, all these cobwebs of the brain were spun about the path of the old king,the human god, who, immeshed in them like a fly in the toils of a spider, could hardly stir alimb for the threads of custom, “light as air but strong as links of iron,” that crossing andrecrossing each other in an endless maze bound him fast within a network of observancesfrom which death or deposition alone could release him.Thus to students of the past the life of the old kings and priests teems with instruction. In itwas summed up all that passed for wisdom when the world was young. It was the perfectpattern after which every man strove to shape his life; a faultless model constructed withrigorous accuracy upon the lines laid down by a barbarous philosophy. Crude and false asthat philosophy may seem to us, it would be unjust to deny it the merit of logical"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"consistency. Starting from a conception of the vital principle as a tiny being or soul existingin, but distinct and separable from, the living being, it deduces for the practical guidance oflife a system of rules which in general hangs well together and forms a fairly complete andharmonious whole. The flaw—and it is a fatal one—of the system lies not in its reasoning,but in its premises; in its conception of the nature of life, not in any irrelevancy of theconclusions which it draws from that conception. But to stigmatise these premises asridiculous because we can easily detect their falseness, would be ungrateful as well asunphilosophical. We stand upon the foundation reared by the generations that have gonebefore, and we can but dimly realise the painful and prolonged efforts which it has costhumanity to struggle up to the point, no very exalted one after all, which we have reached.Our gratitude is due to the nameless and forgotten toilers, whose patient thought and activeexertions have largely made us what we are. The amount of new knowledge which one age,certainly which one man, can add to the common store is small, and it argues stupidity ordishonesty, besides ingratitude, to ignore the heap while vaunting the few grains which itmay have been our privilege to add to it. There is indeed little danger at present ofundervaluing the contributions which modern times and even classical antiquity have madeto the general advancement of our race. But when we pass these limits, the case is different.Contempt and ridicule or abhorrence and denunciation are too often the only recognitionvouchsafed to the savage and his ways. Yet of the benefactors whom we are boundthankfully to commemorate, many, perhaps most, were savages. For when all is said anddone our resemblances to the savage are still far more numerous than our differences fromhim; and what we have in common with him, and deliberately retain as true and useful, weowe to our savage forefathers who slowly acquired by experience and transmitted to us byinheritance those seemingly fundamental ideas which we are apt to regard as original andintuitive. We are like heirs to a fortune which has been handed down for so many ages thatthe memory of those who built it up is lost, and its possessors for the time being regard it ashaving been an original and unalterable possession of their race since the beginning of theworld. But reflection and enquiry should satisfy us that to our predecessors we areindebted for much of what we thought most our own, and that their errors were not wilfulextravagances or the ravings of insanity, but simply hypotheses, justifiable as such at thetime when they were propounded, but which a fuller experience has proved to beinadequate. It is only by the successive testing of hypotheses and rejection of the false thattruth is at last elicited. After all, what we call truth is only the hypothesis which is found towork best. Therefore in reviewing the opinions and practices of ruder ages and races weshall do well to look with leniency upon their errors as inevitable slips made in the searchfor truth, and to give them the benefit of that indulgence which we ourselves may one daystand in need of: cum excusatione itaque veteres audiendi sunt.XXIV. The Killing of the Divine King1. The Mortality of the GodsMAN has created gods in his own likeness and being himself mortal he has naturallysupposed his creatures to be in the same sad predicament. Thus the Greenlanders believed"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"that a wind could kill their most powerful god, and that he would certainly die if hetouched a dog. When they heard of the Christian God, they kept asking if he never died,and being informed that he did not, they were much surprised, and said that he must be avery great god indeed. In answer to the enquiries of Colonel Dodge, a North AmericanIndian stated that the world was made by the Great Spirit. Being asked which Great Spirithe meant, the good one or the bad one, “Oh, neither of them,” replied he, “the Great Spiritthat made the world is dead long ago. He could not possibly have lived as long as this.” Atribe in the Philippine Islands told the Spanish conquerors that the grave of the Creatorwas upon the top of Mount Cabunian. Heitsi-eibib, a god or divine hero of the Hottentots,died several times and came to life again. His graves are generally to be met with in narrowdefiles between mountains. When the Hottentots pass one of them, they throw a stone on itfor good luck, sometimes muttering, “Give us plenty of cattle.” The grave of Zeus, the greatgod of Greece, was shown to visitors in Crete as late as about the beginning of our era. Thebody of Dionysus was buried at Delphi beside the golden statue of Apollo, and his tombbore the inscription, “Here lies Dionysus dead, the son of Semele.” According to oneaccount, Apollo himself was buried at Delphi; for Pythagoras is said to have carved aninscription on his tomb, setting forth how the god had been killed by the python and buriedunder the tripod.The great gods of Egypt themselves were not exempt from the common lot. They too grewold and died. But when at a later time the discovery of the art of embalming gave a newlease of life to the souls of the dead by preserving their bodies for an indefinite time fromcorruption, the deities were permitted to share the benefit of an invention which held out togods as well as to men a reasonable hope of immortality. Every province then had the tomband mummy of its dead god. The mummy of Osiris was to be seen at Mendes; Thinisboasted of the mummy of Anhouri; and Heliopolis rejoiced in the possession of that ofToumou. The high gods of Babylon also, though they appeared to their worshippers only indreams and visions, were conceived to be human in their bodily shape, human in theirpassions, and human in their fate; for like men they were born into the world, and like menthey loved and fought and died.2. Kings killed when their Strength failsIF THE HIGH gods, who dwell remote from the fret and fever of this earthly life, are yetbelieved to die at last, it is not to be expected that a god who lodges in a frail tabernacle offlesh should escape the same fate, though we hear of African kings who have imaginedthemselves immortal by virtue of their sorceries. Now primitive peoples, as we have seen,sometimes believe that their safety and even that of the world is bound up with the life ofone of these god-men or human incarnations of the divinity. Naturally, therefore, they takethe utmost care of his life, out of a regard for their own. But no amount of care andprecaution will prevent the man-god from growing old and feeble and at last dying. Hisworshippers have to lay their account with this sad necessity and to meet it as best they can.The danger is a formidable one; for if the course of nature is dependent on the man-god’slife, what catastrophes may not be expected from the gradual enfeeblement of his powersand their final extinction in death? There is only one way of averting these dangers. Theman-god must be killed as soon as he shows symptoms that his powers are beginning to fail,"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"and his soul must be transferred to a vigorous successor before it has been seriouslyimpaired by the threatened decay. The advantages of thus putting the man-god to deathinstead of allowing him to die of old age and disease are, to the savage, obvious enough. Forif the man-god dies what we call a natural death, it means, according to the savage, that hissoul has either voluntarily departed from his body and refuses to return, or morecommonly that it has been extracted, or at least detained in its wanderings, by a demon orsorcerer. In any of these cases the soul of the man-god is lost to his worshippers, and with ittheir prosperity is gone and their very existence endangered. Even if they could arrange tocatch the soul of the dying god as it left his lips or his nostrils and so transfer it to asuccessor, this would not effect their purpose; for, dying of disease, his soul wouldnecessarily leave his body in the last stage of weakness and exhaustion, and so enfeebled itwould continue to drag out a languid, inert existence in any body to which it might betransferred. Whereas by slaying him his worshippers could, in the first place, make sure ofcatching his soul as it escaped and transferring it to a suitable successor; and, in the secondplace, by putting him to death before his natural force was abated, they would secure thatthe world should not fall into decay with the decay of the man-god. Every purpose,therefore, was answered, and all dangers averted by thus killing the man-god andtransferring his soul, while yet at its prime, to a vigorous successor.The mystic kings of Fire and Water in Cambodia are not allowed to die a natural death.Hence when one of them is seriously ill and the elders think that he cannot recover, theystab him to death. The people of Congo believed, as we have seen, that if their pontiff theChitomé were to die a natural death, the world would perish, and the earth, which he alonesustained by his power and merit, would immediately be annihilated. Accordingly when hefell ill and seemed likely to die, the man who was destined to be his successor entered thepontiff’s house with a rope or a club and strangled or clubbed him to death. The Ethiopiankings of Meroe were worshipped as gods; but whenever the priests chose, they sent amessenger to the king, ordering him to die, and alleging an oracle of the gods as theirauthority for the command. This command the kings always obeyed down to the reign ofErgamenes, a contemporary of Ptolemy II., King of Egypt. Having received a Greekeducation which emancipated him from the superstitions of his countrymen, Ergamenesventured to disregard the command of the priests, and, entering the Golden Temple with abody of soldiers, put the priests to the sword.Customs of the same sort appear to have prevailed in this part of Africa down to moderntimes. In some tribes of Fazoql the king had to administer justice daily under a certain tree.If from sickness or any other cause he was unable to discharge this duty for three wholedays, he was hanged on the tree in a noose, which contained two razors so arranged thatwhen the noose was drawn tight by the weight of the king’s body they cut his throat.A custom of putting their divine kings to death at the first symptoms of infirmity or old ageprevailed until lately, if indeed it is even now extinct and not merely dormant, among theShilluk of the White Nile, and in recent years it has been carefully investigated by Dr. C. G.Seligman. The reverence which the Shilluk pay to their king appears to arise chiefly fromthe conviction that he is a reincarnation of the spirit of Nyakang, the semi-divine hero whofounded the dynasty and settled the tribe in their present territory. It is a fundamentalarticle of the Shilluk creed that the spirit of the divine or semi-divine Nyakang is incarnate"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"in the reigning king, who is accordingly himself invested to some extent with the characterof a divinity. But while the Shilluk hold their kings in high, indeed religious reverence andtake every precaution against their accidental death, nevertheless they cherish “theconviction that the king must not be allowed to become ill or senile, lest with hisdiminishing vigour the cattle should sicken and fail to bear their increase, the crops shouldrot in the fields, and man, stricken with disease, should die in ever-increasing numbers.”To prevent these calamities it used to be the regular custom with the Shilluk to put the kingto death whenever he showed signs of ill-health or failing strength. One of the fatalsymptoms of decay was taken to be an incapacity to satisfy the sexual passions of his wives,of whom he has very many, distributed in a large number of houses at Fashoda. When thisominous weakness manifested itself, the wives reported it to the chiefs, who are popularlysaid to have intimated to the king his doom by spreading a white cloth over his face andknees as he lay slumbering in the heat of the sultry afternoon. Execution soon followed thesentence of death. A hut was specially built for the occasion: the king was led into it and laydown with his head resting on the lap of a nubile virgin: the door of the hut was thenwalled up; and the couple were left without food, water, or fire to die of hunger andsuffocation. This was the old custom, but it was abolished some five generations ago onaccount of the excessive sufferings of one of the kings who perished in this way. It is saidthat the chiefs announce his fate to the king, and that afterwards he is strangled in a hutwhich has been specially built for the occasion.From Dr. Seligman’s enquiries it appears that not only was the Shilluk king liable to bekilled with due ceremony at the first symptoms of incipient decay, but even while he wasyet in the prime of health and strength he might be attacked at any time by a rival andhave to defend his crown in a combat to the death. According to the common Shilluktradition any son of a king had the right thus to fight the king in possession and, if hesucceeded in killing him, to reign in his stead. As every king had a large harem and manysons, the number of possible candidates for the throne at any time may well have been notinconsiderable, and the reigning monarch must have carried his life in his hand. But theattack on him could only take place with any prospect of success at night; for during theday the king surrounded himself with his friends and bodyguards, and an aspirant to thethrone could hardly hope to cut his way through them and strike home. It was otherwise atnight. For then the guards were dismissed and the king was alone in his enclosure with hisfavourite wives, and there was no man near to defend him except a few herdsmen, whosehuts stood a little way off. The hours of darkness were therefore the season of peril for theking. It is said that he used to pass them in constant watchfulness, prowling round his hutsfully armed, peering into the blackest shadows, or himself standing silent and alert, like asentinel on duty, in some dark corner. When at last his rival appeared, the fight would takeplace in grim silence, broken only by the clash of spears and shields, for it was a point ofhonour with the king not to call the herdsmen to his assistance.Like Nyakang himself, their founder, each of the Shilluk kings after death is worshipped ata shrine, which is erected over his grave, and the grave of a king is always in the villagewhere he was born. The tomb-shrine of a king resembles the shrine of Nyakang, consistingof a few huts enclosed by a fence; one of the huts is built over the king’s grave, the othersare occupied by the guardians of the shrine. Indeed the shrines of Nyakang and the shrinesof the kings are scarcely to be distinguished from each other, and the religious rituals"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"observed at all of them are identical in form and vary only in matters of detail, thevariations being due apparently to the far greater sanctity attributed to the shrines ofNyakang. The grave-shrines of the kings are tended by certain old men or women, whocorrespond to the guardians of the shrines of Nyakang. They are usually widows or oldmen-servants of the deceased king, and when they die they are succeeded in their office bytheir descendants. Moreover, cattle are dedicated to the grave-shrines of the kings andsacrifices are offered at them just as at the shrines of Nyakang.In general the principal element in the religion of the Shilluk would seem to be the worshipwhich they pay to their sacred or divine kings, whether dead or alive. These are believed tobe animated by a single divine spirit, which has been transmitted from the semi-mythical,but probably in substance historical, founder of the dynasty through all his successors tothe present day. Hence, regarding their kings as incarnate divinities on whom the welfareof men, of cattle, and of the corn implicitly depends, the Shilluk naturally pay them thegreatest respect and take every care of them; and however strange it may seem to us, theircustom of putting the divine king to death as soon as he shows signs of ill-health or failingstrength springs directly from their profound veneration for him and from their anxiety topreserve him, or rather the divine spirit by which he is animated, in the most perfect stateof efficiency: nay, we may go further and say that their practice of regicide is the best proofthey can give of the high regard in which they hold their kings. For they believe, as we haveseen, that the king’s life or spirit is so sympathetically bound up with the prosperity of thewhole country, that if he fell ill or grew senile the cattle would sicken and cease to multiply,the crops would rot in the fields, and men would perish of widespread disease. Hence, intheir opinion, the only way of averting these calamities is to put the king to death while heis still hale and hearty, in order that the divine spirit which he has inherited from hispredecessors may be transmitted in turn by him to his successor while it is still in fullvigour and has not yet been impaired by the weakness of disease and old age. In thisconnexion the particular symptom which is commonly said to seal the king’s death-warrantis highly significant; when he can no longer satisfy the passions of his numerous wives, inother words, when he has ceased, whether partially or wholly, to be able to reproduce hiskind, it is time for him to die and to make room for a more vigorous successor. Taken alongwith the other reasons which are alleged for putting the king to death, this one suggeststhat the fertility of men, of cattle, and of the crops is believed to depend sympathetically onthe generative power of the king, so that the complete failure of that power in him wouldinvolve a corresponding failure in men, animals, and plants, and would thereby entail at nodistant date the entire extinction of all life, whether human, animal, or vegetable. Nowonder, that with such a danger before their eyes the Shilluk should be most careful not tolet the king die what we should call a natural death of sickness or old age. It ischaracteristic of their attitude towards the death of the kings that they refrain fromspeaking of it as death: they do not say that a king has died but simply that he has “goneaway” like his divine ancestors Nyakang and Dag, the two first kings of the dynasty, bothof whom are reported not to have died but to have disappeared. The similar legends of themysterious disappearance of early kings in other lands, for example at Rome and inUganda, may well point to a similar custom of putting them to death for the purpose ofpreserving their life.On the whole the theory and practice of the divine kings of the Shilluk correspond very"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"nearly to the theory and practice of the priests of Nemi, the Kings of the Wood, if my viewof the latter is correct. In both we see a series of divine kings on whose life the fertility ofmen, of cattle, and of vegetation is believed to depend, and who are put to death, whether insingle combat or otherwise, in order that their divine spirit may be transmitted to theirsuccessors in full vigour, uncontaminated by the weakness and decay of sickness or old age,because any such degeneration on the part of the king would, in the opinion of hisworshippers, entail a corresponding degeneration on manking, on cattle, and on the crops.Some points in this explanation of the custom of putting divine kings to death, particularlythe method of transmitting their divine souls to their successors, will be dealt with morefully in the sequel. Meantime we pass to other examples of the general practice.The Dinka are a congeries of independent tribes in the valley of the White Nile. They areessentially a pastoral people, passionately devoted to the care of their numerous herds ofoxen, though they also keep sheep and goats, and the women cultivate small quantities ofmillet and sesame. For their crops and above all for their pastures they depend on theregularity of the rains: in seasons of prolonged drought they are said to be reduced to greatextremities. Hence the rain-maker is a very important personage among them to this day;indeed the men in authority whom travellers dub chiefs or sheikhs are in fact the actual orpotential rain-makers of the tribe or community. Each of them is believed to be animatedby the spirit of a great rain-maker, which has come down to him through a succession ofrain-makers; and in virtue of this inspiration a successful rain-maker enjoys very greatpower and is consulted on all important matters. Yet in spite, or rather in virtue, of thehigh honour in which he is held, no Dinka rain-maker is allowed to die a natural death ofsickness or old age; for the Dinka believe that if such an untoward event were to happen,the tribe would suffer from disease and famine, and the herds would not yield theirincrease. So when a rain-maker feels that he is growing old and infirm, he tells his childrenthat he wishes to die. Among the Agar Dinka a large grave is dug and the rain-maker liesdown in it, surrounded by his friends and relatives. From time to time he speaks to thepeople, recalling the past history of the tribe, reminding them how he has ruled andadvised them, and instructing them how they are to act in the future. Then, when he hasconcluded his admonition, he bids them cover him up. So the earth is thrown down on himas he lies in the grave, and he soon dies of suffocation. Such, with minor variations, appearsto be the regular end of the honourable career of a rain-maker in all the Dinka tribes. TheKhor-Adar Dinka told Dr. Seligman that when they have dug the grave for their rain-maker they strangle him in his house. The father and paternal uncle of one of Dr.Seligman’s informants had both been rain-makers and both had been killed in the mostregular and orthodox fashion. Even if a rain-maker is quite young he will be put to deathshould he seem likely to perish of disease. Further, every precaution is taken to prevent arain-maker from dying an accidental death, for such an end, though not nearly so serious amatter as death from illness or old age, would be sure to entail sickness on the tribe. Assoon as a rain-maker is killed, his valuable spirit is supposed to pass to a suitable successor,whether a son or other near blood relation.In the Central African kingdom of Bunyoro down to recent years custom required that assoon as the king fell seriously ill or began to break up from age, he should die by his ownhand; for, according to an old prophecy, the throne would pass away from the dynasty ifever the king were to die a natural death. He killed himself by draining a poisoned cup. If"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"he faltered or were too ill to ask for the cup, it was his wife’s duty to administer the poison.When the king of Kibanga, on the Upper Congo, seems near his end, the sorcerers put arope round his neck, which they draw gradually tighter till he dies. If the king of Gingirohappens to be wounded in war, he is put to death by his comrades, or, if they fail to killhim, by his kinsfolk, however hard he may beg for mercy. They say they do it that he maynot die by the hands of his enemies. The Jukos are a heathen tribe of the Benue River, agreat tributary of the Niger. In their country “the town of Gatri is ruled by a king who iselected by the big men of the town as follows. When in the opinion of the big men the kinghas reigned long enough, they give out that ‘the king is sick’—a formula understood by allto mean that they are going to kill him, though the intention is never put more plainly.They then decide who is to be the next king. How long he is to reign is settled by theinfluential men at a meeting; the question is put and answered by each man throwing onthe ground a little piece of stick for each year he thinks the new king should rule. The kingis then told, and a great feast prepared, at which the king gets drunk on guinea-corn beer.After that he is speared, and the man who was chosen becomes king. Thus each Juko kingknows that he cannot have very many more years to live, and that he is certain of hispredecessor’s fate. This, however, does not seem to frighten candidates. The same customof king-killing is said to prevail at Quonde and Wukari as well as at Gatri.” In the threeHausa kingdoms of Gobir, Katsina, and Daura, in Northern Nigeria, as soon as a kingshowed signs of failing health or growing infirmity, an official who bore the title of Killer ofthe Elephant appeared and throttled him.The Matiamvo is a great king or emperor in the interior of Angola. One of the inferiorkings of the country, by name Challa, gave to a Portuguese expedition the followingaccount of the manner in which the Matiamvo comes by his end. “It has been customary,”he said, “for our Matiamvos to die either in war or by a violent death, and the presentMatiamvo must meet this last fate, as, in consequence of his great exactions, he has livedlong enough. When we come to this understanding, and decide that he should be killed, weinvite him to make war with our enemies, on which occasion we all accompany him and hisfamily to the war, when we lose some of our people. If he escapes unhurt, we return to thewar again and fight for three or four days. We then suddenly abandon him and his familyto their fate, leaving him in the enemy’s hands. Seeing himself thus deserted, he causes histhrone to be erected, and, sitting down, calls his family around him. He then orders hismother to approach; she kneels at his feet; he first cuts off her head, then decapitates hissons in succession, next his wives and relatives, and, last of all, his most beloved wife, calledAnacullo. This slaughter being accomplished, the Matiamvo, dressed in all his pomp,awaits his own death, which immediately follows, by an officer sent by the powerfulneighbouring chiefs, Caniquinha and Canica. This officer first cuts off his legs and arms atthe joints, and lastly he cuts off his head; after which the head of the officer is struck off.All the potentates retire from the encampment, in order not to witness his death. It is myduty to remain and witness his death, and to mark the place where the head and arms havebeen deposited by the two great chiefs, the enemies of the Matiamvo. They also takepossession of all the property belonging to the deceased monarch and his family, whichthey convey to their own residence. I then provide for the funeral of the mutilated remainsof the late Matiamvo, after which I retire to his capital and proclaim the new government. Ithen return to where the head, legs, and arms have been deposited, and, for forty slaves, Iransom them, together with the merchandise and other property belonging to the deceased,"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"which I give up to the new Matiamvo, who has been proclaimed. This is what has happenedto many Matiamvos, and what must happen to the present one.”It appears to have been a Zulu custom to put the king to death as soon as he began to havewrinkles or grey hairs. At least this seems implied in the following passage written by onewho resided for some time at the court of the notorious Zulu tyrant Chaka, in the earlypart of the nineteenth century: “The extraordinary violence of the king’s rage with me wasmainly occasioned by that absurd nostrum, the hair oil, with the notion of which Mr.Farewell had impressed him as being a specific for removing all indications of age. Fromthe first moment of his having heard that such a preparation was attainable, he evinced asolicitude to procure it, and on every occasion never forgot to remind us of his anxietyrespecting it; more especially on our departure on the mission his injunctions wereparticularly directed to this object. It will be seen that it is one of the barbarous customs ofthe Zoolas in their choice or election of their kings that he must neither have wrinkles norgrey hairs, as they are both distinguishing marks of disqualification for becoming amonarch of a warlike people. It is also equally indispensable that their king should neverexhibit those proofs of having become unfit and incompetent to reign; it is thereforeimportant that they should conceal these indications so long as they possibly can. Chakahad become greatly apprehensive of the approach of grey hairs; which would at once be thesignal for him to prepare to make his exit from this sublunary world, it being alwaysfollowed by the death of the monarch.” The writer to whom we are indebted for thisinstructive anecdote of the hair oil omits to specify the mode in which a grey-haired andwrinkled Zulu chief used “to make his exit from this sublunary world”; but on analogy wemay conjecture that he was killed.The custom of putting kings to death as soon as they suffered from any personal defectprevailed two centuries ago in the Caffre kingdom of Sofala. We have seen that these kingsof Sofala were regarded as gods by their people, being entreated to give rain or sunshine,according as each might be wanted. Nevertheless a slight bodily blemish, such as the loss ofa tooth, was considered a sufficient cause for putting one of these god-men to death, as welearn from the following passage of an old Portuguese historian: “It was formerly thecustom of the kings of this land to commit suicide by taking poison when any disaster ornatural physical defect fell upon them, such as impotence, infectious disease, the loss oftheir front teeth, by which they were disfigured, or any other deformity or affliction. Toput an end to such defects they killed themselves, saying that the king should be free fromany blemish, and if not, it was better for his honour that he should die and seek another lifewhere he would be made whole, for there everything was perfect. But the Quiteve (king)who reigned when I was in those parts would not imitate his predecessors in this, beingdiscreet and dreaded as he was; for having lost a front tooth he caused it to be proclaimedthroughout the kingdom that all should be aware that he had lost a tooth and shouldrecognise him when they saw him without it, and if his predecessors killed themselves forsuch things they were very foolish, and he would not do so; on the contrary, he would bevery sorry when the time came for him to die a natural death, for his life was verynecessary to preserve his kingdom and defend it from his enemies; and he recommendedhis successors to follow his example.”The king of Sofala who dared to survive the loss of his front tooth was thus a bold reformer"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"like Ergamenes, king of Ethiopia. We may conjecture that the ground for putting theEthiopian kings to death was, as in the case of the Zulu and Sofala kings, the appearanceon their person of any bodily defect or sign of decay; and that the oracle which the priestsalleged as the authority for the royal execution was to the effect that great calamities wouldresult from the reign of a king who had any blemish on his body; just as an oracle warnedSparta against a “lame reign,” that is, the reign of a lame king. It is some confirmation ofthis conjecture that the kings of Ethiopia were chosen for their size, strength, and beautylong before the custom of killing them was abolished. To this day the Sultan of Wadai musthave no obvious bodily defect, and the king of Angoy cannot be crowned if he has a singleblemish, such as a broken or a filed tooth or the scar of an old wound. According to theBook of Acaill and many other authorities no king who was afflicted with a personalblemish might reign over Ireland at Tara. Hence, when the great King Cormac Mac Artlost one eye by an accident, he at once abdicated.Many days’ journey to the north-east of Abomey, the old capital of Dahomey, lies thekingdom of Eyeo. “The Eyeos are governed by a king, no less absolute than the king ofDahomey, yet subject to a regulation of state, at once humiliating and extraordinary. Whenthe people have conceived an opinion of his ill-government, which is sometimes insidiouslyinfused into them by the artifice of his discontented ministers, they send a deputation tohim with a present of parrots’ eggs, as a mark of its authenticity, to represent to him thatthe burden of government must have so far fatigued him that they consider it full time forhim to repose from his cares and indulge himself with a little sleep. He thanks his subjectsfor their attention to his ease, retires to his own apartment as if to sleep, and there givesdirections to his women to strangle him. This is immediately executed, and his son quietlyascends the throne upon the usual terms of holding the reins of government no longer thanwhilst he merits the approbation of the people.” About the year 1774, a king of Eyeo, whomhis ministers attempted to remove in the customary manner, positively refused to acceptthe proffered parrots’ eggs at their hands, telling them that he had no mind to take a nap,but on the contrary was resolved to watch for the benefit of his subjects. The ministers,surprised and indignant at his recalcitrancy, raised a rebellion, but were defeated withgreat slaughter, and thus by his spirited conduct the king freed himself from the tyranny ofhis councillors and established a new precedent for the guidance of his successors.However, the old custom seems to have revived and persisted until late in the nineteenthcentury, for a Catholic missionary, writing in 1884, speaks of the practice as if it were stillin vogue. Another missionary, writing in 1881, thus describes the usage of the Egbas andthe Yorubas of West Africa: “Among the customs of the country one of the most curious isunquestionably that of judging, and punishing the king. Should he have earned the hatredof his people by exceeding his rights, one of his councillors, on whom the heavy duty is laid,requires of the prince that he shall ‘go to sleep,’ which means simply ‘take poison and die.’If his courage fails him at the supreme moment, a friend renders him this last service, andquietly, without betraying the secret, they prepare the people for the news of the king’sdeath. In Yoruba the thing is managed a little differently. When a son is born to the king ofOyo, they make a model of the infant’s right foot in clay and keep it in the house of theelders (ogboni). If the king fails to observe the customs of the country, a messenger, withoutspeaking a word, shows him his child’s foot. The king knows what that means. He takespoison and goes to sleep.” The old Prussians acknowledged as their supreme lord a rulerwho governed them in the name of the gods, and was known as “God’s Mouth.” When he"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"felt himself weak and ill, if he wished to leave a good name behind him, he had a great heapmade of thorn-bushes and straw, on which he mounted and delivered a long sermon to thepeople, exhorting them to serve the gods and promising to go to the gods and speak for thepeople. Then he took some of the perpetual fire which burned in front of the holy oak-tree,and lighting the pile with it burned himself to death.3. Kings killed at the End of a Fixed TermIN THE CASES hitherto described, the divine king or priest is suffered by his people toretain office until some outward defect, some visible symptom of failing health oradvancing age, warns them that he is no longer equal to the discharge of his divine duties;but not until such symptoms have made their appearance is he put to death. Some peoples,however, appear to have thought it unsafe to wait for even the slightest symptom of decayand have preferred to kill the king while he was still in the full vigour of life. Accordingly,they have fixed a term beyond which he might not reign, and at the close of which he mustdie, the term fixed upon being short enough to exclude the probability of his degeneratingphysically in the interval. In some parts of Southern India the period fixed was twelveyears. Thus, according to an old traveller, in the province of Quilacare, “there is a Gentilehouse of prayer, in which there is an idol which they hold in great account, and everytwelve years they celebrate a great feast to it, whither all the Gentiles go as to a jubilee.This temple possesses many lands and much revenue: it is a very great affair. This provincehas a king over it, who has not more than twelve years to reign from jubilee to jubilee. Hismanner of living is in this wise, that is to say: when the twelve years are completed, on theday of this feast there assemble together innumerable people, and much money is spent ingiving food to Bramans. The king has a wooden scaffolding made, spread over with silkenhangings: and on that day he goes to bathe at a tank with great ceremonies and sound ofmusic, after that he comes to the idol and prays to it, and mounts on to the scaffolding, andthere before all the people he takes some very sharp knives, and begins to cut off his nose,and then his ears, and his lips, and all his members, and as much flesh off himself as hecan; and he throws it away very hurriedly until so much of his blood is spilled that hebegins to faint, and then he cuts his throat himself. And he performs this sacrifice to theidol, and whoever desires to reign another twelve years and undertake this martyrdom forlove of the idol, has to be present looking on at this: and from that place they raise him upas king.”The king of Calicut, on the Malabar coast, bears the title of Samorin or Samory. He“pretends to be of a higher rank than the Brahmans, and to be inferior only to the invisiblegods; a pretention that was acknowledged by his subjects, but which is held as absurd andabominable by the Brahmans, by whom he is only treated as a Sudra.” Formerly theSamorin had to cut his throat in public at the end of a twelve years’ reign. But towards theend of the seventeenth century the rule had been modified as follows: “Many strangecustoms were observed in this country in former times, and some very odd ones are stillcontinued. It was an ancient custom for the Samorin to reign but twelve years, and nolonger. If he died before his term was expired, it saved him a troublesome ceremony ofcutting his own throat, on a publick scaffold erected for the purpose. He first made a feastfor all his nobility and gentry, who are very numerous. After the feast he saluted his guests,"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"and went on the scaffold, and very decently cut his own throat in the view of the assembly,and his body was, a little while after, burned with great pomp and ceremony, and thegrandees elected a new Samorin. Whether that custom was a religious or a civil ceremony,I know not, but it is now laid aside. And a new custom is followed by the modern Samorins,that jubilee is proclaimed throughout his dominions, at the end of twelve years, and a tentis pitched for him in a spacious plain, and a great feast is celebrated for ten or twelve days,with mirth and jollity, guns firing night and day, so at the end of the feast any four of theguests that have a mind to gain a crown by a desperate action, in fighting their waythrough 30 or 40,000 of his guards, and kill the Samorin in his tent, he that kills himsucceeds him in his empire. In anno 1695, one of those jubilees happened, and the tentpitched near Pennany, a seaport of his, about fifteen leagues to the southward of Calicut.There were but three men that would venture on that desperate action, who fell in, withsword and target, among the guard, and, after they had killed and wounded many, werethemselves killed. One of the desperados had a nephew of fifteen or sixteen years of age,that kept close by his uncle in the attack on the guards, and, when he saw him fall, theyouth got through the guards into the tent, and made a stroke at his Majesty’s head, andhad certainly despatched him if a large brass lamp which was burning over his head hadnot marred the blow; but, before he could make another, he was killed by the guards; and,I believe, the same Samorin reigns yet. I chanced to come that time along the coast andheard the guns for two or three days and nights successively.”The English traveller, whose account I have quoted, did not himself witness the festival hedescribes, though he heard the sound of the firing in the distance. Fortunately, exactrecords of these festivals and of the number of men who perished at them have beenpreserved in the archives of the royal family at Calicut. In the latter part of the nineteenthcentury they were examined by Mr. W. Logan, with the personal assistance of the reigningking, and from his work it is possible to gain an accurate conception both of the tragedyand of the scene where it was periodically enacted down to 1743, when the ceremony tookplace for the last time.The festival at which the king of Calicut staked his crown and his life on the issue of battlewas known as the “Great Sacrifice.” It fell every twelfth year, when the planet Jupiter wasin retrograde motion in the sign of the Crab, and it lasted twenty-eight days, culminating atthe time of the eighth lunar asterism in the month of Makaram. As the date of the festivalwas determined by the position of Jupiter in the sky, and the interval between two festivalswas twelve years, which is roughly Jupiter’s period of revolution round the sun, we mayconjecture that the splendid planet was supposed to be in a special sense the king’s star andto rule his destiny, the period of its revolution in heaven corresponding to the period of hisreign on earth. However that may be, the ceremony was observed with great pomp at theTirunavayi temple, on the north bank of the Ponnani River. The spot is close to the presentrailway line. As the train rushes by, you can just catch a glimpse of the temple, almosthidden behind a clump of trees on the river bank. From the western gateway of the templea perfectly straight road, hardly raised above the level of the surrounding rice-fields andshaded by a fine avenue, runs for half a mile to a high ridge with a precipitous bank, onwhich the outlines of three or four terraces can still be traced. On the topmost of theseterraces the king took his stand on the eventful day. The view which it commands is a fineone. Across the flat expanse of the rice-fields, with the broad placid river winding through"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"them, the eye ranges eastward to high tablelands, their lower slopes embowered in woods,while afar off looms the great chain of the western Ghauts, and in the furthest distance theNeilgherries or Blue Mountains, hardly distinguishable from the azure of the sky above.But it was not to the distant prospect that the king’s eyes naturally turned at this crisis ofhis fate. His attention was arrested by a spectacle nearer at hand. For all the plain belowwas alive with troops, their banners waving gaily in the sun, the white tents of their manycamps standing sharply out against the green and gold of the ricefields. Forty thousandfighting men or more were gathered there to defend the king. But if the plain swarmedwith soldiers, the road that cuts across it from the temple to the king’s stand was clear ofthem. Not a soul was stirring on it. Each side of the way was barred by palisades, and fromthe palisades on either hand a long hedge of spears, held by strong arms, projected into theempty road, their blades meeting in the middle and forming a glittering arch of steel. Allwas now ready. The king waved his sword. At the same moment a great chain of massygold, enriched with bosses, was placed on an elephant at his side. That was the signal. Onthe instant a stir might be seen half a mile away at the gate of the temple. A group ofswordsmen, decked with flowers and smeared with ashes, has stepped out from the crowd.They have just partaken of their last meal on earth, and they now receive the last blessingsand farewells of their friends. A moment more and they are coming down the lane ofspears, hewing and stabbing right and left at the spearmen, winding and turning andwrithing among the blades as if they had no bones in their bodies. It is all in vain. One afterthe other they fall, some nearer the king, some farther off, content to die, not for theshadow of a crown, but for the mere sake of approving their dauntless valour andswordsmanship to the world. On the last days of the festival the same magnificent displayof gallantry, the same useless sacrifice of life was repeated again and again. Yet perhaps nosacrifice is wholly useless which proves that there are men who prefer honour to life.“It is a singular custom in Bengal,” says an old native historian of India, “that there is littleof hereditary descent in succession to the sovereignty... . Whoever kills the king, andsucceeds in placing himself on that throne, is immediately acknowledged as king; all theamirs, wazirs, soldiers, and peasants instantly obey and submit to him, and consider him asbeing as much their sovereign as they did their former prince, and obey his ordersimplicitly. The people of Bengal say, ‘We are faithful to the throne; whoever fills the thronewe are obedient and true to it.’” A custom of the same sort formerly prevailed in the littlekingdom of Passier, on the northern coast of Sumatra. The old Portuguese historian DeBarros, who informs us of it, remarks with surprise that no wise man would wish to be kingof Passier, since the monarch was not allowed by his subjects to live long. From time totime a sort of fury seized the people, and they marched through the streets of the citychanting with loud voices the fatal words, “The king must die!” When the king heard thatsong of death he knew that his hour had come. The man who struck the fatal blow was ofthe royal lineage, and as soon as he had done the deed of blood and seated himself on thethrone he was regarded as the legitimate king, provided that he contrived to maintain hisseat peaceably for a single day. This, however, the regicide did not always succeed in doing.When Fernão Peres d’Andrade, on a voyage to China, put in at Passier for a cargo ofspices, two kings were massacred, and that in the most peaceable and orderly manner,without the smallest sign of tumult or sedition in the city, where everything went on in itsusual course, as if the murder or execution of a king were a matter of everyday occurrence."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Indeed, on one occasion three kings were raised to the dangerous elevation and followedeach other in the dusty road of death in a single day. The people defended the custom,which they esteemed very laudable and even of divine institution, by saying that God wouldnever allow so high and mighty a being as a king, who reigned as his vicegerent on earth, toperish by violence unless for his sins he thoroughly deserved it. Far away from the tropicalisland of Sumatra a rule of the same sort appears to have obtained among the old Slavs.When the captives Gunn and Jarmerik contrived to slay the king and queen of the Slavsand made their escape, they were pursued by the barbarians, who shouted after them thatif they would only come back they would reign instead of the murdered monarch, since bya public statute of the ancients the succession to the throne fell to the king’s assassin. Butthe flying regicides turned a deaf ear to promises which they regarded as mere baits to lurethem back to destruction; they continued their flight, and the shouts and clamour of thebarbarians gradually died away in the distance.When kings were bound to suffer death, whether at their own hands or at the hands ofothers, on the expiration of a fixed term of years, it was natural that they should seek todelegate the painful duty, along with some of the privileges of sovereignty, to a substitutewho should suffer vicariously in their stead. This expedient appears to have been resortedto by some of the princes of Malabar. Thus we are informed by a native authority on thatcountry that “in some places all powers both executive and judicial were delegated for afixed period to natives by the sovereign. This institution was styled Thalavettiparothiam orauthority obtained by decapitation.... It was an office tenable for five years during whichits bearer was invested with supreme despotic powers within his jurisdiction. On the expiryof the five years the man’s head was cut off and thrown up in the air amongst a largeconcourse of villagers, each of whom vied with the other in trying to catch it in its coursedown. He who succeeded was nominated to the post for the next five years.”When once kings, who had hitherto been bound to die a violent death at the end of a termof years, conceived the happy thought of dying by deputy in the persons of others, theywould very naturally put it in practice; and accordingly we need not wonder at finding sopopular an expedient, or traces of it, in many lands. Scandinavian traditions contain somehints that of old the Swedish kings reigned only for periods of nine years, after which theywere put to death or had to find a substitute to die in their stead. Thus Aun or On, king ofSweden, is said to have sacrificed to Odin for length of days and to have been answered bythe god that he should live so long as he sacrificed one of his sons every ninth year. Hesacrificed nine of them in this manner, and would have sacrificed the tenth and last, but theSwedes would not allow him. So he died and was buried in a mound at Upsala. Anotherindication of a similar tenure of the crown occurs in a curious legend of the deposition andbanishment of Odin. Offended at his misdeeds, the other gods outlawed and exiled him, butset up in his place a substitute, Oller by name, a cunning wizard, to whom they accordedthe symbols both of royalty and of godhead. The deputy bore the name of Odin, andreigned for nearly ten years, when he was driven from the throne, while the real Odin cameto his own again. His discomfited rival retired to Sweden and was afterwards slain in anattempt to repair his shattered fortunes. As gods are often merely men who loom largethrough the mists of tradition, we may conjecture that this Norse legend preserves aconfused reminiscence of ancient Swedish kings who reigned for nine or ten years together,then abdicated, delegating to others the privilege of dying for their country. The great"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"festival which was held at Upsala every nine years may have been the occasion on which theking or his deputy was put to death. We know that human sacrifices formed part of therites.There are some grounds for believing that the reign of many ancient Greek kings waslimited to eight years, or at least that at the end of every period of eight years a newconsecration, a fresh outpouring of the divine grace, was regarded as necessary in order toenable them to discharge their civil and religious duties. Thus it was a rule of the Spartanconstitution that every eighth year the ephors should choose a clear and moonless nightand sitting down observe the sky in silence. If during their vigil they saw a meteor orshooting star, they inferred that the king had sinned against the deity, and they suspendedhim from his functions until the Delphic or Olympic oracle should reinstate him in them.This custom, which has all the air of great antiquity, was not suffered to remain a deadletter even in the last period of the Spartan monarchy; for in the third century before ourera a king, who had rendered himself obnoxious to the reforming party, was actuallydeposed on various trumped-up charges, among which the allegation that the ominous signhad been seen in the sky took a prominent place.If the tenure of the regal office was formerly limited among the Spartans to eight years, wemay naturally ask, why was that precise period selected as the measure of a king’s reign?The reason is probably to be found in those astronomical considerations which determinedthe early Greek calendar. The difficulty of reconciling lunar with solar time is one of thestanding puzzles which has taxed the ingenuity of men who are emerging from barbarism.Now an octennial cycle is the shortest period at the end of which sun and moon really marktime together after overlapping, so to say, throughout the whole of the interval. Thus, forexample, it is only once in every eight years that the full moon coincides with the longest orshortest day; and as this coincidence can be observed with the aid of a simple dial, theobservation is naturally one of the first to furnish a base for a calendar which shall bringlunar and solar times into tolerable, though not exact, harmony. But in early days theproper adjustment of the calendar is a matter of religious concern, since on it depends aknowledge of the right seasons for propitiating the deities whose favour is indispensable tothe welfare of the community. No wonder, therefore, that the king, as the chief priest of thestate, or as himself a god, should be liable to deposition or death at the end of anastronomical period. When the great luminaries had run their course on high, and wereabout to renew the heavenly race, it might well be thought that the king should renew hisdivine energies, or prove them unabated, under pain of making room for a more vigoroussuccessor. In Southern India, as we have seen, the king’s reign and life terminated with therevolution of the planet Jupiter round the sun. In Greece, on the other hand, the king’s fateseems to have hung in the balance at the end of every eight years, ready to fly up and kickthe beam as soon as the opposite scale was loaded with a falling star.Whatever its origin may have been, the cycle of eight years appears to have coincided withthe normal length of the king’s reign in other parts of Greece besides Sparta. Thus Minos,king of Cnossus in Crete, whose great palace has been unearthed in recent years, is said tohave held office for periods of eight years together. At the end of each period he retired fora season to the oracular cave on Mount Ida, and there communed with his divine fatherZeus, giving him an account of his kingship in the years that were past, and receiving from"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"him instructions for his guidance in those which were to come. The tradition plainly impliesthat at the end of every eight years the king’s sacred powers needed to be renewed byintercourse with the godhead, and that without such a renewal he would have forfeited hisright to the throne.Without being unduly rash we may surmise that the tribute of seven youths and sevenmaidens whom the Athenians were bound to send to Minos every eight years had someconnexion with the renewal of the king’s power for another octennial cycle. Traditionsvaried as to the fate which awaited the lads and damsels on their arrival in Crete; but thecommon view appears to have been that they were shut up in the labyrinth, there to bedevoured by the Minotaur, or at least to be imprisoned for life. Perhaps they weresacrificed by being roasted alive in a bronze image of a bull, or of a bull-headed man, inorder to renew the strength of the king and of the sun, whom he personated. This at allevents is suggested by the legend of Talos, a bronze man who clutched people to his breastand leaped with them into the fire, so that they were roasted alive. He is said to have beengiven by Zeus to Europa, or by Hephaestus to Minos, to guard the island of Crete, which hepatrolled thrice daily. According to one account he was a bull, according to another he wasthe sun. Probably he was identical with the Minotaur, and stripped of his mythical featureswas nothing but a bronze image of the sun represented as a man with a bull’s head. Inorder to renew the solar fires, human victims may have been sacrificed to the idol by beingroasted in its hollow body or placed on its sloping hands and allowed to roll into a pit offire. It was in the latter fashion that the Carthaginians sacrificed their offspring to Moloch.The children were laid on the hands of a calf-headed image of bronze, from which they slidinto a fiery oven, while the people danced to the music of flutes and timbrels to drown theshrieks of the burning victims. The resemblance which the Cretan traditions bear to theCarthaginian practice suggests that the worship associated with the names of Minos andthe Minotaur may have been powerfully influenced by that of a Semitic Baal. In thetradition of Phalaris, tyrant of Agrigentum, and his brazen bull we may have an echo ofsimilar rites in Sicily, where the Carthaginian power struck deep roots.In the province of Lagos, the Ijebu tribe of the Yoruba race is divided into two branches,which are known respectively as the Ijebu Ode and the Ijebu Remon. The Ode branch ofthe tribe is ruled by a chief who bears the title of Awujale and is surrounded by a greatdeal of mystery. Down to recent times his face might not be seen even by his own subjects,and if circumstances obliged him to communicate with them he did so through a screenwhich hid him from view. The other or Remon branch of the Ijebu tribe is governed by achief, who ranks below the Awujale. Mr. John Parkinson was informed that in formertimes this subordinate chief used to be killed with ceremony after a rule of three years. Asthe country is now under British protection the custom of putting the chief to death at theend of a three years’ reign has long been abolished, and Mr. Parkinson was unable toascertain any particulars on the subject.At Babylon, within historical times, the tenure of the kingly office was in practice lifelong,yet in theory it would seem to have been merely annual. For every year at the festival ofZagmuk the king had to renew his power by seizing the hands of the image of Marduk inhis great temple of Esagil at Babylon. Even when Babylon passed under the power ofAssyria, the monarchs of that country were expected to legalise their claim to the throne"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"every year by coming to Babylon and performing the ancient ceremony at the New Yearfestival, and some of them found the obligation so burdensome that rather than discharge itthey renounced the title of king altogether and contented themselves with the humbler oneof Governor. Further, it would appear that in remote times, though not within thehistorical period, the kings of Babylon or their barbarous predecessors forfeited not merelytheir crown but their life at the end of a year’s tenure of office. At least this is theconclusion to which the following evidence seems to point. According to the historianBerosus, who as a Babylonian priest spoke with ample knowledge, there was annuallycelebrated in Babylon a festival called the Sacaea. It began on the sixteenth day of themonth Lous, and lasted for five days, during which masters and servants changed places,the servants giving orders and the masters obeying them. A prisoner condemned to deathwas dressed in the king’s robes, seated on the king’s throne, allowed to issue whatevercommands he pleased, to eat, drink, and enjoy himself, and to lie with the king’sconcubines. But at the end of the five days he was stripped of his royal robes, scourged, andhanged or impaled. During his brief term of office he bore the title of Zoganes. This custommight perhaps have been explained as merely a grim jest perpetrated in a season of jollityat the expense of an unhappy criminal. But one circumstance—the leave given to the mockking to enjoy the king’s concubines—is decisive against this interpretation. Considering thejealous seclusion of an oriental despot’s harem we may be quite certain that permission toinvade it would never have been granted by the despot, least of all to a condemnedcriminal, except for the very gravest cause. This cause could hardly be other than that thecondemned man was about to die in the king’s stead, and that to make the substitutionperfect it was necessary he should enjoy the full rights of royalty during his brief reign.There is nothing surprising in this substitution. The rule that the king must be put to deatheither on the appearance of any symptom of bodily decay or at the end of a fixed period iscertainly one which, sooner or later, the kings would seek to abolish or modify. We haveseen that in Ethiopia, Sofala, and Eyeo the rule was boldly set aside by enlightenedmonarchs; and that in Calicut the old custom of killing the king at the end of twelve yearswas changed into a permission granted to any one at the end of the twelve years’ period toattack the king, and, in the event of killing him, to reign in his stead; though, as the kingtook care at these times to be surrounded by his guards, the permission was little morethan a form. Another way of modifying the stern old rule is seen in the Babylonian customjust described. When the time drew near for the king to be put to death (in Babylon thisappears to have been at the end of a single year’s reign) he abdicated for a few days, duringwhich a temporary king reigned and suffered in his stead. At first the temporary king mayhave been an innocent person, possibly a member of the king’s own family; but with thegrowth of civilisation the sacrifice of an innocent person would be revolting to the publicsentiment, and accordingly a condemned criminal would be invested with the brief andfatal sovereignty. In the sequel we shall find other examples of a dying criminalrepresenting a dying god. For we must not forget that, as the case of the Shilluk kingsclearly shows, the king is slain in his character of a god or a demigod, his death andresurrection, as the only means of perpetuating the divine life unimpaired, being deemednecessary for the salvation of his people and the world.A vestige of a practice of putting the king to death at the end of a year’s reign appears tohave survived in the festival called Macahity, which used to be celebrated in Hawaii duringthe last month of the year. About a hundred years ago a Russian voyager described the"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"custom as follows: “The taboo Macahity is not unlike to our festival of Christmas. Itcontinues a whole month, during which the people amuse themselves with dances, plays,and sham-fights of every kind. The king must open this festival wherever he is. On thisoccasion his majesty dresses himself in his richest cloak and helmet, and is paddled in acanoe along the shore, followed sometimes by many of his subjects. He embarks early, andmust finish his excursion at sunrise. The strongest and most expert of the warriors ischosen to receive him on his landing. This warrior watches the canoe along the beach; andas soon as the king lands, and has thrown off his cloak, he darts his spear at him, from adistance of about thirty paces, and the king must either catch the spear in his hand, orsuffer from it: there is no jesting in the business. Having caught it, he carries it under hisarm, with the sharp end downwards, into the temple or heavoo. On his entrance, theassembled multitude begin their sham-fights, and immediately the air is obscured by cloudsof spears, made for the occasion with blunted ends. Hamamea [the king] has beenfrequently advised to abolish this ridiculous ceremony, in which he risks his life every year;but to no effect. His answer always is, that he is as able to catch a spear as any one on theisland is to throw it at him. During the Macahity, all punishments are remitted throughoutthe country; and no person can leave the place in which he commences these holidays, letthe affair be ever so important.”That a king should regularly have been put to death at the close of a year’s reign willhardly appear improbable when we learn that to this day there is still a kingdom in whichthe reign and the life of the sovereign are limited to a single day. In Ngoio, a province of theancient kingdom of Congo, the rule obtains that the chief who assumes the cap ofsovereignty is always killed on the night after his coronation. The right of succession lieswith the chief of the Musurongo; but we need not wonder that he does not exercise it, andthat the throne stands vacant. “No one likes to lose his life for a few hours’ glory on theNgoio throne.”XXV. Temporary KingsIN SOME places the modified form of the old custom of regicide which appears to haveprevailed at Babylon has been further softened down. The king still abdicates annually fora short time and his place is filled by a more or less nominal sovereign; but at the close ofhis short reign the latter is no longer killed, though sometimes a mock execution stillsurvives as a memorial of the time when he was actually put to death. To take examples. Inthe month of Méac (February) the king of Cambodia annually abdicated for three days.During this time he performed no act of authority, he did not touch the seals, he did noteven receive the revenues which fell due. In his stead there reigned a temporary king calledSdach Méac, that is, King February. The office of temporary king was hereditary in afamily distantly connected with the royal house, the sons succeeding the fathers and theyounger brothers the elder brothers just as in the succession to the real sovereignty. On afavourable day fixed by the astrologers the temporary king was conducted by themandarins in triumphal procession. He rode one of the royal elephants, seated in the royalpalanquin, and escorted by soldiers who, dressed in appropriate costumes, represented theneighbouring peoples of Siam, Annam, Laos, and so on. In place of the golden crown he"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"wore a peaked white cap, and his regalia, instead of being of gold encrusted with diamonds,were of rough wood. After paying homage to the real king, from whom he received thesovereignty for three days, together with all the revenues accruing during that time (thoughthis last custom has been omitted for some time), he moved in procession round the palaceand through the streets of the capital. On the third day, after the usual procession, thetemporary king gave orders that the elephants should trample under foot the “mountain ofrice,” which was a scaffold of bamboo surrounded by sheaves of rice. The people gatheredup the rice, each man taking home a little with him to secure a good harvest. Some of it wasalso taken to the king, who had it cooked and presented to the monks.In Siam on the sixth day of the moon in the sixth month (the end of April) a temporaryking is appointed, who for three days enjoys the royal prerogatives, the real king remainingshut up in his palace. This temporary king sends his numerous satellites in all directions toseize and confiscate whatever they can find in the bazaar and open shops; even the shipsand junks which arrive in harbour during the three days are forfeited to him and must beredeemed. He goes to a field in the middle of the city, whither they bring a gilded ploughdrawn by gaily-decked oxen. After the plough has been anointed and the oxen rubbed withincense, the mock king traces nine furrows with the plough, followed by aged dames of thepalace scattering the first seed of the season. As soon as the nine furrows are drawn, thecrowd of spectators rushes in and scrambles for the seed which has just been sown,believing that, mixed with the seed-rice, it will ensure a plentiful crop. Then the oxen areunyoked, and rice, maize, sesame, sago, bananas, sugar-cane, melons, and so on, are setbefore them; whatever they eat first will, it is thought, be dear in the year following, thoughsome people interpret the omen in the opposite sense. During this time the temporary kingstands leaning against a tree with his right foot resting on his left knee. From standing thuson one foot he is popularly known as King Hop; but his official title is Phaya Phollathep“Lord of the Heavenly Hosts.” He is a sort of Minister of Agriculture; all disputes aboutfields, rice, and so forth, are referred to him. There is moreover another ceremony in whichhe personates the king. It takes place in the second month (which falls in the cold season)and lasts three days. He is conducted in procession to an open place opposite the Temple ofthe Brahmans, where there are a number of poles dressed like May-poles, upon which theBrahmans swing. All the while that they swing and dance, the Lord of the Heavenly Hostshas to stand on one foot upon a seat which is made of bricks plastered over, covered with awhite cloth, and hung with tapestry. He is supported by a wooden frame with a gilt canopy,and two Brahmans stand one on each side of him. The dancing Brahmans carry buffalohorns with which they draw water from a large copper caldron and sprinkle it on thespectators; this is supposed to bring good luck, causing the people to dwell in peace andquiet, health and prosperity. The time during which the Lord of the Heavenly Hosts has tostand on one foot is about three hours. This is thought “to prove the dispositions of theDevattas and spirits.” If he lets his foot down “he is liable to forfeit his property and havehis family enslaved by the king, as it is believed to be a bad omen, portending destruction tothe state, and instability to the throne. But if he stand firm he is believed to have gained avictory over evil spirits, and he has moreover the privilege, ostensibly at least, of seizingany ship which may enter the harbour during these three days, and taking its contents, andalso of entering any open shop in the town and carrying away what he chooses.”Such were the duties and privileges of the Siamese King Hop down to about the middle of"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"the nineteenth century or later. Under the reign of the late enlightened monarch this quaintpersonage was to some extent both shorn of the glories and relieved of the burden of hisoffice. He still watches, as of old, the Brahmans rushing through the air in a swingsuspended between two tall masts, each some ninety feet high; but he is allowed to sitinstead of stand, and, although public opinion still expects him to keep his right foot on hisleft knee during the whole of the ceremony, he would incur no legal penalty were he, to thegreat chagrin of the people, to put his weary foot to the ground. Other signs, too, tell of theinvasion of the East by the ideas and civilisation of the West. The thoroughfares that leadto the scene of the performance are blocked with carriages: lamp-posts and telegraph posts,to which eager spectators cling like monkeys, rise above the dense crowd; and, while atatterdemalion band of the old style, in gaudy garb of vermilion and yellow, bangs andtootles away on drums and trumpets of an antique pattern, the procession of barefootedsoldiers in brilliant uniforms steps briskly along to the lively strains of a modern militaryband playing “Marching through Georgia.”On the first day of the sixth month, which was regarded as the beginning of the year, theking and people of Samarcand used to put on new clothes and cut their hair and beards.Then they repaired to a forest near the capital where they shot arrows on horseback forseven days. On the last day the target was a gold coin, and he who hit it had the right to beking for one day. In Upper Egypt on the first day of the solar year by Coptic reckoning,that is, on the tenth of September, when the Nile has generally reached its highest point, theregular government is suspended for three days and every town chooses its own ruler. Thistemporary lord wears a sort of tall fool’s cap and a long flaxen beard, and is enveloped in astrange mantle. With a wand of office in his hand and attended by men disguised asscribes, executioners, and so forth, he proceeds to the Governor’s house. The latter allowshimself to be deposed; and the mock king, mounting the throne, holds a tribunal, to thedecisions of which even the governor and his officials must bow. After three days the mockking is condemned to death; the envelope or shell in which he was encased is committed tothe flames, and from its ashes the Fellah creeps forth. The custom perhaps points to an oldpractice of burning a real king in grim earnest. In Uganda the brothers of the king used tobe burned, because it was not lawful to shed the royal blood.The Mohammedan students of Fez, in Morocco, are allowed to appoint a sultan of theirown, who reigns for a few weeks, and is known as Sultan t-tulba, “the Sultan of theScribes.” This brief authority is put up for auction and knocked down to the highestbidder. It brings some substantial privileges with it, for the holder is freed from taxesthenceforward, and he has the right of asking a favour from the real sultan. That favour isseldom refused; it usually consists in the release of a prisoner. Moreover, the agents of thestudent-sultan levy fines on the shopkeepers and householders, against whom they trumpup various humorous charges. The temporary sultan is surrounded with the pomp of a realcourt, and parades the streets in state with music and shouting, while a royal umbrella isheld over his head. With the so-called fines and free-will offerings, to which the real sultanadds a liberal supply of provisions, the students have enough to furnish forth a magnificentbanquet; and altogether they enjoy themselves thoroughly, indulging in all kinds of gamesand amusements. For the first seven days the mock sultan remains in the college; then hegoes about a mile out of the town and encamps on the bank of the river, attended by thestudents and not a few of the citizens. On the seventh day of his stay outside the town he is"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"visited by the real sultan, who grants him his request and gives him seven more days toreign, so that the reign of “the Sultan of the Scribes” nominally lasts three weeks. But whensix days of the last week have passed the mock sultan runs back to the town by night. Thistemporary sultanship always falls in spring, about the beginning of April. Its origin is saidto have been as follows. When Mulai Rasheed II. was fighting for the throne in 1664 or1665, a certain Jew usurped the royal authority at Taza. But the rebellion was soonsuppressed through the loyalty and devotion of the students. To effect their purpose theyresorted to an ingenious stratagem. Forty of them caused themselves to be packed in chestswhich were sent as a present to the usurper. In the dead of night, while the unsuspectingJew was slumbering peacefully among the packing-cases, the lids were stealthily raised, thebrave forty crept forth, slew the usurper, and took possession of the city in the name of thereal sultan, who, to mark his gratitude for the help thus rendered him in time of need,conferred on the students the right of annually appointing a sultan of their own. Thenarrative has all the air of a fiction devised to explain an old custom, of which the realmeaning and origin had been forgotten.A custom of annually appointing a mock king for a single day was observed at Lostwithielin Cornwall down to the sixteenth century. On “little Easter Sunday” the freeholders of thetown and manor assembled together, either in person or by their deputies, and one amongthem, as it fell to his lot by turn, gaily attired and gallantly mounted, with a crown on hishead, a sceptre in his hand, and a sword borne before him, rode through the principalstreet to the church, dutifully attended by all the rest on horseback. The clergyman in hisbest robes received him at the churchyard stile and conducted him to hear divine service.On leaving the church he repaired, with the same pomp, to a house provided for hisreception. Here a feast awaited him and his suite, and being set at the head of the table hewas served on bended knees, with all the rites due to the estate of a prince. The ceremonyended with the dinner, and every man returned home.Sometimes the temporary king occupies the throne, not annually, but once for all at thebeginning of each reign. Thus in the kingdom of Jambi in Sumatra it is the custom that atthe beginning of a new reign a man of the people should occupy the throne and exercise theroyal prerogatives for a single day. The origin of the custom is explained by a tradition thatthere were once five royal brothers, the four elder of whom all declined the throne on theground of various bodily defects, leaving it to their youngest brother. But the eldestoccupied the throne for one day, and reserved for his descendants a similar privilege at thebeginning of every reign. Thus the office of temporary king is hereditary in a family akin tothe royal house. In Bilaspur it seems to be the custom, after the death of a Rajah, for aBrahman to eat rice out of the dead Rajah’s hand, and then to occupy the throne for ayear. At the end of the year the Brahman receives presents and is dismissed from theterritory, being forbidden apparently to return. “The idea seems to be that the spirit of theRájá enters into the Bráhman who eats the khir (rice and milk) out of his hand when he isdead, as the Brahman is apparently carefully watched during the whole year, and notallowed to go away.” The same or a similar custom is believed to obtain among the hillstates about Kangra. The custom of banishing the Brahman who represents the king maybe a substitute for putting him to death. At the installation of a prince of Carinthia apeasant, in whose family the office was hereditary, ascended a marble stone which stoodsurrounded by meadows in a spacious valley; on his right stood a black mother-cow, on his"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"left a lean ugly mare. A rustic crowd gathered about him. Then the future prince, dressedas a peasant and carrying a shepherd’s staff, drew near, attended by courtiers andmagistrates. On perceiving him the peasant called out, “Who is this whom I see coming soproudly along?” The people answered, “The prince of the land.” The peasant was thenprevailed on to surrender the marble seat to the prince on condition of receiving sixtypence, the cow and mare, and exemption from taxes. But before yielding his place he gavethe prince a light blow on the cheek.Some points about these temporary kings deserve to be specially noticed before we pass tothe next branch of the evidence. In the first place, the Cambodian and Siamese examplesshow clearly that it is especially the divine or magical functions of the king which aretransferred to his temporary substitute. This appears from the belief that by keeping up hisfoot the temporary king of Siam gained a victory over the evil spirits, whereas by letting itdown he imperilled the existence of the state. Again, the Cambodian ceremony of tramplingdown the “mountain of rice,” and the Siamese ceremony of opening the ploughing andsowing, are charms to produce a plentiful harvest, as appears from the belief that thosewho carry home some of the trampled rice, or of the seed sown, will thereby secure a goodcrop. Moreover, when the Siamese representative of the king is guiding the plough, thepeople watch him anxiously, not to see whether he drives a straight furrow, but to mark theexact point on his leg to which the skirt of his silken robe reaches; for on that is supposed tohang the state of the weather and the crops during the ensuing season. If the Lord of theHeavenly Hosts hitches up his garment above his knee, the weather will be wet and heavyrains will spoil the harvest. If he lets it trail to his ankle, a drought will be the consequence.But fine weather and heavy crops will follow if the hem of his robe hangs exactly half-waydown the calf of his leg. So closely is the course of nature, and with it the weal or woe of thepeople, dependent on the minutest act or gesture of the king’s representative. But the taskof making the crops grow, thus deputed to the temporary kings, is one of the magicalfunctions regularly supposed to be discharged by kings in primitive society. The rule thatthe mock king must stand on one foot upon a raised seat in the rice-field was perhapsoriginally meant as a charm to make the crop grow high; at least this was the object of asimilar ceremony observed by the old Prussians. The tallest girl, standing on one foot upona seat, with her lap full of cakes, a cup of brandy in her right hand and a piece of elm-barkor linden-bark in her left, prayed to the god Waizganthos that the flax might grow as highas she was standing. Then, after draining the cup, she had it refilled, and poured thebrandy on the ground as an offering to Waizganthos, and threw down the cakes for hisattendant sprites. If she remained steady on one foot throughout the ceremony, it was anomen that the flax crop would be good; but if she let her foot down, it was feared that thecrop might fail. The same significance perhaps attaches to the swinging of the Brahmans,which the Lord of the Heavenly Hosts had formerly to witness standing on one foot. On theprinciples of homoeopathic or imitative magic it might be thought that the higher thepriests swing the higher will grow the rice. For the ceremony is described as a harvestfestival, and swinging is practised by the Letts of Russia with the avowed intention ofinfluencing the growth of the crops. In the spring and early summer, between Easter andSt. John’s Day (the summer solstice), every Lettish peasant is said to devote his leisurehours to swinging diligently; for the higher he rises in the air the higher will his flax growthat season."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"In the foregoing cases the temporary king is appointed annually in accordance with aregular custom. But in other cases the appointment is made only to meet a specialemergency, such as to relieve the real king from some actual or threatened evil by divertingit to a substitute, who takes his place on the throne for a short time. The history of Persiafurnishes instances of such occasional substitutes for the Shah. Thus Shah Abbas the Great,being warned by his astrologers in the year 1591 that a serious danger impended over him,attempted to avert the omen by abdicating the throne and appointing a certain unbelievernamed Yusoofee, probably a Christian, to reign in his stead. The substitute wasaccordingly crowned, and for three days, if we may trust the Persian historians, he enjoyednot only the name and the state but the power of the king. At the end of his brief reign hewas put to death: the decree of the stars was fulfilled by this sacrifice; and Abbas, whoreascended his throne in a most propitious hour, was promised by his astrologers a longand glorious reign.XXVI. Sacrifice of the King’s SonA POINT to notice about the temporary kings described in the foregoing chapter is that intwo places (Cambodia and Jambi) they come of a stock which is believed to be akin to theroyal family. If the view here taken of the origin of these temporary kingships is correct, wecan easily understand why the king’s substitute should sometimes be of the same race asthe king. When the king first succeeded in getting the life of another accepted as a sacrificeinstead of his own, he would have to show that the death of that other would serve thepurpose quite as well as his own would have done. Now it was as a god or demigod that theking had to die; therefore the substitute who died for him had to be invested, at least forthe occasion, with the divine attributes of the king. This, as we have just seen, was certainlythe case with the temporary kings of Siam and Cambodia; they were invested with thesupernatural functions, which in an earlier stage of society were the special attributes ofthe king. But no one could so well represent the king in his divine character as his son, whomight be supposed to share the divine afflatus of his father. No one, therefore, could soappropriately die for the king and, through him, for the whole people, as the king’s son.We have seen that according to tradition, Aun or On, King of Sweden, sacrificed nine of hissons to Odin at Upsala in order that his own life might be spared. After he had sacrificedhis second son he received from the god an answer that he should live so long as he gavehim one of his sons every ninth year. When he had sacrificed his seventh son, he still lived,but was so feeble that he could not walk but had to be carried in a chair. Then he offeredup his eighth son, and lived nine years more, lying in his bed. After that he sacrificed hisninth son, and lived another nine years, but so that he drank out of a horn like a weanedchild. He now wished to sacrifice his only remaining son to Odin, but the Swedes would notallow him. So he died and was buried in a mound at Upsala.In ancient Greece there seems to have been at least one kingly house of great antiquity ofwhich the eldest sons were always liable to be sacrificed in room of their royal sires. WhenXerxes was marching through Thessaly at the head of his mighty host to attack theSpartans at Thermopylae, he came to the town of Alus. Here he was shown the sanctuary ofLaphystian Zeus, about which his guides told him a strange tale. It ran somewhat as"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"follows. Once upon a time the king of the country, by name Athamas, married a wifeNephele, and had by her a son called Phrixus and a daughter named Helle. Afterwards hetook to himself a second wife called Ino, by whom he had two sons, Learchus andMelicertes. But his second wife was jealous of her stepchildren, Phrixus and Helle, andplotted their death. She went about very cunningly to compass her bad end. First of all shepersuaded the women of the country to roast the seed corn secretly before it was committedto the ground. So next year no crops came up and the people died of famine. Then the kingsent messengers to the oracle at Delphi to enquire the cause of the dearth. But the wickedstepmother bribed the messenger to give out as the answer of the god that the dearth wouldnever cease till the children of Athamas by his first wife had been sacrificed to Zeus. WhenAthamas heard that, he sent for the children, who were with the sheep. But a ram with afleece of gold opened his lips, and speaking with the voice of a man warned the children oftheir danger. So they mounted the ram and fled with him over land and sea. As they flewover the sea, the girl slipped from the animal’s back, and falling into water was drowned.But her brother Phrixus was brought safe to the land of Colchis, where reigned a child ofthe sun. Phrixus married the king’s daughter, and she bore him a son Cytisorus. And therehe sacrificed the ram with the golden fleece to Zeus the God of Flight; but some will have itthat he sacrificed the animal to Laphystian Zeus. The golden fleece itself he gave to hiswife’s father, who nailed it to an oak tree, guarded by a sleepless dragon in a sacred groveof Ares. Meanwhile at home an oracle had commanded that King Athamas himself shouldbe sacrificed as an expiatory offering for the whole country. So the people decked him withgarlands like a victim and led him to the altar, where they were just about to sacrifice himwhen he was rescued either by his grandson Cytisorus, who arrived in the nick of timefrom Colchis, or by Hercules, who brought tidings that the king’s son Phrixus was yetalive. Thus Athamas was saved, but afterward he went mad, and mistaking his sonLearchus for a wild beast, shot him dead. Next he attempted the life of his remaining sonMelicertes, but the child was rescued by his mother Ino, who ran and threw herself andhim from a high rock into the sea. Mother and son were changed into marine divinities,and the son received special homage in the isle of Tenedos, where babes were sacrificed tohim. Thus bereft of wife and children the unhappy Athamas quitted his country, and onenquiring of the oracle where he should dwell was told to take up his abode wherever heshould be entertained by wild beasts. He fell in with a pack of wolves devouring sheep, andwhen they saw him they fled and left him the bleeding remnants of their prey. In this waythe oracle was fulfilled. But because King Athamas had not been sacrificed as a sin-offeringfor the whole country, it was divinely decreed that the eldest male scion of his family ineach generation should be sacrificed without fail, if ever he set foot in the town-hall, wherethe offerings were made to Laphystian Zeus by one of the house of Athamas. Many of thefamily, Xerxes was informed, had fled to foreign lands to escape this doom; but some ofthem had returned long afterwards, and being caught by the sentinels in the act of enteringthe town-hall were wreathed as victims, led forth in procession, and sacrificed. Theseinstances appear to have been notorious, if not frequent; for the writer of a dialogueattributed to Plato, after speaking of the immolation of human victims by theCarthaginians, adds that such practices were not unknown among the Greeks, and herefers with horror to the sacrifices offered on Mount Lycaeus and by the descendants ofAthamas.The suspicion that this barbarous custom by no means fell into disuse even in later days is"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"strengthened by a case of human sacrifice which occurred in Plutarch’s time atOrchomenus, a very ancient city of Boeotia, distant only a few miles across the plain fromthe historian’s birthplace. Here dwelt a family of which the men went by the name ofPsoloeis or “Sooty,” and the women by the name of Oleae or “Destructive.” Every year atthe festival of the Agrionia the priest of Dionysus pursued these women with a drawnsword, and if he overtook one of them he had the right to slay her. In Plutarch’s lifetimethe right was actually exercised by a priest Zoilus. The family thus liable to furnish at leastone human victim every year was of royal descent, for they traced their lineage to Minyas,the famous old king of Orchomenus, the monarch of fabulous wealth, whose statelytreasury, as it is called, still stands in ruins at the point where the long rocky hill ofOrchomenus melts into the vast level expanse of the Copaic plain. Tradition ran that theking’s three daughters long despised the other women of the country for yielding to theBacchic frenzy, and sat at home in the king’s house scornfully plying the distaff and theloom, while the rest, wreathed with flowers, their dishevelled locks streaming to the wind,roamed in ecstasy the barren mountains that rise above Orchomenus, making the solitudeof the hills to echo to the wild music of cymbals and tambourines. But in time the divinefury infected even the royal damsels in their quiet chamber; they were seized with a fiercelonging to partake of human flesh, and cast lots among themselves which should give upher child to furnish a cannibal feast. The lot fell on Leucippe, and she surrendered her sonHippasus, who was torn limb from limb by the three. From these misguided women sprangthe Oleae and the Psoloeis, of whom the men were said to be so called because they woresad-coloured raiment in token of their mourning and grief.Now this practice of taking human victims from a family of royal descent at Orchomenus isall the more significant because Athamas himself is said to have reigned in the land ofOrchomenus even before the time of Minyas, and because over against the city there risesMount Laphystius, on which, as at Alus in Thessaly, there was a sanctuary of LaphystianZeus, where, according to tradition, Athamas purposed to sacrifice his two childrenPhrixus and Helle. On the whole, comparing the traditions about Athamas with the customthat obtained with regard to his descendants in historical times, we may fairly infer that inThessaly and probably in Boeotia there reigned of old a dynasty of which the kings wereliable to be sacrificed for the good of the country to the god called Laphystian Zeus, butthat they contrived to shift the fatal responsibility to their offspring, of whom the eldest sonwas regularly destined to the altar. As time went on, the cruel custom was so far mitigatedthat a ram was accepted as a vicarious sacrifice in room of the royal victim, providedalways that the prince abstained from setting foot in the town-hall where the sacrificeswere offered to Laphystian Zeus by one of his kinsmen. But if he were rash enough to enterthe place of doom, to thrust himself wilfully, as it were, on the notice of the god who hadgood-naturedly winked at the substitution of a ram, the ancient obligation which had beensuffered to lie in abeyance recovered all its force, and there was no help for it but he mustdie. The tradition which associated the sacrifice of the king or his children with a greatdearth points clearly to the belief, so common among primitive folk, that the king isresponsible for the weather and the crops, and that he may justly pay with his life for theinclemency of the one or the failure of the other. Athamas and his line, in short, appear tohave united divine or magical with royal functions; and this view is strongly supported bythe claims to divinity which Salmoneus, the brother of Athamas, is said to have set up. Wehave seen that this presumptuous mortal professed to be no other than Zeus himself, and to"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"wield the thunder and lightning, of which he made a trumpery imitation by the help oftinkling kettles and blazing torches. If we may judge from analogy, his mock thunder andlightning were no mere scenic exhibition designed to deceive and impress the beholders;they were enchantments practised by the royal magician for the purpose of bringing aboutthe celestial phenomena which they feebly mimicked.Among the Semites of Western Asia the king, in a time of national danger, sometimes gavehis own son to die as a sacrifice for the people. Thus Philo of Byblus, in his work on theJews, says: “It was an ancient custom in a crisis of great danger that the ruler of a city ornation should give his beloved son to die for the whole people, as a ransom offered to theavenging demons; and the children thus offered were slain with mystic rites. So Cronus,whom the Phoenicians call Israel, being king of the land and having an only-begotten soncalled Jeoud (for in the Phoenician tongue Jeoud signifies ‘only begotten’), dressed him inroyal robes and sacrificed him upon an altar in a time of war, when the country was ingreat danger from the enemy.” When the king of Moab was besieged by the Israelites andhard beset, he took his eldest son, who should have reigned in his stead, and offered him fora burnt offering on the wall.XXVII. Succession to the SoulTO THE VIEW that in early times, and among barbarous races, kings have frequentlybeen put to death at the end of a short reign, it may be objected that such a custom wouldtend to the extinction of the royal family. The objection may be met by observing, first, thatthe kingship is often not confined to one family, but may be shared in turn by several;second, that the office is frequently not hereditary, but is open to men of any family, even toforeigners, who may fulfil the requisite conditions, such as marrying a princess orvanquishing the king in battle; and, third, that even if the custom did tend to the extinctionof a dynasty, that is not a consideration which would prevent its observance among peopleless provident of the future and less heedful of human life than ourselves. Many races, likemany individuals, have indulged in practices which must in the end destroy them. ThePolynesians seem regularly to have killed two-thirds of their children. In some parts of EastAfrica the proportion of infants massacred at birth is said to be the same. Only childrenborn in certain presentations are allowed to live. The Jagas, a conquering tribe in Angola,are reported to have put to death all their children, without exception, in order that thewomen might not be cumbered with babies on the march. They recruited their numbers byadopting boys and girls of thirteen or fourteen years of age, whose parents they had killedand eaten. Among the Mbaya Indians of South America the women used to murder alltheir children except the last, or the one they believed to be the last. If one of them hadanother child afterwards, she killed it. We need not wonder that this practice entirelydestroyed a branch of the Mbaya nation, who had been for many years the mostformidable enemies of the Spaniards. Among the Lengua Indians of the Gran Chaco, themissionaries discovered what they describe as “a carefully planned system of racial suicide,by the practice of infanticide by abortion, and other methods.” Nor is infanticide the onlymode in which a savage tribe commits suicide. A lavish use of the poison ordeal may beequally effective. Some time ago a small tribe named Uwet came down from the hill"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"country, and settled on the left branch of the Calabar River in West Africa. When themissionaries first visited the place, they found the population considerable, distributed intothree villages. Since then the constant use of the poison ordeal has almost extinguished thetribe. On one occasion the whole population took poison to prove their innocence. Abouthalf perished on the spot, and the remnant, we are told, still continuing their superstitiouspractice, must soon become extinct. With such examples before us we need not hesitate tobelieve that many tribes have felt no scruple or delicacy in observing a custom which tendsto wipe out a single family. To attribute such scruples to them is to commit the common,the perpetually repeated mistake of judging the savage by the standard of Europeancivilisation. If any of my readers set out with the notion that all races of men think and actmuch in the same way as educated Englishmen, the evidence of superstitious belief andcustom collected in this work should suffice to disabuse him of so erroneous aprepossession.The explanation here given of the custom of killing divine persons assumes, or at least isreadily combined with, the idea that the soul of the slain divinity is transmitted to hissuccessor. Of this transmission I have no direct proof except in the case of the Shilluk,among whom the practice of killing the divine king prevails in a typical form, and withwhom it is a fundamental article of faith that the soul of the divine founder of the dynastyis immanent in every one of his slain successors. But if this is the only actual example ofsuch a belief which I can adduce, analogy seems to render it probable that a similarsuccession to the soul of the slain god has been supposed to take place in other instances,though direct evidence of it is wanting. For it has been already shown that the soul of theincarnate deity is often supposed to transmigrate at death into another incarnation; and ifthis takes place when the death is a natural one, there seems no reason why it should nottake place when the death has been brought about by violence. Certainly the idea that thesoul of a dying person may be transmitted to his successor is perfectly familiar to primitivepeoples. In Nias the eldest son usually succeeds his father in the chieftainship. But if fromany bodily or mental defect the eldest son is disqualified for ruling, the father determines inhis lifetime which of his sons shall succeed him. In order, however, to establish his right ofsuccession, it is necessary that the son upon whom his father’s choice falls shall catch in hismouth or in a bag the last breath, and with it the soul, of the dying chief. For whoevercatches his last breath is chief equally with the appointed successor. Hence the otherbrothers, and sometimes also strangers, crowd round the dying man to catch his soul as itpasses. The houses in Nias are raised above the ground on posts, and it has happened thatwhen the dying man lay with his face on the floor, one of the candidates has bored a hole inthe floor and sucked in the chief’s last breath through a bamboo tube. When the chief hasno son, his soul is caught in a bag, which is fastened to an image made to represent thedeceased; the soul is then believed to pass into the image.Sometimes it would appear that the spiritual link between a king and the souls of hispredecessors is formed by the possession of some part of their persons. In southern Celebesthe regalia often consist of corporeal portions of deceased rajahs, which are treasured assacred relics and confer the right to the throne. Similarly among the Sakalavas of southernMadagascar a vertebra of the neck, a nail, and a lock of hair of a deceased king are placedin a crocodile’s tooth and carefully kept along with the similar relics of his predecessors ina house set apart for the purpose. The possession of these relics constitutes the right to the"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"throne. A legitimate heir who should be deprived of them would lose all his authority overthe people, and on the contrary a usurper who should make himself master of the relicswould be acknowledged king without dispute. When the Alake or king of Abeokuta in WestAfrica dies, the principal men decapitate his body, and placing the head in a large earthenvessel deliver it to the new sovereign; it becomes his fetish and he is bound to pay ithonours. Sometimes, in order apparently that the new sovereign may inherit more surelythe magical and other virtues of the royal line, he is required to eat a piece of his deadpredecessor. Thus at Abeokuta not only was the head of the late king presented to hissuccessor, but the tongue was cut out and given him to eat. Hence, when the natives wish tosignify that the sovereign reigns, they say, “He has eaten the king.” A custom of the samesort is still practised at Ibadan, a large town in the interior of Lagos, West Africa. Whenthe king dies his head is cut off and sent to his nominal suzerain, the Alafin of Oyo, theparamount king of Yoruba land; but his heart is eaten by his successor. This ceremony wasperformed not very many years ago at the accession of a new king of Ibadan.Taking the whole of the preceding evidence into account, we may fairly suppose that whenthe divine king or priest is put to death his spirit is believed to pass into his successor. Inpoint of fact, among the Shilluk of the White Nile, who regularly kill their divine kings,every king on his accession has to perform a ceremony which appears designed to convey tohim the same sacred and worshipful spirit which animated all his predecessors, one afterthe other, on the throne.XXVIII. The Killing of the Tree-Spirit1. The Whitsuntide MummersIT remains to ask what light the custom of killing the divine king or priest sheds upon thespecial subject to our enquiry. In an earlier part of this work we saw reason to suppose thatthe King of the Wood at Nemi was regarded as an incarnation of a tree-spirit or of thespirit of vegetation, and that as such he would be endowed, in the belief of his worshippers,with a magical power of making the trees to bear fruit, the crops to grow, and so on. Hislife must therefore have been held very precious by his worshippers, and was probablyhedged in by a system of elaborate precautions or taboos like those by which, in so manyplaces, the life of the man-god has been guarded against the malignant influence of demonsand sorcerers. But we have seen that the very value attached to the life of the man-godnecessitates his violent death as the only means of preserving it from the inevitable decay ofage. The same reasoning would apply to the King of the Wood; he, too, had to be killed inorder that the divine spirit, incarnate in him, might be transferred in its integrity to hissuccessor. The rule that he held office till a stronger should slay him might be supposed tosecure both the preservation of his divine life in full vigour and its transference to asuitable successor as soon as that vigour began to be impaired. For so long as he couldmaintain his position by the strong hand, it might be inferred that his natural force was notabated; whereas his defeat and death at the hands of another proved that his strength wasbeginning to fail and that it was time his divine life should be lodged in a less dilapidated"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"tabernacle. This explanation of the rule that the King of the Wood had to be slain by hissuccessor at least renders that rule perfectly intelligible. It is strongly supported by thetheory and practice of the Shilluk, who put their divine king to death at the first signs offailing health, lest his decrepitude should entail a corresponding failure of vital energy onthe corn, the cattle, and men. Moreover, it is countenanced by the analogy of the Chitomé,upon whose life the existence of the world was supposed to hang, and who was thereforeslain by his successor as soon as he showed signs of breaking up. Again, the terms on whichin later times the King of Calicut held office are identical with those attached to the officeof King of the Wood, except that whereas the former might be assailed by a candidate atany time, the King of Calicut might only be attacked once every twelve years. But as theleave granted to the King of Calicut to reign so long as he could defend himself against allcomers was a mitigation of the old rule which set a fixed term to his life, so we mayconjecture that the similar permission granted to the King of the Wood was a mitigation ofan older custom of putting him to death at the end of a definite period. In both cases thenew rule gave to the god-man at least a chance for his life, which under the old rule wasdenied him; and people probably reconciled themselves to the change by reflecting that solong as the god-man could maintain himself by the sword against all assaults, there was noreason to apprehend that the fatal decay had set in.The conjecture that the King of the Wood was formerly put to death at the expiry of a fixedterm, without being allowed a chance for his life, will be confirmed if evidence can beadduced of a custom of periodically killing his counterparts, the human representatives ofthe tree-spirit, in Northern Europe. Now in point of fact such a custom has leftunmistakable traces of itself in the rural festivals of the peasantry. To take examples.At Niederpöring, in Lower Bavaria, the Whitsuntide representative of the tree-spirit—thePfingstl as he was called—was clad from top to toe in leaves and flowers. On his head hewore a high pointed cap, the ends of which rested on his shoulders, only two holes being leftin it for his eyes. The cap was covered with water-flowers and surmounted with a nosegayof peonies. The sleeves of his coat were also made of water-plants, and the rest of his bodywas enveloped in alder and hazel leaves. On each side of him marched a boy holding up oneof the Pfingstl’s arms. These two boys carried drawn swords, and so did most of the otherswho formed the procession. They stopped at every house where they hoped to receive apresent; and the people, in hiding, soused the leaf-clad boy with water. All rejoiced when hewas well drenched. Finally he waded into the brook up to his middle; whereupon one of theboys, standing on the bridge, pretended to cut off his head. At Wurmlingen, in Swabia, ascore of young fellows dress themselves on Whit-Monday in white shirts and whitetrousers, with red scarves round their waists and swords hanging from the scarves. Theyride on horseback into the wood, led by two trumpeters blowing their trumpets. In thewood they cut down leafy oak branches, in which they envelop from head to foot him whowas the last of their number to ride out of the village. His legs, however, are encasedseparately, so that he may be able to mount his horse again. Further, they give him a longartificial neck, with an artificial head and a false face on the top of it. Then a May-tree iscut, generally an aspen or beech about ten feet high; and being decked with colouredhandkerchiefs and ribbons it is entrusted to a special “May-bearer.” The cavalcade thenreturns with music and song to the village. Amongst the personages who figure in theprocession are a Moorish king with a sooty face and a crown on his head, a Dr. Iron-Beard,"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"a corporal, and an executioner. They halt on the village green, and each of the charactersmakes a speech in rhyme. The executioner announces that the leaf-clad man has beencondemned to death, and cuts off his false head. Then the riders race to the May-tree,which has been set up a little way off. The first man who succeeds in wrenching it from theground as he gallops past keeps it with all its decorations. The ceremony is observed everysecond or third year.In Saxony and Thüringen there is a Whitsuntide ceremony called “chasing the Wild Manout of the bush,” or “fetching the Wild Man out of the wood.” A young fellow is envelopedin leaves or moss and called the Wild Man. He hides in the wood and the other lads of thevillage go out to seek him. They find him, lead him captive out of the wood, and fire at himwith blank muskets. He falls like dead to the ground, but a lad dressed as a doctor bleedshim, and he comes to life again. At this they rejoice, and, binding him fast on a waggon,take him to the village, where they tell all the people how they have caught the Wild Man.At every house they receive a gift. In the Erzgebirge the following custom was annuallyobserved at Shrovetide about the beginning of the seventeenth century. Two men disguisedas Wild Men, the one in brushwood and moss, the other in straw, were led about thestreets, and at last taken to the market-place, where they were chased up and down, shotand stabbed. Before falling they reeled about with strange gestures and spirted blood onthe people from bladders which they carried. When they were down, the huntsmen placedthem on boards and carried them to the ale-house, the miners marching beside them andwinding blasts on their mining tools as if they had taken a noble head of game. A verysimilar Shrovetide custom is still observed near Schluckenau in Bohemia. A man dressedup as a Wild Man is chased through several streets till he comes to a narrow lane acrosswhich a cord is stretched. He stumbles over the cord and, falling to the ground, isovertaken and caught by his pursuers. The executioner runs up and stabs with his sword abladder filled with blood which the Wild Man wears round his body; so the Wild Man dies,while a stream of blood reddens the ground. Next day a straw-man, made up to look likethe Wild Man, is placed on a litter, and, accompanied by a great crowd, is taken to a poolinto which it is thrown by the executioner. The ceremony is called “burying the Carnival.”In Semic (Bohemia) the custom of beheading the King is observed on Whit-Monday. Atroop of young people disguise themselves; each is girt with a girdle of bark and carries awooden sword and a trumpet of willow-bark. The King wears a robe of tree-bark adornedwith flowers, on his head is a crown of bark decked with flowers and branches, his feet arewound about with ferns, a mask hides his face, and for a sceptre he has a hawthorn switchin his hand. A lad leads him through the village by a rope fastened to his foot, while the restdance about, blow their trumpets, and whistle. In every farmhouse the King is chasedround the room, and one of the troop, amid much noise and outcry, strikes with his sworda blow on the King’s robe of bark till it rings again. Then a gratuity is demanded. Theceremony of decapitation, which is here somewhat slurred over, is carried out with agreater semblance of reality in other parts of Bohemia. Thus in some villages of theKöniggrätz district on Whit-Monday the girls assemble under one lime-tree and the youngmen under another, all dressed in their best and tricked out with ribbons. The young mentwine a garland for the Queen, and the girls another for the King. When they have chosenthe King and Queen they all go in procession two and two, to the ale-house, from thebalcony of which the crier proclaims the names of the King and Queen. Both are then"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"invested with the insignia of their office and are crowned with the garlands, while the musicplays up. Then some one gets on a bench and accuses the King of various offences, such asill-treating the cattle. The King appeals to witnesses and a trial ensues, at the close of whichthe judge, who carries a white wand as his badge of office, pronounces a verdict of“Guilty,” or “Not guilty.” If the verdict is “Guilty,” the judge breaks his wand, the Kingkneels on a white cloth, all heads are bared, and a soldier sets three or four hats, one abovethe other, on his Majesty’s head. The judge then pronounces the word “Guilty” thrice in aloud voice, and orders the crier to behead the King. The crier obeys by striking off theKing’s hats with the wooden sword.But perhaps, for our purpose, the most instructive of these mimic executions is thefollowing Bohemian one. In some places of the Pilsen district (Bohemia) on Whit-Mondaythe King is dressed in bark, ornamented with flowers and ribbons; he wears a crown of giltpaper and rides a horse, which is also decked with flowers. Attended by a judge, anexecutioner, and other characters, and followed by a train of soldiers, all mounted, he ridesto the village square, where a hut or arbour of green boughs has been erected under theMay-trees, which are firs, freshly cut, peeled to the top, and dressed with flowers andribbons. After the dames and maidens of the village have been criticised and a frogbeheaded, the cavalcade rides to a place previously determined upon, in a straight, broadstreet. Here they draw up in two lines and the King takes to flight. He is given a short startand rides off at full speed, pursued by the whole troop. If they fail to catch him he remainsKing for another year, and his companions must pay his score at the ale-house in theevening. But if they overtake and catch him he is scourged with hazel rods or beaten withthe wooden swords and compelled to dismount. Then the executioner asks, “Shall I beheadthis King?” The answer is given, “Behead him”; the executioner brandishes his axe, andwith the words, “One, two, three, let the King headless be!” he strikes off the King’s crown.Amid the loud cries of the bystanders the King sinks to the ground; then he is laid on a bierand carried to the nearest farmhouse.In most of the personages who are thus slain in mimicry it is impossible not to recogniserepresentatives of the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation, as he is supposed to manifesthimself in spring. The bark, leaves, and flowers in which the actors are dressed, and theseason of the year at which they appear, show that they belong to the same class as theGrass King, King of the May, Jack-in-the-Green, and other representatives of the vernalspirit of vegetation which we examined in an earlier part of this work. As if to remove anypossible doubt on this head, we find that in two cases these slain men are brought intodirect connexion with May-trees, which are the impersonal, as the May King, Grass King,and so forth, are the personal representatives of the tree-spirit. The drenching of thePfingstl with water and his wading up to the middle into the brook are, therefore, no doubtrain-charms like those which have been already described.But if these personages represent, as they certainly do, the spirit of vegetation in spring, thequestion arises, Why kill them? What is the object of slaying the spirit of vegetation at anytime and above all in spring, when his services are most wanted? The only probable answerto this question seems to be given in the explanation already proposed of the custom ofkilling the divine king or priest. The divine life, incarnate in a material and mortal body, isliable to be tainted and corrupted by the weakness of the frail medium in which it is for a"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"time enshrined; and if it is to be saved from the increasing enfeeblement which it mustnecessarily share with its human incarnation as he advances in years, it must be detachedfrom him before, or at least as soon as, he exhibits signs of decay, in order to be transferredto a vigorous successor. This is done by killing the old representative of the god andconveying the divine spirit from him to a new incarnation. The killing of the god, that is, ofhis human incarnation, is therefore merely a necessary step to his revival or resurrection ina better form. Far from being an extinction of the divine spirit, it is only the beginning of apurer and stronger manifestation of it. If this explanation holds good of the custom ofkilling divine kings and priests in general, it is still more obviously applicable to the customof annually killing the representative of the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation in spring. Forthe decay of plant life in winter is readily interpreted by primitive man as an enfeeblementof the spirit of vegetation; the spirit has, he thinks, grown old and weak and must thereforebe renovated by being slain and brought to life in a younger and fresher form. Thus thekilling of the representative of the tree-spirit in spring is regarded as a means to promoteand quicken the growth of vegetation. For the killing of the tree-spirit is associated always(we must suppose) implicitly, and sometimes explicitly also, with a revival or resurrectionof him in a more youthful and vigorous form. So in the Saxon and Thüringen custom, afterthe Wild Man has been shot he is brought to life again by a doctor; and in the Wurmlingenceremony there figures a Dr. Iron-Beard, who probably once played a similar part;certainly in another spring ceremony, which will be described presently, Dr. Iron-Beardpretends to restore a dead man to life. But of this revival or resurrection of the god we shallhave more to say anon.The points of similarity between these North European personages and the subject of ourenquiry—the King of the Wood or priest of Nemi—are sufficiently striking. In thesenorthern maskers we see kings, whose dress of bark and leaves along with the hut of greenboughs and the fir-trees, under which they hold their court, proclaim them unmistakablyas, like their Italian counterpart, Kings of the Wood. Like him they die a violent death, butlike him they may escape from it for a time by their bodily strength and agility; for inseveral of these northern customs the flight and pursuit of the king is a prominent part ofthe ceremony, and in one case at least if the king can outrun his pursuers he retains his lifeand his office for another year. In this last case the king in fact holds office on condition ofrunning for his life once a year, just as the King of Calicut in later times held office oncondition of defending his life against all comers once every twelve years, and just as thepriest of Nemi held office on condition of defending himself against any assault at any time.In every one of these instances the life of the god-man is prolonged on condition of hisshowing, in a severe physical contest of fight or flight, that his bodily strength is notdecayed, and that, therefore, the violent death, which sooner or later is inevitable, may forthe present be postponed. With regard to flight it is noticeable that flight figuredconspicuously both in the legend and in the practice of the King of the Wood. He had to bea runaway slave in memory of the flight of Orestes, the traditional founder of the worship;hence the Kings of the Wood are described by an ancient writer as “both strong of handand fleet of foot.” Perhaps if we knew the ritual of the Arician grove fully we might findthat the king was allowed a chance for his life by flight, like his Bohemian brother. I havealready conjectured that the annual flight of the priestly king at Rome (regifugium) was atfirst a flight of the same kind; in other words, that he was originally one of those divinekings who are either put to death after a fixed period or allowed to prove by the strong"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"hand or the fleet foot that their divinity is vigorous and unimpaired. One more point ofresemblance may be noted between the Italian King of the Wood and his northerncounterparts. In Saxony and Thüringen the representative of the tree-spirit, after beingkilled, is brought to life again by a doctor. This is exactly what legend affirmed to havehappened to the first King of the Wood at Nemi, Hippolytus or Virbius, who after he hadbeen killed by his horses was restored to life by the physician Aesculapius. Such a legendtallies well with the theory that the slaying of the King of the Wood was only a step to hisrevival or resurrection in his successor.2. Burying the CarnivalTHUS far I have offered an explanation of the rule which required that the priest of Nemishould be slain by his successor. The explanation claims to be no more than probable; ourscanty knowledge of the custom and of its history forbids it to be more. But its probabilitywill be augmented in proportion to the extent to which the motives and modes of thoughtwhich it assumes can be proved to have operated in primitive society. Hitherto the god withwhose death and resurrection we have been chiefly concerned has been the tree-god. But ifI can show that the custom of killing the god and the belief in his resurrection originated,or at least existed, in the hunting and pastoral stage of society, when the slain god was ananimal, and that it survived into the agricultural stage, when the slain god was the corn ora human being representing the corn, the probability of my explanation will have beenconsiderably increased. This I shall attempt to do in the sequel, and in the course of thediscussion I hope to clear up some obscurities which still remain, and to answer someobjections which may have suggested themselves to the reader.We start from the point at which we left off—the spring customs of European peasantry.Besides the ceremonies already described there are two kindred sets of observances inwhich the simulated death of a divine or supernatural being is a conspicuous feature. Inone of them the being whose death is dramatically represented is a personification of theCarnival; in the other it is Death himself. The former ceremony falls naturally at the end ofthe Carnival, either on the last day of that merry season, namely Shrove Tuesday, or on thefirst day of Lent, namely Ash Wednesday. The date of the other ceremony—the Carryingor Driving out of Death, as it is commonly called—is not so uniformly fixed. Generally it isthe fourth Sunday in Lent, which hence goes by the name of Dead Sunday; but in someplaces the celebration falls a week earlier, in others, as among the Czechs of Bohemia, aweek later, while in certain German villages of Moravia it is held on the first Sunday afterEaster. Perhaps, as has been suggested, the date may originally have been variable,depending on the appearance of the first swallow or some other herald of the spring. Somewriters regard the ceremony as Slavonic in its origin. Grimm thought it was a festival ofthe New Year with the old Slavs, who began their year in March. We shall first takeexamples, of the mimic death of the Carnival, which always falls before the other in thecalendar.At Frosinone, in Latium, about half-way between Rome and Naples, the dull monotony oflife in a provincial Italian town is agreeably broken on the last day of the Carnival by theancient festival known as the Radica. About four o’clock in the afternoon the town band,"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"playing lively tunes and followed by a great crowd, proceeds to the Piazza del Plebiscito,where is the Sub-Prefecture as well as the rest of the Government buildings. Here, in themiddle of the square, the eyes of the expectant multitude are greeted by the sight of animmense car decked with many-coloured festoons and drawn by four horses. Mounted onthe car is a huge chair, on which sits enthroned the majestic figure of the Carnival, a manof stucco about nine feet high with a rubicund and smiling countenance. Enormous boots, atin helmet like those which grace the heads of officers of the Italian marine, and a coat ofmany colours embellished with strange devices, adorn the outward man of this statelypersonage. His left hand rests on the arm of the chair, while with his right he gracefullysalutes the crowd, being moved to this act of civility by a string which is pulled by a manwho modestly shrinks from publicity under the mercy-seat. And now the crowd, surgingexcitedly round the car, gives vent to its feelings in wild cries of joy, gentle and simple beingmixed up together and all dancing furiously the Saltarello. A special feature of the festivalis that every one must carry in his hand what is called a radica ( “root”), by which is meanta huge leaf of the aloe or rather the agave. Any one who ventured into the crowd withoutsuch a leaf would be unceremoniously hustled out of it, unless indeed he bore as asubstitute a large cabbage at the end of a long stick or a bunch of grass curiously plaited.When the multitude, after a short turn, has escorted the slow-moving car to the gate of theSub-Prefecture, they halt, and the car, jolting over the uneven ground, rumbles into thecourtyard. A hush now falls on the crowd, their subdued voices sounding, according to thedescription of one who has heard them, like the murmur of a troubled sea. All eyes areturned anxiously to the door from which the Sub-Prefect himself and the otherrepresentatives of the majesty of the law are expected to issue and pay their homage to thehero of the hour. A few moments of suspense and then a storm of cheers and hand-clappingsalutes the appearance of the dignitaries, as they file out and, descending the staircase, taketheir place in the procession. The hymn of the Carnival is now thundered out, after which,amid a deafening roar, aloe leaves and cabbages are whirled aloft and descend impartiallyon the heads of the just and the unjust, who lend fresh zest to the proceedings by engagingin a free fight. When these preliminaries have been concluded to the satisfaction of allconcerned, the procession gets under weigh. The rear is brought up by a cart laden withbarrels of wine and policemen, the latter engaged in the congenial task of serving out wineto all who ask for it, while a most internecine struggle, accompanied by a copious dischargeof yells, blows, and blasphemy, goes on among the surging crowd at the cart’s tail in theiranxiety not to miss the glorious opportunity of intoxicating themselves at the publicexpense. Finally, after the procession has paraded the principal streets in this majesticmanner, the effigy of Carnival is taken to the middle of a public square, stripped of hisfinery, laid on a pile of wood, and burnt amid the cries of the multitude, who thunderingout once more the song of the Carnival fling their so-called “roots” on the pyre and givethemselves up without restraint to the pleasures of the dance.In the Abruzzi a pasteboard figure of the Carnival is carried by four grave-diggers withpipes in their mouths and bottles of wine slung at their shoulder-belts. In front walks thewife of the Carnival, dressed in mourning and dissolved in tears. From time to time thecompany halts, and while the wife addresses the sympathising public, the grave-diggersrefresh the inner man with a pull at the bottle. In the open square the mimic corpse is laidon a pyre, and to the roll of drums, the shrill screams of the women, and the gruffer cries ofthe men a light is set to it. While the figure burns, chestnuts are thrown about among the"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"crowd. Sometimes the Carnival is represented by a straw-man at the top of a pole which isborne through the town by a troop of mummers in the course of the afternoon. Whenevening comes on, four of the mummers hold out a quilt or sheet by the corners, and thefigure of the Carnival is made to tumble into it. The procession is then resumed, theperformers weeping crocodile tears and emphasising the poignancy of their grief by thehelp of saucepans and dinner bells. Sometimes, again, in the Abruzzi the dead Carnival ispersonified by a living man who lies in a coffin, attended by another who acts the priestand dispenses holy water in great profusion from a bathing tub.At Lerida, in Catalonia, the funeral of the Carnival was witnessed by an English travellerin 1877. On the last Sunday of the Carnival a grand procession of infantry, cavalry, andmaskers of many sorts, some on horseback and some in carriages, escorted the grand car ofHis Grace Pau Pi, as the effigy was called, in triumph through the principal streets. Forthree days the revelry ran high, and then at midnight on the last day of the Carnival thesame procession again wound through the streets, but under a different aspect and for adifferent end. The triumphal car was exchanged for a hearse, in which reposed the effigy ofhis dead Grace: a troop of maskers, who in the first procession had played the part ofStudents of Folly with many a merry quip and jest, now, robed as priests and bishops,paced slowly along holding aloft huge lighted tapers and singing a dirge. All the mummerswore crape, and all the horsemen carried blazing flambeaux. Down the high street, betweenthe lofty, many-storeyed and balconied houses, where every window, every balcony, everyhousetop was crammed with a dense mass of spectators, all dressed and masked in fantasticgorgeousness, the procession took its melancholy way. Over the scene flashed and playedthe shifting cross-lights and shadows from the moving torches: red and blue Bengal lightsflared up and died out again; and above the trampling of the horses and the measuredtread of the marching multitude rose the voices of the priests chanting the requiem, whilethe military bands struck in with the solemn roll of the muffled drums. On reaching theprincipal square the procession halted, a burlesque funeral oration was pronounced overthe defunct Pau Pi, and the lights were extinguished. Immediately the devil and his angelsdarted from the crowd, seized the body and fled away with it, hotly pursued by the wholemultitude, yelling, screaming, and cheering. Naturally the fiends were overtaken anddispersed; and the sham corpse, rescued from their clutches, was laid in a grave that hadbeen made ready for its reception. Thus the Carnival of 1877 at Lerida died and wasburied.A ceremony of the same sort is observed in Provence on Ash Wednesday. An effigy calledCaramantran, whimsically attired, is drawn in a chariot or borne on a litter, accompaniedby the populace in grotesque costumes, who carry gourds full of wine and drain them withall the marks, real or affected, of intoxication. At the head of the procession are some mendisguised as judges and barristers, and a tall gaunt personage who masquerades as Lent;behind them follow young people mounted on miserable hacks and attired as mournerswho pretend to bewail the fate that is in store for Caramantran. In the principal square theprocession halts, the tribunal is constituted, and Caramantran placed at the bar. After aformal trial he is sentenced to death amid the groans of the mob: the barrister whodefended him embraces his client for the last time: the officers of justice do their duty: thecondemned is set with his back to a wall and hurried into eternity under a shower of stones.The sea or a river receives his mangled remains. Throughout nearly the whole of the"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Ardennes it was and still is customary on Ash Wednesday to burn an effigy which issupposed to represent the Carnival, while appropriate verses are sung round about theblazing figure. Very often an attempt is made to fashion the effigy in the likeness of thehusband who is reputed to be least faithful to his wife of any in the village. As mightperhaps have been anticipated, the distinction of being selected for portraiture under thesepainful circumstances has a slight tendency to breed domestic jars, especially when theportrait is burnt in front of the house of the gay deceiver whom it represents, while apowerful chorus of caterwauls, groans, and other melodious sounds bears public testimonyto the opinion which his friends and neighbours entertain of his private virtues. In somevillages of the Ardennes a young man of flesh and blood, dressed up in hay and straw, usedto act the part of Shrove Tuesday (Mardi Gras), as the personification of the Carnival isoften called in France after the last day of the period which he personates. He was broughtbefore a mock tribunal, and being condemned to death was placed with his back to a wall,like a soldier at a military execution, and fired at with blank cartridges. At Vrigne-aux-Boisone of these harmless buffoons, named Thierry, was accidentally killed by a wad that hadbeen left in a musket of the firing-party. When poor Shrove Tuesday dropped under thefire, the applause was loud and long, he did it so naturally; but when he did not get upagain, they ran to him and found him a corpse. Since then there have been no more of thesemock executions in the Ardennes.In Normandy on the evening of Ash Wednesday it used to be the custom to hold acelebration called the Burial of Shrove Tuesday. A squalid effigy scantily clothed in rags, abattered old hat crushed down on his dirty face, his great round paunch stuffed with straw,represented the disreputable old rake who, after a long course of dissipation, was nowabout to suffer for his sins. Hoisted on the shoulders of a sturdy fellow, who pretended tostagger under the burden, this popular personification of the Carnival promenaded thestreets for the last time in a manner the reverse of triumphal. Preceded by a drummer andaccompanied by a jeering rabble, among whom the urchins and all the tag-rag and bobtailof the town mustered in great force, the figure was carried about by the flickering light oftorches to the discordant din of shovels and tongs, pots and pans, horns and kettles,mingled with hootings, groans, and hisses. From time to time the procession halted, and achampion of morality accused the broken-down old sinner of all the excesses he hadcommitted and for which he was now about to be burned alive. The culprit, having nothingto urge in his own defence, was thrown on a heap of straw, a torch was put to it, and a greatblaze shot up, to the delight of the children who frisked round it screaming out some oldpopular verses about the death of the Carnival. Sometimes the effigy was rolled down theslope of a hill before being burnt. At Saint-Lô the ragged effigy of Shrove Tuesday wasfollowed by his widow, a big burly lout dressed as a woman with a crape veil, who emittedsounds of lamentation and woe in a stentorian voice. After being carried about the streetson a litter attended by a crowd of maskers, the figure was thrown into the River Vire. Thefinal scene has been graphically described by Madame Octave Feuillet as she witnessed it inher childhood some sixty years ago. “My parents invited friends to see, from the top of thetower of Jeanne Couillard, the funeral procession passing. It was there that, quaffinglemonade—the only refreshment allowed because of the fast—we witnessed at nightfall aspectacle of which I shall always preserve a lively recollection. At our feet flowed the Vireunder its old stone bridge. On the middle of the bridge lay the figure of Shrove Tuesday ona litter of leaves, surrounded by scores of maskers dancing, singing, and carrying torches."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Some of them in their motley costumes ran along the parapet like fiends. The rest, worn outwith their revels, sat on the posts and dozed. Soon the dancing stopped, and some of thetroop, seizing a torch, set fire to the effigy, after which they flung it into the river withredoubled shouts and clamour. The man of straw, soaked with resin, floated away burningdown the stream of the Vire, lighting up with its funeral fires the woods on the bank andthe battlements of the old castle in which Louis XI. and Francis I. had slept. When the lastglimmer of the blazing phantom had vanished, like a falling star, at the end of the valley,every one withdrew, crowd and maskers alike, and we quitted the ramparts with ourguests.”In the neighbourhood of Tübingen on Shrove Tuesday a straw-man, called the ShrovetideBear, is made up; he is dressed in a pair of old trousers, and a fresh black-pudding or twosquirts filled with blood are inserted in his neck. After a formal condemnation he isbeheaded, laid in a coffin, and on Ash Wednesday is buried in the churchyard. This iscalled “Burying the Carnival.” Amongst some of the Saxons of Transylvania the Carnivalis hanged. Thus at Braller on Ash Wednesday or Shrove Tuesday two white and twochestnut horses draw a sledge on which is placed a straw-man swathed in a white cloth;beside him is a cart-wheel which is kept turning round. Two lads disguised as old menfollow the sledge lamenting. The rest of the village lads, mounted on horseback and deckedwith ribbons, accompany the procession, which is headed by two girls crowned withevergreen and drawn in a waggon or sledge. A trial is held under a tree, at which ladsdisguised as soldiers pronounce sentence of death. The two old men try to rescue the straw-man and to fly with him, but to no purpose; he is caught by the two girls and handed overto the executioner, who hangs him on a tree. In vain the old men try to climb up the treeand take him down; they always tumble down, and at last in despair they throw themselveson the ground and weep and howl for the hanged man. An official then makes a speech inwhich he declares that the Carnival was condemned to death because he had done themharm, by wearing out their shoes and making them tired and sleepy. At the “Burial ofCarnival” in Lechrain, a man dressed as a woman in black clothes is carried on a litter orbier by four men; he is lamented over by men disguised as women in black clothes, thenthrown down before the village dung-heap, drenched with water, buried in the dung-heap,and covered with straw. On the evening of Shrove Tuesday the Esthonians make a strawfigure called metsik or “wood-spirit”; one year it is dressed with a man’s coat and hat, nextyear with a hood and a petticoat. This figure is stuck on a long pole, carried across theboundary of the village with loud cries of joy, and fastened to the top of a tree in the wood.The ceremony is believed to be a protection against all kinds of misfortune.Sometimes at these Shrovetide or Lenten ceremonies the resurrection of the pretendeddead person is enacted. Thus, in some parts of Swabia on Shrove Tuesday Dr. Iron-Beardprofesses to bleed a sick man, who thereupon falls as dead to the ground; but the doctor atlast restores him to life by blowing air into him through a tube. In the Harz Mountains,when Carnival is over, a man is laid on a baking-trough and carried with dirges to thegrave; but in the grave a glass of brandy is buried instead of the man. A speech is deliveredand then the people return to the village-green or meeting-place, where they smoke thelong clay pipes which are distributed at funerals. On the morning of Shrove Tuesday in thefollowing year the brandy is dug up and the festival begins by every one tasting the spiritwhich, as the phrase goes, has come to life again."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"3. Carrying out DeathTHE CEREMONY of “Carrying out Death” presents much the same features as “Buryingthe Carnival”; except that the carrying out of Death is generally followed by a ceremony,or at least accompanied by a profession, of bringing in Summer, Spring, or Life. Thus inMiddle Franken, a province of Bavaria, on the fourth Sunday in Lent, the village urchinsused to make a straw effigy of Death, which they carried about with burlesque pompthrough the streets, and afterwards burned with loud cries beyond the bounds. TheFrankish custom is thus described by a writer of the sixteenth century: “At Mid-Lent, theseason when the church bids us rejoice, the young people of my native country make astraw image of Death, and fastening it to a pole carry it with shouts to the neighbouringvillages. By some they are kindly received, and after being refreshed with milk, peas, anddried pears, the usual food of that season, are sent home again. Others, however, treat themwith anything but hospitality; for, looking on them as harbingers of misfortune, to wit ofdeath, they drive them from their boundaries with weapons and insults.” In the villagesnear Erlangen, when the fourth Sunday in Lent came around, the peasant girls used todress themselves in all their finery with flowers in their hair. Thus attired they repaired tothe neighbouring town, carrying puppets which were adorned with leaves and covered withwhite cloths. These they took from house to house in pairs, stopping at every door wherethey expected to receive something, and singing a few lines in which they announced that itwas Mid-Lent and that they were about to throw Death into the water. When they hadcollected some trifling gratuities they went to the river Regnitz and flung the puppetsrepresenting Death into the stream. This was done to ensure a fruitful and prosperousyear; further, it was considered a safeguard against pestilence and sudden death. AtNuremberg girls of seven to eighteen years of age go through the streets bearing a littleopen coffin, in which is a doll hidden under a shroud. Others carry a beech branch, with anapple fastened to it for a head, in an open box. They sing, “We carry Death into the water,it is well,” or “We carry Death into the water, carry him in and out again.” In some partsof Bavaria down to 1780 it was believed that a fatal epidemic would ensue if the custom of“Carrying out Death” were not observed.In some villages of Thüringen, on the fourth Sunday of Lent, the children used to carry apuppet of birchen twigs through the village, and then threw it into a pool, while they sang,“We carry the old Death out behind the herdman’s old house; we have got Summer, andKroden’s (?) power is destroyed.” At Debschwitz or Dobschwitz, near Gera, the ceremonyof “Driving out Death” is or was annually observed on the first of March. The youngpeople make up a figure of straw or the like materials, dress it in old clothes, which theyhave begged from houses in the village, and carry it out and throw it into the river. Onreturning to the village they break the good news to the people, and receive eggs and othervictuals as a reward. The ceremony is or was supposed to purify the village and to protectthe inhabitants from sickness and plague. In other villages of Thüringen, in which thepopulation was originally Slavonic, the carrying out of the puppet is accompanied with thesinging of a song, which begins, “Now we carry Death out of the village and Spring into thevillage.” At the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth century the customwas observed in Thüringen as follows. The boys and girls made an effigy of straw or the"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"like materials, but the shape of the figure varied from year to year. In one year it wouldrepresent an old man, in the next an old woman, in the third a young man, and in thefourth a maiden, and the dress of the figure varied with the character it personated. Thereused to be a sharp contest as to where the effigy was to be made, for the people thought thatthe house from which it was carried forth would not be visited with death that year. Havingbeen made, the puppet was fastened to a pole and carried by a girl if it represented an oldman, but by a boy if it represented an old woman. Thus it was borne in procession, theyoung people holding sticks in their hands and singing that they were driving out Death.When they came to water they threw the effigy into it and ran hastily back, fearing that itmight jump on their shoulders and wring their necks. They also took care not to touch it,lest it should dry them up. On their return they beat the cattle with the sticks, believingthat this would make the animals fat or fruitful. Afterwards they visited the house orhouses from which they had carried the image of Death; where they received a dole of half-boiled peas. The custom of “Carrying out Death” was practised also in Saxony. At Leipsicthe bastards and public women used to make a straw effigy of Death every year at Mid-Lent. This they carried through all the streets with songs and showed it to the youngmarried women. Finally they threw it into the river Parthe. By this ceremony theyprofessed to make the young wives fruitful, to purify the city, and to protect the inhabitantsfor that year from plague and other epidemics.Ceremonies of the same sort are observed at Mid-Lent in Silesia. Thus in many places thegrown girls with the help of the young men dress up a straw figure with women’s clothesand carry it out of the village towards the setting sun. At the boundary they strip it of itsclothes, tear it in pieces, and scatter the fragments about the fields. This is called “BuryingDeath.” As they carry the image out, they sing that they are about to bury Death under anoak, that he may depart from the people. Sometimes the song runs that they are bearingDeath over hill and dale to return no more. In the Polish neighbourhood of Gross-Strehlitzthe puppet is called Goik. It is carried on horseback and thrown into the nearest water. Thepeople think that the ceremony protects them from sickness of every sort in the comingyear. In the districts of Wohlau and Guhrau the image of Death used to be thrown over theboundary of the next village. But as the neighbours feared to receive the ill-omened figure,they were on the look-out to repel it, and hard knocks were often exchanged between thetwo parties. In some Polish parts of Upper Silesia the effigy, representing an old woman,goes by the name of Marzana, the goddess of death. It is made in the house where the lastdeath occurred, and is carried on a pole to the boundary of the village, where it is throwninto a pond or burnt. At Polkwitz the custom of “Carrying out Death” fell into abeyance;but an outbreak of fatal sickness which followed the intermission of the ceremony inducedthe people to resume it.In Bohemia the children go out with a straw-man, representing Death, to the end of thevillage, where they burn it, singing—“Now carry we Death out of the village,The new Summer into the village,Welcome, dear Summer,Green little corn.”"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"At Tabor in Bohemia the figure of Death is carried out of the town and flung from a highrock into the water, while they sing—“Death swims on the water,Summer will soon be here,We carried Death away for youWe brought the Summer.And do thou, O holy Marketa,Give us a good yearFor wheat and for rye.”In other parts of Bohemia they carry Death to the end of the village, singing—“We carry Death out of the village,And the New Year into the village.Dear Spring, we bid you welcome,Green grass, we bid you welcome.”Behind the village they erect a pyre, on which they burn the straw figure, reviling andscoffing at it the while. Then they return, singing—“We have carried away Death,And brought Life back.He has taken up his quarters in the village,Therefore sing joyous songs.”In some German villages of Moravia, as in Jassnitz and Seitendorf, the young folk assembleon the third Sunday in Lent and fashion a straw-man, who is generally adorned with a furcap and a pair of old leathern hose, if such are to be had. The effigy is then hoisted on apole and carried by the lads and lasses out into the open fields. On the way they sing a song,in which it is said that they are carrying Death away and bringing dear Summer into thehouse, and with Summer the May and the flowers. On reaching an appointed place theydance in a circle round the effigy with loud shouts and screams, then suddenly rush at itand tear it to pieces with their hands. Lastly, the pieces are thrown together in a heap, thepole is broken, and fire is set to the whole. While it burns the troop dances merrily roundit, rejoicing at the victory won by Spring; and when the fire has nearly died out they go to"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"the householders to beg for a present of eggs wherewith to hold a feast, taking care to giveas a reason for the request that they have carried Death out and away.The preceding evidence shows that the effigy of Death is often regarded with fear andtreated with marks of hatred and abhorrence. Thus the anxiety of the villagers to transferthe figure from their own to their neighbours’ land, and the reluctance of the latter toreceive the ominous guest, are proof enough of the dread which it inspires. Further, inLusatia and Silesia the puppet is sometimes made to look in at the window of a house, andit is believed that some one in the house will die within the year unless his life is redeemedby the payment of money. Again, after throwing the effigy away, the bearers sometimesrun home lest Death should follow them, and if one of them falls in running, it is believedthat he will die within the year. At Chrudim, in Bohemia, the figure of Death is made out ofa cross, with a head and mask stuck at the top, and a shirt stretched out on it. On the fifthSunday in Lent the boys take this effigy to the nearest brook or pool, and standing in a linethrow it into the water. Then they all plunge in after it; but as soon as it is caught no onemore may enter the water. The boy who did not enter the water or entered it last will diewithin the year, and he is obliged to carry the Death back to the village. The effigy is thenburned. On the other hand, it is believed that no one will die within the year in the houseout of which the figure of Death has been carried; and the village out of which Death hasbeen driven is sometimes supposed to be protected against sickness and plague. In somevillages of Austrian Silesia on the Saturday before Dead Sunday an effigy is made of oldclothes, hay, and straw, for the purpose of driving Death out of the village. On Sunday thepeople, armed with sticks and straps, assemble before the house where the figure is lodged.Four lads then draw the effigy by cords through the village amid exultant shouts, while allthe others beat it with their sticks and straps. On reaching a field which belongs to aneighbouring village they lay down the figure, cudgel it soundly, and scatter the fragmentsover the field. The people believe that the village from which Death has been thus carriedout will be safe from any infectious disease for the whole year.4. Bringing in SummerIN THE PRECEDING ceremonies the return of Spring, Summer, or Life, as a sequel to theexpulsion of Death, is only implied or at most announced. In the following ceremonies it isplainly enacted. Thus in some parts of Bohemia the effigy of Death is drowned by beingthrown into the water at sunset; then the girls go out into the wood and cut down a youngtree with a green crown, hang a doll dressed as a woman on it, deck the whole with green,red, and white ribbons, and march in procession with their Líto (Summer) into the village,collecting gifts and singing—“Death swims in the water,Spring comes to visit us,With eggs that are red,With yellow pancakes.We carried Death out of the village,"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"We are carrying Summer into the village.”In many Silesian villages the figure of Death, after being treated with respect, is stript of itsclothes and flung with curses into the water, or torn to pieces in a field. Then the young folkrepair to a wood, cut down a small fir-tree, peel the trunk, and deck it with festoons ofevergreens, paper roses, painted egg-shells, motley bits of cloth, and so forth. The tree thusadorned is called Summer or May. Boys carry it from house to house singing appropriatesongs and begging for presents. Among their songs is the following:“We have carried Death out,We are bringing the dear Summer back,The Summer and the MayAnd all the flowers gay.”Sometimes they also bring back from the wood a prettily adorned figure, which goes by thename of Summer, May, or the Bride; in the Polish districts it is called Dziewanna, thegoddess of spring.At Eisenach on the fourth Sunday in Lent young people used to fasten a straw-man,representing Death, to a wheel, which they trundled to the top of a hill. Then setting fire tothe figure they allowed it and the wheel to roll down the slope. Next day they cut a tall fir-tree, tricked it out with ribbons, and set it up in the plain. The men then climbed the tree tofetch down the ribbons. In Upper Lusatia the figure of Death, made of straw and rags, isdressed in a veil furnished by the last bride and a shirt provided by the house in which thelast death took place. Thus arrayed the figure is stuck on the end of a long pole and carriedat full speed by the tallest and strongest girl, while the rest pelt the effigy with sticks andstones. Whoever hits it will be sure to live through the year. In this way Death is carried outof the village and thrown into the water or over the boundary of the next village. On theirway home each one breaks a green branch and carries it gaily with him till he reaches thevillage, when he throws it away. Sometimes the young people of the next village, uponwhose land the figure has been thrown, run after them and hurl it back, not wishing tohave Death among them. Hence the two parties occasionally come to blows.In these cases Death is represented by the puppet which is thrown away, Summer or Lifeby the branches or trees which are brought back. But sometimes a new potency of lifeseems to be attributed to the image of Death itself, and by a kind of resurrection it becomesthe instrument of the general revival. Thus in some parts of Lusatia women alone areconcerned in carrying out Death, and suffer no male to meddle with it. Attired inmourning, which they wear the whole day, they make a puppet of straw, clothe it in a whiteshirt, and give it a broom in one hand and a scythe in the other. Singing songs and pursuedby urchins throwing stones, they carry the puppet to the village boundary, where they tearit in pieces. Then they cut down a fine tree, hang the shirt on it, and carry it home singing."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"On the Feast of Ascension the Saxons of Braller, a village of Transylvania, not far fromHermannstadt, observe the ceremony of “Carrying out Death” in the following manner.After morning service all the school-girls repair to the house of one of their number, andthere dress up the Death. This is done by tying a threshed-out sheaf of corn into a roughsemblance of a head and body, while the arms are simulated by a broomstick thrustthrough it horizontally. The figure is dressed in the holiday attire of a young peasantwoman, with a red hood, silver brooches, and a profusion of ribbons at the arms andbreast. The girls bustle at their work, for soon the bells will be ringing to vespers, and theDeath must be ready in time to be placed at the open window, that all the people may see iton their way to church. When vespers are over, the longed-for moment has come for thefirst procession with the Death to begin; it is a privilege that belongs to the school-girlsalone. Two of the older girls seize the figure by the arms and walk in front: all the restfollow two and two. Boys may take no part in the procession, but they troop after it gazingwith open-mouthed admiration at the “beautiful Death.” So the procession goes through allthe streets of the village, the girls singing the old hymn that begins—“Gott mein Vater, deine LiebeReicht so weit der Himmel ist,”to a tune that differs from the ordinary one. When the procession has wound its waythrough every street, the girls go to another house, and having shut the door against theeager prying crowd of boys who follow at their heels, they strip the Death and pass thenaked truss of straw out of the window to the boys, who pounce on it, run out of the villagewith it without singing, and fling the dilapidated effigy into the neighbouring brook. Thisdone, the second scene of the little drama begins. While the boys were carrying away theDeath out of the village, the girls remained in the house, and one of them is now dressed inall the finery which had been worn by the effigy. Thus arrayed she is led in processionthrough all the streets to the singing of the same hymn as before. When the procession isover they all betake themselves to the house of the girl who played the leading part. Here afeast awaits them from which also the boys are excluded. It is a popular belief that thechildren may safely begin to eat gooseberries and other fruit after the day on which Deathhas thus been carried out; for Death, which up to that time lurked especially ingooseberries, is now destroyed. Further, they may now bathe with impunity out of doors.Very similar is the ceremony which, down to recent years, was observed in some of theGerman villages of Moravia. Boys and girls met on the afternoon of the first Sunday afterEaster, and together fashioned a puppet of straw to represent Death. Decked with bright-coloured ribbons and cloths, and fastened to the top of a long pole, the effigy was thenborne with singing and clamour to the nearest height, where it was stript of its gay attireand thrown or rolled down the slope. One of the girls was next dressed in the gauds takenfrom the effigy of Death, and with her at its head the procession moved back to the village.In some villages the practice is to bury the effigy in the place that has the most evilreputation of all the country-side: others throw it into running water.In the Lusatian ceremony described above, the tree which is brought home after the"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"destruction of the figure of Death is plainly equivalent to the trees or branches which, inthe preceding customs, were brought back as representatives of Summer or Life, afterDeath had been thrown away or destroyed. But the transference of the shirt worn by theeffigy of Death to the tree clearly indicates that the tree is a kind of revivification, in a newform, of the destroyed effigy. This comes out also in the Transylvanian and Moraviancustoms: the dressing of a girl in the clothes worn by the Death, and the leading her aboutthe village to the same song which had been sung when the Death was being carried about,show that she is intended to be a kind of resuscitation of the being whose effigy has justbeen destroyed. These examples therefore suggest that the Death whose demolition isrepresented in these ceremonies cannot be regarded as the purely destructive agent whichwe understand by Death. If the tree which is brought back as an embodiment of thereviving vegetation of spring is clothed in the shirt worn by the Death which has just beendestroyed, the object certainly cannot be to check and counteract the revival of vegetation:it can only be to foster and promote it. Therefore the being which has just beendestroyed—the so-called Death—must be supposed to be endowed with a vivifying andquickening influence, which it can communicate to the vegetable and even the animalworld. This ascription of a life-giving virtue to the figure of Death is put beyond a doubt bythe custom, observed in some places, of taking pieces of the straw effigy of Death andplacing them in the fields to make the crops grow, or in the manger to make the cattlethrive. Thus in Spachendorf, a village of Austrian Silesia, the figure of Death, made ofstraw, brushwood, and rags, is carried with wild songs to an open place outside the villageand there burned, and while it is burning a general struggle takes place for the pieces,which are pulled out of the flames with bare hands. Each one who secures a fragment of theeffigy ties it to a branch of the largest tree in his garden, or buries it in his field, in thebelief that this causes the crops to grow better. In the Troppau district of Austrian Silesiathe straw figure which the boys make on the fourth Sunday in Lent is dressed by the girlsin woman’s clothes and hung with ribbons, necklace, and garlands. Attached to a long poleit is carried out of the village, followed by a troop of young people of both sexes, whoalternately frolic, lament, and sing songs. Arrived at its destination—a field outside thevillage—the figure is stripped of its clothes and ornaments; then the crowd rushes at it andtears it to bits, scuffling for the fragments. Every one tries to get a wisp of the straw ofwhich the effigy was made, because such a wisp, placed in the manger, is believed to makethe cattle thrive. Or the straw is put in the hens’ nest, it being supposed that this preventsthe hens from carrying away their eggs, and makes them brood much better. The sameattribution of a fertilising power to the figure of Death appears in the belief that if thebearers of the figure, after throwing it away, beat cattle with their sticks, this will renderthe beasts fat or prolific. Perhaps the sticks had been previously used to beat the Death,and so had acquired the fertilising power ascribed to the effigy. We have seen, too, that atLeipsic a straw effigy of Death was shown to young wives to make them fruitful.It seems hardly possible to separate from the May-trees the trees or branches which arebrought into the village after the destruction of the Death. The bearers who bring them inprofess to be bringing in the Summer, therefore the trees obviously represent the Summer;indeed in Silesia they are commonly called the Summer or the May, and the doll which issometimes attached to the Summer-tree is a duplicate representative of the Summer, just asthe May is sometimes represented at the same time by a May-tree and a May Lady.Further, the Summer-trees are adorned like May-trees with ribbons and so on; like May-"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"trees, when large, they are planted in the ground and climbed up; and like May-trees, whensmall, they are carried from door to door by boys or girls singing songs and collectingmoney. And as if to demonstrate the identity of the two sets of customs the bearers of theSummer-tree sometimes announce that they are bringing in the Summer and the May. Thecustoms, therefore, of bringing in the May and bringing in the Summer are essentially thesame; and the Summer-tree is merely another form of the May-tree, the only distinction(besides that of name) being in the time at which they are respectively brought in; for whilethe May-tree is usually fetched in on the first of May or at Whitsuntide, the Summer-tree isfetched in on the fourth Sunday in Lent. Therefore, if the May-tree is an embodiment of thetree-spirit or spirit of vegetation, the Summer-tree must likewise be an embodiment of thetree-spirit or spirit of vegetation. But we have seen that the Summer-tree is in some cases arevivification of the effigy of Death. It follows, therefore, that in these cases the effigy calledDeath must be an embodiment of the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation. This inference isconfirmed, first, by the vivifying and fertilising influence which the fragments of the effigyof Death are believed to exercise both on vegetable and on animal life; for this influence, aswe saw in an earlier part of this work, is supposed to be a special attribute of the tree-spirit.It is confirmed, secondly, by observing that the effigy of Death is sometimes decked withleaves or made of twigs, branches, hemp, or a threshed-out sheaf of corn; and thatsometimes it is hung on a little tree and so carried about by girls collecting money, just as isdone with the May-tree and the May Lady, and with the Summer-tree and the dollattached to it. In short we are driven to regard the expulsion of Death and the bringing inof Summer as, in some cases at least, merely another form of that death and revival of thespirit of vegetation in spring which we saw enacted in the killing and resurrection of theWild Man. The burial and resurrection of the Carnival is probably another way ofexpressing the same idea. The interment of the representative of the Carnival under adung-heap is natural, if he is supposed to possess a quickening and fertilising influence likethat ascribed to the effigy of Death. The Esthonians, indeed, who carry the straw figure outof the village in the usual way on Shrove Tuesday, do not call it the Carnival, but theWood-spirit (Metsik), and they clearly indicate the identity of the effigy with the wood-spirit by fixing it to the top of a tree in the wood, where it remains for a year, and isbesought almost daily with prayers and offerings to protect the herds; for like a true wood-spirit the Metsik is a patron of cattle. Sometimes the Metsik is made of sheaves of corn.Thus we may fairly conjecture that the names Carnival, Death, and Summer arecomparatively late and inadequate expressions for the beings personified or embodied inthe customs with which we have been dealing. The very abstractness of the names bespeaksa modern origin; for the personification of times and seasons like the Carnival andSummer, or of an abstract notion like death, is not primitive. But the ceremoniesthemselves bear the stamp of a dateless antiquity; therefore we can hardly help supposingthat in their origin the ideas which they embodied were of a more simple and concreteorder. The notion of a tree, perhaps of a particular kind of tree (for some savages have noword for tree in general), or even of an individual tree, is sufficiently concrete to supply abasis from which by a gradual process of generalisation the wider idea of a spirit ofvegetation might be reached. But this general idea of vegetation would readily beconfounded with the season in which it manifests itself; hence the substitution of Spring,Summer, or May for the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation would be easy and natural.Again, the concrete notion of the dying tree or dying vegetation would by a similar process"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"of generalisation glide into a notion of death in general; so that the practice of carrying outthe dying or dead vegetation in spring, as a preliminary to its revival, would in time widenout into an attempt to banish Death in general from the village or district. The view that inthese spring ceremonies Death meant originally the dying or dead vegetation of winter hasthe high support of W. Mannhardt; and he confirms it by the analogy of the name Death asapplied to the spirit of the ripe corn. Commonly the spirit of the ripe corn is conceived, notas dead, but as old, and hence it goes by the name of the Old Man or the Old Woman. Butin some places the last sheaf cut at harvest, which is generally believed to be the seat of thecorn spirit, is called “the Dead One”: children are warned against entering the corn-fieldsbecause Death sits in the corn; and, in a game played by Saxon children in Transylvania atthe maize harvest, Death is represented by a child completely covered with maize leaves.5. Battle of Summer and WinterSOMETIMES in the popular customs of the peasantry the contrast between the dormantpowers of vegetation in winter and their awakening vitality in spring takes the form of adramatic contest between actors who play the parts respectively of Winter and Summer.Thus in the towns of Sweden on May Day two troops of young men on horseback used tomeet as if for mortal combat. One of them was led by a representative of Winter clad infurs, who threw snowballs and ice in order to prolong the cold weather. The other troopwas commanded by a representative of Summer covered with fresh leaves and flowers. Inthe sham fight which followed the party of Summer came off victorious, and the ceremonyended with a feast. Again, in the region of the middle Rhine, a representative of Summerclad in ivy combats a representative of Winter clad in straw or moss and finally gains avictory over him. The vanquished foe is thrown to the ground and stripped of his casing ofstraw, which is torn to pieces and scattered about, while the youthful comrades of the twochampions sing a song to commemorate the defeat of Winter by Summer. Afterwards theycarry about a summer garland or branch and collect gifts of eggs and bacon from house tohouse. Sometimes the champion who acts the part of Summer is dressed in leaves andflowers and wears a chaplet of flowers on his head. In the Palatinate this mimic conflicttakes place on the fourth Sunday in Lent. All over Bavaria the same drama used to beacted on the same day, and it was still kept up in some places down to the middle of thenineteenth century or later. While Summer appeared clad all in green, decked withfluttering ribbons, and carrying a branch in blossom or a little tree hung with apples andpears, Winter was muffled up in cap and mantle of fur and bore in his hand a snow-shovelor a flail. Accompanied by their respective retinues dressed in corresponding attire, theywent through all the streets of the village, halting before the houses and singing staves ofold songs, for which they received presents of bread, eggs, and fruit. Finally, after a shortstruggle, Winter was beaten by Summer and ducked in the village well or driven out of thevillage with shouts and laughter into the forest.At Goepfritz in Lower Austria, two men personating Summer and Winter used to go fromhouse to house on Shrove Tuesday, and were everywhere welcomed by the children withgreat delight. The representative of Summer was clad in white and bore a sickle; hiscomrade, who played the part of Winter, had a fur-cap on his head, his arms and legs wereswathed in straw, and he carried a flail. In every house they sang verses alternately. At"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Drömling in Brunswick, down to the present time, the contest between Summer andWinter is acted every year at Whitsuntide by a troop of boys and a troop of girls. The boysrush singing, shouting, and ringing bells from house to house to drive Winter away; afterthem come the girls singing softly and led by a May Bride, all in bright dresses and deckedwith flowers and garlands to represent the genial advent of spring. Formerly the part ofWinter was played by a straw-man which the boys carried with them; now it is acted by areal man in disguise.Among the Central Esquimaux of North America the contest between representatives ofsummer and winter, which in Europe has long degenerated into a mere dramaticperformance, is still kept up as a magical ceremony of which the avowed intention is toinfluence the weather. In autumn, when storms announce the approach of the dismalArctic winter, the Esquimaux divide themselves into two parties called respectively theptarmigans and the ducks, the ptarmigans comprising all persons born in winter, and theducks all persons born in summer. A long rope of sealskin is then stretched out, and eachparty laying hold of one end of it seeks by tugging with might and main to drag the otherparty over to its side. If the ptarmigans get the worst of it, then summer has won the gameand fine weather may be expected to prevail through the winter.6. Death and Resurrection of KostrubonkoI RUSSIA funeral ceremonies like those of “Burying the Carnival” and “Carrying outDeath” are celebrated under the names, not of Death or the Carnival, but of certain mythicfigures, Kostrubonko, Kostroma, Kupalo, Lada, and Yarilo. These Russian ceremonies areobserved both in spring and at midsummer. Thus “in Little Russia it used to be the customat Eastertide to celebrate the funeral of a being called Kostrubonko, the deity of the spring.A circle was formed of singers who moved slowly around a girl who lay on the ground as ifdead, and as they went they sang:‘Dead, dead is our Kostrubonko!Dead, dead is our dear one!’until the girl suddenly sprang up, on which the chorus joyfully exclaimed:‘Come to life, come to life has our Kostrubonko!Come to life, come to life has our dear one!’”On the Eve of St. John (Midsummer Eve) a figure of Kupalo is made of straw and “isdressed in woman’s clothes, with a necklace and a floral crown. Then a tree is felled, and,"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"after being decked with ribbons, is set up on some chosen spot. Near this tree, to which theygive the name of Marena [Winter or Death], the straw figure is placed, together with atable, on which stand spirits and viands. Afterwards a bonfire is lit, and the young men andmaidens jump over it in couples, carrying the figure with them. On the next day they stripthe tree and the figure of their ornaments, and throw them both into a stream.” On St.Peter’s Day, the twenty-ninth of June, or on the following Sunday, “the Funeral ofKostroma” or of Lada or of Yarilo is celebrated in Russia. In the Governments of Penzaand Simbirsk the funeral used to be represented as follows. A bonfire was kindled on thetwenty-eighth of June, and on the next day the maidens chose one of their number to playthe part of Kostroma. Her companions saluted her with deep obeisances, placed her on aboard, and carried her to the bank of a stream. There they bathed her in the water, whilethe oldest girl made a basket of lime-tree bark and beat it like a drum. Then they returnedto the village and ended the day with processions, games, and dances. In the Muromdistrict Kostroma was represented by a straw figure dressed in woman’s clothes andflowers. This was laid in a trough and carried with songs to the bank of a lake or river.Here the crowd divided into two sides, of which the one attacked and the other defendedthe figure. At last the assailants gained the day, stripped the figure of its dress andornaments, tore it in pieces, trod the straw of which it was made under foot, and flung itinto the stream; while the defenders of the figure hid their faces in their hands andpretended to bewail the death of Kostroma. In the district of Kostroma the burial of Yarilowas celebrated on the twenty-ninth or thirtieth of June. The people chose an old man andgave him a small coffin containing a Priapus-like figure representing Yarilo. This hecarried out of the town, followed by women chanting dirges and expressing by theirgestures grief and despair. In the open fields a grave was dug, and into it the figure waslowered amid weeping and wailing, after which games and dances were begun, “calling tomind the funeral games celebrated in old times by the pagan Slavonians.” In Little Russiathe figure of Yarilo was laid in a coffin and carried through the streets after sunsetsurrounded by drunken women, who kept repeating mournfully, “He is dead! he is dead!”The men lifted and shook the figure as if they were trying to recall the dead man to life.Then they said to the women, “Women, weep not. I know what is sweeter than honey.” Butthe women continued to lament and chant, as they do at funerals. “Of what was he guilty?He was so good. He will arise no more. O how shall we part from thee? What is life withoutthee? Arise, if only for a brief hour. But he rises not, he not.” At last the Yarilo was buriedin a grave.7. Death and Revival of VegetationTHESE Russian customs are plainly of the same nature as those which in Austria andGermany are known as “Carrying out Death.” Therefore if the interpretation here adoptedof the latter is right, the Russian Kostrubonko, Yarilo, and the rest must also have beenoriginally embodiments of the spirit of vegetation, and their death must have beenregarded as a necessary preliminary to their revival. The revival as a sequel to the death isenacted in the first of the ceremonies described, the death and resurrection ofKostrubonko. The reason why in some of these Russian ceremonies the death of the spiritof vegetation is celebrated at midsummer may be that the decline of summer is dated from"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Midsummer Day, after which the days begin to shorten, and the sun sets out on hisdownward journey:“To the darksome hollowsWhere the frosts of winter lie.”Such a turning-point of the year, when vegetation might be thought to share the incipientthough still almost imperceptible decay of summer, might very well be chosen by primitiveman as a fit moment for resorting to those magic rites by which he hopes to stay thedecline, or at least to ensure the revival, of plant life.But while the death of vegetation appears to have been represented in all, and its revival insome, of these spring and midsummer ceremonies, there are features in some of themwhich can hardly be explained on this hypothesis alone. The solemn funeral, thelamentations, and the mourning attire, which often characterise these rites, are indeedappropriate at the death of the beneficent spirit of vegetation. But what shall we say of theglee with which the effigy is often carried out, of the sticks and stones with which it isassailed, and the taunts and curses which are hurled at it? What shall we say of the dreadof the effigy evinced by the haste with which the bearers scamper home as soon as theyhave thrown it away, and by the belief that some one must soon die in any house into whichit has looked? This dread might perhaps be explained by a belief that there is a certaininfectiousness in the dead spirit of vegetation which renders its approach dangerous. Butthis explanation, besides being rather strained, does not cover the rejoicings which oftenattend the carrying out of Death. We must therefore recognise two distinct and seeminglyopposite features in these ceremonies: on the one hand, sorrow for the death, and affectionand respect for the dead; on the other hand, fear and hatred of the dead, and rejoicings athis death. How the former of these features is to be explained I have attempted to show:how the latter came to be so closely associated with the former is a question which I shalltry to answer in the sequel.8. Analogous Rites in IndiaIN THE KANAGRA district of India there is a custom observed by young girls in springwhich closely resembles some of the European spring ceremonies just described. It is calledthe Ralî Ka melâ, or fair of Ralî, the Ralî being a small painted earthen image of Siva orPârvatî. The custom is in vogue all over the Kanagra district, and its celebration, which isentirely confined to young girls, lasts through most of Chet (March-April) up to theSankrânt of Baisâkh (April). On a morning in March all the young girls of the village takesmall baskets of dûb grass and flowers to an appointed place, where they throw them in aheap. Round this heap they stand in a circle and sing. This goes on every day for ten days,till the heap of grass and flowers has reached a fair height. Then they cut in the jungle twobranches, each with three prongs at one end, and place them, prongs downwards, over the"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"heap of flowers, so as to make two tripods or pyramids. On the single uppermost points ofthese branches they get an image-maker to construct two clay images, one to representSiva, and the other Pârvatî. The girls then divide themselves into two parties, one for Sivaand one for Pârvatî, and marry the images in the usual way, leaving out no part of theceremony. After the marriage they have a feast, the cost of which is defrayed bycontributions solicited from their parents. Then at the next Sankrânt (Baisâkh) they all gotogether to the river-side, throw the images into a deep pool, and weep over the place, asthough they were performing funeral obsequies. The boys of the neighbourhood often teasethem by diving after the images, bringing them up, and waving them about while the girlsare crying over them. The object of the fair is said to be to secure a good husband.That in this Indian ceremony the deities Siva and Pârvatî are conceived as spirits ofvegetation seems to be proved by the placing of their images on branches over a heap ofgrass and flowers. Here, as often in European folk-custom, the divinities of vegetation arerepresented in duplicate, by plants and by puppets. The marriage of these Indian deities inspring corresponds to the European ceremonies in which the marriage of the vernal spiritsof vegetation is represented by the King and Queen of May, the May Bride, Bridegroom ofthe May, and so forth. The throwing of the images into the water, and the mourning forthem, are the equivalents of the European customs of throwing the dead spirit of vegetationunder the name of Death, Yarilo, Kostroma, and the rest, into the water and lamentingover it. Again, in India, as often in Europe, the rite is performed exclusively by females.The notion that the ceremony helps to procure husbands for the girls can be explained bythe quickening and fertilising influence which the spirit of vegetation is believed to exertupon the life of man as well as of plants.9. The Magic SpringTHE GENERAL explanation which we have been led to adopt of these and many similarceremonies is that they are, or were in their origin, magical rites intended to ensure therevival of nature in spring. The means by which they were supposed to effect this end wereimitation and sympathy. Led astray by his ignorance of the true causes of things, primitiveman believed that in order to produce the great phenomena of nature on which his lifedepended he had only to imitate them, and that immediately by a secret sympathy ormystic influence the little drama which he acted in forest glade or mountain dell, on desertplain or wind-swept shore, would be taken up and repeated by mightier actors on a vasterstage. He fancied that by masquerading in leaves and flowers he helped the bare earth toclothe herself with verdure, and that by playing the death and burial of winter he drovethat gloomy season away, and made smooth the path for the footsteps of returning spring.If we find it hard to throw ourselves even in fancy into a mental condition in which suchthings seem possible, we can more easily picture to ourselves the anxiety which the savage,when he first began to lift his thoughts above the satisfaction of his merely animal wants,and to meditate on the causes of things, may have felt as to the continued operation of whatwe now call the laws of nature. To us, familiar as we are with the conception of theuniformity and regularity with which the great cosmic phenomena succeed each other,there seems little ground for apprehension that the causes which produce these effects willcease to operate, at least within the near future. But this confidence in the stability of"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"nature is bred only by the experience which comes of wide observation and long tradition;and the savage, with his narrow sphere of observation and his short-lived tradition, lacksthe very elements of that experience which alone could set his mind at rest in face of theever-changing and often menacing aspects of nature. No wonder, therefore, that he isthrown into a panic by an eclipse, and thinks that the sun or the moon would surely perish,if he did not raise a clamour and shoot his puny shafts into the air to defend the luminariesfrom the monster who threatens to devour them. No wonder he is terrified when in thedarkness of night a streak of sky is suddenly illumined by the flash of a meteor, or thewhole expanse of the celestial arch glows with the fitful light of the Northern Streamers.Even phenomena which recur at fixed and uniform intervals may be viewed by him withapprehension, before he has come to recognise the orderliness of their recurrence. Thespeed or slowness of his recognition of such periodic or cyclic changes in nature will dependlargely on the length of the particular cycle. The cycle, for example, of day and night iseverywhere, except in the polar regions, so short and hence so frequent that men probablysoon ceased to discompose themselves seriously as to the chance of its failing to recur,though the ancient Egyptians, as we have seen, daily wrought enchantments to bring backto the east in the morning the fiery orb which had sunk at evening in the crimson west. Butit was far otherwise with the annual cycle of the seasons. To any man a year is aconsiderable period, seeing that the number of our years is but few at the best. To theprimitive savage, with his short memory and imperfect means of marking the flight of time,a year may well have been so long that he failed to recognise it as a cycle at all, andwatched the changing aspects of earth and heaven with a perpetual wonder, alternatelydelighted and alarmed, elated and cast down, according as the vicissitudes of light andheat, of plant and animal life, ministered to his comfort or threatened his existence. Inautumn when the withered leaves were whirled about the forest by the nipping blast, andhe looked up at the bare boughs, could he feel sure that they would ever be green again? Asday by day the sun sank lower and lower in the sky, could he be certain that the luminarywould ever retrace his heavenly road? Even the waning moon, whose pale sickle rosethinner and thinner every night over the rim of the eastern horizon, may have excited in hismind a fear lest, when it had wholly vanished, there should be moons no more.These and a thousand such misgivings may have thronged the fancy and troubled the peaceof the man who first began to reflect on the mysteries of the world he lived in, and to takethought for a more distant future than the morrow. It was natural, therefore, that withsuch thoughts and fears he should have done all that in him lay to bring back the fadedblossom to the bough, to swing the low sun of winter up to his old place in the summer sky,and to restore its orbed fulness to the silver lamp of the waning moon. We may smile at hisvain endeavours if we please, but it was only by making a long series of experiments, ofwhich some were almost inevitably doomed to failure, that man learned from experiencethe futility of some of his attempted methods and the fruitfulness of others. After all,magical ceremonies are nothing but experiments which have failed and which continue tobe repeated merely because, for reasons which have already been indicated, the operator isunaware of their failure. With the advance of knowledge these ceremonies either cease tobe performed altogether or are kept up from force of habit long after the intention withwhich they were instituted has been forgotten. Thus fallen from their high estate, no longerregarded as solemn rites on the punctual performance of which the welfare and even thelife of the community depend, they sink gradually to the level of simple pageants,"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"mummeries, and pastimes, till in the final stage of degeneration they are wholly abandonedby older people, and, from having once been the most serious occupation of the sage,become at last the idle sport of children. It is in this final stage of decay that most of the oldmagical rites of our European forefathers linger on at the present day, and even from thistheir last retreat they are fast being swept away by the rising tide of those multitudinousforces, moral, intellectual, and social, which are bearing mankind onward to a new andunknown goal. We may feel some natural regret at the disappearance of quaint customsand picturesque ceremonies, which have preserved to an age often deemed dull and prosaicsomething of the flavour and freshness of the olden time, some breath of the springtime ofthe world; yet our regret will be lessened when we remember that these pretty pageants,these now innocent diversions, had their origin in ignorance and superstition; that if theyare a record of human endeavour, they are also a monument of fruitless ingenuity, ofwasted labour, and of blighted hopes; and that for all their gay trappings—their flowers,their ribbons, and their music—they partake far more of tragedy than of farce.The interpretation which, following in the footsteps of W. Mannhardt, I have attempted togive of these ceremonies has been not a little confirmed by the discovery, made since thisbook was first written, that the natives of Central Australia regularly practise magicalceremonies for the purpose of awakening the dormant energies of nature at the approachof what may be called the Australian spring. Nowhere apparently are the alternations ofthe seasons more sudden and the contrasts between them more striking than in the desertsof Central Australia, where at the end of a long period of drought the sandy and stonywilderness, over which the silence and desolation of death appear to brood, is suddenly,after a few days of torrential rain, transformed into a landscape smiling with verdure andpeopled with teeming multitudes of insects and lizards, of frogs and birds. The marvellouschange which passes over the face of nature at such times has been compared even byEuropean observers to the effect of magic; no wonder, then, that the savage should regardit as such in very deed. Now it is just when there is promise of the approach of a goodseason that the natives of Central Australia are wont especially to perform those magicalceremonies of which the avowed intention is to multiply the plants and animals they use asfood. These ceremonies, therefore, present a close analogy to the spring customs of ourEuropean peasantry not only in the time of their celebration, but also in their aim; for wecan hardly doubt that in instituting rites designed to assist the revival of plant life in springour primitive forefathers were moved, not by any sentimental wish to smell at early violets,or pluck the rathe primrose, or watch yellow daffodils dancing in the breeze, but by thevery practical consideration, certainly not formulated in abstract terms, that the life ofman is inextricably bound up with that of plants, and that if they were to perish he couldnot survive. And as the faith of the Australian savage in the efficacy of his magic rites isconfirmed by observing that their performance is invariably followed, sooner or later, bythat increase of vegetable and animal life which it is their object to produce, so, we maysuppose, it was with European savages in the olden time. The sight of the fresh green inbrake and thicket, of vernal flowers blowing on mossy banks, of swallows arriving from thesouth, and of the sun mounting daily higher in the sky, would be welcomed by them as somany visible signs that their enchantments were indeed taking effect, and would inspirethem with a cheerful confidence that all was well with a world which they could thus mouldto suit their wishes. Only in autumn days, as summer slowly faded, would their confidenceagain be dashed by doubts and misgivings at symptoms of decay, which told how vain were"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"all their efforts to stave off for ever the approach of winter and of death.XXIX. The Myth of AdonisTHE SPECTACLE of the great changes which annually pass over the face of the earth haspowerfully impressed the minds of men in all ages, and stirred them to meditate on thecauses of transformations so vast and wonderful. Their curiosity has not been purelydisinterested; for even the savage cannot fail to perceive how intimately his own life isbound up with the life of nature, and how the same processes which freeze the stream andstrip the earth of vegetation menace him with extinction. At a certain stage of developmentmen seem to have imagined that the means of averting the threatened calamity were intheir own hands, and that they could hasten or retard the flight of the seasons by magic art.Accordingly they performed ceremonies and recited spells to make the rain to fall, the sunto shine, animals to multiply, and the fruits of the earth to grow. In course of time the slowadvance of knowledge, which has dispelled so many cherished illusions, convinced at leastthe more thoughtful portion of mankind that the alternations of summer and winter, ofspring and autumn, were not merely the result of their own magical rites, but that somedeeper cause, some mightier power, was at work behind the shifting scenes of nature. Theynow pictured to themselves the growth and decay of vegetation, the birth and death ofliving creatures, as effects of the waxing or waning strength of divine beings, of gods andgoddesses, who were born and died, who married and begot children, on the pattern ofhuman life.Thus the old magical theory of the seasons was displaced, or rather supplemented, by areligious theory. For although men now attributed the annual cycle of change primarily tocorresponding changes in their deities, they still thought that by performing certainmagical rites they could aid the god who was the principle of life, in his struggle with theopposing principle of death. They imagined that they could recruit his failing energies andeven raise him from the dead. The ceremonies which they observed for this purpose were insubstance a dramatic representation of the natural processes which they wished tofacilitate; for it is a familiar tenet of magic that you can produce any desired effect bymerely imitating it. And as they now explained the fluctuations of growth and decay, ofreproduction and dissolution, by the marriage, the death, and the rebirth or revival of thegods, their religious or rather magical dramas turned in great measure on these themes.They set forth the fruitful union of the powers of fertility, the sad death of one at least ofthe divine partners, and his joyful resurrection. Thus a religious theory was blended with amagical practice. The combination is familiar in history. Indeed, few religions have eversucceeded in wholly extricating themselves from the old trammels of magic. Theinconsistency of acting on two opposite principles, however it may vex the soul of thephilosopher, rarely troubles the common man; indeed he is seldom even aware of it. Hisaffair is to act, not to analyse the motives of his action. If mankind had always been logicaland wise, history would not be a long chronicle of folly and crime.Of the changes which the seasons bring with them, the most striking within the temperatezone are those which affect vegetation. The influence of the seasons on animals, thoughgreat, is not nearly so manifest. Hence it is natural that in the magical dramas designed to"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"dispel winter and bring back spring the emphasis should be laid on vegetation, and thattrees and plants should figure in them more prominently than beasts and birds. Yet the twosides of life, the vegetable and the animal, were not dissociated in the minds of those whoobserved the ceremonies. Indeed they commonly believed that the tie between the animaland the vegetable world was even closer than it really is; hence they often combined thedramatic representation of reviving plants with a real or a dramatic union of the sexes forthe purpose of furthering at the same time and by the same act the multiplication of fruits,of animals, and of men. To them the principle of life and fertility, whether animal orvegetable, was one and indivisible. To live and to cause to live, to eat food and to begetchildren, these were the primary wants of men in the past, and they will be the primarywants of men in the future so long as the world lasts. Other things may be added to enrichand beautify human life, but unless these wants are first satisfied, humanity itself mustcease to exist. These two things, therefore, food and children, were what men chiefly soughtto procure by the performance of magical rites for the regulation of the seasons.Nowhere, apparently, have these rites been more widely and solemnly celebrated than inthe lands which border the Eastern Mediterranean. Under the names of Osiris, Tammuz,Adonis, and Attis, the peoples of Egypt and Western Asia represented the yearly decay andrevival of life, especially of vegetable life, which they personified as a god who annuallydied and rose again from the dead. In name and detail the rites varied from place to place:in substance they were the same. The supposed death and resurrection of this orientaldeity, a god of many names but of essentially one nature, is now to be examined. We beginwith Tammuz or Adonis.The worship of Adonis was practised by the Semitic peoples of Babylonia and Syria, andthe Greeks borrowed it from them as early as the seventh century before Christ. The truename of the deity was Tammuz: the appellation of Adonis is merely the Semitic Adon,“lord,” a title of honour by which his worshippers addressed him. But the Greeks througha misunderstanding converted the title of honour into a proper name. In the religiousliterature of Babylonia Tammuz appears as the youthful spouse or lover of Ishtar, the greatmother goddess, the embodiment of the reproductive energies of nature. The references totheir connexion with each other in myth and ritual are both fragmentary and obscure, butwe gather from them that every year Tammuz was believed to die, passing away from thecheerful earth to the gloomy subterranean world, and that every year his divine mistressjourneyed in quest of him “to the land from which there is no returning, to the house ofdarkness, where dust lies on door and bolt.” During her absence the passion of love ceasedto operate: men and beasts alike forgot to reproduce their kinds: all life was threatenedwith extinction. So intimately bound up with the goddess were the sexual functions of thewhole animal kingdom that without her presence they could not be discharged. Amessenger of the great god Ea was accordingly despatched to rescue the goddess on whomso much depended. The stern queen of the infernal regions, Allatu or Eresh-Kigal by name,reluctantly allowed Ishtar to be sprinkled with the Water of Life and to depart, in companyprobably with her lover Tammuz, that the two might return together to the upper world,and that with their return all nature might revive.Laments for the departed Tammuz are contained in several Babylonian hymns, whichliken him to plants that quickly fade. He is"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"“A tamarisk that in the garden has drunk no water,Whose crown in the field has brought forth no blossom.A willow that rejoiced not by the watercourse,A willow whose roots were torn up.A herb that in the garden had drunk no water.”His death appears to have been annually mourned, to the shrill music of flutes, by men andwomen about midsummer in the month named after him, the month of Tammuz. Thedirges were seemingly chanted over an effigy of the dead god, which was washed with purewater, anointed with oil, and clad in a red robe, while the fumes of incense rose into the air,as if to stir his dormant senses by their pungent fragrance and wake him from the sleep ofdeath. In one of these dirges, inscribed Lament of the Flutes for Tammuz, we seem still tohear the voices of the singers chanting the sad refrain and to catch, like far-away music, thewailing notes of the flutes:“At his vanishing away she lifts up a lament,‘Oh my child!’ at his vanishing away she lifts up a lament;‘My Damu!’ at his vanishing away she lifts up a lament.‘My enchanter and priest!’ at his vanishing away she lifts up a lament,At the shining cedar, rooted in a spacious place,In Eanna, above and below, she lifts up a lament.Like the lament that a house lifts up for its master, lifts she up a lament,Like the lament that a city lifts up for its lord, lifts she up a lament.Her lament is the lament for a herb that grows not in the bed,Her lament is the lament for the corn that grows not in the ear.Her chamber is a possession that brings not forth a possession,A weary woman, a weary child, forspent.Her lament is for a great river, where no willows grow,Her lament is for a field, where corn and herbs grow not.Her lament is for a pool, where fishes grow not.Her lament is for a thickest of reeds, where no reeds grow.Her lament is for woods, where tamarisks grow not.Her lament is for a wilderness where no cypresses (?) grow.Her lament is for the depth of a garden of trees, where honey and wine grow not.Her lament is for meadows, where no plants grow.Her lament is for a palace, where length of life grows not.”The tragical story and the melancholy rites of Adonis are better known to us from thedescriptions of Greek writers than from the fragments of Babylonian literature or the brief"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"reference of the prophet Ezekiel, who saw the women of Jerusalem weeping for Tammuz atthe north gate of the temple. Mirrored in the glass of Greek mythology, the oriental deityappears as a comely youth beloved by Aphrodite. In his infancy the goddess hid him in achest, which she gave in charge to Persephone, queen of the nether world. But whenPersephone opened the chest and beheld the beauty of the babe, she refused to give himback to Aphrodite, though the goddess of love went down herself to hell to ransom her dearone from the power of the grave. The dispute between the two goddesses of love and deathwas settled by Zeus, who decreed that Adonis should abide with Persephone in the underworld for one part of the year, and with Aphrodite in the upper world for another part. Atlast the fair youth was killed in hunting by a wild boar, or by the jealous Ares, who turnedhimself into the likeness of a boar in order to compass the death of his rival. Bitterly didAphrodite lament her loved and lost Adonis. In this form of the myth, the contest betweenAphrodite and Persephone for the possession of Adonis clearly reflects the strugglebetween Ishtar and Allatu in the land of the dead, while the decision of Zeus that Adonis isto spend one part of the year under ground and another part above ground is merely aGreek version of the annual disappearance and reappearance of Tammuz.XXX. Adonis in SyriaTHE MYTH of Adonis was localised and his rites celebrated with much solemnity at twoplaces in Western Asia. One of these was Byblus on the coast of Syria, the other wasPaphos in Cyprus. Both were great seats of the worship of Aphrodite, or rather of herSemitic counterpart, Astarte; and of both, if we accept the legends, Cinyras, the father ofAdonis, was king. Of the two cities Byblus was the more ancient; indeed it claimed to be theoldest city in Phoenicia, and to have been founded in the early ages of the world by thegreat god El, whom Greeks and Romans identified with Cronus and Saturn respectively.However that may have been, in historical times it ranked as a holy place, the religiouscapital of the country, the Mecca or Jerusalem of the Phoenicians. The city stood on aheight beside the sea, and contained a great sanctuary of Astarte, where in the midst of aspacious open court, surrounded by cloisters and approached from below by staircases,rose a tall cone or obelisk, the holy image of the goddess. In this sanctuary the rites ofAdonis were celebrated. Indeed the whole city was sacred to him, and the river NahrIbrahim, which falls into the sea a little to the south of Byblus, bore in antiquity the nameof Adonis. This was the kingdom of Cinyras. From the earliest to the latest times the cityappears to have been ruled by kings, assisted perhaps by a senate or council of elders.The last king of Byblus bore the ancient name of Cinyras, and was beheaded by Pompeythe Great for his tyrannous excesses. His legendary namesake Cinyras is said to havefounded a sanctuary of Aphrodite, that is, of Astarte, at a place on Mount Lebanon, distanta day’s journey from the capital. The spot was probably Aphaca, at the source of the riverAdonis, half-way between Byblus and Baalbec; for at Aphaca there was a famous groveand sanctuary of Astarte which Constantine destroyed on account of the flagitiouscharacter of the worship. The site of the temple has been discovered by modern travellersnear the miserable village which still bears the name of Afka at the head of the wild,romantic, wooded gorge of the Adonis. The hamlet stands among groves of noble walnut-"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"trees on the brink of the lyn. A little way off the river rushes from a cavern at the foot of amighty amphitheatre of towering cliffs to plunge in a series of cascades into the awfuldepths of the glen. The deeper it descends, the ranker and denser grows the vegetation,which, sprouting from the crannies and fissures of the rocks, spreads a green veil over theroaring or murmuring stream in the tremendous chasm below. There is somethingdelicious, almost intoxicating, in the freshness of these tumbling waters, in the sweetnessand purity of the mountain air, in the vivid green of the vegetation. The temple, of whichsome massive hewn blocks and a fine column of Syenite granite still mark the site, occupieda terrace facing the source of the river and commanding a magnificent prospect. Across thefoam and the roar of the waterfalls you look up to the cavern and away to the top of thesublime precipices above. So lofty is the cliff that the goats which creep along its ledges tobrowse on the bushes appear like ants to the spectator hundreds of feet below. Seaward theview is especially impressive when the sun floods the profound gorge with golden light,revealing all the fantastic buttresses and rounded towers of its mountain rampart, andfalling softly on the varied green of the woods which clothe its depths. It was here that,according to the legend, Adonis met Aphrodite for the first or the last time, and here hismangled body was buried. A fairer scene could hardly be imagined for a story of tragiclove and death. Yet, sequestered as the valley is and must always have been, it is not whollydeserted. A convent or a village may be observed here and there standing out against thesky on the top of some beetling crag, or clinging to the face of a nearly perpendicular cliffhigh above the foam and the din of the river; and at evening the lights that twinkle throughthe gloom betray the presence of human habitations on slopes which might seeminaccessible to man. In antiquity the whole of the lovely vale appears to have beendedicated to Adonis, and to this day it is haunted by his memory; for the heights whichshut it in are crested at various points by ruined monuments of his worship, some of themoverhanging dreadful abysses, down which it turns the head dizzy to look and see theeagles wheeling about their nests far below. One such monument exists at Ghineh. The faceof a great rock, above a roughly hewn recess, is here carved with figures of Adonis andAphrodite. He is portrayed with spear in rest, awaiting the attack of a bear, while she isseated in an attitude of sorrow. Her grief-stricken figure may well be the mourningAphrodite of the Lebanon described by Macrobius, and the recess in the rock is perhapsher lover’s tomb. Every year, in the belief of his worshippers, Adonis was wounded todeath on the mountains, and every year the face of nature itself was dyed with his sacredblood. So year by year the Syrian damsels lamented his untimely fate, while the redanemone, his flower, bloomed among the cedars of Lebanon, and the river ran red to thesea, fringing the winding shores of the blue Mediterranean, whenever the wind set inshore,with a sinuous band of crimson.XXXI. Adonis in CyprusTHE ISLAND of Cyprus lies but one day’s sail from the coast of Syria. Indeed, on finesummer evenings its mountains may be descried looming low and dark against the red firesof sunset. With its rich mines of copper and its forests of firs and stately cedars, the islandnaturally attracted a commercial and maritime people like the Phoenicians; while theabundance of its corn, its wine, and its oil must have rendered it in their eyes a Land of"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Promise by comparison with the niggardly nature of their own rugged coast, hemmed inbetween the mountains and the sea. Accordingly they settled in Cyprus at a very early dateand remained there long after the Greeks had also established themselves on its shores; forwe know from inscriptions and coins that Phoenician kings reigned at Citium, the Chittimof the Hebrews, down to the time of Alexander the Great. Naturally the Semitic colonistsbrought their gods with them from the mother-land. They worshipped Baal of theLebanon, who may well have been Adonis, and at Amathus on the south coast theyinstituted the rites of Adonis and Aphrodite, or rather Astarte. Here, as at Byblus, theserites resembled the Egyptian worship of Osiris so closely that some people even identifiedthe Adonis of Amathus with Osiris.But the great seat of the worship of Aphrodite and Adonis in Cyprus was Paphos on thesouth-western side of the island. Among the petty kingdoms into which Cyprus was dividedfrom the earliest times until the end of the fourth century before our era Paphos must haveranked with the best. It is a land of hills and billowy ridges, diversified by fields andvineyards and intersected by rivers, which in the course of ages have carved for themselvesbeds of such tremendous depth that travelling in the interior is difficult and tedious. Thelofty range of Mount Olympus (the modern Troodos), capped with snow the greater part ofthe year, screens Paphos from the northerly and easterly winds and cuts it off from the restof the island. On the slopes of the range the last pine-woods of Cyprus linger, shelteringhere and there monasteries in scenery not unworthy of the Apennines. The old city ofPaphos occupied the summit of a hill about a mile from the sea; the newer city sprang up atthe harbour some ten miles off. The sanctuary of Aphrodite at Old Paphos (the modernKuklia) was one of the most celebrated shrines in the ancient world. According toHerodotus, it was founded by Phoenician colonists from Ascalon; but it is possible that anative goddess of fertility was worshipped on the spot before the arrival of the Phoenicians,and that the newcomers identified her with their own Baalath or Astarte, whom she mayhave closely resembled. If two deities were thus fused in one, we may suppose that theywere both varieties of that great goddess of motherhood and fertility whose worshipappears to have been spread all over Western Asia from a very early time. The suppositionis confirmed as well by the archaic shape of her image as by the licentious character of herrites; for both that shape and those rites were shared by her with other Asiatic deities. Herimage was simply a white cone or pyramid. In like manner, a cone was the emblem ofAstarte at Byblus, of the native goddess whom the Greeks called Artemis at Perga inPamphylia, and of the sun-god Heliogabalus at Emesa in Syria. Conical stones, whichapparently served as idols, have also been found at Golgi in Cyprus, and in the Phoeniciantemples of Malta; and cones of sandstone came to light at the shrine of the “Mistress ofTorquoise” among the barren hills and frowning precipices of Sinai.In Cyprus it appears that before marriage all women were formerly obliged by custom toprostitute themselves to strangers at the sanctuary of the goddess, whether she went by thename of Aphrodite, Astarte, or what not. Similar customs prevailed in many parts ofWestern Asia. Whatever its motive, the practice was clearly regarded, not as an orgy oflust, but as a solemn religious duty performed in the service of that great Mother Goddessof Western Asia whose name varied, while her type remained constant, from place to place.Thus at Babylon every woman, whether rich or poor, had once in her life to submit to theembraces of a stranger at the temple of Mylitta, that is, of Ishtar or Astarte, and to dedicate"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"to the goddess the wages earned by this sanctified harlotry. The sacred precinct wascrowded with women waiting to observe the custom. Some of them had to wait there foryears. At Heliopolis or Baalbec in Syria, famous for the imposing grandeur of its ruinedtemples, the custom of the country required that every maiden should prostitute herself toa stranger at the temple of Astarte, and matrons as well as maids testified their devotion tothe goddess in the same manner. The emperor Constantine abolished the custom, destroyedthe temple, and built a church in its stead. In Phoenician temples women prostitutedthemselves for hire in the service of religion, believing that by this conduct they propitiatedthe goddess and won her favour. “It was a law of the Amorites, that she who was about tomarry should sit in fornication seven days by the gate.” At Byblus the people shaved theirheads in the annual mourning for Adonis. Women who refused to sacrifice their hair hadto give themselves up to strangers on a certain day of the festival, and the money whichthey thus earned was devoted to the goddess. A Greek inscription found at Tralles in Lydiaproves that the practice of religious prostitution survived in that country as late as thesecond century of our era. It records of a certain woman, Aurelia Aemilia by name, notonly that she herself served the god in the capacity of a harlot at his express command, butthat her mother and other female ancestors had done the same before her; and thepublicity of the record, engraved on a marble column which supported a votive offering,shows that no stain attached to such a life and such a parentage. In Armenia the noblestfamilies dedicated their daughters to the service of the goddess Anaitis in her temple ofAcilisena, where the damsels acted as prostitutes for a long time before they were given inmarriage. Nobody scrupled to take one of these girls to wife when her period of service wasover. Again, the goddess Ma was served by a multitude of sacred harlots at Comana inPontus, and crowds of men and women flocked to her sanctuary from the neighbouringcities and country to attend the biennial festivals or to pay their vows to the goddess.If we survey the whole of the evidence on this subject, some of which has still to be laidbefore the reader, we may conclude that a great Mother Goddess, the personification of allthe reproductive energies of nature, was worshipped under different names but with asubstantial similarity of myth and ritual by many peoples of Western Asia; that associatedwith her was a lover, or rather series of lovers, divine yet mortal, with whom she matedyear by year, their commerce being deemed essential to the propagation of animals andplants, each in their several kind; and further, that the fabulous union of the divine pairwas simulated and, as it were, multiplied on earth by the real, though temporary, union ofthe human sexes at the sanctuary of the goddess for the sake of thereby ensuring thefruitfulness of the ground and the increase of man and beast.At Paphos the custom of religious prostitution is said to have been instituted by KingCinyras, and to have been practised by his daughters, the sisters of Adonis, who, havingincurred the wrath of Aphrodite, mated with strangers and ended their days in Egypt. Inthis form of the tradition the wrath of Aphrodite is probably a feature added by a laterauthority, who could only regard conduct which shocked his own moral sense as apunishment inflicted by the goddess instead of as a sacrifice regularly enjoined by her onall her devotees. At all events the story indicates that the princesses of Paphos had toconform to the custom as well as women of humble birth.Among the stories which were told of Cinyras, the ancestor of the priestly kings of Paphos"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"and the father of Adonis, there are some that deserve our attention. In the first place, he issaid to have begotten his son Adonis in incestuous intercourse with his daughter Myrrha ata festival of the corn-goddess, at which women robed in white were wont to offer corn-wreaths as first-fruits of the harvest and to observe strict chastity for nine days. Similarcases of incest with a daughter are reported of many ancient kings. It seems unlikely thatsuch reports are without foundation, and perhaps equally improbable that they refer tomere fortuitous outbursts of unnatural lust. We may suspect that they are based on apractice actually observed for a definite reason in certain special circumstances. Now incountries where the royal blood was traced through women only, and where consequentlythe king held office merely in virtue of his marriage with an hereditary princess, who wasthe real sovereign, it appears to have often happened that a prince married his own sister,the princess royal, in order to obtain with her hand the crown which otherwise would havegone to another man, perhaps to a stranger. May not the same rule of descent havefurnished a motive for incest with a daughter? For it seems a natural corollary from such arule that the king was bound to vacate the throne on the death of his wife, the queen, sincehe occupied it only by virtue of his marriage with her. When that marriage terminated, hisright to the throne terminated with it and passed at once to his daughter’s husband. Henceif the king desired to reign after his wife’s death, the only way in which he couldlegitimately continue to do so was by marrying his daughter, and thus prolonging throughher the title which had formerly been his through her mother.Cinyras is said to have been famed for his exquisite beauty and to have been wooed byAphrodite herself. Thus it would appear, as scholars have already observed, that Cinyraswas in a sense a duplicate of his handsome son Adonis, to whom the inflammable goddessalso lost her heart. Further, these stories of the love of Aphrodite for two members of theroyal house of Paphos can hardly be dissociated from the corresponding legend told ofPygmalion, a Phoenician king of Cyprus, who is said to have fallen in love with an image ofAphrodite and taken it to his bed. When we consider that Pygmalion was the father-in-lawof Cinyras, that the son of Cinyras was Adonis, and that all three, in successive generations,are said to have been concerned in a love-intrigue with Aphrodite, we can hardly helpconcluding that the early Phoenician kings of Paphos, or their sons, regularly claimed to benot merely the priests of the goddess but also her lovers, in other words, that in theirofficial capacity they personated Adonis. At all events Adonis is said to have reigned inCyprus, and it appears to be certain that the title of Adonis was regularly borne by the sonsof all the Phoenician kings of the island. It is true that the title strictly signified no morethan “lord”; yet the legends which connect these Cyprian princes with the goddess of lovemake it probable that they claimed the divine nature as well as the human dignity ofAdonis. The story of Pygmalion points to a ceremony of a sacred marriage in which theking wedded the image of Aphrodite, or rather of Astarte. If that was so, the tale was in asense true, not of a single man only, but of a whole series of men, and it would be all themore likely to be told of Pygmalion, if that was a common name of Semitic kings in general,and of Cyprian kings in particular. Pygmalion, at all events, is known as the name of theking of Tyre from whom his sister Dido fled; and a king of Citium and Idalium in Cyprus,who reigned in the time of Alexander the Great, was also called Pygmalion, or ratherPumiyathon, the Phoenician name which the Greeks corrupted into Pygmalion. Further, itdeserves to be noted that the names Pygmalion and Astarte occur together in a Punicinscription on a gold medallion which was found in a grave at Carthage; the characters of"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"the inscription are of the earliest type. As the custom of religious prostitution at Paphos issaid to have been founded by king Cinyras and observed by his daughters, we may surmisethat the kings of Paphos played the part of the divine bridegroom in a less innocent ritethan the form of marriage with a statue; in fact, that at certain festivals each of them hadto mate with one or more of the sacred harlots of the temple, who played Astarte to hisAdonis. If that was so, there is more truth than has commonly been supposed in thereproach cast by the Christian fathers that the Aphrodite worshipped by Cinyras was acommon whore. The fruit of their union would rank as sons and daughters of the deity, andwould in time become the parents of gods and goddesses, like their fathers and mothersbefore them. In this manner Paphos, and perhaps all sanctuaries of the great Asiaticgoddess where sacred prostitution was practised, might be well stocked with human deities,the offspring of the divine king by his wives, concubines, and temple harlots. Any one ofthese might probably succeed his father on the throne or be sacrificed in his steadwhenever stress of war or other grave junctures called, as they sometimes did, for the deathof a royal victim. Such a tax, levied occasionally on the king’s numerous progeny for thegood of the country, would neither extinguish the divine stock nor break the father’s heart,who divided his paternal affection among so many. At all events, if, as there seems reasonto believe, Semitic kings were often regarded at the same time as hereditary deities, it iseasy to understand the frequency of Semitic personal names which imply that the bearersof them were the sons or daughters, the brothers or sisters, the fathers or mothers of a god,and we need not resort to the shifts employed by some scholars to evade the plain sense ofthe words. This interpretation is confirmed by a parallel Egyptian usage; for in Egypt,where the kings were worshipped as divine, the queen was called “the wife of the god” or“the mother of the god,” and the title “father of the god” was borne not only by the king’sreal father but also by his father-in-law. Similarly, perhaps, among the Semites any manwho sent his daughter to swell the royal harem may have been allowed to call himself “thefather of the god.”If we may judge by his name, the Semitic king who bore the name of Cinyras was, likeKing David, a harper; for the name of Cinyras is clearly connected with the Greek cinyra,“a lyre,” which in its turn comes from the Semitic kinnor, “a lyre,” the very word appliedto the instrument on which David played before Saul. We shall probably not err inassuming that at Paphos as at Jerusalem the music of the lyre or harp was not a merepastime designed to while away an idle hour, but formed part of the service of religion, themoving influence of its melodies being perhaps set down, like the effect of wine, to thedirect inspiration of a deity. Certainly at Jerusalem the regular clergy of the templeprophesied to the music of harps, of psalteries, and of cymbals; and it appears that theirregular clergy also, as we may call the prophets, depended on some such stimulus forinducing the ecstatic state which they took for immediate converse with the divinity. Thuswe read of a band of prophets coming down from a high place with a psaltery, a timbrel, apipe, and a harp before them, and prophesying as they went. Again, when the united forcesof Judah and Ephraim were traversing the wilderness of Moab in pursuit of the enemy,they could find no water for three days, and were like to die of thirst, they and the beasts ofburden. In this emergency the prophet Elisha, who was with the army, called for a minstreland bade him play. Under the influence of the music he ordered the soldiers to dig trenchesin the sandy bed of the waterless waddy through which lay the line of march. They did so,and next morning the trenches were full of the water that had drained down into them"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"underground from the desolate, forbidding mountains on either hand. The prophet’ssuccess in striking water in the wilderness resembles the reported success of moderndowsers, though his mode of procedure was different. Incidentally he rendered anotherservice to his countrymen. For the skulking Moabites from their lairs among the rocks sawthe red sun of the desert reflected in the water, and taking it for the blood, or perhapsrather for an omen of the blood, of their enemies, they plucked up heart to attack the campand were defeated with great slaughter.Again, just as the cloud of melancholy which from time to time darkened the moody mindof Saul was viewed as an evil spirit from the Lord vexing him, so on the other hand thesolemn strains of the harp, which soothed and composed his troubled thoughts, may wellhave seemed to the hag-ridden king the very voice of God or of his good angel whisperingpeace. Even in our own day a great religious writer, himself deeply sensitive to the witcheryof music, has said that musical notes, with all their power to fire the blood and melt theheart, cannot be mere empty sounds and nothing more; no, they have escaped from somehigher sphere, they are outpourings of eternal harmony, the voice of angels, the Magnificatof saints. It is thus that the rude imaginings of primitive man are transfigured and hisfeeble lispings echoed with a rolling reverberation in the musical prose of Newman. Indeedthe influence of music on the development of religion is a subject which would repay asympathetic study. For we cannot doubt that this, the most intimate and affecting of all thearts, has done much to create as well as to express the religious emotions, thus modifyingmore or less deeply the fabric of belief to which at first sight it seems only to minister. Themusician has done his part as well as the prophet and the thinker in the making of religion.Every faith has its appropriate music, and the difference between the creeds might almostbe expressed in musical notation. The interval, for example, which divides the wild revels ofCybele from the stately ritual of the Catholic Church is measured by the gulf which seversthe dissonant clash of cymbals and tambourines from the grave harmonies of Palestrinaand Handel. A different spirit breathes in the difference of the music.XXXII. The Ritual of AdonisAT THE FESTIVALS of Adonis, which were held in Western Asia and in Greek lands, thedeath of the god was annually mourned, with a bitter wailing, chiefly by women; images ofhim, dressed to resemble corpses, were carried out as to burial and then thrown into thesea or into springs; and in some places his revival was celebrated on the following day. Butat different places the ceremonies varied somewhat in the manner and apparently also inthe season of their celebration. At Alexandria images of Aphrodite and Adonis weredisplayed on two couches; beside them were set ripe fruits of all kinds, cakes, plantsgrowing in flower-pots, and green bowers twined with anise. The marriage of the loverswas celebrated one day, and on the morrow women attired as mourners, with streaminghair and bared breasts, bore the image of the dead Adonis to the sea-shore and committedit to the waves. Yet they sorrowed not without hope, for they sang that the lost one wouldcome back again. The date at which this Alexandrian ceremony was observed is notexpressly stated; but from the mention of the ripe fruits it has been inferred that it tookplace in late summer. In the great Phoenician sanctuary of Astarte at Byblus the death of"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Adonis was annually mourned, to the shrill wailing notes of the flute, with weeping,lamentation, and beating of the breast; but next day he was believed to come to life againand ascend up to heaven in the presence of his worshippers. The disconsolate believers, leftbehind on earth, shaved their heads as the Egyptians did on the death of the divine bullApis; women who could not bring themselves to sacrifice their beautiful tresses had to givethemselves up to strangers on a certain day of the festival, and to dedicate to Astarte thewages of their shame.This Phoenician festival appears to have been a vernal one, for its date was determined bythe discoloration of the river Adonis, and this has been observed by modern travellers tooccur in spring. At that season the red earth washed down from the mountains by the raintinges the water of the river, and even the sea, for a great way with a blood-red hue, andthe crimson stain was believed to be the blood of Adonis, annually wounded to death by theboar on Mount Lebanon. Again, the scarlet anemone is said to have sprung from the bloodof Adonis, or to have been stained by it; and as the anemone blooms in Syria about Easter,this may be thought to show that the festival of Adonis, or at least one of his festivals, washeld in spring. The name of the flower is probably derived from Naaman (“darling”),which seems to have been an epithet of Adonis. The Arabs still call the anemone “woundsof the Naaman.” The red rose also was said to owe its hue to the same sad occasion; forAphrodite, hastening to her wounded lover, trod on a bush of white roses; the cruel thornstore her tender flesh, and her sacred blood dyed the white roses for ever red. It would beidle, perhaps, to lay much weight on evidence drawn from the calendar of flowers, and inparticular to press an argument so fragile as the bloom of the rose. Yet so far as it counts atall, the tale which links the damask rose with the death of Adonis points to a summerrather than to a spring celebration of his passion. In Attica, certainly, the festival fell at theheight of summer. For the fleet which Athens fitted out against Syracuse, and by thedestruction of which her power was permanently crippled, sailed at midsummer, and by anominous coincidence the sombre rites of Adonis were being celebrated at the very time. Asthe troops marched down to the harbour to embark, the streets through which they passedwere lined with coffins and corpse-like effigies, and the air was rent with the noise ofwomen wailing for the dead Adonis. The circumstance cast a gloom over the sailing of themost splendid armament that Athens ever sent to sea. Many ages afterwards, when theEmperor Julian made his first entry into Antioch, he found in like manner the gay, theluxurious capital of the East plunged in mimic grief for the annual death of Adonis; and ifhe had any presentiment of coming evil, the voices of lamentation which struck upon hisear must have seemed to sound his knell.The resemblance of these ceremonies to the Indian and European ceremonies which I havedescribed elsewhere is obvious. In particular, apart from the somewhat doubtful date of itscelebration, the Alexandrian ceremony is almost identical with the Indian. In both of themthe marriage of two divine beings, whose affinity with vegetation seems indicated by thefresh plants with which they are surrounded, is celebrated in effigy, and the effigies areafterwards mourned over and thrown into the water. From the similarity of these customsto each other and to the spring and midsummer customs of modern Europe we shouldnaturally expect that they all admit of a common explanation. Hence, if the explanationwhich I have adopted of the latter is correct, the ceremony of the death and resurrection ofAdonis must also have been a dramatic representation of the decay and revival of plant life."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"The inference thus based on the resemblance of the customs is confirmed by the followingfeatures in the legend and ritual of Adonis. His affinity with vegetation comes out at once inthe common story of his birth. He was said to have been born from a myrrh-tree, the barkof which bursting, after a ten months’ gestation, allowed the lovely infant to come forth.According to some, a boar rent the bark with his tusk and so opened a passage for thebabe. A faint rationalistic colour was given to the legend by saying that his mother was awoman named Myrrh, who had been turned into a myrrh-tree soon after she hadconceived the child. The use of myrrh as incense at the festival of Adonis may have givenrise to the fable. We have seen that incense was burnt at the corresponding Babylonianrites, just as it was burnt by the idolatrous Hebrews in honour of the Queen of Heaven,who was no other than Astarte. Again, the story that Adonis spent half, or according toothers a third, of the year in the lower world and the rest of it in the upper world, isexplained most simply and naturally by supposing that he represented vegetation,especially the corn, which lies buried in the earth half the year and reappears above groundthe other half. Certainly of the annual phenomena of nature there is none which suggests soobviously the idea of death and resurrection as the disappearance and reappearance ofvegetation in autumn and spring. Adonis has been taken for the sun; but there is nothing inthe sun’s annual course within the temperate and tropical zones to suggest that he is deadfor half or a third of the year and alive for the other half or two-thirds. He might, indeed,be conceived as weakened in winter, but dead he could not be thought to be; his dailyreappearance contradicts the supposition. Within the Arctic Circle, where the sun annuallydisappears for a continuous period which varies from twenty-four hours to six monthsaccording to the latitude, his yearly death and resurrection would certainly be an obviousidea; but no one except the unfortunate astronomer Bailly has maintained that the Adonisworship came from the Arctic regions. On the other hand, the annual death and revival ofvegetation is a conception which readily presents itself to men in every stage of savageryand civilisation; and the vastness of the scale on which this ever-recurring decay andregeneration takes place, together with man’s intimate dependence on it for subsistence,combine to render it the most impressive annual occurrence in nature, at least within thetemperate zones. It is no wonder that a phenomenon so important, so striking, and souniversal should, by suggesting similar ideas, have given rise to similar rites in many lands.We may, therefore, accept as probable an explanation of the Adonis worship which accordsso well with the facts of nature and with the analogy of similar rites in other lands.Moreover, the explanation is countenanced by a considerable body of opinion amongst theancients themselves, who again and again interpreted the dying and reviving god as thereaped and sprouting grain.The character of Tammuz or Adonis as a corn-spirit comes out plainly in an account of hisfestival given by an Arabic writer of the tenth century. In describing the rites and sacrificesobserved at the different seasons of the year by the heathen Syrians of Harran, he says:“Tammuz (July). In the middle of this month is the festival of el-Bûgât, that is, of theweeping women, and this is the Tâ-uz festival, which is celebrated in honour of the god Tâ-uz. The women bewail him, because his lord slew him so cruelly, ground his bones in a mill,and then scattered them to the wind. The women (during this festival) eat nothing whichhas been ground in a mill, but limit their diet to steeped wheat, sweet vetches, dates, raisins,and the like.” Tâ-uz, who is no other than Tammuz, is here like Burns’s John Barleycorn:"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"“They wasted o’er a scorching flameThe marrow of his bones;But a miller us’d him worst of all—For he crush’d him between two stones.”This concentration, so to say, of the nature of Adonis upon the cereal crops is characteristicof the stage of culture reached by his worshippers in historical times. They had left thenomadic life of the wandering hunter and herdsman far behind them; for ages they hadbeen settled on the land, and had depended for their subsistence mainly on the products oftillage. The berries and roots of the wilderness, the grass of the pastures, which had beenmatters of vital importance to their ruder forefathers, were now of little moment to them:more and more their thoughts and energies were engrossed by the staple of their life, thecorn; more and more accordingly the propitiation of the deities of fertility in general and ofthe corn-spirit in particular tended to become the central feature of their religion. The aimthey set before themselves in celebrating the rites was thoroughly practical. It was no vaguepoetical sentiment which prompted them to hail with joy the rebirth of vegetation and tomourn its decline. Hunger, felt or feared, was the mainspring of the worship of Adonis.It has been suggested by Father Lagrange that the mourning for Adonis was essentially aharvest rite designed to propitiate the corngod, who was then either perishing under thesickles of the reapers, or being trodden to death under the hoofs of the oxen on thethreshing-floor. While the men slew him, the women wept crocodile tears at home toappease his natural indignation by a show of grief for his death. The theory fits in well withthe dates of the festivals, which fell in spring or summer; for spring and summer, notautumn, are the seasons of the barley and wheat harvests in the lands which worshippedAdonis. Further, the hypothesis is confirmed by the practice of the Egyptian reapers, wholamented, calling upon Isis, when they cut the first corn; and it is recommended by theanalogous customs of many hunting tribes, who testify great respect for the animals whichthey kill and eat.Thus interpreted the death of Adonis is not the natural decay of vegetation in generalunder the summer heat or the winter cold; it is the violent destruction of the corn by man,who cuts it down on the field, stamps it to pieces on the threshing-floor, and grinds it topowder in the mill. That this was indeed the principal aspect in which Adonis presentedhimself in later times to the agricultural peoples of the Levant, may be admitted; butwhether from the beginning he had been the corn and nothing but the corn, may bedoubted. At an earlier period he may have been to the herdsman, above all, the tenderherbage which sprouts after rain, offering rich pasture to the lean and hungry cattle.Earlier still he may have embodied the spirit of the nuts and berries which the autumnwoods yield to the savage hunter and his squaw. And just as the husband-man mustpropitiate the spirit of the corn which he consumes, so the herdsman must appease thespirit of the grass and leaves which his cattle munch, and the hunter must soothe the spiritof the roots which he digs, and of the fruits which he gathers from the bough. In all casesthe propitiation of the injured and angry, sprite would naturally comprise elaborate"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"excuses and apologies, accompanied by loud lamentations at his decease whenever, throughsome deplorable accident or necessity, he happened to be murdered as well as robbed. Onlywe must bear in mind that the savage hunter and herdsman of those early days hadprobably not yet attained to the abstract idea of vegetation in general; and thataccordingly, so far as Adonis existed for them at all, he must have been the Adon or lord ofeach individual tree and plant rather than a personification of vegetable life as a whole.Thus there would be as many Adonises as there were trees and shrubs, and each of themmight expect to receive satisfaction for any damage done to his person or property. Andyear by year, when the trees were deciduous, every Adonis would seem to bleed to deathwith the red leaves of autumn and to come to life again with the fresh green of spring.There is some reason to think that in early times Adonis was sometimes personated by aliving man who died a violent death in the character of the god. Further, there is evidencewhich goes to show that among the agricultural peoples of the Eastern Mediterranean, thecorn-spirit, by whatever name he was known, was often represented, year by year, byhuman victims slain on the harvest-field. If that was so, it seems likely that the propitiationof the corn-spirit would tend to fuse to some extent with the worship of the dead. For thespirits of these victims might be thought to return to life in the ears which they hadfattened with their blood, and to die a second death at the reaping of the corn. Now theghosts of those who have perished by violence are surly and apt to wreak their vengeanceon their slayers whenever an opportunity offers. Hence the attempt to appease the souls ofthe slaughtered victims would naturally blend, at least in the popular conception, with theattempt to pacify the slain corn-spirit. And as the dead came back in the sprouting corn, sothey might be thought to return in the spring flowers, waked from their long sleep by thesoft vernal airs. They had been laid to their rest under the sod. What more natural than toimagine that the violets and the hyacinths, the roses and the anemones, sprang from theirdust, were empurpled or incarnadined by their blood, and contained some portion of theirspirit?“I sometimes think that never blows so redThe Rose as where some buried Caesar bled;That every Hyacinth the Garden wearsDropt in her Lap from some once lovely Head.“And this reviving Herb whose tender GreenFledges the River-Lip on which we lean—Ah, lean upon it lightly, for who knowsFrom what once lovely Lip it springs unseen?”In the summer after the battle of Landen, the most sanguinary battle of the seventeenthcentury in Europe, the earth, saturated with the blood of twenty thousand slain, brokeforth into millions of poppies, and the traveller who passed that vast sheet of scarlet mightwell fancy that the earth had indeed given up her dead. At Athens the greatCommemoration of the Dead fell in spring about the middle of March, when the early"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"flowers are in bloom. Then the dead were believed to rise from their graves and go aboutthe streets, vainly endeavouring to enter the temples and dwellings, which were barredagainst these perturbed spirits with ropes, buckthorn, and pitch. The name of the festival,according to the most obvious and natural interpretation, means the Festival of Flowers,and the title would fit well with the substance of the ceremonies if at that season the poorghosts were indeed thought to creep from the narrow house with the opening flowers.There may therefore be a measure of truth in the theory of Renan, who saw in the Adonisworship a dreamy voluptuous cult of death, conceived not as the King of Terrors, but as aninsidious enchanter who lures his victims to himself and lulls them into an eternal sleep.The infinite charm of nature in the Lebanon, he thought, lends itself to religious emotionsof this sensuous, visionary sort, hovering vaguely between pain and pleasure, betweenslumber and tears. It would doubtless be a mistake to attribute to Syrian peasants theworship of a conception so purely abstract as that of death in general. Yet it may be truethat in their simple minds the thought of the reviving spirit of vegetation was blent with thevery concrete notion of the ghosts of the dead, who come to life again in spring days withthe early flowers, with the tender green of the corn and the many-tinted blossoms of thetrees. Thus their views of the death and resurrection of nature would be coloured by theirviews of the death and resurrection of man, by their personal sorrows and hopes and fears.In like manner we cannot doubt that Renan’s theory of Adonis was itself deeply tinged bypassionate memories, memories of the slumber akin to death which sealed his own eyes onthe slopes of the Lebanon, memories of the sister who sleeps in the land of Adonis neveragain to wake with the anemones and the roses.XXXIII. The Gardens of AdonisPERHAPS the best proof that Adonis was a deity of vegetation, and especially of the corn,is furnished by the gardens of Adonis, as they were called. These were baskets or pots filledwith earth, in which wheat, barley, lettuces, fennel, and various kinds of flowers were sownand tended for eight days, chiefly or exclusively by women. Fostered by the sun’s heat, theplants shot up rapidly, but having no root they withered as rapidly away, and at the end ofeight days were carried out with the images of the dead Adonis, and flung with them intothe sea or into springs.These gardens of Adonis are most naturally interpreted as representatives of Adonis ormanifestations of his power; they represented him, true to his original nature, in vegetableform, while the images of him, with which they were carried out and cast into the water,portrayed him in his later human shape. All these Adonis ceremonies, if I am right, wereoriginally intended as charms to promote the growth or revival of vegetation; and theprinciple by which they were supposed to produce this effect was homoeopathic orimitative magic. For ignorant people suppose that by mimicking the effect which theydesire to produce they actually help to produce it; thus by sprinkling water they make rain,by lighting a fire they make sunshine, and so on. Similarly, by mimicking the growth ofcrops they hope to ensure a good harvest. The rapid growth of the wheat and barley in thegardens of Adonis was intended to make the corn shoot up; and the throwing of thegardens and of the images into the water was a charm to secure a due supply of fertilising"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"rain. The same, I take it, was the object of throwing the effigies of Death and the Carnivalinto water in the corresponding ceremonies of modern Europe. Certainly the custom ofdrenching with water a leaf-clad person, who undoubtedly personifies vegetation, is stillresorted to in Europe for the express purpose of producing rain. Similarly the custom ofthrowing water on the last corn cut at harvest, or on the person who brings it home (acustom observed in Germany and France, and till lately in England and Scotland), is insome places practised with the avowed intent to procure rain for the next year’s crops.Thus in Wallachia and amongst the Roumanians in Transylvania, when a girl is bringinghome a crown made of the last ears of corn cut at harvest, all who meet her hasten to throwwater on her, and two farm-servants are placed at the door for the purpose; for theybelieve that if this were not done, the crops next year would perish from drought. At thespring ploughing in Prussia, when the ploughmen and sowers returned in the evening fromtheir work in the fields, the farmer’s wife and the servants used to splash water over them.The ploughmen and sowers retorted by seizing every one, throwing them into the pond,and ducking them under the water. The farmer’s wife might claim exemption on paymentof a forfeit, but every one else had to be ducked. By observing this custom they hoped toensure a due supply of rain for the seed.The opinion that the gardens of Adonis are essentially charms to promote the growth ofvegetation, especially of the crops, and that they belong to the same class of customs asthose spring and mid-summer folk-customs of modern Europe which I have described else-where, does not rest for its evidence merely on the intrinsic probability of the case.Fortunately we are able to show that gardens of Adonis (if we may use the expression in ageneral sense) are still planted, first, by a primitive race at their sowing season, and,second, by European peasants at midsummer. Amongst the Oraons and Mundas of Bengal,when the time comes for planting out the rice which has been grown in seed-beds, a partyof young people of both sexes go to the forest and cut a young Karma-tree, or the branch ofone. Bearing it in triumph they return dancing, singing, and beating drums, and plant it inthe middle of the village dancing-ground. A sacrifice is offered to the tree; and nextmorning the youth of both sexes, linked arm-in-arm, dance in a great circle round theKarma-tree, which is decked with strips of coloured cloth and sham bracelets and neckletsof plaited straw. As a preparation for the festival, the daughters of the headman of thevillage cultivate blades of barley in a peculiar way. The seed is sown in moist, sandy soil,mixed with turmeric, and the blades sprout and unfold of a pale-yellow or primrose colour.On the day of the festival the girls take up these blades and carry them in baskets to thedancing-ground, where, prostrating themselves reverentially, they place some of the plantsbefore the Karma-tree. Finally, the Karma-tree is taken away and thrown into a stream ortank. The meaning of planting these barley blades and then presenting them to the Karma-tree is hardly open to question. Trees are supposed to exercise a quickening influence uponthe growth of crops, and amongst the very people in question—the Mundas or Mundaris—“the grove deities are held responsible for the crops.” Therefore, when at the season forplanting out the rice the Mundas bring in a tree and treat it with so much respect, theirobject can only be to foster thereby the growth of the rice which is about to be planted out;and the custom of causing barley blades to sprout rapidly and then presenting them to thetree must be intended to subserve the same purpose, perhaps by reminding the tree-spiritof his duty towards the crops, and stimulating his activity by this visible example of rapidvegetable growth. The throwing of the Karma-tree into the water is to be interpreted as a"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"rain-charm. Whether the barley blades are also thrown into the water is not said; but if myinterpretation of the custom is right, probably they are so. A distinction between thisBengal custom and the Greek rites of Adonis is that in the former the tree-spirit appears inhis original form as a tree; whereas in the Adonis worship he appears in human form,represented as a dead man, though his vegetable nature is indicated by the gardens ofAdonis, which are, so to say, a secondary manifestation of his original power as a tree-spirit.Gardens of Adonis are cultivated also by the Hindoos, with the intention apparently ofensuring the fertility both of the earth and of mankind. Thus at Oodeypoor in Rajputana afestival is held in honour of Gouri, or Isani, the goddess of abundance. The rites beginwhen the sun enters the sign of the Ram, the opening of the Hindoo year. An image of thegoddess Gouri is made of earth, and a smaller one of her husband Iswara, and the two areplaced together. A small trench is next dug, barley is sown in it, and the ground wateredand heated artificially till the grain sprouts, when the women dance round it hand in hand,invoking the blessing of Gouri on their husbands. After that the young corn is taken up anddistributed by the women to the men, who wear it in their turbans. In these rites thedistribution of the barley shoots to the men, and the invocation of a blessing on theirhusbands by the wives, point clearly to the desire of offspring as one motive for observingthe custom. The same motive probably explains the use of gardens of Adonis at themarriage of Brahmans in the Madras Presidency. Seeds of five or nine sorts are mixed andsown in earthen pots, which are made specially for the purpose and are filled with earth.Bride and bridegroom water the seeds both morning and evening for four days; and on thefifth day the seedlings are thrown, like the real gardens of Adonis, into a tank or river.In Sardinia the gardens of Adonis are still planted in connexion with the great midsummerfestival which bears the name of St. John. At the end of March or on the first of April ayoung man of the village presents himself to a girl, and asks her to be his comare (gossip orsweetheart), offering to be her compare. The invitation is considered as an honour by thegirl’s family, and is gladly accepted. At the end of May the girl makes a pot of the bark ofthe cork-tree, fills it with earth, and sows a handful of wheat and barley in it. The pot beingplaced in the sun and often watered, the corn sprouts rapidly and has a good head byMidsummer Eve (St. John’s Eve, the twenty-third of June). The pot is then called Erme orNenneri. On St. John’s Day the young man and the girl, dressed in their best, accompaniedby a long retinue and preceded by children gambolling and frolicking, move in processionto a church outside the village. Here they break the pot by throwing it against the door ofthe church. Then they sit down in a ring on the grass and eat eggs and herbs to the music offlutes. Wine is mixed in a cup and passed round, each one drinking as it passes. Then theyjoin hands and sing “Sweethearts of St. John” (Compare e comare di San Giovanni) overand over again, the flutes playing the while. When they tire of singing they stand up anddance gaily in a ring till evening. This is the general Sardinian custom. As practised atOzieri it has some special features. In May the pots are made of cork-bark and plantedwith corn, as already described. Then on the Eve of St. John the window-sills are drapedwith rich cloths, on which the pots are placed, adorned with crimson and blue silk andribbons of various colours. On each of the pots they used formerly to place a statuette orcloth doll dressed as a woman, or a Priapus-like figure made of paste; but this custom,rigorously forbidden by the Church, has fallen into disuse. The village swains go about in a"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"troop to look at the pots and their decorations and to wait for the girls, who assemble onthe public square to celebrate the festival. Here a great bonfire is kindled, round whichthey dance and make merry. Those who wish to be “Sweethearts of St. John” act as follows.The young man stands on one side of the bonfire and the girl on the other, and they, in amanner, join hands by each grasping one end of a long stick, which they pass three timesbackwards and forwards across the fire, thus thrusting their hands thrice rapidly into theflames. This seals their relationship to each other. Dancing and music go on till late atnight. The correspondence of these Sardinian pots of grain to the gardens of Adonis seemscomplete, and the images formerly placed in them answer to the images of Adonis whichaccompanied his gardens.Customs of the same sort are observed at the same season in Sicily. Pairs of boys and girlsbecome gossips of St. John on St. John’s Day by drawing each a hair from his or her headand performing various ceremonies over them. Thus they tie the hairs together and throwthem up in the air, or exchange them over a potsherd, which they afterwards break in two,preserving each a fragment with pious care. The tie formed in the latter way is supposed tolast for life. In some parts of Sicily the gossips of St. John present each other with plates ofsprouting corn, lentils, and canary seed, which have been planted forty days before thefestival. The one who receives the plate pulls a stalk of the young plants, binds it with aribbon, and preserves it among his or her greatest treasures, restoring the platter to thegiver. At Catania the gossips exchange pots of basil and great cucumbers; the girls tend thebasil, and the thicker it grows the more it is prized.In these midsummer customs of Sardinia and Sicily it is possible that, as Mr. R. Wünschsupposes, St. John has replaced Adonis. We have seen that the rites of Tammuz or Adoniswere commonly celebrated about midsummer; according to Jerome, their date was June.In Sicily gardens of Adonis are still sown in spring as well as in summer, from which wemay perhaps infer that Sicily as well as Syria celebrated of old a vernal festival of the deadand risen god. At the approach of Easter, Sicilian women sow wheat, lentils, andcanaryseed in plates, which they keep in the dark and water every two days. The plantssoon shoot up; the stalks are tied together with red ribbons, and the plates containing themare placed on the sepulchres which, with the effigies of the dead Christ, are made up inCatholic and Greek churches on Good Friday, just as the gardens of Adonis were placed onthe grave of the dead Adonis. The practice is not confined to Sicily, for it is observed also atCosenza in Calabria, and perhaps in other places. The whole custom—sepulchres as well asplates of sprouting grain—may be nothing but a continuation, under a different name, ofthe worship of Adonis.Nor are these Sicilian and Calabrian customs the only Easter ceremonies which resemblethe rites of Adonis. “During the whole of Good Friday a waxen effigy of the dead Christ isexposed to view in the middle of the Greek churches and is covered with fervent kisses bythe thronging crowd, while the whole church rings with melancholy, monotonous dirges.Late in the evening, when it has grown quite dark, this waxen image is carried by thepriests into the street on a bier adorned with lemons, roses, jessamine, and other flowers,and there begins a grand procession of the multitude, who move in serried ranks, with slowand solemn step, through the whole town. Every man carries his taper and breaks out intodoleful lamentation. At all the houses which the procession passes there are seated women"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"with censers to fumigate the marching host. Thus the community solemnly buries its Christas if he had just died. At last the waxen image is again deposited in the church, and thesame lugubrious chants echo anew. These lamentations, accompanied by a strict fast,continue till midnight on Saturday. As the clock strikes twelve, the bishop appears andannounces the glad tidings that ‘Christ is risen,’ to which the crowd replies, ‘He is risenindeed,’ and at once the whole city bursts into an uproar of joy, which finds vent in shrieksand shouts, in the endless discharge of carronades and muskets, and the explosion of fire-works of every sort. In the very same hour people plunge from the extremity of the fast intothe enjoyment of the Easter lamb and neat wine.”In like manner the Catholic Church has been accustomed to bring before its followers in avisible form the death and resurrection of the Redeemer. Such sacred dramas are wellfitted to impress the lively imagination and to stir the warm feelings of a susceptiblesouthern race, to whom the pomp and pageantry of Catholicism are more congenial than tothe colder temperament of the Teutonic peoples.When we reflect how often the Church has skilfully contrived to plant the seeds of the newfaith on the old stock of paganism, we may surmise that the Easter celebration of the deadand risen Christ was grafted upon a similar celebration of the dead and risen Adonis,which, as we have seen reason to believe, was celebrated in Syria at the same season. Thetype, created by Greek artists, of the sorrowful goddess with her dying lover in her arms,resembles and may have been the model of the Pietà of Christian art, the Virgin with thedead body of her divine Son in her lap, of which the most celebrated example is the one byMichael Angelo in St. Peters. That noble group, in which the living sorrow of the mothercontrasts so wonderfully with the languor of death in the son, is one of the finestcompositions in marble. Ancient Greek art has bequeathed to us few works so beautiful,and none so pathetic.In this connexion a well-known statement of Jerome may not be without significance. Hetells us that Bethlehem, the traditionary birthplace of the Lord, was shaded by a grove ofthat still older Syrian Lord, Adonis, and that where the infant Jesus had wept, the lover ofVenus was bewailed. Though he does not expressly say so, Jerome seems to have thoughtthat the grove of Adonis had been planted by the heathen after the birth of Christ for thepurpose of defiling the sacred spot. In this he may have been mistaken. If Adonis wasindeed, as I have argued, the spirit of the corn, a more suitable name for his dwelling-placecould hardly be found than Bethlehem, “the House of Bread,” and he may well have beenworshipped there at his House of Bread long ages before the birth of Him who said, “I amthe bread of life.” Even on the hypothesis that Adonis followed rather than preceded Christat Bethlehem, the choice of his sad figure to divert the allegiance of Christians from theirLord cannot but strike us as eminently appropriate when we remember the similarity ofthe rites which commemorated the death and resurrection of the two. One of the earliestseats of the worship of the new god was Antioch, and at Antioch, as we have seen, the deathof the old god was annually celebrated with great solemnity. A circumstance whichattended the entrance of Julian into the city at the time of the Adonis festival may perhapsthrow some light on the date of its celebration. When the emperor drew near to the city hewas received with public prayers as if he had been a god, and he marvelled at the voices ofa great multitude who cried that the Star of Salvation had dawned upon them in the East."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"This may doubtless have been no more than a fulsome compliment paid by an obsequiousOriental crowd to the Roman emperor. But it is also possible that the rising of a bright starregularly gave the signal for the festival, and that as chance would have it the star emergedabove the rim of the eastern horizon at the very moment of the emperor’s approach. Thecoincidence, if it happened, could hardly fail to strike the imagination of a superstitiousand excited multitude, who might thereupon hail the great man as the deity whose comingwas announced by the sign in the heavens. Or the emperor may have mistaken for agreeting to himself the shouts which were addressed to the star. Now Astarte, the divinemistress of Adonis, was identified with the planet Venus, and her changes from a morningto an evening star were carefully noted by the Babylonian astronomers, who drew omensfrom her alternate appearance and disappearance. Hence we may conjecture that thefestival of Adonis was regularly timed to coincide with the appearance of Venus as theMorning or Evening Star. But the star which the people of Antioch saluted at the festivalwas seen in the East; therefore, if it was indeed Venus, it can only have been the MorningStar. At Aphaca in Syria, where there was a famous temple of Astarte, the signal for thecelebration of the rites was apparently given by the flashing of a meteor, which on a certainday fell like a star from the top of Mount Lebanon into the river Adonis. The meteor wasthought to be Astarte herself, and its flight through the air might naturally be interpretedas the descent of the amorous goddess to the arms of her lover. At Antioch and elsewherethe appearance of the Morning Star on the day of the festival may in like manner havebeen hailed as the coming of the goddess of love to wake her dead leman from his earthybed. If that were so, we may surmise that it was the Morning Star which guided the wisemen of the East to Bethlehem, the hallowed spot which heard, in the language of Jerome,the weeping of the infant Christ and the lament for Adonis.XXXIV. The Myth and Ritual of AttisANOTHER of those gods whose supposed death and resurrection struck such deep rootsinto the faith and ritual of Western Asia is Attis. He was to Phrygia what Adonis was toSyria. Like Adonis, he appears to have been a god of vegetation, and his death andresurrection were annually mourned and rejoiced over at a festival in spring. The legendsand rites of the two gods were so much alike that the ancients themselves sometimesidentified them. Attis was said to have been a fair young shepherd or herdsman beloved byCybele, the Mother of the Gods, a great Asiatic goddess of fertility, who had her chief homein Phrygia. Some held that Attis was her son. His birth, like that of many other heroes, issaid to have been miraculous. His mother, Nana, was a virgin, who conceived by putting aripe almond or a pomegranate in her bosom. Indeed in the Phrygian cosmogony an almondfigured as the father of all things, perhaps because its delicate lilac blossom is one of thefirst heralds of the spring, appearing on the bare boughs before the leaves have opened.Such tales of virgin mothers are relics of an age of childish ignorance when men had not yetrecognized the intercourse of the sexes as the true cause of offspring. Two differentaccounts of the death of Attis were current. According to the one he was killed by a boar,like Adonis. According to the other he unmanned himself under a pine-tree, and bled todeath on the spot. The latter is said to have been the local story told by the people ofPessinus, a great seat of the worship of Cybele, and the whole legend of which the story"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"forms a part is stamped with a character of rudeness and savagery that speaks strongly forits antiquity. Both tales might claim the support of custom, or rather both were probablyinvented to explain certain customs observed by the worshippers. The story of the self-mutilation of Attis is clearly an attempt to account for the self-mutilation of his priests, whoregularly castrated themselves on entering the service of the goddess. The story of his deathby the boar may have been told to explain why his worshippers, especially the people ofPessinus, abstained from eating swine. In like manner the worshippers of Adonis abstainedfrom pork, because a boar had killed their god. After his death Attis is said to have beenchanged into a pine-tree.The worship of the Phrygian Mother of the Gods was adopted by the Romans in 204 B.C.towards the close of their long struggle with Hannibal. For their drooping spirits had beenopportunely cheered by a prophecy, alleged to be drawn from that convenient farrago ofnonsense, the Sibylline Books, that the foreign invader would be driven from Italy if thegreat Oriental goddess were brought to Rome. Accordingly ambassadors were despatchedto her sacred city Pessinus in Phrygia. The small black stone which embodied the mightydivinity was entrusted to them and conveyed to Rome, where it was received with greatrespect and installed in the temple of Victory on the Palatine Hill. It was the middle ofApril when the goddess arrived, and she went to work at once. For the harvest that yearwas such as had not been seen for many a long day, and in the very next year Hannibal andhis veterans embarked for Africa. As he looked his last on the coast of Italy, fading behindhim in the distance, he could not foresee that Europe, which had repelled the arms, wouldyet yield to the gods, of the Orient. The vanguard of the conquerors had already encampedin the heart of Italy before the rearguard of the beaten army fell sullenly back from itsshores.We may conjecture, though we are not told, that the Mother of the Gods brought with herthe worship of her youthful lover or son to her new home in the West. Certainly theRomans were familiar with the Galli, the emasculated priests of Attis, before the close ofthe Republic. These unsexed beings, in their Oriental costume, with little images suspendedon their breasts, appear to have been a familiar sight in the streets of Rome, which theytraversed in procession, carrying the image of the goddess and chanting their hymns to themusic of cymbals and tambourines, flutes and horns, while the people, impressed by thefantastic show and moved by the wild strains, flung alms to them in abundance, and buriedthe image and its bearers under showers of roses. A further step was taken by the EmperorClaudius when he incorporated the Phrygian worship of the sacred tree, and with itprobably the orgiastic rites of Attis, in the established religion of Rome. The great springfestival of Cybele and Attis is best known to us in the form in which it was celebrated atRome; but as we are informed that the Roman ceremonies were also Phrygian, we mayassume that they differed hardly, if at all, from their Asiatic original. The order of thefestival seems to have been as follows.On the twenty-second day of March, a pine-tree was cut in the woods and brought into thesanctuary of Cybele, where it was treated as a great divinity. The duty of carrying thesacred tree was entrusted to a guild of Tree-bearers. The trunk was swathed like a corpsewith woollen bands and decked with wreaths of violets, for violets were said to have sprungfrom the blood of Attis, as roses and anemones from the blood of Adonis; and the effigy of"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"a young man, doubtless Attis himself, was tied to the middle of the stem. On the second dayof the festival, the twenty-third of March, the chief ceremony seems to have been a blowingof trumpets. The third day, the twenty-fourth of March, was known as the Day of Blood:the Archigallus or highpriest drew blood from his arms and presented it as an offering. Norwas he alone in making this bloody sacrifice. Stirred by the wild barbaric music of clashingcymbals, rumbling drums, droning horns, and screaming flutes, the inferior clergy whirledabout in the dance with waggling heads and streaming hair, until, rapt into a frenzy ofexcitement and insensible to pain, they gashed their bodies with potsherds or slashed themwith knives in order to bespatter the altar and the sacred tree with their flowing blood. Theghastly rite probably formed part of the mourning for Attis and may have been intended tostrengthen him for the resurrection. The Australian aborigines cut themselves in likemanner over the graves of their friends for the purpose, perhaps, of enabling them to beborn again. Further, we may conjecture, though we are not expressly told, that it was onthe same Day of Blood and for the same purpose that the novices sacrificed their virility.Wrought up to the highest pitch of religious excitement they dashed the severed portions ofthemselves against the image of the cruel goddess. These broken instruments of fertilitywere afterwards reverently wrapt up and buried in the earth or in subterranean chamberssacred to Cybele, where, like the offering of blood, they may have been deemedinstrumental in recalling Attis to life and hastening the general resurrection of nature,which was then bursting into leaf and blossom in the vernal sunshine. Some confirmationof this conjecture is furnished by the savage story that the mother of Attis conceived byputting in her bosom a pomegranate sprung from the severed genitals of a man-monsternamed Agdestis, a sort of double of Attis.If there is any truth in this conjectural explanation of the custom, we can readilyunderstand why other Asiatic goddesses of fertility were served in like manner by eunuchpriests. These feminine deities required to receive from their male ministers, whopersonated the divine lovers, the means of discharging their beneficent functions: they hadthemselves to be impregnated by the life-giving energy before they could transmit it to theworld. Goddesses thus ministered to by eunuch priests were the great Artemis of Ephesusand the great Syrian Astarte of Hierapolis, whose sanctuary, frequented by swarms ofpilgrims and enriched by the offerings of Assyria and Babylonia, of Arabia and Phoenicia,was perhaps in the days of its glory the most popular in the East. Now the unsexed priestsof this Syrian goddess resembled those of Cybele so closely that some people took them tobe the same. And the mode in which they dedicated themselves to the religious life wassimilar. The greatest festival of the year at Hierapolis fell at the beginning of spring, whenmultitudes thronged to the sanctuary from Syria and the regions round about. While theflutes played, the drums beat, and the eunuch priests slashed themselves with knives, thereligious excitement gradually spread like a wave among the crowd of onlookers, and manya one did that which he little thought to do when he came as a holiday spectator to thefestival. For man after man, his veins throbbing with the music, his eyes fascinated by thesight of the streaming blood, flung his garments from him, leaped forth with a shout, andseizing one of the swords which stood ready for the purpose, castrated himself on the spot.Then he ran through the city, holding the bloody pieces in his hand, till he threw them intoone of the houses which he passed in his mad career. The household thus honoured had tofurnish him with a suit of female attire and female ornaments, which he wore for the rest ofhis life. When the tumult of emotion had subsided, and the man had come to himself again,"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"the irrevocable sacrifice must often have been followed by passionate sorrow and lifelongregret. This revulsion of natural human feeling after the frenzies of a fanatical religion ispowerfully depicted by Catullus in a celebrated poem.The parallel of these Syrian devotees confirms the view that in the similar worship ofCybele the sacrifice of virility took place on the Day of Blood at the vernal rites of thegoddess, when the violets, supposed to spring from the red drops of her wounded lover,were in bloom among the pines. Indeed the story that Attis unmanned himself under apine-tree was clearly devised to explain why his priests did the same beside the sacredviolet-wreathed tree at his festival. At all events, we can hardly doubt that the Day of Bloodwitnessed the mourning for Attis over an effigy of him which was afterwards buried. Theimage thus laid in the sepulchre was probably the same which had hung upon the tree.Throughout the period of mourning the worshippers fasted from bread, nominally becauseCybele had done so in her grief for the death of Attis, but really perhaps for the samereason which induced the women of Harran to abstain from eating anything ground in amill while they wept for Tammuz. To partake of bread or flour at such a season might havebeen deemed a wanton profanation of the bruised and broken body of the god. Or the fastmay possibly have been a preparation for a sacramental meal.But when night had fallen, the sorrow of the worshippers was turned to joy. For suddenly alight shone in the darkness: the tomb was opened: the god had risen from the dead; and asthe priest touched the lips of the weeping mourners with balm, he softly whispered in theirears the glad tidings of salvation. The resurrection of the god was hailed by his disciples asa promise that they too would issue triumphant from the corruption of the grave. On themorrow, the twenty-fifth day of March, which was reckoned the vernal equinox, the divineresurrection was celebrated with a wild outburst of glee. At Rome, and probably elsewhere,the celebration took the form of a carnival. It was the Festival of Joy (Hilaria). A universallicence prevailed. Every man might say and do what he pleased. People went about thestreets in disguise. No dignity was too high or too sacred for the humblest citizen to assumewith impunity. In the reign of Commodus a band of conspirators thought to take advantageof the masquerade by dressing in the uniform of the Imperial Guard, and so, mingling withthe crowd of merrymakers, to get within stabbing distance of the emperor. But the plotmiscarried. Even the stern Alexander Severus used to relax so far on the joyous day as toadmit a pheasant to his frugal board. The next day, the twenty-sixth of March, was given torepose, which must have been much needed after the varied excitements and fatigues of thepreceding days. Finally, the Roman festival closed on the twenty-seventh of March with aprocession to the brook Almo. The silver image of the goddess, with its face of jagged blackstone, sat in a waggon drawn by oxen. Preceded by the nobles walking barefoot, it movedslowly, to the loud music of pipes and tambourines, out by the Porta Capena, and so downto the banks of the Almo, which flows into the Tiber just below the walls of Rome. Therethe high-priest, robed in purple, washed the waggon, the image, and the other sacredobjects in the water of the stream. On returning from their bath, the wain and the oxenwere strewn with fresh spring flowers. All was mirth and gaiety. No one thought of theblood that had flowed so lately. Even the eunuch priests forgot their wounds.Such, then, appears to have been the annual solemnisation of the death and resurrection ofAttis in spring. But besides these public rites, his worship is known to have comprised"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"certain secret or mystic ceremonies, which probably aimed at bringing the worshipper, andespecially the novice, into closer communication with his god. Our information as to thenature of these mysteries and the date of their celebration is unfortunately very scanty, butthey seem to have included a sacramental meal and a baptism of blood. In the sacramentthe novice became a partaker of the mysteries by eating out of a drum and drinking out ofa cymbal, two instruments of music which figured prominently in the thrilling orchestra ofAttis. The fast which accompanied the mourning for the dead god may perhaps have beendesigned to prepare the body of the communicant for the reception of the blessedsacrament by purging it of all that could defile by contact the sacred elements. In thebaptism the devotee, crowned with gold and wreathed with fillets, descended into a pit, themouth of which was covered with a wooden grating. A bull, adorned with garlands offlowers, its forehead glittering with gold leaf, was then driven on to the grating and therestabbed to death with a consecrated spear. Its hot reeking blood poured in torrents throughthe apertures, and was received with devout eagerness by the worshipper on every part ofhis person and garments, till he emerged from the pit, drenched, dripping, and scarlet fromhead to foot, to receive the homage, nay the adoration, of his fellows as one who had beenborn again to eternal life and had washed away his sins in the blood of the bull. For sometime afterwards the fiction of a new birth was kept up by dieting him on milk like a new-born babe. The regeneration of the worshipper took place at the same time as theregeneration of his god, namely at the vernal equinox. At Rome the new birth and theremission of sins by the shedding of bull’s blood appear to have been carried out above allat the sanctuary of the Phrygian goddess on the Vatican Hill, at or near the spot where thegreat basilica of St. Peter’s now stands; for many inscriptions relating to the rites werefound when the church was being enlarged in 1608 or 1609. From the Vatican as a centrethis barbarous system of superstition seems to have spread to other parts of the Romanempire. Inscriptions found in Gaul and Germany prove that provincial sanctuariesmodelled their ritual on that of the Vatican. From the same source we learn that thetesticles as well as the blood of the bull played an important part in the ceremonies.Probably they were regarded as a powerful charm to promote fertility and hasten the newbirth.XXXV. Attis as a God of VegetationTHE ORIGINAL character of Attis as a tree-spirit is brought out plainly by the part whichthe pine-tree plays in his legend, his ritual, and his monuments. The story that he was ahuman being transformed into a pine-tree is only one of those transparent attempts atrationalising old beliefs which meet us so frequently in mythology. The bringing in of thepine-tree from the woods, decked with violets and woollen bands, is like bringing in theMay-tree or Summer-tree in modern folk-custom; and the effigy which was attached to thepine-tree was only a duplicate representative of the tree-spirit Attis. After being fastened tothe tree, the effigy was kept for a year and then burned. The same thing appears to havebeen sometimes done with the May-pole; and in like manner the effigy of the corn-spirit,made at harvest, is often preserved till it is replaced by a new effigy at next year’s harvest.The original intention of such customs was no doubt to maintain the spirit of vegetation inlife throughout the year. Why the Phrygians should have worshipped the pine above other"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"trees we can only guess. Perhaps the sight of its changeless, though sombre, green crestingthe ridges of the high hills above the fading splendour of the autumn woods in the valleysmay have seemed to their eyes to mark it out as the seat of a diviner life, of somethingexempt from the sad vicissitudes of the seasons, constant and eternal as the sky whichstooped to meet it. For the same reason, perhaps, ivy was sacred to Attis; at all events, weread that his eunuch priests were tattooed with a pattern of ivy leaves. Another reason forthe sanctity of the pine may have been its usefulness. The cones of the stone-pine containedible nut-like seeds, which have been used as food since antiquity, and are still eaten, forexample, by the poorer classes in Rome. Moreover, a wine was brewed from these seeds,and this may partly account for the orgiastic nature of the rites of Cybele, which theancients compared to those of Dionysus. Further, pine-cones were regarded as symbols orrather instruments of fertility. Hence at the festival of the Thesmophoria they were thrown,along with pigs and other agents or emblems of fecundity, into the sacred vaults of Demeterfor the purpose of quickening the ground and the wombs of women.Like tree-spirits in general, Attis was apparently thought to wield power over the fruits ofthe earth or even to be identical with the corn. One of his epithets was “very fruitful”: hewas addressed as the “reaped green (or yellow) ear of corn”; and the story of his sufferings,death, and resurrection was interpreted as the ripe grain wounded by the reaper, buried inthe granary, and coming to life again when it is sown in the ground. A statue of him in theLateran Museum at Rome clearly indicates his relation to the fruits of the earth, andparticularly to the corn; for it represents him with a bunch of ears of corn and fruit in hishand, and a wreath of pine-cones, pomegranates, and other fruits on his head, while fromthe top of his Phrygian cap ears of corn are sprouting. On a stone urn, which contained theashes of an Archigallus or high-priest of Attis, the same idea is expressed in a slightlydifferent way. The top of the urn is adorned with ears of corn carved in relief, and it issurmounted by the figure of a cock, whose tail consists of ears of corn. Cybele in likemanner was conceived as a goddess of fertility who could make or mar the fruits of theearth; for the people of Augustodunum (Autun) in Gaul used to cart her image about in awaggon for the good of the fields and vineyards, while they danced and sang before it, andwe have seen that in Italy an unusually fine harvest was attributed to the recent arrival ofthe Great Mother. The bathing of the image of the goddess in a river may well have been arain-charm to ensure an abundant supply of moisture for the crops.XXXVI. Human Representatives of AttisFROM INSCRIPTIONS it appears that both at Pessinus and Rome the high-priest ofCybele regularly bore the name of Attis. It is therefore a reasonable conjecture that heplayed the part of his namesake, the legendary Attis, at the annual festival. We have seenthat on the Day of Blood he drew blood from his arms, and this may have been an imitationof the self-inflicted death of Attis under the pine-tree. It is not inconsistent with thissupposition that Attis was also represented at these ceremonies by an effigy; for instancescan be shown in which the divine being is first represented by a living person andafterwards by an effigy, which is then burned or otherwise destroyed. Perhaps we may go astep farther and conjecture that this mimic killing of the priest, accompanied by a real"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"effusion of his blood, was in Phrygia, as it has been elsewhere, a substitute for a humansacrifice which in earlier times was actually offered.A reminiscence of the manner in which these old representatives of the deity were put todeath is perhaps preserved in the famous story of Marsyas. He was said to be a Phrygiansatyr or Silenus, according to others a shepherd or herdsman, who played sweetly on theflute. A friend of Cybele, he roamed the country with the disconsolate goddess to soothe hergrief for the death of Attis. The composition of the Mother’s Air, a tune played on the flutein honour of the Great Mother Goddess, was attributed to him by the people of Celaenae inPhrygia. Vain of his skill, he challenged Apollo to a musical contest, he to play on the fluteand Apollo on the lyre. Being vanquished, Marsyas was tied up to a pine-tree and flayed orcut limb from limb either by the victorious Apollo or by a Scythian slave. His skin wasshown at Celaenae in historical times. It hung at the foot of the citadel in a cave from whichthe river Marsyas rushed with an impetuous and noisy tide to join the Maeander. So theAdonis bursts full-born from the precipices of the Lebanon; so the blue river of Ibreezleaps in a crystal jet from the red rocks of the Taurus; so the stream, which now rumblesdeep underground, used to gleam for a moment on its passage from darkness to darknessin the dim light of the Corycian cave. In all these copious fountains, with their glad promiseof fertility and life, men of old saw the hand of God and worshipped him beside the rushingriver with the music of its tumbling waters in their ears. At Celaenae, if we can trusttradition, the piper Marsyas, hanging in his cave, had a soul for harmony even in death; forit is said that at the sound of his native Phrygian melodies the skin of the dead satyr used tothrill, but that if the musician struck up an air in praise of Apollo it remained deaf andmotionless.In this Phrygian satyr, shepherd, or herdsman who enjoyed the friendship of Cybele,practised the music so characteristic of her rites, and died a violent death on her sacredtree, the pine, may we not detect a close resemblance to Attis, the favourite shepherd orherdsman of the goddess, who is himself described as a piper, is said to have perishedunder a pine-tree, and was annually represented by an effigy hung, like Marsyas, upon apine? We may conjecture that in old days the priest who bore the name and played the partof Attis at the spring festival of Cybele was regularly hanged or otherwise slain upon thesacred tree, and that this barbarous custom was afterwards mitigated into the form inwhich it is known to us in later times, when the priest merely drew blood from his bodyunder the tree and attached an effigy instead of himself to its trunk. In the holy grove atUpsala men and animals were sacrificed by being hanged upon the sacred trees. Thehuman victims dedicated to Odin were regularly put to death by hanging or by acombination of hanging and stabbing, the man being strung up to a tree or a gallows andthen wounded with a spear. Hence Odin was called the Lord of the Gallows or the God ofthe Hanged, and he is represented sitting under a gallows tree. Indeed he is said to havebeen sacrificed to himself in the ordinary way, as we learn from the weird verses of theHavamal, in which the god describes how he acquired his divine power by learning themagic runes:“I know that I hung on the windy treeFor nine whole nights,"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Wounded with the spear, dedicated to Odin,Myself to myself.”The Bagobos of Mindanao, one of the Philippine Islands, used annually to sacrifice humanvictims for the good of the crops in a similar way. Early in December, when theconstellation Orion appeared at seven o’clock in the evening, the people knew that the timehad come to clear their fields for sowing and to sacrifice a slave. The sacrifice waspresented to certain powerful spirits as payment for the good year which the people hadenjoyed, and to ensure the favour of the spirits for the coming season. The victim was led toa great tree in the forest; there he was tied with his back to the tree and his arms stretchedhigh above his head, in the attitude in which ancient artists portrayed Marsyas hanging onthe fatal tree. While he thus hung by the arms, he was slain by a spear thrust through hisbody at the level of the armpits. Afterwards the body was cut clean through the middle atthe waist, and the upper part was apparently allowed to dangle for a little from the tree,while the under part wallowed in blood on the ground. The two portions were finally castinto a shallow trench beside the tree. Before this was done, anybody who wished might cutoff a piece of flesh or a lock of hair from the corpse and carry it to the grave of somerelation whose body was being consumed by a ghoul. Attracted by the fresh corpse, theghoul would leave the mouldering old body in peace. These sacrifices have been offered bymen now living.In Greece the great goddess Artemis herself appears to have been annually hanged in effigyin her sacred grove of Condylea among the Arcadian hills, and there accordingly she wentby the name of the Hanged One. Indeed a trace of a similar rite may perhaps be detectedeven at Ephesus, the most famous of her sanctuaries, in the legend of a woman who hangedherself and was thereupon dressed by the compassionate goddess in her own divine garband called by the name of Hecate. Similarly, at Melite in Phthia, a story was told of a girlnamed Aspalis who hanged herself, but who appears to have been merely a form ofArtemis. For after her death her body could not be found, but an image of her wasdiscovered standing beside the image of Artemis, and the people bestowed on it the title ofHecaerge or Far-shooter, one of the regular epithets of the goddess. Every year the virginssacrificed a young goat to the image by hanging it, because Aspalis was said to have hangedherself. The sacrifice may have been a substitute for hanging an image or a humanrepresentative of Artemis. Again, in Rhodes the fair Helen was worshipped under the titleof Helen of the Tree, because the queen of the island had caused her handmaids, disguisedas Furies, to string her up to a bough. That the Asiatic Greeks sacrificed animals in thisfashion is proved by coins of Ilium, which represent an ox or cow hanging on a tree andstabbed with a knife by a man, who sits among the branches or on the animal’s back. AtHierapolis also the victims were hung on trees before they were burnt. With these Greekand Scandinavian parallels before us we can hardly dismiss as wholly improbable theconjecture that in Phrygia a man-god may have hung year by year on the sacred but fataltree."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"XXXVII. Oriental Religions in the WestTHE WORSHIP of the Great Mother of the Gods and her lover or son was very popularunder the Roman Empire. Inscriptions prove that the two received divine honours,separately or conjointly, not only in Italy, and especially at Rome, but also in the provinces,particularly in Africa, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, and Bulgaria. Their worshipsurvived the establishment of Christianity by Constantine; for Symmachus records therecurrence of the festival of the Great Mother, and in the days of Augustine her effeminatepriests still paraded the streets and squares of Carthage with whitened faces, scented hair,and mincing gait, while, like the mendicant friars of the Middle Ages, they begged almsfrom the passers-by. In Greece, on the other hand, the bloody orgies of the Asiatic goddessand her consort appear to have found little favour. The barbarous and cruel character ofthe worship, with its frantic excesses, was doubtless repugnant to the good taste andhumanity of the Greeks, who seem to have preferred the kindred but gentler rites ofAdonis. Yet the same features which shocked and repelled the Greeks may have positivelyattracted the less refined Romans and barbarians of the West. The ecstatic frenzies, whichwere mistaken for divine inspiration, the mangling of the body, the theory of a new birthand the remission of sins through the shedding of blood, have all their origin in savagery,and they naturally appealed to peoples in whom the savage instincts were still strong. Theirtrue character was indeed often disguised under a decent veil of allegorical or philosophicalinterpretation, which probably sufficed to impose upon the rapt and enthusiasticworshippers, reconciling even the more cultivated of them to things which otherwise musthave filled them with horror and disgust.The religion of the Great Mother, with its curious blending of crude savagery with spiritualaspirations, was only one of a multitude of similar Oriental faiths which in the later days ofpaganism spread over the Roman Empire, and by saturating the European peoples withalien ideals of life gradually undermined the whole fabric of ancient civilisation. Greek andRoman society was built on the conception of the subordination of the individual to thecommunity, of the citizen to the state; it set the safety of the commonwealth, as the supremeaim of conduct, above the safety of the individual whether in this world or in the world tocome. Trained from infancy in this unselfish ideal, the citizens devoted their lives to thepublic service and were ready to lay them down for the common good; or if they shrankfrom the supreme sacrifice, it never occurred to them that they acted otherwise than baselyin preferring their personal existence to the interests of their country. All this was changedby the spread of Oriental religions which inculcated the communion of the soul with Godand its eternal salvation as the only objects worth living for, objects in comparison withwhich the prosperity and even the existence of the state sank into insignificance. Theinevitable result of this selfish and immoral doctrine was to withdraw the devotee more andmore from the public service, to concentrate his thoughts on his own spiritual emotions,and to breed in him a contempt for the present life which he regarded merely as aprobation for a better and an eternal. The saint and the recluse, disdainful of earth andrapt in ecstatic contemplation of heaven, became in popular opinion the highest ideal ofhumanity, displacing the old ideal of the patriot and hero who, forgetful of self, lives and isready to die for the good of his country. The earthly city seemed poor and contemptible tomen whose eyes beheld the City of God coming in the clouds of heaven. Thus the centre ofgravity, so to say, was shifted from the present to a future life, and however much the other"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"world may have gained, there can be little doubt that this one lost heavily by the change. Ageneral disintegration of the body politic set in. The ties of the state and the family wereloosened: the structure of society tended to resolve itself into its individual elements andthereby to relapse into barbarism; for civilisation is only possible through the active co-operation of the citizens and their willingness to subordinate their private interests to thecommon good. Men refused to defend their country and even to continue their kind. Intheir anxiety to save their own souls and the souls of others, they were content to leave thematerial world, which they identified with the principle of evil, to perish around them. Thisobsession lasted for a thousand years. The revival of Roman law, of the Aristotelianphilosophy, of ancient art and literature at the close of the Middle Ages, marked the returnof Europe to native ideals of life and conduct, to saner, manlier views of the world. Thelong halt in the march of civilisation was over. The tide of Oriental invasion had turned atlast. It is ebbing still.Among the gods of eastern origin who in the decline of the ancient world competed againsteach other for the allegiance of the West was the old Persian deity Mithra. The immensepopularity of his worship is attested by the monuments illustrative of it which have beenfound scattered in profusion all over the Roman Empire. In respect both of doctrines andof rites the cult of Mithra appears to have presented many points of resemblance not onlyto the religion of the Mother of the Gods but also to Christianity. The similarity struck theChristian doctors themselves and was explained by them as a work of the devil, who soughtto seduce the souls of men from the true faith by a false and insidious imitation of it. So tothe Spanish conquerors of Mexico and Peru many of the native heathen rites appeared tobe diabolical counterfeits of the Christian sacraments. With more probability the modernstudent of comparative religion traces such resemblances to the similar and independentworkings of the mind of man in his sincere, if crude, attempts to fathom the secret of theuniverse, and to adjust his little life to its awful mysteries. However that may be, there canbe no doubt that the Mithraic religion proved a formidable rival to Christianity, combiningas it did a solemn ritual with aspirations after moral purity and a hope of immortality.Indeed the issue of the conflict between the two faiths appears for a time to have hung inthe balance. An instructive relic of the long struggle is preserved in our festival ofChristmas, which the Church seems to have borrowed directly from its heathen rival. Inthe Julian calendar the twenty-fifth of December was reckoned the winter solstice, and itwas regarded as the Nativity of the Sun, because the day begins to lengthen and the powerof the sun to increase from that turning-point of the year. The ritual of the nativity, as itappears to have been celebrated in Syria and Egypt, was remarkable. The celebrantsretired into certain inner shrines, from which at midnight they issued with a loud cry, “TheVirgin has brought forth! The light is waxing!” The Egyptians even represented the new-born sun by the image of an infant which on his birthday, the winter solstice, they broughtforth and exhibited to his worshippers. No doubt the Virgin who thus conceived and bore ason on the twenty-fifth of December was the great Oriental goddess whom the Semitescalled the Heavenly Virgin or simply the Heavenly Goddess; in Semitic lands she was aform of Astarte. Now Mithra was regularly identified by his worshippers with the Sun, theUnconquered Sun, as they called him; hence his nativity also fell on the twenty-fifth ofDecember. The Gospels say nothing as to the day of Christ’s birth, and accordingly theearly Church did not celebrate it. In time, however, the Christians of Egypt came to regardthe sixth of January as the date of the Nativity, and the custom of commemorating the"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"birth of the Saviour on that day gradually spread until by the fourth century it wasuniversally established in the East. But at the end of the third or the beginning of thefourth century the Western Church, which had never recognised the sixth of January asthe day of the Nativity, adopted the twenty-fifth of December as the true date, and in timeits decision was accepted also by the Eastern Church. At Antioch the change was notintroduced till about the year 375 A.D.What considerations led the ecclesiastical authorities to institute the festival of Christmas?The motives for the innovation are stated with great frankness by a Syrian writer, himself aChristian. “The reason,” he tells us, “why the fathers transferred the celebration of thesixth of January to the twenty-fifth of December was this. It was a custom of the heathen tocelebrate on the same twenty-fifth of December the birthday of the Sun, at which theykindled lights in token of festivity. In these solemnities and festivities the Christians alsotook part. Accordingly when the doctors of the Church perceived that the Christians had aleaning to this festival, they took counsel and resolved that the true Nativity should besolemnised on that day and the festival of the Epiphany on the sixth of January.Accordingly, along with this custom, the practice has prevailed of kindling fires till thesixth.” The heathen origin of Christmas is plainly hinted at, if not tacitly admitted, byAugustine when he exhorts his Christian brethren not to celebrate that solemn day like theheathen on account of the sun, but on account of him who made the sun. In like mannerLeo the Great rebuked the pestilent belief that Christmas was solemnised because of thebirth of the new sun, as it was called, and not because of the nativity of Christ.Thus it appears that the Christian Church chose to celebrate the birthday of its Founder onthe twenty-fifth of December in order to transfer the devotion of the heathen from the Sunto him who was called the Sun of Righteousness. If that was so, there can be no intrinsicimprobability in the conjecture that motives of the same sort may have led the ecclesiasticalauthorities to assimilate the Easter festival of the death and resurrection of their Lord tothe festival of the death and resurrection of another Asiatic god which fell at the sameseason. Now the Easter rites still observed in Greece, Sicily, and Southern Italy bear insome respects a striking resemblance to the rites of Adonis, and I have suggested that theChurch may have consciously adapted the new festival to its heathen predecessor for thesake of winning souls to Christ. But this adaptation probably took place in the Greek-speaking rather than in the Latin-speaking parts of the ancient world; for the worship ofAdonis, while it flourished among the Greeks, appears to have made little impression onRome and the West. Certainly it never formed part of the official Roman religion. Theplace which it might have taken in the affections of the vulgar was already occupied by thesimilar but more barbarous worship of Attis and the Great Mother. Now the death andresurrection of Attis were officially celebrated at Rome on the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth of March, the latter being regarded as the spring equinox, and therefore as the mostappropriate day for the revival of a god of vegetation who had been dead or sleepingthroughout the winter. But according to an ancient and widespread tradition Christsuffered on the twenty-fifth of March, and accordingly some Christians regularlycelebrated the Crucifixion on that day without any regard to the state of the moon. Thiscustom was certainly observed in Phrygia, Cappadocia, and Gaul, and there seem to begrounds for thinking that at one time it was followed also in Rome. Thus the traditionwhich placed the death of Christ on the twenty-fifth of March was ancient and deeply"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"rooted. It is all the more remarkable because astronomical considerations prove that it canhave had no historical foundation. The inference appears to be inevitable that the passionof Christ must have been arbitrarily referred to that date in order to harmonise with anolder festival of the spring equinox. This is the view of the learned ecclesiastical historianMgr. Duchesne, who points out that the death of the Saviour was thus made to fall upon thevery day on which, according to a widespread belief, the world had been created. But theresurrection of Attis, who combined in himself the characters of the divine Father and thedivine Son, was officially celebrated at Rome on the same day. When we remember that thefestival of St. George in April has replaced the ancient pagan festival of the Parilia; that thefestival of St. John the Baptist in June has succeeded to a heathen midsummer festival ofwater: that the festival of the Assumption of the Virgin in August has ousted the festival ofDiana; that the feast of All Souls in November is a continuation of an old heathen feast ofthe dead; and that the Nativity of Christ himself was assigned to the winter solstice inDecember because that day was deemed the Nativity of the Sun; we can hardly be thoughtrash or unreasonable in conjecturing that the other cardinal festival of the Christianchurch—the solemnisation of Easter—may have been in like manner, and from likemotives of edification, adapted to a similar celebration of the Phrygian god Attis at thevernal equinox.At least it is a remarkable coincidence, if it is nothing more, that the Christian and theheathen festivals of the divine death and resurrection should have been solemnised at thesame season and in the same places. For the places which celebrated the death of Christ atthe spring equinox were Phrygia, Gaul, and apparently Rome, that is, the very regions inwhich the worship of Attis either originated or struck deepest root. It is difficult to regardthe coincidence as purely accidental. If the vernal equinox, the season at which in thetemperate regions the whole face of nature testifies to a fresh outburst of vital energy, hadbeen viewed from of old as the time when the world was annually created afresh in theresurrection of a god, nothing could be more natural than to place the resurrection of thenew deity at the same cardinal point of the year. Only it is to be observed that if the deathof Christ was dated on the twenty-fifth of March, his resurrection, according to Christiantradition, must have happened on the twenty-seventh of March, which is just two days laterthan the vernal equinox of the Julian calendar and the resurrection of Attis. A similardisplacement of two days in the adjustment of Christian to heathen celebrations occurs inthe festivals of St. George and the Assumption of the Virgin. However, another Christiantradition, followed by Lactantius and perhaps by the practice of the Church in Gaul,placed the death of Christ on the twenty-third and his resurrection on the twenty-fifth ofMarch. If that was so, his resurrection coincided exactly with the resurrection of Attis.In point of fact it appears from the testimony of an anonymous Christian, who wrote in thefourth century of our era, that Christians and pagans alike were struck by the remarkablecoincidence between the death and resurrection of their respective deities, and that thecoincidence formed a theme of bitter controversy between the adherents of the rivalreligions, the pagans contending that the resurrection of Christ was a spurious imitation ofthe resurrection of Attis, and the Christians asserting with equal warmth that theresurrection of Attis was a diabolical counterfeit of the resurrection of Christ. In theseunseemly bickerings the heathen took what to a superficial observer might seem strongground by arguing that their god was the older and therefore presumably the original, not"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"the counterfeit, since as a general rule an original is older than its copy. This feebleargument the Christians easily rebutted. They admitted, indeed, that in point of timeChrist was the junior deity, but they triumphantly demonstrated his real seniority byfalling back on the subtlety of Satan, who on so important an occasion had surpassedhimself by inverting the usual order of nature.Taken altogether, the coincidences of the Christian with the heathen festivals are too closeand too numerous to be accidental. They mark the compromise which the Church in thehour of its triumph was compelled to make with its vanquished yet still dangerous rivals.The inflexible Protestantism of the primitive missionaries, with their fiery denunciations ofheathendom, had been exchanged for the supple policy, the easy tolerance, thecomprehensive charity of shrewd ecclesiastics, who clearly perceived that if Christianitywas to conquer the world it could do so only by relaxing the too rigid principles of itsFounder, by widening a little the narrow gate which leads to salvation. In this respect aninstructive parallel might be drawn between the history of Christianity and the history ofBuddhism. Both systems were in their origin essentially ethical reforms born of thegenerous ardour, the lofty aspirations, the tender compassion of their noble Founders, twoof those beautiful spirits who appear at rare intervals on earth like beings come from abetter world to support and guide our weak and erring nature. Both preached moral virtueas the means of accomplishing what they regarded as the supreme object of life, the eternalsalvation of the individual soul, though by a curious antithesis the one sought that salvationin a blissful eternity, the other in a final release from suffering, in annihilation. But theaustere ideals of sanctity which they inculcated were too deeply opposed not only to thefrailties but to the natural instincts of humanity ever to be carried out in practice by morethan a small number of disciples, who consistently renounced the ties of the family and thestate in order to work out their own salvation in the still seclusion of the cloister. If suchfaiths were to be nominally accepted by whole nations or even by the world, it was essentialthat they should first be modified or transformed so as to accord in some measure with theprejudices, the passions, the superstitions of the vulgar. This process of accommodationwas carried out in after ages by followers who, made of less ethereal stuff than theirmasters, were for that reason the better fitted to mediate between them and the commonherd. Thus as time went on, the two religions, in exact proportion to their growingpopularity, absorbed more and more of those baser elements which they had beeninstituted for the very purpose of suppressing. Such spiritual decadences are inevitable.The world cannot live at the level of its great men. Yet it would be unfair to the generalityof our kind to ascribe wholly to their intellectual and moral weakness the gradualdivergence of Buddhism and Christianity from their primitive patterns. For it should neverbe forgotten that by their glorification of poverty and celibacy both these religions struckstraight at the root not merely of civil society but of human existence. The blow wasparried by the wisdom or the folly of the vast majority of mankind, who refused topurchase a chance of saving their souls with the certainty of extinguishing the species.XXXVIII. The Myth of OsirisIN ANCIENT EGYPT the god whose death and resurrection were annually celebrated"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"with alternate sorrow and joy was Osiris, the most popular of all Egyptian deities; andthere are good grounds for classing him in one of his aspects with Adonis and Attis as apersonification of the great yearly vicissitudes of nature, especially of the corn. But theimmense vogue which he enjoyed for many ages induced his devoted worshippers to heapupon him the attributes and powers of many other gods; so that it is not always easy tostrip him, so to say, of his borrowed plumes and to restore them to their proper owners.The story of Osiris is told in a connected form only by Plutarch, whose narrative has beenconfirmed and to some extent amplified in modern times by the evidence of themonuments.Osiris was the offspring of an intrigue between the earth-god Seb (Keb or Geb, as the nameis sometimes transliterated) and the sky-goddess Nut. The Greeks identified his parentswith their own deities Cronus and Rhea. When the sun-god Ra perceived that his wife Nuthad been unfaithful to him, he declared with a curse that she should be delivered of thechild in no month and no year. But the goddess had another lover, the god Thoth orHermes, as the Greeks called him, and he playing at draughts with the moon won from hera seventy-second part of every day, and having compounded five whole days out of theseparts he added them to the Egyptian year of three hundred and sixty days. This was themythical origin of the five supplementary days which the Egyptians annually inserted atthe end of every year in order to establish a harmony between lunar and solar time. Onthese five days, regarded as outside the year of twelve months, the curse of the sun-god didnot rest, and accordingly Osiris was born on the first of them. At his nativity a voice rangout proclaiming that the Lord of All had come into the world. Some say that a certainPamyles heard a voice from the temple at Thebes bidding him announce with a shout that agreat king, the beneficent Osiris, was born. But Osiris was not the only child of his mother.On the second of the supplementary days she gave birth to the elder Horus, on the third tothe god Set, whom the Greeks called Typhon, on the fourth to the goddess Isis, and on thefifth to the goddess Nephthys. Afterwards Set married his sister Nephthys, and Osirismarried his sister Isis.Reigning as a king on earth, Osiris reclaimed the Egyptians from savagery, gave them laws,and taught them to worship the gods. Before his time the Egyptians had been cannibals.But Isis, the sister and wife of Osiris, discovered wheat and barley growing wild, and Osirisintroduced the cultivation of these grains amongst his people, who forthwith abandonedcannibalism and took kindly to a corn diet. Moreover, Osiris is said to have been the first togather fruit from trees, to train the vine to poles, and to tread the grapes. Eager tocommunicate these beneficent discoveries to all mankind, he committed the wholegovernment of Egypt to his wife Isis, and travelled over the world, diffusing the blessings ofcivilisation and agriculture wherever he went. In countries where a harsh climate orniggardly soil forbade the cultivation of the vine, he taught the inhabitants to consolethemselves for the want of wine by brewing beer from barley. Loaded with the wealth thathad been showered upon him by grateful nations, he returned to Egypt, and on account ofthe benefits he had conferred on mankind he was unanimously hailed and worshipped as adeity. But his brother Set (whom the Greeks called Typhon) with seventy-two othersplotted against him. Having taken the measure of his good brother’s body by stealth, thebad brother Typhon fashioned and highly decorated a coffer of the same size, and once"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"when they were all drinking and making merry he brought in the coffer and jestinglypromised to give it to the one whom it should fit exactly. Well, they all tried one after theother, but it fitted none of them. Last of all Osiris stepped into it and lay down. On that theconspirators ran and slammed the lid down on him, nailed it fast, soldered it with moltenlead, and flung the coffer into the Nile. This happened on the seventeenth day of the monthAthyr, when the sun is in the sign of the Scorpion, and in the eight-and-twentieth year ofthe reign or the life of Osiris. When Isis heard of it she sheared off a lock of her hair, put ona mourning attire, and wandered disconsolately up and down, seeking the body.By the advice of the god of wisdom she took refuge in the papyrus swamps of the Delta.Seven scorpions accompanied her in her flight. One evening when she was weary she cameto the house of a woman, who, alarmed at the sight of the scorpions, shut the door in herface. Then one of the scorpions crept under the door and stung the child of the woman thathe died. But when Isis heard the mother’s lamentation, her heart was touched, and she laidher hands on the child and uttered her powerful spells; so the poison was driven out of thechild and he lived. Afterwards Isis herself gave birth to a son in the swamps. She hadconceived him while she fluttered in the form of a hawk over the corpse of her deadhusband. The infant was the younger Horus, who in his youth bore the name ofHarpocrates, that is, the child Horus. Him Buto, the goddess of the north, hid from thewrath of his wicked uncle Set. Yet she could not guard him from all mishap; for one daywhen Isis came to her little son’s hiding-place she found him stretched lifeless and rigid onthe ground: a scorpion had stung him. Then Isis prayed to the sun-god Ra for help. Thegod hearkened to her and staid his bark in the sky, and sent down Thoth to teach her thespell by which she might restore her son to life. She uttered the words of power, andstraightway the poison flowed from the body of Horus, air passed into him, and he lived.Then Thoth ascended up into the sky and took his place once more in the bark of the sun,and the bright pomp passed onward jubilant.Meantime the coffer containing the body of Osiris had floated down the river and away outto sea, till at last it drifted ashore at Byblus, on the coast of Syria. Here a fine erica-treeshot up suddenly and enclosed the chest in its trunk. The king of the country, admiring thegrowth of the tree, had it cut down and made into a pillar of his house; but he did not knowthat the coffer with the dead Osiris was in it. Word of this came to Isis and she journeyed toByblus, and sat down by the well, in humble guise, her face wet with tears. To none wouldshe speak till the king’s handmaidens came, and them she greeted kindly, and braided theirhair, and breathed on them from her own divine body a wondrous perfume. But when thequeen beheld the braids of her handmaidens’ hair and smelt the sweet smell that emanatedfrom them, she sent for the stranger woman and took her into her house and made her thenurse of her child. But Isis gave the babe her finger instead of her breast to suck, and atnight she began to burn all that was mortal of him away, while she herself in the likeness ofa swallow fluttered round the pillar that contained her dead brother, twitteringmournfully. But the queen spied what she was doing and shrieked out when she saw herchild in flames, and thereby she hindered him from becoming immortal. Then the goddessrevealed herself and begged for the pillar of the roof, and they gave it her, and she cut thecoffer out of it, and fell upon it and embraced it and lamented so loud that the younger ofthe king’s children died of fright on the spot. But the trunk of the tree she wrapped in finelinen, and poured ointment on it, and gave it to the king and queen, and the wood stands in"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"a temple of Isis and is worshipped by the people of Byblus to this day. And Isis put thecoffer in a boat and took the eldest of the king’s children with her and sailed away. As soonas they were alone, she opened the chest, and laying her face on the face of her brother shekissed him and wept. But the child came behind her softly and saw what she was about,and she turned and looked at him in anger, and the child could not bear her look and died;but some say that it was not so, but that he fell into the sea and was drowned. It is he whomthe Egyptians sing of at their banquets under the name of Maneros.But Isis put the coffer by and went to see her son Horus at the city of Buto, and Typhonfound the coffer as he was hunting a boar one night by the light of a full moon. And heknew the body, and rent it into fourteen pieces, and scattered them abroad. But Isis sailedup and down the marshes in a shallop made of papyrus, looking for the pieces; and that iswhy when people sail in shallops made of papyrus, the crocodiles do not hurt them, for theyfear or respect the goddess. And that is the reason, too, why there are many graves ofOsiris in Egypt, for she buried each limb as she found it. But others will have it that sheburied an image of him in every city, pretending it was his body, in order that Osiris mightbe worshipped in many places, and that if Typhon searched for the real grave he might notbe able to find it. However, the genital member of Osiris had been eaten by the fishes, soIsis made an image of it instead, and the image is used by the Egyptians at their festivals tothis day. “Isis,” writes the historian Diodorus Siculus, “recovered all the parts of the bodyexcept the genitals; and because she wished that her husband’s grave should be unknownand honoured by all who dwell in the land of Egypt, she resorted to the following device.She moulded human images out of wax and spices, corresponding to the stature of Osiris,round each one of the parts of his body. Then she called in the priests according to theirfamilies and took an oath of them all that they would reveal to no man the trust she wasabout to repose in them. So to each of them privately she said that to them alone sheentrusted the burial of the body, and reminding them of the benefits they had received sheexhorted them to bury the body in their own land and to honour Osiris as a god. She alsobesought them to dedicate one of the animals of their country, whichever they chose, and tohonour it in life as they had formerly honoured Osiris, and when it died to grant itobsequies like his. And because she would encourage the priests in their own interest tobestow the aforesaid honours, she gave them a third part of the land to be used by them inthe service and worship of the gods. Accordingly it is said that the priests, mindful of thebenefits of Osiris, desirous of gratifying the queen, and moved by the prospect of gain,carried out all the injunctions of Isis. Wherefore to this day each of the priests imaginesthat Osiris is buried in his country, and they honour the beasts that were consecrated in thebeginning, and when the animals die the priests renew at their burial the mourning forOsiris. But the sacred bulls, the one called Apis and the other Mnevis, were dedicated toOsiris, and it was ordained that they should be worshipped as gods in common by all theEgyptians, since these animals above all others had helped the discoverers of corn insowing the seed and procuring the universal benefits of agriculture.”Such is the myth or legend of Osiris, as told by Greek writers and eked out by more or lessfragmentary notices or allusions in native Egyptian literature. A long inscription in thetemple at Denderah has preserved a list of the god’s graves, and other texts mention theparts of his body which were treasured as holy relics in each of the sanctuaries. Thus hisheart was at Athribis, his backbone at Busiris, his neck at Letopolis, and his head at"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Memphis. As often happens in such cases, some of his divine limbs were miraculouslymultiplied. His head, for example, was at Abydos as well as at Memphis, and his legs, whichwere remarkably numerous, would have sufficed for several ordinary mortals. In thisrespect, however, Osiris was nothing to St. Denys, of whom no less than seven heads, allequally genuine, are extant.According to native Egyptian accounts, which supplement that of Plutarch, when Isis hadfound the corpse of her husband Osiris, she and her sister Nephthys sat down beside it anduttered a lament which in after ages became the type of all Egyptian lamentations for thedead. “Come to thy house,” they wailed. “Come to thy house. O god On! come to thy house,thou who hast no foes. O fair youth, come to thy house, that thou mayest see me. I am thysister, whom thou lovest; thou shalt not part from me. O fair boy, come to thy house... . Isee thee not, yet doth my heart yearn after thee and mine eyes desire thee. Come to her wholoves thee, who loves thee, Unnefer, thou blessed one! Come to thy sister, come to thy wife,to thy wife, thou whose heart stands still. Come to thy housewife. I am thy sister by thesame mother, thou shalt not be far from me. Gods and men have turned their faces towardsthee and weep for thee together... . I call after thee and weep, so that my cry is heard toheaven, but thou hearest not my voice; yet am I thy sister, whom thou didst love on earth;thou didst love none but me, my brother! my brother!” This lament for the fair youth cutoff in his prime reminds us of the laments for Adonis. The title of Unnefer or “the GoodBeing” bestowed on him marks the beneficence which tradition universally ascribed toOsiris; it was at once his commonest title and one of his names as king.The lamentations of the two sad sisters were not in vain. In pity for her sorrow the sun-godRa sent down from heaven the jackal-headed god Anubis, who, with the aid of Isis andNephthys, of Thoth and Horus, pieced together the broken body of the murdered god,swathed it in linen bandages, and observed all the other rites which the Egyptians werewont to perform over the bodies of the departed. Then Isis fanned the cold clay with herwings: Osiris revived, and thenceforth reigned as king over the dead in the other world.There he bore the titles of Lord of the Underworld, Lord of Eternity, Ruler of the Dead.There, too, in the great Hall of the Two Truths, assisted by forty-two assessors, one fromeach of the principal districts of Egypt, he presided as judge at the trial of the souls of thedeparted, who made their solemn confession before him, and, their heart having beenweighed in the balance of justice, received the reward of virtue in a life eternal or theappropriate punishment of their sins.In the resurrection of Osiris the Egyptians saw the pledge of a life everlasting forthemselves beyond the grave. They believed that every man would live eternally in theother world if only his surviving friends did for his body what the gods had done for thebody of Osiris. Hence the ceremonies observed by the Egyptians over the human dead werean exact copy of those which Anubis, Horus, and the rest had performed over the dead god.“At every burial there was enacted a representation of the divine mystery which had beenperformed of old over Osiris, when his son, his sisters, his friends were gathered round hismangled remains and succeeded by their spells and manipulations in converting his brokenbody into the first mummy, which they afterwards reanimated and furnished with themeans of entering on a new individual life beyond the grave. The mummy of the deceasedwas Osiris; the professional female mourners were his two sisters Isis and Nephthys;"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Anubis, Horus, all the gods of the Osirian legend gathered about the corpse.” In this wayevery dead Egyptian was identified with Osiris and bore his name. From the MiddleKingdom onwards it was the regular practice to address the deceased as “Osiris So-and-So,” as if he were the god himself, and to add the standing epithet “true of speech,” becausetrue speech was characteristic of Osiris. The thousands of inscribed and pictured tombsthat have been opened in the valley of the Nile prove that the mystery of the resurrectionwas performed for the benefit of every dead Egyptian; as Osiris died and rose again fromthe dead, so all men hoped to arise like him from death to life eternal.Thus according to what seems to have been the general native tradition Osiris was a goodand beloved king of Egypt, who suffered a violent death but rose from the dead and washenceforth worshipped as a deity. In harmony with this tradition he was regularlyrepresented by sculptors and painters in human and regal form as a dead king, swathed inthe wrappings of a mummy, but wearing on his head a kingly crown and grasping in one ofhis hands, which were left free from the bandages, a kingly sceptre. Two cities above allothers were associated with his myth or memory. One of them was Busiris in Lower Egypt,which claimed to possess his backbone; the other was Abydos in Upper Egypt, whichgloried in the possession of his head. Encircled by the nimbus of the dead yet living god,Abydos, originally an obscure place, became from the end of the Old Kingdom the holiestspot in Egypt; his tomb there would seem to have been to the Egyptians what the Church ofthe Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem is to Christians. It was the wish of every pious man thathis dead body should rest in hallowed earth near the grave of the glorified Osiris. Fewindeed were rich enough to enjoy this inestimable privilege; for, apart from the cost of atomb in the sacred city, the mere transport of mummies from great distances was bothdifficult and expensive. Yet so eager were many to absorb in death the blessed influencewhich radiated from the holy sepulchre that they caused their surviving friends to conveytheir mortal remains to Abydos, there to tarry for a short time, and then to be broughtback by river and interred in the tombs which had been made ready for them in theirnative land. Others had cenotaphs built or memorial tablets erected for themselves near thetomb of their dead and risen Lord, that they might share with him the bliss of a joyfulresurrection.XXXIX. The Ritual of Osiris1. The Popular RitesA USEFUL clue to the original nature of a god or goddess is often furnished by the seasonat which his or her festival is celebrated. Thus, if the festival falls at the new or the fullmoon, there is a certain presumption that the deity thus honoured either is the moon or atleast has lunar affinities. If the festival is held at the winter or summer solstice, wenaturally surmise that the god is the sun, or at all events that he stands in some closerelation to that luminary. Again, if the festival coincides with the time of sowing or harvest,we are inclined to infer that the divinity is an embodiment of the earth or of the corn. Thesepresumptions or inferences, taken by themselves, are by no means conclusive; but if they"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"happen to be confirmed by other indications, the evidence may be regarded as fairlystrong.Unfortunately, in dealing with the Egyptian gods we are in a great measure precluded frommaking use of this clue. The reason is not that the dates of the festivals are alwaysunknown, but that they shifted from year to year, until after a long interval they hadrevolved through the whole course of the seasons. This gradual revolution of the festalEgyptian cycle resulted from the employment of a calendar year which neithercorresponded exactly to the solar year nor was periodically corrected by intercalation.If the Egyptian farmer of the olden time could get no help, except at the rarest intervals,from the official or sacerdotal calendar, he must have been compelled to observe forhimself those natural signals which marked the times for the various operations ofhusbandry. In all ages of which we possess any records the Egyptians have been anagricultural people, dependent for their subsistence on the growth of the corn. The cerealswhich they cultivated were wheat, barley, and apparently sorghum (Holcus sorghum,Linnaeus), the doora of the modern fellaheen. Then as now the whole country, with theexception of a fringe on the coast of the Mediterranean, was almost rainless, and owed itsimmense fertility entirely to the annual inundation of the Nile, which, regulated by anelaborate system of dams and canals, was distributed over the fields, renewing the soil yearby year with a fresh deposit of mud washed down from the great equatorial lakes and themountains of Abyssinia. Hence the rise of the river has always been watched by theinhabitants with the utmost anxiety; for if it either falls short of or exceeds a certain height,dearth and famine are the inevitable consequences. The water begins to rise early in June,but it is not until the latter half of July that it swells to a mighty tide. By the end ofSeptember the inundation is at its greatest height. The country is now submerged, andpresents the appearance of a sea of turbid water, from which the towns and villages, builton higher ground, rise like islands. For about a month the flood remains nearly stationary,then sinks more and more rapidly, till by December or January the river has returned toits ordinary bed. With the approach of summer the level of the water continues to fall. Inthe early days of June the Nile is reduced to half its ordinary breadth; and Egypt, scorchedby the sun, blasted by the wind that has blown from the Sahara for many days, seems amere continuation of the desert. The trees are choked with a thick layer of grey dust. A fewmeagre patches of vegetables, watered with difficulty, struggle painfully for existence in theimmediate neighbourhood of the villages. Some appearance of verdure lingers beside thecanals and in the hollows from which the moisture has not wholly evaporated. The plainappears to pant in the pitiless sunshine, bare, dusty, ash-coloured, cracked and seamed asfar as the eye can see with a network of fissures. From the middle of April till the middle ofJune the land of Egypt is but half alive, waiting for the new Nile.For countless ages this cycle of natural events has determined the annual labours of theEgyptian husbandman. The first work of the agricultural year is the cutting of the damswhich have hitherto prevented the swollen river from flooding the canals and the fields.This is done, and the pent-up waters released on their beneficent mission, in the first half ofAugust. In November, when the inundation has subsided, wheat, barley, and sorghum aresown. The time of harvest varies with the district, falling about a month later in the norththan in the south. In Upper or Southern Egypt barley is reaped at the beginning of March,"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"wheat at the beginning of April, and sorghum about the end of that month.It is natural to suppose that the various events of the agricultural year were celebrated bythe Egyptian farmer with some simple religious rites designed to secure the blessing of thegods upon his labours. These rustic ceremonies he would continue to perform year afteryear at the same season, while the solemn festivals of the priests continued to shift, with theshifting calendar, from summer through spring to winter, and so backward throughautumn to summer. The rites of the husbandman were stable because they rested on directobservation of nature: the rites of the priest were unstable because they were based on afalse calculation. Yet many of the priestly festivals may have been nothing but the old ruralfestivals disguised in the course of ages by the pomp of sacerdotalism and severed, by theerror of the calendar, from their roots in the natural cycle of the seasons.These conjectures are confirmed by the little we know both of the popular and of theofficial Egyptian religion. Thus we are told that the Egyptians held a festival of Isis at thetime when the Nile began to rise. They believed that the goddess was then mourning for thelost Osiris, and that the tears which dropped from her eyes swelled the impetuous tide ofthe river. Now if Osiris was in one of his aspects a god of the corn, nothing could be morenatural than that he should be mourned at midsummer. For by that time the harvest waspast, the fields were bare, the river ran low, life seemed to be suspended, the corn-god wasdead. At such a moment people who saw the handiwork of divine beings in all theoperations of nature might well trace the swelling of the sacred stream to the tears shed bythe goddess at the death of the beneficent corn-god her husband.And the sign of the rising waters on earth was accompanied by a sign in heaven. For in theearly days of Egyptian history, some three or four thousand years before the beginning ofour era, the splendid star of Sirius, the brightest of all the fixed stars, appeared at dawn inthe east just before sunrise about the time of the summer solstice, when the Nile begins torise. The Egyptians called it Sothis, and regarded it as the star of Isis, just as theBabylonians deemed the planet Venus the star of Astarte. To both peoples apparently thebrilliant luminary in the morning sky seemed the goddess of life and love come to mournher departed lover or spouse and to wake him from the dead. Hence the rising of Siriusmarked the beginning of the sacred Egyptian year, and was regularly celebrated by afestival which did not shift with the shifting official year.The cutting of the dams and the admission of the water into the canals and fields is a greatevent in the Egyptian year. At Cairo the operation generally takes place between the sixthand the sixteenth of August, and till lately was attended by ceremonies which deserve to benoticed, because they were probably handed down from antiquity. An ancient canal,known by the name of the Khalíj, formerly passed through the native town of Cairo. Nearits entrance the canal was crossed by a dam of earth, very broad at the bottom anddiminishing in breadth upwards, which used to be constructed before or soon after the Nilebegan to rise. In front of the dam, on the side of the river, was reared a truncated cone ofearth called the ’arooseh or “bride,” on the top of which a little maize or millet wasgenerally sown. This “bride” was commonly washed down by the rising tide a week or afortnight before the cutting of the dam. Tradition runs that the old custom was to deck ayoung virgin in gay apparel and throw her into the river as a sacrifice to obtain a plentifulinundation. Whether that was so or not, the intention of the practice appears to have been"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"to marry the river, conceived as a male power, to his bride the cornland, which was so soonto be fertilised by his water. The ceremony was therefore a charm to ensure the growth ofthe crops. In modern times money used to be thrown into the canal on this occasion, andthe populace dived into the water after it. This practice also would seem to have beenancient, for Seneca tells us that at a place called the Veins of the Nile, not far from Philae,the priests used to cast money and offerings of gold into the river at a festival whichapparently took place at the rising of the water.The next great operation of the agricultural year in Egypt is the sowing of the seed inNovember, when the water of the inundation has retreated from the fields. With theEgyptians, as with many peoples of antiquity, the committing of the seed to the earthassumed the character of a solemn and mournful rite. On this subject I will let Plutarchspeak for himself. “What,” he asks, “are we to make of the gloomy, joyless, and mournfulsacrifices, if it is wrong either to omit the established rites or to confuse and disturb ourconceptions of the gods by absurd suspicions? For the Greeks also perform many riteswhich resemble those of the Egyptians and are observed about the same time. Thus at thefestival of the Thesmophoria in Athens women sit on the ground and fast. And theBoeotians open the vaults of the Sorrowful One, naming that festival sorrowful becauseDemeter is sorrowing for the descent of the Maiden. The month is the month of sowingabout the setting of the Pleiades. The Egyptians call it Athyr, the Athenians Pyanepsion,the Boeotians the month of Demeter... . For it was that time of year when they saw some ofthe fruits vanishing and failing from the trees, while they sowed others grudgingly and withdifficulty, scraping the earth with their hands and huddling it up again, on the uncertainchance that what they deposited in the ground would ever ripen and come to maturity.Thus they did in many respects like those who bury and mourn their dead.”The Egyptian harvest, as we have seen, falls not in autumn but in spring, in the months ofMarch, April, and May. To the husbandman the time of harvest, at least in a good year,must necessarily be a season of joy: in bringing home his sheaves he is requited for his longand anxious labours. Yet if the old Egyptian farmer felt a secret joy at reaping andgarnering the grain, it was essential that he should conceal the natural emotion under anair of profound dejection. For was he not severing the body of the corn-god with his sickleand trampling it to pieces under the hoofs of his cattle on the threshing-floor? Accordinglywe are told that it was an ancient custom of the Egyptian corn-reapers to beat their breastsand lament over the first sheaf cut, while at the same time they called upon Isis. Theinvocation seems to have taken the form of a melancholy chant, to which the Greeks gavethe name of Maneros. Similar plaintive strains were chanted by corn-reapers in Phoeniciaand other parts of Western Asia. Probably all these doleful ditties were lamentations forthe corn-god killed by the sickles of the reapers. In Egypt the slain deity was Osiris, and thename Maneros, applied to the dirge, appears to be derived from certain words meaning“Come to thy house,” which often occur in the lamentations for the dead god.Ceremonies of the same sort have been observed by other peoples, probably for the samepurpose. Thus we are told that among all vegetables corn, by which is apparently meantmaize, holds the first place in the household economy and the ceremonial observance of theCherokee Indians, who invoke it under the name of “the Old Woman” in allusion to a myththat it sprang from the blood of an old woman killed by her disobedient sons. After the last"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"working of the crop a priest and his assistant went into the field and sang songs ofinvocation to the spirit of the corn. After that a loud rustling would be heard, which wasthought to be caused by the Old Woman bringing the corn into the field. A clean trail wasalways kept from the field to the house, “so that the corn might be encouraged to stay athome and not go wandering elsewhere.” “Another curious ceremony, of which even thememory is now almost forgotten, was enacted after the first working of the corn, when theowner or priest stood in succession at each of the four corners of the field and wept andwailed loudly. Even the priests are now unable to give a reason for this performance, whichmay have been a lament for the bloody death of Selu,” the Old Woman of the Corn. Inthese Cherokee practices the lamentations and the invocations of the Old Woman of theCorn resemble the ancient Egyptian customs of lamenting over the first corn cut andcalling upon Isis, herself probably in one of her aspects an Old Woman of the Corn.Further, the Cherokee precaution of leaving a clear path from the field to the houseresembles the Egyptian invitation to Osiris, “Come to thy house.” So in the East Indies tothis day people observe elaborate ceremonies for the purpose of bringing back the Soul ofthe Rice from the fields to the barn. The Nandi of East Africa perform a ceremony inSeptember when the eleusine grain is ripening. Every woman who owns a plantation goesout with her daughters into the cornfields and makes a bonfire of the branches and leavesof certain trees. After that they pluck some of the eleusine, and each of them puts one grainin her necklace, chews another and rubs it on her forehead, throat, and breast. “No joy isshown by the womenfolk on this occasion, and they sorrowfully cut a basketful of the cornwhich they take home with them and place in the loft to dry.”The conception of the corn-spirit as old and dead at harvest is very clearly embodied in acustom observed by the Arabs of Moab. When the harvesters have nearly finished theirtask and only a small corner of the field remains to be reaped, the owner takes a handful ofwheat tied up in a sheaf. A hole is dug in the form of a grave, and two stones are setupright, one at the head and the other at the foot, just as in an ordinary burial. Then thesheaf of wheat is laid at the bottom of the grave, and the sheikh pronounces these words,“The old man is dead.” Earth is afterwards thrown in to cover the sheaf, with a prayer,“May Allah bring us back the wheat of the dead.”2. The Official RitesSUCH, then, were the principal events of the farmer’s calendar in ancient Egypt, and suchthe simple religious rites by which he celebrated them. But we have still to consider theOsirian festivals of the official calendar, so far as these are described by Greek writers orrecorded on the monuments. In examining them it is necessary to bear in mind that onaccount of the movable year of the old Egyptian calendar the true or astronomical dates ofthe official festivals must have varied from year to year, at least until the adoption of thefixed Alexandrian year in 30 B.C. From that time onward, apparently, the dates of thefestivals were determined by the new calendar, and so ceased to rotate throughout thelength of the solar year. At all events Plutarch, writing about the end of the first century,implies that they were then fixed, not movable; for though he does not mention theAlexandrian calendar, he clearly dates the festivals by it. Moreover, the long festal calendarof Esne, an important document of the Imperial age, is obviously based on the fixed"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"Alexandrian year; for it assigns the mark for New Year’s Day to the day whichcorresponds to the twenty-ninth of August, which was the first day of the Alexandrian year,and its references to the rising of the Nile, the position of the sun, and the operations ofagriculture are all in harmony with this supposition. Thus we may take it as fairly certainthat from 30 B.C. onwards the Egyptian festivals were stationary in the solar year.Herodotus tells us that the grave of Osiris was at Sais in Lower Egypt, and that there was alake there upon which the sufferings of the god were displayed as a mystery by night. Thiscommemoration of the divine passion was held once a year: the people mourned and beattheir breasts at it to testify their sorrow for the death of the god; and an image of a cow,made of gilt wood with a golden sun between its horns, was carried out of the chamber inwhich it stood the rest of the year. The cow no doubt represented Isis herself, for cows weresacred to her, and she was regularly depicted with the horns of a cow on her head, or evenas a woman with the head of a cow. It is probable that the carrying out of her cow-shapedimage symbolised the goddess searching for the dead body of Osiris; for this was the nativeEgyptian interpretation of a similar ceremony observed in Plutarch’s time about the wintersolstice, when the gilt cow was carried seven times round the temple. A great feature of thefestival was the nocturnal illumination. People fastened rows of oil-lamps to the outside oftheir houses, and the lamps burned all night long. The custom was not confined to Sais, butwas observed throughout the whole of Egypt.This universal illumination of the houses on one night of the year suggests that the festivalmay have been a commemoration not merely of the dead Osiris but of the dead in general,in other words, that it may have been a night of All Souls. For it is a widespread belief thatthe souls of the dead revisit their old homes on one night of the year; and on that solemnoccasion people prepare for the reception of the ghosts by laying out food for them to eat,and lighting lamps to guide them on their dark road from and to the grave. Herodotus,who briefly describes the festival, omits to mention its date, but we can determine it withsome probability from other sources. Thus Plutarch tells us that Osiris was murdered onthe seventeenth of the month Athyr, and that the Egyptians accordingly observed mournfulrites for four days from the seventeenth of Athyr. Now in the Alexandrian calendar, whichPlutarch used, these four days corresponded to the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, andsixteenth of November, and this date answers exactly to the other indications given byPlutarch, who says that at the time of the festival the Nile was sinking, the north windsdying away, the nights lengthening, and the leaves falling from the trees. During these fourdays a gilt cow swathed in a black pall was exhibited as an image of Isis. This, no doubt,was the image mentioned by Herodotus in his account of the festival. On the nineteenth dayof the month the people went down to the sea, the priests carrying a shrine which containeda golden casket. Into this casket they poured fresh water, and thereupon the spectatorsraised a shout that Osiris was found. After that they took some vegetable mould, moistenedit with water, mixed it with precious spices and incense, and moulded the paste into a smallmoon-shaped image, which was then robed and ornamented. Thus it appears that thepurpose of the ceremonies described by Plutarch was to represent dramatically, first, thesearch for the dead body of Osiris, and, second, its joyful discovery, followed by theresurrection of the dead god who came to life again in the new image of vegetable mouldand spices. Lactantius tells us how on these occasions the priests, with their shaven bodies,beat their breasts and lamented, imitating the sorrowful search of Isis for her lost son"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Osiris, and how afterwards their sorrow was turned to joy when the jackal-headed godAnubis, or rather a mummer in his stead, produced a small boy, the living representative ofthe god who was lost and was found. Thus Lactantius regarded Osiris as the son instead ofthe husband of Isis, and he makes no mention of the image of vegetable mould. It isprobable that the boy who figured in the sacred drama played the part, not of Osiris, but ofhis son Horus; but as the death and resurrection of the god were celebrated in many citiesof Egypt, it is also possible that in some places the part of the god come to life was playedby a living actor instead of by an image. Another Christian writer describes how theEgyptians, with shorn heads, annually lamented over a buried idol of Osiris, smiting theirbreasts, slashing their shoulders, ripping open their old wounds, until, after several days ofmourning, they professed to find the mangled remains of the god, at which they rejoiced.However the details of the ceremony may have varied in different places, the pretence offinding the god’s body, and probably of restoring it to life, was a great event in the festalyear of the Egyptians. The shouts of joy which greeted it are described or alluded to bymany ancient writers.The funeral rites of Osiris, as they were observed at his great festival in the sixteenprovinces of Egypt, are described in a long inscription of the Ptolemaic period, which isengraved on the walls of the god’s temple at Denderah, the Tentyra of the Greeks, a townof Upper Egypt situated on the western bank of the Nile about forty miles north of Thebes.Unfortunately, while the information thus furnished is remarkably full and minute onmany points, the arrangement adopted in the inscription is so confused and the expressionoften so obscure that a clear and consistent account of the ceremonies as a whole canhardly be extracted from it. Moreover, we learn from the document that the ceremoniesvaried somewhat in the several cities, the ritual of Abydos, for example, differing from thatof Busiris. Without attempting to trace all the particularities of local usage I shall brieflyindicate what seem to have been the leading features of the festival, so far as these can beascertained with tolerable certainty.The rites lasted eighteen days, from the twelfth to the thirtieth of the month Khoiak, andset forth the nature of Osiris in his triple aspect as dead, dismembered, and finallyreconstituted by the union of his scattered limbs. In the first of these aspects he was calledChent-Ament (Khenti-Amenti), in the second Osiris-Sep, and in the third Sokari (Seker).Small images of the god were moulded of sand or vegetable earth and corn, to whichincense was sometimes added; his face was painted yellow and his cheek-bones green.These images were cast in a mould of pure gold, which represented the god in the form of amummy, with the white crown of Egypt on his head. The festival opened on the twelfth dayof Khoiak with a ceremony of ploughing and sowing. Two black cows were yoked to theplough, which was made of tamarisk wood, while the share was of black copper. A boyscattered the seed. One end of the field was sown with barley, the other with spelt, and themiddle with flax. During the operation the chief celebrant recited the ritual chapter of “thesowing of the fields.” At Busiris on the twentieth of Khoiak sand and barley were put in thegod’s “garden,” which appears to have been a sort of large flower-pot. This was done in thepresence of the cow-goddess Shenty, represented seemingly by the image of a cow made ofgilt sycamore wood with a headless human image in its inside. “Then fresh inundationwater was poured out of a golden vase over both the goddess and the ‘garden,’ and thebarley was allowed to grow as the emblem of the resurrection of the god after his burial in"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"the earth, ‘for the growth of the garden is the growth of the divine substance.’” On thetwenty-second of Khoiak, at the eighth hour, the images of Osiris, attended by thirty-fourimages of deities, performed a mysterious voyage in thirty-four tiny boats made of papyrus,which were illuminated by three hundred and sixty-five lights. On the twenty-fourth ofKhoiak, after sunset, the effigy of Osiris in a coffin of mulberry wood was laid in the grave,and at the ninth hour of the night the effigy which had been made and deposited the yearbefore was removed and placed upon boughs of sycamore. Lastly, on the thirtieth day ofKhoiak they repaired to the holy sepulchre, a subterranean chamber over which appears tohave grown a clump of Persea-trees. Entering the vault by the western door, they laid thecoffined effigy of the dead god reverently on a bed of sand in the chamber. So they left himto his rest, and departed from the sepulchre by the eastern door. Thus ended theceremonies in the month of Khoiak.In the foregoing account of the festival, drawn from the great inscription of Denderah, theburial of Osiris figures prominently, while his resurrection is implied rather thanexpressed. This defect of the document, however, is amply compensated by a remarkableseries of bas-reliefs which accompany and illustrate the inscription. These exhibit in aseries of scenes the dead god lying swathed as a mummy on his bier, then gradually raisinghimself up higher and higher, until at last he has entirely quitted the bier and is seen erectbetween the guardian wings of the faithful Isis, who stands behind him, while a male figureholds up before his eyes the crux ansata, the Egyptian symbol of life. The resurrection ofthe god could hardly be portrayed more graphically. Even more instructive, however, isanother representation of the same event in a chamber dedicated to Osiris in the greattemple of Isis at Philae. Here we see the dead body of Osiris with stalks of corn springingfrom it, while a priest waters the stalks from a pitcher which he holds in his hand. Theaccompanying inscription sets forth that “this is the form of him whom one may not name,Osiris of the mysteries, who springs from the returning waters.” Taken together, thepicture and the words seem to leave no doubt that Osiris was here conceived andrepresented as a personification of the corn which springs from the fields after they havebeen fertilised by the inundation. This, according to the inscription, was the kernel of themysteries, the innermost secret revealed to the initiated. So in the rites of Demeter atEleusis a reaped ear of corn was exhibited to the worshippers as the central mystery oftheir religion. We can now fully understand why at the great festival of sowing in themonth of Khoiak the priests used to bury effigies of Osiris made of earth and corn. Whenthese effigies were taken up again at the end of a year or of a shorter interval, the cornwould be found to have sprouted from the body of Osiris, and this sprouting of the grainwould be hailed as an omen, or rather as the cause, of the growth of the crops. The corn-god produced the corn from himself: he gave his own body to feed the people: he died thatthey might live.And from the death and resurrection of their great god the Egyptians drew not only theirsupport and sustenance in this life, but also their hope of a life eternal beyond the grave.This hope is indicated in the clearest manner by the very remarkable effigies of Osiriswhich have come to light in Egyptian cemeteries. Thus in the Valley of the Kings at Thebesthere was found the tomb of a royal fan-bearer who lived about 1500 B.C. Among the richcontents of the tomb there was a bier on which rested a mattress of reeds covered withthree layers of linen. On the upper side of the linen was painted a life-size figure of Osiris;"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"and the interior of the figure, which was waterproof, contained a mixture of vegetablemould, barley, and a sticky fluid. The barley had sprouted and sent out shoots two or threeinches long. Again, in the cemetery at Cynopolis “were numerous burials of Osiris figures.These were made of grain wrapped up in cloth and roughly shaped like an Osiris, andplaced inside a bricked-up recess at the side of the tomb, sometimes in small potterycoffins, sometimes in wooden coffins in the form of a hawkmummy, sometimes without anycoffins at all.” These corn-stuffed figures were bandaged like mummies with patches ofgilding here and there, as if in imitation of the golden mould in which the similar figures ofOsiris were cast at the festival of sowing. Again, effigies of Osiris, with faces of green waxand their interior full of grain, were found buried near the necropolis of Thebes. Finally,we are told by Professor Erman that between the legs of mummies “there sometimes lies afigure of Osiris made of slime; it is filled with grains of corn, the sprouting of which isintended to signify the resurrection of the god.” We cannot doubt that, just as the burial ofcorn-stuffed images of Osiris in the earth at the festival of sowing was designed to quickenthe seed, so the burial of similar images in the grave was meant to quicken the dead, inother words, to ensure their spiritual immortality.XL. The Nature of Osiris1. Osiris a Corn-godTHE FOREGOING survey of the myth and ritual of Osiris may suffice to prove that in oneof his aspects the god was a personification of the corn, which may be said to die and cometo life again every year. Through all the pomp and glamour with which in later times thepriests had invested his worship, the conception of him as the corn-god comes clearly out inthe festival of his death and resurrection, which was celebrated in the month of Khoiak andat a later period in the month of Athyr. That festival appears to have been essentially afestival of sowing, which properly fell at the time when the husbandman actuallycommitted the seed to the earth. On that occasion an effigy of the corn-god, moulded ofearth and corn, was buried with funeral rites in the ground in order that, dying there, hemight come to life again with the new crops. The ceremony was, in fact, a charm to ensurethe growth of the corn by sympathetic magic, and we may conjecture that as such it waspractised in a simple form by every Egyptian farmer on his fields long before it wasadopted and transfigured by the priests in the stately ritual of the temple. In the modern,but doubtless ancient, Arab custom of burying “the Old Man,” namely, a sheaf of wheat, inthe harvest-field and praying that he may return from the dead, we see the germ out ofwhich the worship of the corn-god Osiris was probably developed.The details of his myth fit in well with this interpretation of the god. He was said to be theoffspring of Sky and Earth. What more appropriate parentage could be invented for thecorn which springs from the ground that has been fertilised by the water of heaven? It istrue that the land of Egypt owed its fertility directly to the Nile and not to showers; but theinhabitants must have known or guessed that the great river in its turn was fed by the rainswhich fell in the far interior. Again, the legend that Osiris was the first to teach men the use"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"of corn would be most naturally told of the corn-god himself. Further, the story that hismangled remains were scattered up and down the land and buried in different places maybe a mythical way of expressing either the sowing or the winnowing of the grain. The latterinterpretation is supported by the tale that Isis placed the severed limbs of Osiris on a corn-sieve. Or more probably the legend may be a reminiscence of a custom of slaying a humanvictim, perhaps a representative of the corn-spirit, and distributing his flesh or scatteringhis ashes over the fields to fertilise them. In modern Europe the figure of Death issometimes torn in pieces, and the fragments are then buried in the ground to make thecrops grow well, and in other parts of the world human victims are treated in the sameway. With regard to the ancient Egyptians we have it on the authority of Manetho that theyused to burn red-haired men and scatter their ashes with winnowing fans, and it is highlysignificant that this barbarous sacrifice was offered by the kings at the grave of Osiris. Wemay conjecture that the victims represented Osiris himself, who was annually slain,dismembered, and buried in their persons that he might quicken the seed in the earth.Possibly in prehistoric times the kings themselves played the part of the god and were slainand dismembered in that character. Set as well as Osiris is said to have been torn in piecesafter a reign of eighteen days, which was commemorated by an annual festival of the samelength. According to one story Romulus, the first king of Rome, was cut in pieces by thesenators, who buried the fragments of him in the ground; and the traditional day of hisdeath, the seventh of July, was celebrated with certain curious rites, which were apparentlyconnected with the artificial fertilisation of the fig. Again, Greek legend told how Pentheus,king of Thebes, and Lycurgus, king of the Thracian Edonians, opposed the vine-godDionysus, and how the impious monarchs were rent in pieces, the one by the frenziedBacchanals, the other by horses. The Greek traditions may well be distorted reminiscencesof a custom of sacrificing human beings, and especially divine kings, in the character ofDionysus, a god who resembled Osiris in many points and was said like him to have beentorn limb from limb. We are told that in Chios men were rent in pieces as a sacrifice toDionysus; and since they died the same death as their god, it is reasonable to suppose thatthey personated him. The story that the Thracian Orpheus was similarly torn limb fromlimb by the Bacchanals seems to indicate that he too perished in the character of the godwhose death he died. It is significant that the Thracian Lycurgus, king of the Edonians, issaid to have been put to death in order that the ground, which had ceased to be fruitful,might regain its fertility.Further, we read of a Norwegian king, Halfdan the Black, whose body was cut up andburied in different parts of his kingdom for the sake of ensuring the fruitfulness of theearth. He is said to have been drowned at the age of forty through the breaking of the ice inspring. What followed his death is thus related by the old Norse historian Snorri Sturluson:“He had been the most prosperous (literally, blessed with abundance) of all kings. Sogreatly did men value him that when the news came that he was dead and his bodyremoved to Hringariki and intended for burial there, the chief men from Raumariki andWestfold and Heithmörk came and all requested that they might take his body with themand bury it in their various provinces; they thought that it would bring abundance to thosewho obtained it. Eventually it was settled that the body was distributed in four places. Thehead was laid in a barrow at Steinn in Hringariki, and each party took away their ownshare and buried it. All these barrows are called Halfdan’s barrows.” It should be"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"remembered that this Halfdan belonged to the family of the Ynglings, who traced theirdescent from Frey, the great Scandinavian god of fertility.The natives of Kiwai, an island lying off the mouth of the Fly River in British New Guinea,tell of a certain magician named Segera, who had sago for his totem. When Segera was oldand ill, he told the people that he would soon die, but that, nevertheless, he would causetheir gardens to thrive. Accordingly, he instructed them that when he was dead they shouldcut him up and place pieces of his flesh in their gardens, but his head was to be buried inhis own garden. Of him it is said that he outlived the ordinary age, and that no man knewhis father, but that he made the sago good and no one was hungry any more. Old men whowere alive some years ago affirmed that they had known Segera in their youth, and thegeneral opinion of the Kiwai people seems to be that Segera died not more than twogenerations ago.Taken all together, these legends point to a widespread practice of dismembering the bodyof a king or magician and burying the pieces in different parts of the country in order toensure the fertility of the ground and probably also the fecundity of man and beast.To return to the human victims whose ashes the Egyptians scattered with winnowing-fans,the red hair of these unfortunates was probably significant. For in Egypt the oxen whichwere sacrificed had also to be red; a single black or white hair found on the beast wouldhave disqualified it for the sacrifice. If, as I conjecture, these human sacrifices wereintended to promote the growth of the crops—and the winnowing of their ashes seems tosupport this view—redhaired victims were perhaps selected as best fitted to personate thespirit of the ruddy grain. For when a god is represented by a living person, it is natural thatthe human representative should be chosen on the ground of his supposed resemblance tothe divine original. Hence the ancient Mexicans, conceiving the maize as a personal beingwho went through the whole course of life between seed-time and harvest, sacrificed new-born babes when the maize was sown, older children when it had sprouted, and so on till itwas fully ripe, when they sacrificed old men. A name for Osiris was the “crop” or“harvest”; and the ancients sometimes explained him as a personification of the corn.2. Osiris a Tree-spiritBUT Osiris was more than a spirit of the corn; he was also a tree-spirit, and this mayperhaps have been his primitive character, since the worship of trees is naturally older inthe history of religion than the worship of the cereals. The character of Osiris as a tree-spirit was represented very graphically in a ceremony described by Firmicus Maternus. Apine-tree having been cut down, the centre was hollowed out, and with the wood thusexcavated an image of Osiris was made, which was then buried like a corpse in the hollowof the tree. It is hard to imagine how the conception of a tree as tenanted by a personalbeing could be more plainly expressed. The image of Osiris thus made was kept for a yearand then burned, exactly as was done with the image of Attis which was attached to thepine-tree. The ceremony of cutting the tree, as described by Firmicus Maternus, appears tobe alluded to by Plutarch. It was probably the ritual counterpart of the mythical discoveryof the body of Osiris enclosed in the erica-tree. In the hall of Osiris at Denderah the coffin"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"containing the hawk-headed mummy of the god is clearly depicted as enclosed within atree, apparently a conifer, the trunk and branches of which are seen above and below thecoffin. The scene thus corresponds closely both to the myth and to the ceremony describedby Firmicus Maternus.It accords with the character of Osiris as a tree-spirit that his worshippers were forbiddento injure fruit-trees, and with his character as a god of vegetation in general that they werenot allowed to stop up wells of water, which are so important for the irrigation of hotsouthern lands. According to one legend, he taught men to train the vine to poles, to pruneits superfluous foliage, and to extract the juice of the grape. In the papyrus of Nebseni,written about 1550 B.C., Osiris is depicted sitting in a shrine, from the roof of which hangclusters of grapes; and in the papyrus of the royal scribe Nekht we see the god enthroned infront of a pool, from the banks of which a luxuriant vine, with many bunches of grapes,grows towards the green face of the seated deity. The ivy was sacred to him, and was calledhis plant because it is always green.3. Osiris a God of FertilityAS A GOD of vegetation Osiris was naturally conceived as a god of creative energy ingeneral, since men at a certain stage of evolution fail to distinguish between thereproductive powers of animals and of plants. Hence a striking feature in his worship wasthe coarse but expressive symbolism by which this aspect of his nature was presented to theeye not merely of the initiated but of the multitude. At his festival women used to go aboutthe villages singing songs in his praise and carrying obscene images of him which they setin motion by means of strings. The custom was probably a charm to ensure the growth ofthe crops. A similar image of him, decked with all the fruits of the earth, is said to havestood in a temple before a figure of Isis, and in the chambers dedicated to him at Philae thedead god is portrayed lying on his bier in an attitude which indicates in the plainest waythat even in death his generative virtue was not extinct but only suspended, ready to provea source of life and fertility to the world when the opportunity should offer. Hymnsaddressed to Osiris contain allusions to this important side of his nature. In one of them itis said that the world waxes green in triumph through him; and another declares, “Thouart the father and mother of mankind, they live on thy breath, they subsist on the flesh ofthy body.” We may conjecture that in this paternal aspect he was supposed, like other godsof fertility, to bless men and women with offspring, and that the processions at his festivalwere intended to promote this object as well as to quicken the seed in the ground. It wouldbe to misjudge ancient religion to denounce as lewd and profligate the emblems and theceremonies which the Egyptians employed for the purpose of giving effect to thisconception of the divine power. The ends which they proposed to themselves in these riteswere natural and laudable; only the means they adopted to compass them were mistaken.A similar fallacy induced the Greeks to adopt a like symbolism in their Dionysiac festivals,and the superficial but striking resemblance thus produced between the two religions hasperhaps more than anything else misled enquirers, both ancient and modern, intoidentifying worships which, though certainly akin in nature, are perfectly distinct andindependent in origin."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"4. Osiris a God of the DeadWE have seen that in one of his aspects Osiris was the ruler and judge of the dead. To apeople like the Egyptians, who not only believed in a life beyond the grave but actuallyspent much of their time, labour, and money in preparing for it, this office of the god musthave appeared hardly, if at all, less important than his function of making the earth tobring forth its fruits in due season. We may assume that in the faith of his worshippers thetwo provinces of the god were intimately connected. In laying their dead in the grave theycommitted them to his keeping who could raise them from the dust to life eternal, even ashe caused the seed to spring from the ground. Of that faith the corn-stuffed effigies ofOsiris found in Egyptian tombs furnish an eloquent and un-equivocal testimony. They wereat once an emblem and an instrument of resurrection. Thus from the sprouting of the grainthe ancient Egyptians drew an augury of human immortality. They are not the only peoplewho have built the same lofty hopes on the same slender foundation.A god who thus fed his people with his own broken body in this life, and who held out tothem a promise of a blissful eternity in a better world hereafter, naturally reigned supremein their affections. We need not wonder, therefore, that in Egypt the worship of the othergods was overshadowed by that of Osiris, and that while they were revered each in his owndistrict, he and his divine partner Isis were adored in all.XLI. IsisTHE ORIGINAL meaning of the goddess Isis is still more difficult to determine than thatof her brother and husband Osiris. Her attributes and epithets were so numerous that inthe hieroglyphics she is called “the many-named,” “the thousand-named,” and in Greekinscriptions “the myriad-named.” Yet in her complex nature it is perhaps still possible todetect the original nucleus round which by a slow process of accretion the other elementsgathered. For if her brother and husband Osiris was in one of his aspects the corn-god, aswe have seen reason to believe, she must surely have been the corn-goddess. There are atleast some grounds for thinking so. For if we may trust Diodorus Siculus, whose authorityappears to have been the Egyptian historian Manetho, the discovery of wheat and barleywas attributed to Isis, and at her festivals stalks of these grains were carried in processionto commemorate the boon she had conferred on men. A further detail is added byAugustine. He says that Isis made the discovery of barley at the moment when she wassacrificing to the common ancestors of her husband and herself, all of whom had beenkings, and that she showed the newly discovered ears of barley to Osiris and his councillorThoth or Mercury, as Roman writers called him. That is why, adds Augustine, theyidentify Isis with Ceres. Further, at harvest-time, when the Egyptian reapers had cut thefirst stalks, they laid them down and beat their breasts, wailing and calling upon Isis. Thecustom has been already explained as a lamen for the corn-spirit slain under the sickle.Amongst the epithets by which Isis is designated in the inscriptions are “Creatress of greenthings,” “Green goddess, whose green colour is like unto the greenness of the earth,” “Ladyof Bread,” “Lady of Beer,” “Lady of Abundance.” According to Brugsch she is “not only"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"the creatress of the fresh verdure of vegetation which covers the earth, but is actually thegreen corn-field itself, which is personified as a goddess.” This is confirmed by her epithetSochit or Sochet, meaning “a corn-field,” a sense which the word still retains in Coptic. TheGreeks conceived of Isis as a corn-goddess, for they identified her with Demeter. In aGreek epigram she is described as “she who has given birth to the fruits of the earth,” and“the mother of the ears of corn”; and in a hymn composed in her honour she speaks ofherself as “queen of the wheat-field,” and is described as “charged with the care of thefruitful furrow’s wheat-rich path.” Accordingly, Greek or Roman artists often representedher with ears of corn on her head or in her hand.Such, we may suppose, was Isis in the olden time, a rustic Corn-Mother adored withuncouth rites by Egyptian swains. But the homely features of the clownish goddess couldhardly be traced in the refined, the saintly form which, spiritualised by ages of religiousevolution, she presented to her worshippers of after days as the true wife, the tendermother, the beneficent queen of nature, encircled with the nimbus of moral purity, ofimmemorial and mysterious sanctity. Thus chastened and transfigured she won manyhearts far beyond the boundaries of her native land. In that welter of religions whichaccompanied the decline of national life in antiquity her worship was one of the mostpopular at Rome and throughout the empire. Some of the Roman emperors themselveswere openly addicted to it. And however the religion of Isis may, like any other, have beenoften worn as a cloak by men and women of loose life, her rites appear on the whole to havebeen honourably distinguished by a dignity and composure, a solemnity and decorum, wellfitted to soothe the troubled mind, to ease the burdened heart. They appealed therefore togentle spirits, and above all to women, whom the bloody and licentious rites of otherOriental goddesses only shocked and repelled. We need not wonder, then, that in a periodof decadence, when traditional faiths were shaken, when systems clashed, when men’sminds were disquieted, when the fabric of empire itself, once deemed eternal, began toshow ominous rents and fissures, the serene figure of Isis with her spiritual calm, hergracious promise of immortality, should have appeared to many like a star in a stormy sky,and should have roused in their breasts a rapture of devotion not unlike that which waspaid in the Middle Ages to the Virgin Mary. Indeed her stately ritual, with its shaven andtonsured priests, its matins and vespers, its tinkling music, its baptism and aspersions ofholy water, its solemn processions, its jewelled images of the Mother of God, presentedmany points of similarity to the pomps and ceremonies of Catholicism. The resemblanceneed not be purely accidental. Ancient Egypt may have contributed its share to thegorgeous symbolism of the Catholic Church as well as to the pale abstractions of hertheology. Certainly in art the figure of Isis suckling the infant Horus is so like that of theMadonna and child that it has sometimes received the adoration of ignorant Christians.And to Isis in her later character of patroness of mariners the Virgin Mary perhaps owesher beautiful epithet of Stella Maris, “Star of the Sea,” under which she is adored bytempest-tossed sailors. The attributes of a marine deity may have been bestowed on Isis bythe sea-faring Greeks of Alexandria. They are quite foreign to her original character and tothe habits of the Egyptians, who had no love of the sea. On this hypothesis Sirius, the brightstar of Isis, which on July mornings rises from the glassy waves of the easternMediterranean, a harbinger of halcyon weather to mariners, was the true Stella Maris, “theStar of the Sea.”"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"XLII. Osiris and the SunOSIRIS has been sometimes interpreted as the sun-god, and in modern times this view hasbeen held by so many distinguished writers that it deserves a brief examination. If weenquire on what evidence Osiris has been identified with the sun or the sun-god, it will befound on analysis to be minute in quantity and dubious, where it is not absolutelyworthless, in quality. The diligent Jablonski, the first modern scholar to collect and sift thetestimony of classical writers on Egyptian religion, says that it can be shown in many waysthat Osiris is the sun, and that he could produce a cloud of witnesses to prove it, but that itis needless to do so, since no learned man is ignorant of the fact. Of the ancient writerswhom he condescends to quote, the only two who expressly identify Osiris with the sun areDiodorus and Macrobius. But little weight can be attached to their evidence; for thestatement of Diodorus is vague and rhetorical, and the reasons which Macrobius, one of thefathers of solar mythology, assigns for the identification are exceedingly slight.The ground upon which some modern writers seem chiefly to rely for the identification ofOsiris with the sun is that the story of his death fits better with the solar phenomena thanwith any other in nature. It may readily be admitted that the daily appearance anddisappearance of the sun might very naturally be expressed by a myth of his death andresurrection; and writers who regard Osiris as the sun are careful to indicate that it is thediurnal, and not the annual, course of the sun to which they understand the myth to apply.Thus Renouf, who identified Osiris with the sun, admitted that the Egyptian sun could notwith any show of reason be described as dead in winter. But if his daily death was thetheme of the legend, why was it celebrated by an annual ceremony? This fact alone seemsfatal to the interpretation of the myth as descriptive of sunset and sunrise. Again, thoughthe sun may be said to die daily, in what sense can he be said to be torn in pieces?In the course of our enquiry it has, I trust, been made clear that there is another naturalphenomenon to which the conception of death and resurrection is as applicable as to sunsetand sunrise, and which, as a matter of fact, has been so conceived and represented in folk-custom. That phenomenon is the annual growth and decay of vegetation. A strong reasonfor interpreting the death of Osiris as the decay of vegetation rather than as the sunset is tobe found in the general, though not unanimous, voice of antiquity, which classed togetherthe worship and myths of Osiris, Adonis, Attis, Dionysus, and Demeter, as religions ofessentially the same type. The consensus of ancient opinion on this subject seems too greatto be rejected as a mere fancy. So closely did the rites of Osiris resemble those of Adonis atByblus that some of the people of Byblus themselves maintained that it was Osiris and notAdonis whose death was mourned by them. Such a view could certainly not have been heldif the rituals of the two gods had not been so alike as to be almost indistinguishable.Herodotus found the similarity between the rites of Osiris and Dionysus so great, that hethought it impossible the latter could have arisen independently; they must, he supposed,have been recently borrowed, with slight alterations, by the Greeks from the Egyptians.Again, Plutarch, a very keen student of comparative religion, insists upon the detailedresemblance of the rites of Osiris to those of Dionysus. We cannot reject the evidence ofsuch intelligent and trustworthy witnesses on plain matters of fact which fell under their"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"own cognizance. Their explanations of the worships it is indeed possible to reject, for themeaning of religious cults is often open to question; but resemblances of ritual are mattersof observation. Therefore, those who explain Osiris as the sun are driven to the alternativeof either dismissing as mistaken the testimony of antiquity to the similarity of the rites ofOsiris, Adonis, Attis, Dionysus, and Demeter, or of interpreting all these rites as sun-worship. No modern scholar has fairly faced and accepted either side of this alternative. Toaccept the former would be to affirm that we know the rites of these deities better than themen who practised, or at least who witnessed them. To accept the latter would involve awrenching, clipping, mangling, and distorting of myth and ritual from which evenMacrobius shrank. On the other hand, the view that the essence of all these rites was themimic death and revival of vegetation, explains them separately and collectively in an easyand natural way, and harmonises with the general testimony borne by the ancients to theirsubstantial similarity.XLIII. DionysusIN THE PRECEDING chapters we saw that in antiquity the civilised nations of WesternAsia and Egypt pictured to themselves the changes of the seasons, and particularly theannual growth and decay of vegetation, as episodes in the life of gods, whose mournfuldeath and happy resurrection they celebrated with dramatic rites of alternate lamentationand rejoicing. But if the celebration was in form dramatic, it was in substance magical; thatis to say, it was intended, on the principles of sympathetic magic, to ensure the vernalregeneration of plants and the multiplication of animals, which had seemed to be menacedby the inroads of winter. In the ancient world, however, such ideas and such rites were byno means confined to the Oriental peoples of Babylon and Syria, of Phrygia and Egypt;they were not a product peculiar to the religious mysticism of the dreamy East, but wereshared by the races of livelier fancy and more mercurial temperament who inhabited theshores and islands of the Aegean. We need not, with some enquirers in ancient and moderntimes, suppose that these Western peoples borrowed from the older civilisation of theOrient the conception of the Dying and Reviving God, together with the solemn ritual, inwhich that conception was dramatically set forth before the eyes of the worshippers. Moreprobably the resemblance which may be traced in this respect between the religions of theEast and West is no more than what we commonly, though incorrectly, call a fortuitouscoincidence, the effect of similar causes acting alike on the similar constitution of thehuman mind in different countries and under different skies. The Greek had no need tojourney into far countries to learn the vicissitudes of the seasons, to mark the fleetingbeauty of the damask rose, the transient glory of the golden corn, the passing splendour ofthe purple grapes. Year by year in his own beautiful land he beheld, with natural regret,the bright pomp of summer fading into the gloom and stagnation of winter, and year byyear he hailed with natural delight the outburst of fresh life in spring. Accustomed topersonify the forces of nature, to tinge her cold abstractions with the warm hues ofimagination, to clothe her naked realities with the gorgeous drapery of a mythic fancy, hefashioned for himself a train of gods and goddesses, of spirits and elves, out of the shiftingpanorama of the seasons, and followed the annual fluctuations of their fortunes withalternate emotions of cheerfulness and dejection, of gladness and sorrow, which found their"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"natural expression in alternate rites of rejoicing and lamentation, of revelry and mourning.A consideration of some of the Greek divinities who thus died and rose again from the deadmay furnish us with a series of companion pictures to set side by side with the sad figuresof Adonis, Attis, and Osiris. We begin with Dionysus.The god Dionysus or Bacchus is best known to us as a personification of the vine and of theexhilaration produced by the juice of the grape. His ecstatic worship, characterised by wilddances, thrilling music, and tipsy excess, appears to have originated among the rude tribesof Thrace, who were notoriously addicted to drunkenness. Its mystic doctrines andextravagant rites were essentially foreign to the clear intelligence and sober temperamentof the Greek race. Yet appealing as it did to that love of mystery and that proneness torevert to savagery which seem to be innate in most men, the religion spread like wildfirethrough Greece until the god whom Homer hardly deigned to notice had become the mostpopular figure of the pantheon. The resemblance which his story and his ceremoniespresent to those of Osiris have led some enquirers both in ancient and modern times to holdthat Dionysus was merely a disguised Osiris, imported directly from Egypt into Greece.But the great preponderance of evidence points to his Thracian origin, and the similarity ofthe two worships is sufficiently explained by the similarity of the ideas and customs onwhich they were founded.While the vine with its clusters was the most characteristic manifestation of Dionysus, hewas also a god of trees in general. Thus we are told that almost all the Greeks sacrificed to“Dionysus of the tree.” In Boeotia one of his titles was “Dionysus in the tree.” His imagewas often merely an upright post, without arms, but draped in a mantle, with a beardedmask to represent the head, and with leafy boughs projecting from the head or body toshow the nature of the deity. On a vase his rude effigy is depicted appearing out of a lowtree or bush. At Magnesia on the Maeander an image of Dionysus is said to have beenfound in a plane-tree, which had been broken by the wind. He was the patron of cultivatedtrees: prayers were offered to him that he would make the trees grow; and he wasespecially honoured by husbandmen, chiefly fruit-growers, who set up an image of him, inthe shape of a natural tree-stump, in their orchards. He was said to have discovered alltree-fruits, amongst which apples and figs are particularly mentioned; and he was referredto as “well-fruited,” “he of the green fruit,” and “making the fruit to grow.” One of histitles was “teeming” or “bursting” (as of sap or blossoms); and there was a FloweryDionysus in Attica and at Patrae in Achaia. The Athenians sacrificed to him for theprosperity of the fruits of the land. Amongst the trees particularly sacred to him, inaddition to the vine, was the pine-tree. The Delphic oracle commanded the Corinthians toworship a particular pine-tree “equally with the god,” so they made two images ofDionysus out of it, with red faces and gilt bodies. In art a wand, tipped with a pine-cone, iscommonly carried by the god or his worshippers. Again, the ivy and the fig-tree wereespecially associated with him. In the Attic township of Acharnae there was a Dionysus Ivy;at Lacedaemon there was a Fig Dionysus; and in Naxos, where figs were called meilicha,there was a Dionysus Meilichios, the face of whose image was made of fig-wood.Further, there are indications, few but significant, that Dionysus was conceived as a deityof agriculture and the corn. He is spoken of as himself doing the work of a husbandman: heis reported to have been the first to yoke oxen to the plough, which before had been"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"dragged by hand alone; and some people found in this tradition the clue to the bovineshape in which, as we shall see, the god was often supposed to present himself to hisworshippers. Thus guiding the ploughshare and scattering the seed as he went, Dionysus issaid to have eased the labour of the husbandman. Further, we are told that in the land ofthe Bisaltae, a Thracian tribe, there was a great and fair sanctuary of Dionysus, where athis festival a bright light shone forth at night as a token of an abundant harvest vouchsafedby the diety; but if the crops were to fail that year, the mystic light was not seen, darknessbrooded over the sanctuary as at other times. Moreover, among the emblems of Dionysuswas the winnowing-fan, that is the large open shovel-shaped basket, which down to moderntimes has been used by farmers to separate the grain from the chaff by tossing the corn inthe air. This simple agricultural instrument figured in the mystic rites of Dionysus; indeedthe god is traditionally said to have been placed at birth in a winnowing-fan as in a cradle:in art he is represented as an infant so cradled; and from these traditions andrepresentations he derived the epithet of Liknites, that is, “He of the Winnowing-fan.”Like other gods of vegetation Dionysus was believed to have died a violent death, but tohave been brought to life again; and his sufferings, death, and resurrection were enacted inhis sacred rites. His tragic story is thus told by the poet Nonnus. Zeus in the form of aserpent visited Persephone, and she bore him Zagreus, that is, Dionysus, a horned infant.Scarcely was he born, when the babe mounted the throne of his father Zeus and mimickedthe great god by brandishing the lightning in his tiny hand. But he did not occupy thethrone long; for the treacherous Titans, their faces whitened with chalk, attacked him withknives while he was looking at himself in a mirror. For a time he evaded their assaults byturning himself into various shapes, assuming the likeness successively of Zeus and Cronus,of a young man, of a lion, a horse, and a serpent. Finally, in the form of a bull, he was cut topieces by the murderous knives of his enemies. His Cretan myth, as related by FirmicusMaternus, ran thus. He was said to have been the bastard son of Jupiter, a Cretan king.Going abroad, Jupiter transferred the throne and sceptre to the youthful Dionysus, but,knowing that his wife Juno cherished a jealous dislike of the child, he entrusted Dionysus tothe care of guards upon whose fidelity he believed he could rely. Juno, however, bribed theguards, and amusing the child with rattles and a cunningly-wrought looking glass luredhim into an ambush, where her satellites, the Titans, rushed upon him, cut him limb fromlimb, boiled his body with various herbs, and ate it. But his sister Minerva, who had sharedin the deed, kept his heart and gave it to Jupiter on his return, revealing to him the wholehistory of the crime. In his rage, Jupiter put the Titans to death by torture, and, to soothehis grief for the loss of his son, made an image in which he enclosed the child’s heart, andthen built a temple in his honour. In this version a Euhemeristic turn has been given to themyth by representing Jupiter and Juno (Zeus and Hera) as a king and queen of Crete. Theguards referred to are the mythical Curetes who danced a war-dance round the infantDionysus, as they are said to have done round the infant Zeus. Very noteworthy is thelegend, recorded both by Nonnus and Firmicus, that in his infancy Dionysus occupied for ashort time the throne of his father Zeus. So Proclus tells us that “Dionysus was the last kingof the gods appointed by Zeus. For his father set him on the kingly throne, and placed inhis hand the sceptre, and made him king of all the gods of the world.” Such traditions pointto a custom of temporarily investing the king’s son with the royal dignity as a preliminaryto sacrificing him instead of his father. Pomegranates were supposed to have sprung fromthe blood of Dionysus, as anemones from the blood of Adonis and violets from the blood of"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"Attis: hence women refrained from eating seeds of pomegranates at the festival of theThesmophoria. According to some, the severed limbs of Dionysus were pieced together, atthe command of Zeus, by Apollo, who buried them on Parnassus. The grave of Dionysuswas shown in the Delphic temple beside a golden statue of Apollo. However, according toanother account, the grave of Dionysus was at Thebes, where he is said to have been torn inpieces. Thus far the resurrection of the slain god is not mentioned, but in other versions ofthe myth it is variously related. According to one version, which represented Dionysus as ason of Zeus and Demeter, his mother pieced together his mangled limbs and made himyoung again. In others it is simply said that shortly after his burial he rose from the deadand ascended up to heaven; or that Zeus raised him up as he lay mortally wounded; or thatZeus swallowed the heart of Dionysus and then begat him afresh by Semele, who in thecommon legend figures as mother of Dionysus. Or, again, the heart was pounded up andgiven in a potion to Semele, who thereby conceived him.Turning from the myth to the ritual, we find that the Cretans celebrated a biennial festivalat which the passion of Dionysus was represented in every detail. All that he had done orsuffered in his last moments was enacted before the eyes of his worshippers, who tore a livebull to pieces with their teeth and roamed the woods with frantic shouts. In front of themwas carried a casket supposed to contain the sacred heart of Dionysus, and to the wildmusic of flutes and cymbals they mimicked the rattles by which the infant god had beenlured to his doom. Where the resurrection formed part of the myth, it also was acted at therites, and it even appears that a general doctrine of resurrection, or at least of immortality,was inculcated on the worshippers; for Plutarch, writing to console his wife on the death oftheir infant daughter, comforts her with the thought of the immortality of the soul astaught by tradition and revealed in the mysteries of Dionysus. A different form of the mythof the death and resurrection of Dionysus is that he descended into Hades to bring up hismother Semele from the dead. The local Argive tradition was that he went down throughthe Alcyonian lake; and his return from the lower world, in other words his resurrection,was annually celebrated on the spot by the Argives, who summoned him from the water bytrumpet blasts, while they threw a lamb into the lake as an offering to the warder of thedead. Whether this was a spring festival does not appear, but the Lydians certainlycelebrated the advent of Dionysus in spring; the god was supposed to bring the season withhim. Deities of vegetation, who are believed to pass a certain portion of each yearunderground, naturally come to be regarded as gods of the lower world or of the dead.Both Dionysus and Osiris were so conceived.A feature in the mythical character of Dionysus, which at first sight appears inconsistentwith his nature as a deity of vegetation, is that he was often conceived and represented inanimal shape, especially in the form, or at least with the horns, of a bull. Thus he is spokenof as “cow-born,” “bull,” “bull-shaped,” “bull-faced,” “bull-browed,” “bull-horned,”“horn-bearing,” “two-horned,” “horned.” He was believed to appear, at least occasionally,as a bull. His images were often, as at Cyzicus, made in bull shape, or with bull horns; andhe was painted with horns. Types of the horned Dionysus are found amongst the survivingmonuments of antiquity. On one statuette he appears clad in a bull’s hide, the head, horns,and hoofs hanging down behind. Again, he is represented as a child with clusters of grapesround his brow, and a calf’s head, with sprouting horns, attached to the back of his head.On a red-figured vase the god is portrayed as a calf-headed child seated on a woman’s lap."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"The people of Cynaetha held a festival of Dionysus in winter, when men, who had greasedtheir bodies with oil for the occasion, used to pick out a bull from the herd and carry it tothe sanctuary of the god. Dionysus was supposed to inspire their choice of the particularbull, which probably represented the deity himself; for at his festivals he was believed toappear in bull form. The women of Elis hailed him as a bull, and prayed him to come withhis bull’s foot. They sang, “Come hither, Dionysus, to thy holy temple by the sea; comewith the Graces to thy temple, rushing with thy bull’s foot, O goodly bull, O goodly bull!”The Bacchanals of Thrace wore horns in imitation of their god. According to the myth, itwas in the shape of a bull that he was torn to pieces by the Titans; and the Cretans, whenthey acted the sufferings and death of Dionysus, tore a live bull to pieces with their teeth.Indeed, the rending and devouring of live bulls and calves appear to have been a regularfeature of the Dionysiac rites. When we consider the practice of portraying the god as abull or with some of the features of the animal, the belief that he appeared in bull form tohis worshippers at the sacred rites, and the legend that in bull form he had been torn inpieces, we cannot doubt that in rending and devouring a live bull at his festival theworshippers of Dionysus believed themselves to be killing the god, eating his flesh, anddrinking his blood.Another animal whose form Dionysus assumed was the goat. One of his names was “Kid.”At Athens and at Hermion he was worshipped under the title of “the one of the BlackGoatskin,” and a legend ran that on a certain occasion he had appeared clad in the skinfrom which he took the title. In the wine-growing district of Phlius, where in autumn theplain is still thickly mantled with the red and golden foliage of the fading vines, there stoodof old a bronze image of a goat, which the husbandmen plastered with gold-leaf as a meansof protecting their vines against blight. The image probably represented the vine-godhimself. To save him from the wrath of Hera, his father Zeus changed the youthfulDionysus into a kid; and when the gods fled to Egypt to escape the fury of Typhon,Dionysus was turned into a goat. Hence when his worshippers rent in pieces a live goat anddevoured it raw, they must have believed that they were eating the body and blood of thegod. The custom of tearing in pieces the bodies of animals and of men and then devouringthem raw has been practised as a religious rite by savages in modern times. We need nottherefore dismiss as a fable the testimony of antiquity to the observance of similar ritesamong the frenzied worshippers of Bacchus.The custom of killing a god in animal form, which we shall examine more in detail furtheron, belongs to a very early stage of human culture, and is apt in later times to bemisunderstood. The advance of thought tends to strip the old animal and plant gods oftheir bestial and vegetable husk, and to leave their human attributes (which are always thekernel of the conception) as the final and sole residuum. In other words, animal and plantgods tend to become purely anthropomorphic. When they have become wholly or nearly so,the animals and plants which were at first the deities themselves, still retain a vague and ill-understood connexion with the anthropomorphic gods who have developed out of them.The origin of the relationship between the deity and the animal or plant having beenforgotten, various stories are invented to explain it. These explanations may follow one oftwo lines according as they are based on the habitual or on the exceptional treatment of thesacred animal or plant. The sacred animal was habitually spared, and only exceptionallyslain; and accordingly the myth might be devised to explain either why it was spared or"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"why it was killed. Devised for the former purpose, the myth would tell of some servicerendered to the deity by the animal; devised for the latter purpose, the myth would tell ofsome injury inflicted by the animal on the god. The reason given for sacrificing goats toDionysus exemplifies a myth of the latter sort. They were sacrificed to him, it was said,because they injured the vine. Now the goat, as we have seen, was originally anembodiment of the god himself. But when the god had divested himself of his animalcharacter and had become essentially anthropomorphic, the killing of the goat in hisworship came to be regarded no longer as a slaying of the deity himself, but as a sacrificeoffered to him; and since some reason had to be assigned why the goat in particular shouldbe sacrificed, it was alleged that this was a punishment inflicted on the goat for injuring thevine, the object of the god’s especial care. Thus we have the strange spectacle of a godsacrificed to himself on the ground that he is his own enemy. And as the deity is supposedto partake of the victim offered to him, it follows that, when the victim is the god’s old self,the god eats of his own flesh. Hence the goat-god Dionysus is represented as eating rawgoat’s blood; and the bull-god Dionysus is called “eater of bulls.” On the analogy of theseinstances we may conjecture that wherever a deity is described as the eater of a particularanimal, the animal in question was originally nothing but the deity himself. Later on weshall find that some savages propitiate dead bears and whales by offering them portions oftheir own bodies.All this, however, does not explain why a deity of vegetation should appear in animal form.But the consideration of that point had better be deferred till we have discussed thecharacter and attributes of Demeter. Meantime it remains to mention that in some places,instead of an animal, a human being was torn in pieces at the rites of Dionysus. This wasthe practice in Chios and Tenedos; and at Potniae in Boeotia the tradition ran that it hadbeen formerly the custom to sacrifice to the goat-smiting Dionysus a child, for whom a goatwas afterwards substituted. At Orchomenus, as we have seen, the human victim was takenfrom the women of an old royal family. As the slain bull or goat represented the slain god,so, we may suppose, the human victim also represented him.The legends of the deaths of Pentheus and Lycurgus, two kings who are said to have beentorn to pieces, the one by Bacchanals, the other by horses, for their opposition to the rites ofDionysus, may be, as I have already suggested, distorted reminiscences of a custom ofsacrificing divine kings in the character of Dionysus and of dispersing the fragments oftheir broken bodies over the fields for the purpose of fertilising them. It is probably nomere coincidence that Dionysus himself is said to have been torn in pieces at Thebes, thevery place where according to legend the same fate befell king Pentheus at the hands of thefrenzied votaries of the vine-god.However, a tradition of human sacrifice may sometimes have been a meremisinterpretation of a sacrificial ritual in which an animal victim was treated as a humanbeing. For example, at Tenedos the new-born calf sacrificed to Dionysus was shod inbuskins, and the mother cow was tended like a woman in child-bed. At Rome a shegoat wassacrificed to Vedijovis as if it were a human victim. Yet on the other hand it is equallypossible, and perhaps more probable, that these curious rites were themselves mitigationsof an older and ruder custom of sacrificing human beings, and that the later pretence oftreating the sacrificial victims as if they were human beings was merely part of a pious and"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"merciful fraud, which palmed off on the deity less precious victims than living men andwomen. This interpretation is supported by many undoubted cases in which animals havebeen substituted for human victims.XLIV. Demeter and PersephoneDIONYSUS was not the only Greek deity whose tragic story and ritual appear to reflectthe decay and revival of vegetation. In another form and with a different application theold tale reappears in the myth of Demeter and Persephone. Substantially their myth isidentical with the Syrian one of Aphrodite (Astarte) and Adonis, the Phrygian one ofCybele and Attis, and the Egyptian one of Isis and Osiris. In the Greek fable, as in itsAsiatic and Egyptian counterparts, a goddess mourns the loss of a loved one, whopersonifies the vegetation, more especially the corn, which dies in winter to revive inspring; only whereas the Oriental imagination figured the loved and lost one as a deadlover or a dead husband lamented by his leman or his wife, Greek fancy embodied thesame idea in the tenderer and purer form of a dead daughter bewailed by her sorrowingmother.The oldest literary document which narrates the myth of Demeter and Persephone is thebeautiful Homeric Hymn to Demeter, which critics assign to the seventh century before ourera. The object of the poem is to explain the origin of the Eleusinian mysteries, and thecomplete silence of the poet as to Athens and the Athenians, who in after ages tookconspicuous part in the festival, renders it probable that the hymn was composed in the faroff time when Eleusis was still a petty independent state, and before the stately processionof the Mysteries had begun to defile, in bright September days, over the low chain ofbarren rocky hills which divides the flat Eleusinian cornland from the more spacious olive-clad expanse of the Athenian plain. Be that as it may, the hymn reveals to us the conceptionwhich the writer entertained of the character and functions of the two goddesses; theirnatural shapes stand out sharply enough under the thin veil of poetical imagery. Theyouthful Persephone, so runs the tale, was gathering roses and lilies, crocuses and violets,hyacinths and narcissuses in a lush meadow, when the earth gaped and Pluto, lord of theDead, issuing from the abyss carried her off on his golden car to be his bride and queen inthe gloomy subterranean world. Her sorrowing mother Demeter, with her yellow tressesveiled in a dark mourning mantle, sought her over land and sea, and learning from the Sunher daughter’s fate she withdrew in high dudgeon from the gods and took up her abode atEleusis, where she presented herself to the king’s daughters in the guise of an old woman,sitting sadly under the shadow of an olive tree beside the Maiden’s Well, to which thedamsels had come to draw water in bronze pitchers for their father’s house. In her wrathat her bereavement the goddess suffered not the seed to grow in the earth but kept ithidden under ground, and she vowed that never would she set foot on Olympus and neverwould she let the corn sprout till her lost daughter should be restored to her. Vainly theoxen dragged the ploughs to and fro in the fields; vainly the sower dropped the barley seedin the brown furrows; nothing came up from the parched and crumbling soil. Even theRarian plain near Eleusis, which was wont to wave with yellow harvests, lay bare andfallow. Mankind would have perished of hunger and the gods would have been robbed of"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"the sacrifices which were their due, if Zeus in alarm had not commanded Pluto to disgorgehis prey, to restore his bride Persephone to her mother Demeter. The grim lord of the Deadsmiled and obeyed, but before he sent back his queen to the upper air on a golden car, hegave her the seed of a pomegranate to eat, which ensured that she would return to him. ButZeus stipulated that henceforth Persephone should spend two thirds of every year with hermother and the gods in the upper world and one third of the year with her husband in thenether world, from which she was to return year by year when the earth was gay withspring flowers. Gladly the daughter then returned to the sunshine, gladly her motherreceived her and fell upon her neck; and in her joy at recovering the lost one Demetermade the corn to sprout from the clods of the ploughed fields and all the broad earth to beheavy with leaves and blossoms. And straightway she went and showed this happy sight tothe princes of Eleusis, to Triptolemus, Eumolpus, Diocles, and to the king Celeus himself,and moreover she revealed to them her sacred rites and mysteries. Blessed, says the poet, isthe mortal man who has seen these things, but he who has had no share of them in life willnever be happy in death when he has descended into the darkness of the grave. So the twogoddesses departed to dwell in bliss with the gods on Olympus; and the bard ends thehymn with a pious prayer to Demeter and Persephone that they would be pleased to granthim a livelihood in return for his song.It has been generally recognised, and indeed it seems scarcely open to doubt, that the maintheme which the poet set before himself in composing this hymn was to describe thetraditional foundation of the Eleusinian mysteries by the goddess Demeter. The wholepoem leads up to the transformation scene in which the bare leafless expanse of theEleusinian plain is suddenly turned, at the will of the goddess, into a vast sheet of ruddycorn; the beneficent deity takes the princes of Eleusis, shows them what she has done,teaches them her mystic rites, and vanishes with her daughter to heaven. The revelation ofthe mysteries is the triumphal close of the piece. This conclusion is confirmed by a moreminute examination of the poem, which proves that the poet has given, not merely ageneral account of the foundation of the mysteries, but also in more or less veiled languagemythical explanations of the origin of particular rites which we have good reason to believeformed essential features of the festival. Amongst the rites as to which the poet thus dropssignificant hints are the preliminary fast of the candidates for initiation, the torchlightprocession, the all-night vigil, the sitting of the candidates, veiled and in silence, on stoolscovered with sheepskins, the use of scurrilous language, the breaking of ribald jests, andthe solemn communion with the divinity by participation in a draught of barley-water froma holy chalice.But there is yet another and a deeper secret of the mysteries which the author of the poemappears to have divulged under cover of his narrative. He tells us how, as soon as she hadtransformed the barren brown expanse of the Eleusinian plain into a field of golden grain,she gladdened the eyes of Triptolemus and the other Eleusinian princes by showing themthe growing or standing corn. When we compare this part of the story with the statementof a Christian writer of the second century, Hippolytus, that the very heart of the mysteriesconsisted in showing to the initiated a reaped ear of corn, we can hardly doubt that the poetof the hymn was well acquainted with this solemn rite, and that he deliberately intended toexplain its origin in precisely the same way as he explained other rites of the mysteries,namely by representing Demeter as having set the example of performing the ceremony in"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"her own person. Thus myth and ritual mutually explain and confirm each other. The poetof the seventh century before our era gives us the myth—he could not without sacrilegehave revealed the ritual: the Christian father reveals the ritual, and his revelation accordsperfectly with the veiled hint of the old poet. On the whole, then, we may, with manymodern scholars, confidently accept the statement of the learned Christian father Clementof Alexandria, that the myth of Demeter and Persephone was acted as a sacred drama inthe mysteries of Eleusis.But if the myth was acted as a part, perhaps as the principal part, of the most famous andsolemn religious rites of ancient Greece, we have still to enquire, What was, after all,stripped of later accretions, the original kernel of the myth which appears to later agessurrounded and transfigured by an aureole of awe and mystery, lit up by some of the mostbrilliant rays of Grecian literature and art? If we follow the indications given by our oldestliterary authority on the subject, the author of the Homeric hymn to Demeter, the riddle isnot hard to read; the figures of the two goddesses, the mother and the daughter, resolvethemselves into personifications of the corn. At least this appears to be fairly certain for thedaughter Persephone. The goddess who spends three or, according to another version ofthe myth, six months of every year with the dead under ground and the remainder of theyear with the living above ground; in whose absence the barley seed is hidden in the earthand the fields lie bare and fallow; on whose return in spring to the upper world the cornshoots up from the clods and the earth is heavy with leaves and blossoms—this goddess cansurely be nothing else than a mythical embodiment of the vegetation, and particularly ofthe corn, which is buried under the soil for some months of every winter and comes to lifeagain, as from the grave, in the sprouting cornstalks and the opening flowers and foliage ofevery spring. No other reasonable and probable explanation of Persephone seems possible.And if the daughter goddess was a personification of the young corn of the present year,may not the mother goddess be a personification of the old corn of last year, which hasgiven birth to the new crops? The only alternative to this view of Demeter would seem to beto suppose that she is a personification of the earth, from whose broad bosom the corn andall other plants spring up, and of which accordingly they may appropriately enough beregarded as the daughters. This view of the original nature of Demeter has indeed beentaken by some writers, both ancient and modern, and it is one which can be reasonablymaintained. But it appears to have been rejected by the author of the Homeric hymn toDemeter, for he not only distinguishes Demeter from the personified Earth but places thetwo in the sharpest opposition to each other. He tells us that it was Earth who, inaccordance with the will of Zeus and to please Pluto, lured Persephone to her doom bycausing the narcissuses to grow which tempted the young goddess to stray far beyond thereach of help in the lush meadow. Thus Demeter of the hymn, far from being identical withthe Earth-goddess, must have regarded that divinity as her worst enemy, since it was to herinsidious wiles that she owed the loss of her daughter. But if the Demeter of the hymncannot have been a personification of the earth, the only alternative apparently is toconclude that she was a personification of the corn.The conclusion is confirmed by the monuments; for in ancient art Demeter and Persephoneare alike characterised as goddesses of the corn by the crowns of corn which they wear ontheir heads and by the stalks of corn which they hold in their hands. Again, it was Demeterwho first revealed to the Athenians the secret of the corn and diffused the beneficent"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"discovery far and wide through the agency of Triptolemus, whom she sent forth as anitinerant missionary to communicate the boon to all mankind. On monuments of art,especially in vase-paintings, he is constantly represented along with Demeter in thiscapacity, holding corn-stalks in his hand and sitting in his car, which is sometimes wingedand sometimes drawn by dragons, and from which he is said to have sowed the seed downon the whole world as he sped through the air. In gratitude for the priceless boon manyGreek cities long continued to send the first-fruits of their barley and wheat harvests asthank-offerings to the Two Goddesses, Demeter and Persephone, at Eleusis, wheresubterranean granaries were built to store the overflowing contributions. Theocritus tellshow in the island of Cos, in the sweet-scented summer time, the farmer brought the first-fruits of the harvest to Demeter who had filled his threshingfloor with barley, and whoserustic image held sheaves and poppies in her hands. Many of the epithets bestowed by theancients on Demeter mark her intimate association with the corn in the clearest manner.How deeply implanted in the mind of the ancient Greeks was this faith in Demeter asgoddess of the corn may be judged by the circumstance that the faith actually persistedamong their Christian descendants at her old sanctuary of Eleusis down to the beginning ofthe nineteenth century. For when the English traveller Dodwell revisited Eleusis, theinhabitants lamented to him the loss of a colossal image of Demeter, which was carried offby Clarke in 1802 and presented to the University of Cambridge, where it still remains. “Inmy first journey to Greece,” says Dodwell, “this protecting deity was in its full glory,situated in the centre of a threshing-floor, amongst the ruins of her temple. The villagerswere impressed with a persuasion that their rich harvests were the effect of her bounty,and since her removal, their abundance, as they assured me, has disappeared.” Thus we seethe Corn Goddess Demeter standing on the threshing-floor of Eleusis and dispensing cornto her worshippers in the nineteenth century of the Christian era, precisely as her imagestood and dispensed corn to her worshippers on the threshing-floor of Cos in the days ofTheocritus. And just as the people of Eleusis in the nineteenth century attributed thediminution of their harvests to the loss of the image of Demeter, so in antiquity theSicilians, a corn-growing people devoted to the worship of the two Corn Goddesses,lamented that the crops of many towns had perished because the unscrupulous Romangovernor Verres had impiously carried off the image of Demeter from her famous templeat Henna. Could we ask for a clearer proof that Demeter was indeed the goddess of thecorn than this belief, held by the Greeks down to modern times, that the corn-cropsdepended on her presence and bounty and perished when her image was removed?On the whole, then, if, ignoring theories, we adhere to the evidence of the ancientsthemselves in regard to the rites of Eleusis, we shall probably incline to agree with the mostlearned of ancient antiquaries, the Roman Varro, who, to quote Augustine’s report of hisopinion, “interpreted the whole of the Eleusinian mysteries as relating to the corn whichCeres (Demeter) had discovered, and to Proserpine (Persephone), whom Pluto had carriedoff from her. And Proserpine herself he said, signifies the fecundity of the seeds, the failureof which at a certain time had caused the earth to mourn for barrenness, and therefore hadgiven rise to the opinion that the daughter of Ceres, that is, fecundity itself, had beenravished by Pluto and detained in the nether world; and when the dearth had been publiclymourned and fecundity had returned once more, there was gladness at the return ofProserpine and solemn rites were instituted accordingly. After that he says,” continues"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"Augustine, reporting Varro, “that many things were taught in her mysteries which had noreference but to the discovery of the corn.”Thus far I have for the most part assumed an identity of nature between Demeter andPersephone, the divine mother and daughter personifying the corn in its double aspect ofthe seed-corn of last year and the ripe ears of this, and this view of the substantial unity ofmother and daughter is borne out by their portraits in Greek art, which are often so alikeas to be indistinguishable. Such a close resemblance between the artistic types of Demeterand Persephone militates decidedly against the view that the two goddesses are mythicalembodiments of two things so different and so easily distinguishable from each other as theearth and the vegetation which springs from it. Had Greek artists accepted that view ofDemeter and Persephone, they could surely have devised types of them which would havebrought out the deep distinction between the goddesses. And if Demeter did not personifythe earth, can there be any reasonable doubt that, like her daughter, she personified thecorn which was so commonly called by her name from the time of Homer downwards? Theessential identity of mother and daughter is suggested, not only by the close resemblance oftheir artistic types, but also by the official title of “the Two Goddesses” which was regularlyapplied to them in the great sanctuary at Eleusis without any specification of theirindividual attributes and titles, as if their separate individualities had almost merged in asingle divine substance.Surveying the evidence as a whole, we are fairly entitled to conclude that in the mind of theordinary Greek the two goddesses were essentially personifications of the corn, and that inthis germ the whole efflorescence of their religion finds implicitly its explanation. But tomaintain this is not to deny that in the long course of religious evolution high moral andspiritual conceptions were grafted on this simple original stock and blossomed out intofairer flowers than the bloom of the barley and the wheat. Above all, the thought of theseed buried in the earth in order to spring up to new and higher life readily suggested acomparison with human destiny, and strengthened the hope that for man too the gravemay be but the beginning of a better and happier existence in some brighter worldunknown. This simple and natural reflection seems perfectly sufficient to explain theassociation of the Corn Goddess at Eleusis with the mystery of death and the hope of ablissful immortality. For that the ancients regarded initiation in the Eleusinian mysteries asa key to unlock the gates of Paradise appears to be proved by the allusions which well-informed writers among them drop to the happiness in store for the initiated hereafter. Nodoubt it is easy for us to discern the flimsiness of the logical foundation on which such highhopes were built. But drowning men clutch at straws, and we need not wonder that theGreeks, like ourselves, with death before them and a great love of life in their hearts,should not have stopped to weigh with too nice a hand the arguments that told for andagainst the prospect of human immortality. The reasoning that satisfied Saint Paul and hasbrought comfort to untold thousands of sorrowing Christians, standing by the deathbed orthe open grave of their loved ones, was good enough to pass muster with ancient pagans,when they too bowed their heads under the burden of grief, and, with the taper of lifeburning low in the socket, looked forward into the darkness of the unknown. Therefore wedo no indignity to the myth of Demeter and Persephone—one of the few myths in which thesunshine and clarity of the Greek genius are crossed by the shadow and mystery of death—when we trace its origin to some of the most familiar, yet eternally affecting aspects of"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"nature, to the melancholy gloom and decay of autumn and to the freshness, the brightness,and the verdure of spring.XLV. The Corn-Mother and the Corn-Maiden in Northern EuropeIT has been argued by W. Mannhardt that the first part of Demeter’s name is derived froman alleged Cretan word deai, “barley,” and that accordingly Demeter means neither morenor less than “Barley-mother” or “Corn-mother”; for the root of the word seems to havebeen applied to different kinds of grain by different branches of the Aryans. As Creteappears to have been one of the most ancient seats of the worship of Demeter, it would notbe surprising if her name were of Cretan origin. But the etymology is open to seriousobjections, and it is safer therefore to lay no stress on it. Be that as it may, we have foundindependent reasons for identifying Demeter as the Corn-mother, and of the two species ofcorn associated with her in Greek religion, namely barley and wheat, the barley hasperhaps the better claim to be her original element; for not only would it seem to have beenthe staple food of the Greeks in the Homeric age, but there are grounds for believing that itis one of the oldest, if not the very oldest, cereal cultivated by the Aryan race. Certainly theuse of barley in the religious ritual of the ancient Hindoos as well as of the ancient Greeksfurnishes a strong argument in favour of the great antiquity of its cultivation, which isknown to have been practised by the lake-dwellers of the Stone Age in Europe.Analogies to the Corn-mother or Barley-mother of ancient Greece have been collected ingreat abundance by W. Mannhardt from the folk-lore of modern Europe. The followingmay serve as specimens.In Germany the corn is very commonly personified under the name of the Corn-mother.Thus in spring, when the corn waves in the wind, the peasants say, “There comes the Corn-mother,” or “The Corn-mother is running over the field,” or “The Corn-mother is goingthrough the corn.” When children wish to go into the fields to pull the blue corn-flowers orthe red poppies, they are told not to do so, because the Corn-mother is sitting in the cornand will catch them. Or again she is called, according to the crop, the Rye-mother or thePea-mother, and children are warned against straying in the rye or among the peas bythreats of the Rye-mother or the Pea-mother. Again the Corn-mother is believed to makethe crop grow. Thus in the neighbourhood of Magdeburg it is sometimes said, “It will be agood year for flax; the Flax-mother has been seen.” In a village of Styria it is said that theCorn-mother, in the shape of a female puppet made out of the last sheaf of corn anddressed in white, may be seen at mid-night in the corn-fields, which she fertilises by passingthrough them; but if she is angry with a farmer, she withers up all his corn.Further, the Corn-mother plays an important part in harvest customs. She is believed to bepresent in the handful of corn which is left standing last on the field; and with the cuttingof this last handful she is caught, or driven away, or killed. In the first of these cases, thelast sheaf is carried joyfully home and honoured as a divine being. It is placed in the barn,and at threshing the corn-spirit appears again. In the Hanoverian district of Hadeln thereapers stand round the last sheaf and beat it with sticks in order to drive the Corn-motherout of it. They call to each other, “There she is! hit her! Take care she doesn’t catch you!”"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"The beating goes on till the grain is completely threshed out; then the Corn-mother isbelieved to be driven away. In the neighbourhood of Danzig the person who cuts the lastears of corn makes them into a doll, which is called the Corn-mother or the Old Womanand is brought home on the last waggon. In some parts of Holstein the last sheaf is dressedin woman’s clothes and called the Corn-mother. It is carried home on the last waggon, andthen thoroughly drenched with water. The drenching with water is doubtless a rain-charm.In the district of Bruck in Styria the last sheaf, called the Corn-mother, is made up into theshape of a woman by the oldest married woman in the village, of an age from fifty to fifty-five years. The finest ears are plucked out of it and made into a wreath, which, twined withflowers, is carried on her head by the prettiest girl of the village to the farmer or squire,while the Corn-mother is laid down in the barn to keep off the mice. In other villages of thesame district the Corn-mother, at the close of harvest, is carried by two lads at the top of apole. They march behind the girl who wears the wreath to the squire’s house, and while hereceives the wreath and hangs it up in the hall, the Corn-mother is placed on the top of apile of wood, where she is the centre of the harvest supper and dance. Afterwards she ishung up in the barn and remains there till the threshing is over. The man who gives the laststroke at threshing is called the son of the Corn-mother; he is tied up in the Corn-mother,beaten, and carried through the village. The wreath is dedicated in church on the followingSunday; and on Easter Eve the grain is rubbed out of it by a seven-year-old girl andscattered amongst the young corn. At Christmas the straw of the wreath is placed in themanger to make the cattle thrive. Here the fertilising power of the Corn-mother is plainlybrought out by scattering the seed taken from her body (for the wreath is made out of theCorn-mother) among the new corn; and her influence over animal life is indicated byplacing the straw in the manger. Amongst the Slavs also the last sheaf is known as the Rye-mother, the Wheat-mother, the Oats-mother, the Barley-mother, and so on, according tothe crop. In the district of Tarnow, Galicia, the wreath made out of the last stalks is calledthe Wheat-mother, Rye-mother, or Pea-mother. It is placed on a girl’s head and kept tillspring, when some of the grain is mixed with the seed-corn. Here again the fertilisingpower of the Corn-mother is indicated. In France, also, in the neighbourhood of Auxerre,the last sheaf goes by the name of the Mother of the Wheat, Mother of the Barley, Motherof the Rye, or Mother of the Oats. They leave it standing in the field till the last waggon isabout to wend homewards. Then they make a puppet out of it, dress it with clothesbelonging to the farmer, and adorn it with a crown and a blue or white scarf. A branch of atree is stuck in the breast of the puppet, which is now called the Ceres. At the dance in theevening the Ceres is set in the middle of the floor, and the reaper who reaped fastest dancesround it with the prettiest girl for his partner. After the dance a pyre is made. All the girls,each wearing a wreath, strip the puppet, pull it to pieces, and place it on the pyre, alongwith the flowers with which it was adorned. Then the girl who was the first to finishreaping sets fire to the pile, and all pray that Ceres may give a fruitful year. Here, asMannhardt observes, the old custom has remained intact, though the name Ceres is a bit ofschoolmaster’s learning. In Upper Brittany the last sheaf is always made into humanshape; but if the farmer is a married man, it is made double and consists of a little corn-puppet placed inside of a large one. This is called the Mother-sheaf. It is delivered to thefarmer’s wife, who unties it and gives drink-money in return.Sometimes the last sheaf is called, not the Corn-mother, but the Harvest-mother or theGreat Mother. In the province of Osnabrück, Hanover, it is called the Harvest-mother; it is"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"made up in female form, and then the reapers dance about with it. In some parts ofWestphalia the last sheaf at the rye-harvest is made especially heavy by fastening stones init. They bring it home on the last waggon and call it the Great Mother, though they do notfashion it into any special shape. In the district of Erfurt a very heavy sheaf, not necessarilythe last, is called the Great Mother, and is carried on the last waggon to the barn, where allhands lift it down amid a fire of jokes.Sometimes again the last sheaf is called the Grandmother, and is adorned with flowers,ribbons, and a woman’s apron. In East Prussia, at the rye or wheat harvest, the reaperscall out to the woman who binds the last sheaf, “You are getting the Old Grandmother.” Inthe neighbourhood of Magdeburg the men and women servants strive who shall get the lastsheaf, called the Grandmother. Whoever gets it will be married in the next year, but his orher spouse will be old; if a girl gets it, she will marry a widower; if a man gets it, he willmarry an old crone. In Silesia the Grandmother—a huge bundle made up of three or foursheaves by the person who tied the last sheaf—was formerly fashioned into a rude likenessof the human form. In the neighbourhood of Belfast the last sheaf sometimes goes by thename of the Granny. It is not cut in the usual way, but all the reapers throw their sickles atit and try to bring it down. It is plaited and kept till the (next?) autumn. Whoever gets itwill marry in the course of the year.Often the last sheaf is called the Old Woman or the Old Man. In Germany it is frequentlyshaped and dressed as a woman, and the person who cuts it or binds it is said to “get theOld Woman.” At Altisheim, in Swabia, when all the corn of a farm has been cut except asingle strip, all the reapers stand in a row before the strip; each cuts his share rapidly, andhe who gives the last cut “has the Old Woman.” When the sheaves are being set up inheaps, the person who gets hold of the Old Woman, which is the largest and thickest of allthe sheaves, is jeered at by the rest, who call out to him, “He has the Old Woman and mustkeep her.” The woman who binds the last sheaf is sometimes herself called the Old Woman,and it is said that she will be married in the next year. In Neusaass, West Prussia, both thelast sheaf—which is dressed up in jacket, hat, and ribbons—and the woman who binds itare called the Old Woman. Together they are brought home on the last waggon and aredrenched with water. In various parts of North Germany the last sheaf at harvest is madeup into a human effigy and called “the Old Man”; and the woman who bound it is said “tohave the Old Man.”In West Prussia, when the last rye is being raked together, the women and girls hurry withthe work, for none of them likes to be the last and to get “the Old Man,” that is, a puppetmade out of the last sheaf, which must be carried before the other reapers by the personwho was the last to finish. In Silesia the last sheaf is called the Old Woman or the Old Manand is the theme of many jests; it is made unusually large and is sometimes weighted with astone. Among the Wends the man or woman who binds the last sheaf at wheat harvest issaid to “have the Old Man.” A puppet is made out of the wheaten straw and ears in thelikeness of a man and decked with flowers. The person who bound the last sheaf must carrythe Old Man home, while the rest laugh and jeer at him. The puppet is hung up in thefarmhouse and remains till a new Old Man is made at the next harvest.In some of these customs, as Mannhardt has remarked, the person who is called by thesame name as the last sheaf and sits beside it on the last waggon is obviously identified with"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"it; he or she represents the corn-spirit which has been caught in the last sheaf; in otherwords, the corn-spirit is represented in duplicate, by a human being and by a sheaf. Theidentification of the person with the sheaf is made still clearer by the custom of wrappingup in the last sheaf the person who cuts or binds it. Thus at Hermsdorf in Silesia it used tobe the regular practice to tie up in the last sheaf the woman who had bound it. At Weiden,in Bavaria, it is the cutter, not the binder, of the last sheaf who is tied up in it. Here theperson wrapt up in the corn represents the corn-spirit, exactly as a person wrapt inbranches or leaves represents the tree-spirit.The last sheaf, designated as the Old Woman, is often distinguished from the other sheavesby its size and weight. Thus in some villages of West Prussia the Old Woman is made twiceas long and thick as a common sheaf, and a stone is fastened in the middle of it. Sometimesit is made so heavy that a man can barely lift it. At Alt-Pillau, in Samland, eight or ninesheaves are often tied together to make the Old Woman, and the man who sets it upgrumbles at its weight. At Itzgrund, in Saxe-Coburg, the last sheaf, called the Old Woman,is made large with the express intention of thereby securing a good crop next year. Thusthe custom of making the last sheaf unusually large or heavy is a charm, working bysympathetic magic, to ensure a large and heavy crop at the following harvest.In Scotland, when the last corn was cut after Hallowmas, the female figure made out of itwas sometimes called the Carlin or Carline, that is, the Old Woman. But if cut beforeHallowmas, it was called the Maiden; if cut after sunset, it was called the Witch, beingsupposed to bring bad luck. Among the Highlanders of Scotland the last corn cut at harvestis known either as the Old Wife (Cailleach) or as the Maiden; on the whole the formername seems to prevail in the western and the latter in the central and eastern districts. Ofthe Maiden we shall speak presently; here we are dealing with the Old Wife. The followinggeneral account of the custom is given by a careful and well-informed enquirer, the Rev. J.G. Campbell, minister of the remote Hebridean island of Tiree: “The Harvest Old Wife (aCailleach).—In harvest, there was a struggle to escape from being the last done with theshearing, and when tillage in common existed, instances were known of a ridge being leftunshorn (no person would claim it) because of it being behind the rest. The fear entertainedwas that of having the ‘famine of the farm’ (gort a bhaile), in the shape of an imaginary oldwoman (cailleach), to feed till next harvest. Much emulation and amusement arose fromthe fear of this old woman... . . The first done made a doll of some blades of corn, whichwas called the ‘old wife,’ and sent it to his nearest neighbour. He in turn, when ready,passed it to another still less expeditious, and the person it last remained with had ‘the oldwoman’ to keep for that year.”In the island of Islay the last corn cut goes by the name of the Old Wife (Cailleach), andwhen she has done her duty at harvest she is hung up on the wall and stays there till thetime comes to plough the fields for the next year’s crop. Then she is taken down, and on thefirst day when the men go to plough she is divided among them by the mistress of thehouse. They take her in their pockets and give her to the horses to eat when they reach thefield. This is supposed to secure good luck for the next harvest, and is understood to be theproper end of the Old Wife.Usages of the same sort are reported from Wales. Thus in North Pembrokeshire a tuft ofthe last corn cut, from six to twelve inches long, is plaited and goes by the name of the Hag"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"(wrach); and quaint old customs used to be practised with it within the memory of manypersons still alive. Great was the excitement among the reapers when the last patch ofstanding corn was reached. All in turn threw their sickles at it, and the one who succeededin cutting it received a jug of home-brewed ale. The Hag (wrach) was then hurriedly madeand taken to a neighbouring farm, where the reapers were still busy at their work. Thiswas generally done by the ploughman; but he had to be very careful not to be observed byhis neighbours, for if they saw him coming and had the least suspicion of his errand theywould soon make him retrace his steps. Creeping stealthily up behind a fence he waited tillthe foreman of his neighbour’s reapers was just opposite him and within easy reach. Thenhe suddenly threw the Hag over the fence and, if possible, upon the foreman’s sickle. Onthat he took to his heels and made off as fast as he could run, and he was a lucky man if heescaped without being caught or cut by the flying sickles which the infuriated reapershurled after him. In other cases the Hag was brought home to the farmhouse by one of thereapers. He did his best to bring it home dry and without being observed; but he was apt tobe roughly handled by the people of the house, if they suspected his errand. Sometimes theystripped him of most of his clothes, sometimes they would drench him with water whichhad been carefully stored in buckets and pans for the purpose. If, however, he succeeded inbringing the Hag in dry and unobserved, the master of the house had to pay him a smallfine; or sometimes a jug of beer “from the cask next to the wall,” which seems to havecommonly held the best beer, would be demanded by the bearer. The Hag was thencarefully hung on a nail in the hall or elsewhere and kept there all the year. The custom ofbringing in the Hag (wrach) into the house and hanging it up still exists in some farms ofNorth Pembrokeshire, but the ancient ceremonies which have just been described are nowdiscontinued.In County Antrim, down to some years ago, when the sickle was finally expelled by thereaping machine, the few stalks of corn left standing last on the field were plaited together;then the reapers, blindfolded, threw their sickles at the plaited corn, and whoeverhappened to cut it through took it home with him and put it over his door. This bunch ofcorn was called the Carley—probably the same word as Carlin.Similar customs are observed by Slavonic peoples. Thus in Poland the last sheaf iscommonly called the Baba, that is, the Old Woman. “In the last sheaf,” it is said, “sits theBaba.” The sheaf itself is also called the Baba, and is sometimes composed of twelve smallersheaves lashed together. In some parts of Bohemia the Baba, made out of the last sheaf, hasthe figure of a woman with a great straw hat. It is carried home on the last harvest-waggonand delivered, along with a garland, to the farmer by two girls. In binding the sheaves thewomen strive not to be last, for she who binds the last sheaf will have a child next year.Sometimes the harvesters call out to the woman who binds the last sheaf, “She has theBaba,” or “She is the Baba.” In the district of Cracow, when a man binds the last sheaf,they say, “The Grandfather is sitting in it”; when a woman binds it, they say, “The Baba issitting in it,” and the woman herself is wrapt up in the sheaf, so that only her head projectsout of it. Thus encased in the sheaf, she is carried on the last harvest-waggon to the house,where she is drenched with water by the whole family. She remains in the sheaf till thedance is over, and for a year she retains the name of Baba.In Lithuania the name for the last sheaf is Boba (Old Woman), answering to the Polish"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"name Baba. The Boba is said to sit in the corn which is left standing last. The person whobinds the last sheaf or digs the last potato is the subject of much banter, and receives andlong retains the name of the Old Rye-woman or the Old Potato-woman. The last sheaf—theBoba—is made into the form of a woman, carried solemnly through the village on the lastharvest-waggon, and drenched with water at the farmer’s house; then every one danceswith it.In Russia also the last sheaf is often shaped and dressed as a woman, and carried withdance and song to the farmhouse. Out of the last sheaf the Bulgarians make a doll whichthey call the Corn-queen or Corn-mother; it is dressed in a woman’s shirt, carried roundthe village, and then thrown into the river in order to secure plenty of rain and dew for thenext year’s crop. Or it is burned and the ashes strew on the fields, doubtless to fertilisethem. The name Queen, as applied to the last sheaf, has its analogies in Central andNorthern Europe. Thus, in the Salzburg district of Austria, at the end of the harvest a greatprocession takes place, in which a Queen of the Corn-ears (Ährenkönigin) is drawn along ina little carriage by young fellows. The custom of the Harvest Queen appears to have beencommon in England. Milton must have been familiar with it, for in Paradise Lost he says:“Adam the whileWaiting desirous her return, had woveOf choicest flow’rs a garland to adornHer tresses, and her rural labours crown,As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen.”Often customs of this sort are practised, not on the harvest-field but on the threshing-floor.The spirit of the corn, fleeing before the reapers as they cut down the ripe grain, quits thereaped corn and takes refuge in the barn, where it appears in the last sheaf threshed, eitherto perish under the blows of the flail or to flee thence to the still unthreshed corn of aneighbouring farm. Thus the last corn to be threshed is called the Mother-Corn or the OldWoman. Sometimes the person who gives the last stroke with the flail is called the OldWoman, and is wrapt in the straw of the last sheaf, or has a bundle of straw fastened on hisback. Whether wrapt in the straw or carrying it on his back, he is carted through thevillage amid general laughter. In some districts of Bavaria, Thüringen, and elsewhere, theman who threshes the last sheaf is said to have the Old Woman or the Old Corn-woman; heis tied up in straw, carried or carted about the village, and set down at last on the dunghill,or taken to the threshing-floor of a neighbouring farmer who has not finished histhreshing. In Poland the man who gives the last stroke at threshing is called Baba (OldWoman); he is wrapt in corn and wheeled through the village. Sometimes in Lithuania thelast sheaf is not threshed, but is fashioned into female shape and carried to the barn of aneighbour who has not finished his threshing.In some parts of Sweden, when a stranger woman appears on the threshing-floor, a flail isput round her body, stalks of corn are wound round her neck, a crown of ears is placed onher head, and the threshers call out, “Behold the Corn-woman.” Here the stranger woman,"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"thus suddenly appearing, is taken to be the corn-spirit who has just been expelled by theflails from the corn-stalks. In other cases the farmer’s wife represents the corn-spirit. Thusin the Commune of Saligné (Vendée), the farmer’s wife, along with the last sheaf, is tied upin a sheet, placed on a litter, and carried to the threshing machine, under which she isshoved. Then the woman is drawn out and the sheaf is threshed by itself, but the woman istossed in the sheet, as if she were being winnowed. It would be impossible to express moreclearly the identification of the woman with the corn than by this graphic imitation ofthreshing and winnowing her.In these customs the spirit of the ripe corn is regarded as old, or at least as of mature age.Hence the names of Mother, Grandmother, Old Woman, and so forth. But in other casesthe corn-spirit is conceived as young. Thus at Saldern, near Wolfenbuttel, when the rye hasbeen reaped, three sheaves are tied together with a rope so as to make a puppet with thecorn ears for a head. This puppet is called the Maiden or the Corn-maiden. Sometimes thecorn-spirit is conceived as a child who is separated from its mother by the stroke of thesickle. This last view appears in the Polish custom of calling out to the man who cuts thelast handful of corn, “You have cut the navel-string.” In some districts of West Prussia thefigure made out of the last sheaf is called the Bastard, and a boy is wrapt up in it. Thewoman who binds the last sheaf and represents the Corn-mother is told that she is about tobe brought to bed; she cries like a woman in travail, and an old woman in the character ofgrandmother acts as midwife. At last a cry is raised that the child is born; whereupon theboy who is tied up in the sheaf whimpers and squalls like an infant. The grandmotherwraps a sack, in imitation of swaddling bands, round the pretended baby, who is carriedjoyfully to the barn, lest he should catch cold in the open air. In other parts of NorthGermany the last sheaf, or the puppet made out of it, is called the Child, the Harvest-Child,and so on, and they call out to the woman who binds the last sheaf, “you are getting thechild.”In some parts of Scotland, as well as in the north of England, the last handful of corn cut onthe harvest-field was called the kirn, and the person who carried it off was said “to win thekirn.” It was then dressed up like a child’s doll and went by the name of the kirn-baby, thekirn-doll, or the Maiden. In Berwickshire down to about the middle of the nineteenthcentury there was an eager competition among the reapers to cut the last bunch of standingcorn. They gathered round it at a little distance and threw their sickles in turn at it, and theman who succeeded in cutting it through gave it to the girl he preferred. She made the cornso cut into a kirn-dolly and dressed it, and the doll was then taken to the farmhouse andhung up there till the next harvest, when its place was taken by the new kirn-dolly. AtSpottiswoode in Berwickshire the reaping of the last corn at harvest was called “cutting theQueen” almost as often as “cutting the kirn.” The mode of cutting it was not by throwingsickles. One of the reapers consented to be blindfolded, and having been given a sickle inhis hand and turned twice or thrice about by his fellows, he was bidden to go and cut thekirn. His groping about and making wild strokes in the air with his sickle excited muchhilarity. When he had tired himself out in vain and given up the task as hopeless, anotherreaper was blindfolded and pursued the quest, and so on, one after the other, till at last thekirn was cut. The successful reaper was tossed up in the air with three cheers by hisbrother harvesters. To decorate the room in which the kirn-supper was held atSpottiswoode as well as the granary, where the dancing took place, two women made kirn-"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"dollies or Queens every year; and many of these rustic effigies of the corn-spirit might beseen hanging up together.In some parts of the Highlands of Scotland the last handful of corn that is cut by thereapers on any particular farm is called the Maiden, or in Gaelic Maidhdeanbuain, literally,“the shorn Maiden.” Superstitions attach to the winning of the Maiden. If it is got by ayoung person, they think it an omen that he or she will be married before another harvest.For that or other reasons there is a strife between the reapers as to who shall get theMaiden, and they resort to various stratagems for the purpose of securing it. One of them,for example, will often leave a handful of corn uncut and cover it up with earth to hide itfrom the other reapers, till all the rest of the corn on the field is cut down. Several may tryto play the same trick, and the one who is coolest and holds out longest obtains the coveteddistinction. When it has been cut, the Maiden is dressed with ribbons into a sort of doll andaffixed to a wall of the farmhouse. In the north of Scotland the Maiden is carefullypreserved till Yule morning, when it is divided among the cattle “to make them thrive allthe year round.” In the neighbourhood of Balquhidder, Perthshire, the last handful of cornis cut by the youngest girl on the field, and is made into the rude form of a female doll, cladin a paper dress, and decked with ribbons. It is called the Maiden, and is kept in thefarmhouse, generally above the chimney, for a good while, sometimes till the Maiden of thenext year is brought in. The writer of this book witnessed the ceremony of cutting theMaiden at Balquhidder in September 1888. A lady friend informed me that as a young girlshe cut the Maiden several times at the request of the reapers in the neighbourhood ofPerth. The name of the Maiden was given to the last handful of standing corn; a reaperheld the top of the bunch while she cut it. Afterwards the bunch was plaited, decked withribbons, and hung up in a conspicuous place on the wall of the kitchen till the next Maidenwas brought in. The harvest-supper in this neighbourhood was also called the Maiden; thereapers danced at it.On some farms on the Gareloch, in Dumbartonshire, about the year 1830, the last handfulof standing corn was called the Maiden. It was divided in two, plaited, and then cut withthe sickle by a girl, who, it was thought, would be lucky and would soon be married. Whenit was cut the reapers gathered together and threw their sickles in the air. The Maiden wasdressed with ribbons and hung in the kitchen near the roof, where it was kept for severalyears with the date attached. Sometimes five or six Maidens might be seen hanging at onceon hooks. The harvest-supper was called the Kirn. In other farms on the Gareloch the lasthandful of corn was called the Maidenhead or the Head; it was neatly plaited, sometimesdecked with ribbons, and hung in the kitchen for a year, when the grain was given to thepoultry.In Aberdeenshire “the last sheaf cut, or ‘Maiden,’ is carried home in merry procession bythe harvesters. It is then presented to the mistress of the house, who dresses it up to bepreserved till the first mare foals. The Maiden is then taken down and presented to themare as its first food. The neglect of this would have untoward effects upon the foal, anddisastrous consequences upon farm operations generally for the season.” In the north-eastof Aberdeenshire the last sheaf is commonly called the clyack sheaf. It used to be cut by theyoungest girl present and was dressed as a woman. Being brought home in triumph, it waskept till Christmas morning, and then given to a mare in foal, if there was one on the farm,"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"or, if there was not, to the oldest cow in calf. Elsewhere the sheaf was divided between allthe cows and their calves or between all the horses and the cattle of the farm. In Fifeshirethe last handful of corn, known as the Maiden, is cut by a young girl and made into therude figure of a doll, tied with ribbons, by which it is hung on the wall of the farm-kitchentill the next spring. The custom of cutting the Maiden at harvest was also observed inInverness-shire and Sutherlandshire.A somewhat maturer but still youthful age is assigned to the corn-spirit by the appellationsof Bride, Oats-bride, and Wheat-bride, which in Germany are sometimes bestowed both onthe last sheaf and on the woman who binds it. At wheat-harvest near Müglitz, in Moravia,a small portion of the wheat is left standing after all the rest has been reaped. This remnantis then cut, amid the rejoicing of the reapers, by a young girl who wears a wreath ofwheaten ears on her head and goes by the name of the Wheat-bride. It is supposed that shewill be a real bride that same year. Near Roslin and Stonehaven, in Scotland, the lasthandful of corn cut “got the name of ‘the bride,’ and she was placed over the bress orchimney-piece; she had a ribbon tied below her numerous ears, and another round herwaist.”Sometimes the idea implied by the name of Bride is worked out more fully by representingthe productive powers of vegetation as bride and bridegroom. Thus in the Vorharz anOats-man and an Oats-woman, swathed in straw, dance at the harvest feast. In SouthSaxony an Oats-bridegroom and an Oats-bride figure together at the harvest celebration.The Oats-bridegroom is a man completely wrapt in oats-straw; the Oats-bride is a mandressed in woman’s clothes, but not wrapt in straw. They are drawn in a waggon to the ale-house, where the dance takes place. At the beginning of the dance the dancers pluck thebunches of oats one by one from the Oats-bridegroom, while he struggles to keep them, tillat last he is completely stript of them and stands bare, exposed to the laughter and jests ofthe company. In Austrian Silesia the ceremony of “the Wheat-bride” is celebrated by theyoung people at the end of the harvest. The woman who bound the last sheaf plays the partof the Wheat-bride, wearing the harvest-crown of wheat ears and flowers on her head.Thus adorned, standing beside her Bridegroom in a waggon and attended by bridesmaids,she is drawn by a pair of oxen, in full imitation of a marriage procession, to the tavern,where the dancing is kept up till morning. Somewhat later in the season the wedding of theOats-bride is celebrated with the like rustic pomp. About Neisse, in Silesia, an Oats-kingand an Oats-queen, dressed up quaintly as a bridal pair, are seated on a harrow and drawnby oxen into the village.In these last instances the corn-spirit is personified in double form as male and female. Butsometimes the spirit appears in a double female form as both old and young, correspondingexactly to the Greek Demeter and Persephone, if my interpretation of these goddesses isright. We have seen that in Scotland, especially among the Gaelic-speaking population, thelast corn cut is sometimes called the Old Wife and sometimes the Maiden. Now there areparts of Scotland in which both an Old Wife (Cailleach) and a Maiden are cut at harvest.The accounts of this custom are not quite clear and consistent, but the general rule seems tobe that, where both a Maiden and an Old Wife (Cailleach) are fashioned out of the reapedcorn at harvest, the Maiden is made out of the last stalks left standing, and is kept by thefarmer on whose land it was cut; while the Old Wife is made out of other stalks, sometimes"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"out of the first stalks cut, and is regularly passed on to a laggard farmer who happens to bestill reaping after his brisker neighbour has cut all his corn. Thus while each farmer keepshis own Maiden, as the embodiment of the young and fruitful spirit of the corn, he passeson the Old Wife as soon as he can to a neighbour, and so the old lady may make the roundof all the farms in the district before she finds a place in which to lay her venerable head.The farmer with whom she finally takes up her abode is of course the one who has been thelast of all the countryside to finish reaping his crops, and thus the distinction ofentertaining her is rather an invidious one. He is thought to be doomed to poverty or to beunder the obligation of “providing for the dearth of the township” in the ensuing season.Similarly we saw that in Pembrokeshire, where the last corn cut is called, not the Maiden,but the Hag, she is passed on hastily to a neighbour who is still at work in his fields andwho receives his aged visitor with anything but a transport of joy. If the Old Wiferepresents the corn-spirit of the past year, as she probably does wherever she is contrastedwith and opposed to a Maiden, it is natural enough that her faded charms should have lessattractions for the husbandman than the buxom form of her daughter, who may beexpected to become in her turn the mother of the golden grain when the revolving year hasbrought round another autumn. The same desire to get rid of the effete Mother of the Cornby palming her off on other people comes out clearly in some of the customs observed atthe close of threshing, particularly in the practice of passing on a hideous straw puppet to aneighbour farmer who is still threshing his corn.The harvest customs just described are strikingly analogous to the spring customs whichwe reviewed in an earlier part of this work. (1) As in the spring customs the tree-spirit isrepresented both by a tree and by a person, so in the harvest customs the corn-spirit isrepresented both by the last sheaf and by the person who cuts or binds or threshes it. Theequivalence of the person to the sheaf is shown by giving him or her the same name as thesheaf; by wrapping him or her in it; and by the rule observed in some places, that when thesheaf is called the Mother, it must be made up into human shape by the oldest marriedwoman, but that when it is called the Maiden, it must be cut by the youngest girl. Here theage of the personal representative of the corn-spirit corresponds with that of the supposedage of the corn-spirit, just as the human victims offered by the Mexicans to promote thegrowth of the maize varied with the age of the maize. For in the Mexican, as in theEuropean, custom the human beings were probably representatives of the corn-spiritrather than victims offered to it. (2) Again the same fertilising influence which the tree-spirit is supposed to exert over vegetation, cattle, and even women is ascribed to the corn-spirit. Thus, its supposed influence on vegetation is shown by the practice of taking some ofthe grain of the last sheaf (in which the corn-spirit is regularly supposed to be present), andscattering it among the young corn in spring or mixing it with the seed-corn. Its influenceon animals is shown by giving the last sheaf to a mare in foal, to a cow in calf, and to horsesat the first ploughing. Lastly, its influence on women is indicated by the custom ofdelivering the Mother-sheaf, made into the likeness of a pregnant woman, to the farmer’swife; by the belief that the woman who binds the last sheaf will have a child next year;perhaps, too, by the idea that the person who gets it will soon be married.Plainly, therefore, these spring and harvest customs are based on the same ancient modesof thought, and form parts of the same primitive heathendom, which was doubtlesspractised by our forefathers long before the dawn of history. Amongst the marks of a"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"primitive ritual we may note the following:1. No special class of persons is set apart for the performance of the rites; in other words,there are no priests. The rites may be performed by any one, as occasion demands.2. No special places are set apart for the performance of the rites; in other words, there areno temples. The rites may be performed anywhere, as occasion demands.3. Spirits, not gods, are recognised. (a) As distinguished from gods, spirits are restricted intheir operations to definite departments of nature. Their names are general, not proper.Their attributes are generic, rather than individual; in other words, there is an indefinitenumber of spirits of each class, and the individuals of a class are all much alike; they haveno definitely marked individuality; no accepted traditions are current as to their origin,life, adventures, and character. (b) On the other hand gods, as distinguished from spirits,are not restricted to definite departments of nature. It is true that there is generally someone department over which they preside as their special province; but they are notrigorously confined to it; they can exert their power for good or evil in many other spheresof nature and life. Again, they bear individual or proper names, such as Demeter,Persephone, Dionysus; and their individual characters and histories are fixed by currentmyths and the representations of art.4. The rites are magical rather than propitiatory. In other words, the desired objects areattained, not by propitiating the favour of divine beings through sacrifice, prayer, andpraise, but by ceremonies which, as I have already explained, are believed to influence thecourse of nature directly through a physical sympathy or resemblance between the rite andthe effect which it is the intention of the rite to produce.Judged by these tests, the spring and harvest customs of our European peasantry deserveto rank as primitive. For no special class of persons and no special places are set exclusivelyapart for their performance; they may be performed by any one, master or man, mistressor maid, boy or girl; they are practised, not in temples or churches, but in the woods andmeadows, beside brooks, in barns, on harvest fields and cottage floors. The supernaturalbeings whose existence is taken for granted in them are spirits rather than deities: theirfunctions are limited to certain well-defined departments of nature: their names aregeneral like the Barley-mother, the Old Woman, the Maiden, not proper names likeDemeter, Persephone, Dionysus. Their generic attributes are known, but their individualhistories and characters are not the subject of myths. For they exist in classes rather thanas individuals, and the members of each class are indistinguishable. For example, everyfarm has its Corn-mother, or its Old Woman, or its Maiden; but every Corn-mother ismuch like every other Corn-mother, and so with the Old Women and Maidens. Lastly, inthese harvests, as in the spring customs, the ritual is magical rather than propitiatory. Thisis shown by throwing the Corn-mother into the river in order to secure rain and dew forthe crops; by making the Old Woman heavy in order to get a heavy crop next year; bystrewing grain from the last sheaf amongst the young crops in spring; and by giving thelast sheaf to the cattle to make them thrive."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"XLVI. The Corn-Mother in Many Lands1. The Corn-mother in AmericaEUROPEAN peoples, ancient and modern, have not been singular in personifying the cornas a mother goddess. The same simple idea has suggested itself to other agricultural racesin distant parts of the world, and has been applied by them to other indigenous cereals thanbarley and wheat. If Europe has its Wheat-mother and its Barley-mother, America has itsMaize-mother and the East Indies their Rice-mother. These personifications I will nowillustrate, beginning with the American personification of the maize.We have seen that among European peoples it is a common custom to keep the plaitedcorn-stalks of the last sheaf, or the puppet which is formed out of them, in the farm-housefrom harvest to harvest. The intention no doubt is, or rather originally was, by preservingthe representative of the corn-spirit to maintain the spirit itself in life and activitythroughout the year, in order that the corn may grow and the crops be good. Thisinterpretation of the custom is at all events rendered highly probable by a similar customobserved by the ancient Peruvians, and thus described by the old Spanish historian Acosta:“They take a certain portion of the most fruitful of the maize that grows in their farms, thewhich they put in a certain granary which they do call Pirua, with certain ceremonies,watching three nights; they put this maize in the richest garments they have, and beingthus wrapped and dressed, they worship this Pirua, and hold it in great veneration, sayingit is the mother of the maize of their inheritances, and that by this means the maizeaugments and is preserved. In this month [the sixth month, answering to May] they make aparticular sacrifice, and the witches demand of this Pirua if it hath strength sufficient tocontinue until the next year; and if it answers no, then they carry this maize to the farm toburn, whence they brought it, according to every man’s power; then they make anotherPirua, with the same ceremonies, saying that they renew it, to the end the seed of maizemay not perish, and if it answers that it hath force sufficient to last longer, they leave ituntil the next year. This foolish vanity continueth to this day, and it is very commonamongst the Indians to have these Piruas.”In this description of the custom there seems to be some error. Probably it was the dressed-up bunch of maize, not the granary (Pirua), which was worshipped by the Peruvians andregarded as the Mother of the Maize. This is confirmed by what we know of the Peruviancustom from another source. The Peruvians, we are told, believed all useful plants to beanimated by a divine being who causes their growth. According to the particular plant,these divine beings were called the Maize-mother (Zara-mama), the Quinoa-mother(Quinoa-mama), the Coca-mother (Coca-mama), and the Potato-mother (Axo-mama).Figures of these divine mothers were made respectively of ears of maize and leaves of thequinoa and coca plants; they were dressed in women’s clothes and worshipped. Thus theMaize-mother was represented by a puppet made of stalks of maize dressed in full femaleattire; and the Indians believed that “as mother, it had the power of producing and givingbirth to much maize.” Probably, therefore, Acosta misunderstood his informant, and theMother of the Maize which he describes was not the granary (Pirua), but the bunch ofmaize dressed in rich vestments. The Peruvian Mother of the Maize, like the harvest-"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"Maiden at Balquhidder, was kept for a year in order that by her means the corn mightgrow and multiply. But lest her strength might not suffice to last till the next harvest, shewas asked in the course of the year how she felt, and if she answered that she felt weak, shewas burned and a fresh Mother of the Maize made, “to the end the seed of maize may notperish.” Here, it may be observed, we have a strong confirmation of the explanationalready given of the custom of killing the god, both periodically and occasionally. TheMother of the maize was allowed, as a rule, to live through a year, that being the periodduring which her strength might reasonably be supposed to last unimpaired; but on anysymptom of her strength failing she was put to death, and a fresh and vigorous Mother ofthe Maize took her place, lest the maize which depended on her for its existence shouldlanguish and decay.2. The Rice-mother in the East IndiesIF THE READER still feels any doubts as to the meaning of the harvest customs whichhave been practised within living memory by European peasants, these doubts mayperhaps be dispelled by comparing the customs observed at the rice-harvest by the Malaysand Dyaks of the East Indies. For these Eastern peoples have not, like our peasantry,advanced beyond the intellectual stage at which the customs originated; their theory andtheir practice are still in unison; for them the quaint rites which in Europe have longdwindled into mere fossils, the pastime of clowns and the puzzle of the learned, are stillliving realities of which they can render an intelligible and truthful account. Hence a studyof their beliefs and usages concerning the rice may throw some light on the true meaning ofthe ritual of the corn in ancient Greece and modern Europe.Now the whole of the ritual which the Malays and Dyaks observe in connexion with the riceis founded on the simple conception of the rice as animated by a soul like that which thesepeople attribute to mankind. They explain the phenomena of reproduction, growth, decay,and death in the rice on the same principles on which they explain the correspondingphenomena in human beings. They imagine that in the fibres of the plant, as in the body ofa man, there is a certain vital element, which is so far independent of the plant that it mayfor a time be completely separated from it without fatal effects, though if its absence beprolonged beyond certain limits the plant will wither and die. This vital yet separableelement is what, for the want of a better word, we must call the soul of a plant, just as asimilar vital and separable element is commonly supposed to constitute the soul of man;and on this theory or myth of the plant-soul is built the whole worship of the cereals, just ason the theory or myth of the human soul is built the whole worship of the dead,—atowering superstructure reared on a slender and precarious foundation.Believing the rice to be animated by a soul like that of a man, the Indonesians naturallytreat it with the deference and the consideration which they show to their fellows. Thusthey behave towards the rice in bloom as they behave towards a pregnant woman; theyabstain from firing guns or making loud noises in the field, lest they should so frighten thesoul of the rice that it would miscarry and bear no grain; and for the same reason they willnot talk of corpses or demons in the rice-fields. Moreover, they feed the blooming rice withfoods of various kinds which are believed to be wholesome for women with child; but when"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"the rice-ears are just beginning to form, they are looked upon as infants, and women gothrough the fields feeding them with rice-pap as if they were human babes. In such naturaland obvious comparisons of the breeding plant to a breeding woman, and of the younggrain to a young child, is to be sought the origin of the kindred Greek conception of theCorn-mother and the Corn-daughter, Demeter and Persephone. But if the timorousfeminine soul of the rice can be frightened into a miscarriage even by loud noises, it is easyto imagine what her feelings must be at harvest, when people are under the sad necessity ofcutting down the rice with the knife. At so critical a season every precaution must be usedto render the necessary surgical operation of reaping as inconspicuous and as painless aspossible. For that reason the reaping of the seed-rice is done with knives of a peculiarpattern, such that the blades are hidden in the reapers’ hands and do not frighten the rice-spirit till the very last moment, when her head is swept off almost before she is aware; andfrom a like delicate motive the reapers at work in the fields employ a special form ofspeech, which the rice-spirit cannot be expected to understand, so that she has no warningor inkling of what is going forward till the heads of rice are safely deposited in the basket.Among the Indonesian peoples who thus personify the rice we may take the Kayans orBahaus of Central Borneo as typical. In order to secure and detain the volatile soul of therice the Kayans resort to a number of devices. Among the instruments employed for thispurpose are a miniature ladder, a spatula, and a basket containing hooks, thorns, andcords. With the spatula the priestess strokes the soul of the rice down the little ladder intothe basket, where it is naturally held fast by the hooks, the thorn, and the cord; and havingthus captured and imprisoned the soul she conveys it into the rice-granary. Sometimes abamboo box and a net are used for the same purpose. And in order to ensure a goodharvest for the following year it is necessary not only to detain the soul of all the grains ofrice which are safely stored in the granary, but also to attract and recover the soul of all therice that has been lost through falling to the earth or being eaten by deer, apes, and pigs.For this purpose instruments of various sorts have been invented by the priests. One, forexample, is a bamboo vessel provided with four hooks made from the wood of a fruit-tree,by means of which the absent rice-soul may be hooked and drawn back into the vessel,which is then hung up in the house. Sometimes two hands carved out of the wood of a fruit-tree are used for the same purpose. And every time that a Kayan housewife fetches ricefrom the granary for the use of her household, she must propitiate the souls of the rice inthe granary, lest they should be angry at being robbed of their substance.The same need of securing the soul of the rice, if the crop is to thrive, is keenly felt by theKarens of Burma. When a rice-field does not flourish, they suppose that the soul (kelah) ofthe rice is in some way detained from the rice. If the soul cannot be called back, the cropwill fail. The following formula is used in recalling the kelah (soul) of the rice: “O come,rice-kelah, come! Come to the field. Come to the rice. With seed of each gender, come.Come from the river Kho, come from the river Kaw; from the place where they meet,come. Come from the West, come from the East.

From the distant kingdomscome. From all granaries come. O rice-kelah, come to the rice.”The Corn-mother of our European peasants has her match in the Rice-mother of the"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Minangkabauers of Sumatra. The Minangkabauers definitely attribute a soul to rice, andwill sometimes assert that rice pounded in the usual way tastes better than rice ground in amill, because in the mill the body of the rice was so bruised and battered that the soul hasfled from it. Like the Javanese they think that the rice is under the special guardianship ofa female spirit called Saning Sari, who is conceived as so closely knit up with the plant thatthe rice often goes by her name, as with the Romans the corn might be called Ceres. Inparticular Saning Sari is represented by certain stalks or grains called indoea padi, that is,literally, “Mother of Rice,” a name that is often given to the guardian spirit herself. Thisso-called Mother of Rice is the occasion of a number of ceremonies observed at the plantingand harvesting of the rice as well as during its preservation in the barn. When the seed ofthe rice is about to be sown in the nursery or bedding-out ground, where under the wetsystem of cultivation it is regularly allowed to sprout before being transplanted to thefields, the best grains are picked out to form the Rice-mother. These are then sown in themiddle of the bed, and the common seed is planted round about them. The state of theRice-mother is supposed to exert the greatest influence on the growth of the rice; if shedroops or pines away, the harvest will be bad in consequence. The woman who sows theRice-mother in the nursery lets her hair hang loose and afterwards bathes, as a means ofensuring an abundant harvest. When the time comes to transplant the rice from thenursery to the field, the Rice-mother receives a special place either in the middle or in acorner of the field, and a prayer or charm is uttered as follows: “Saning Sari, may ameasure of rice come from a stalk of rice and a basketful from a root; may you befrightened neither by lightning nor by passers-by! Sunshine make you glad; with the stormmay you be at peace; and may rain serve to wash your face!” While the rice is growing, theparticular plant which was thus treated as the Rice-mother is lost sight of; but beforeharvest another Rice-mother is found. When the crop is ripe for cutting, the oldest womanof the family or a sorcerer goes out to look for her. The first stalks seen to bend under apassing breeze are the Rice-mother, and they are tied together but not cut until the first-fruits of the field have been carried home to serve as a festal meal for the family and theirfriends, nay even for the domestic animals; since it is Saning Sari’s pleasure that the beastsalso should partake of her good gifts. After the meal has been eaten, the Rice-mother isfetched home by persons in gay attire, who carry her very carefully under an umbrella in aneatly worked bag to the barn, where a place in the middle is assigned to her. Every onebelieves that she takes care of the rice in the barn and even multiplies it not uncommonly.When the Tomori of Central Celebes are about to plant the rice, they bury in the field somebetel as an offering to the spirits who cause the rice to grow. The rice that is planted roundthis spot is the last to be reaped at harvest. At the commencement of the reaping the stalksof this patch of rice are tied together into a sheaf, which is called “the Mother of the Rice”(ineno pae), and offerings in the shape of rice, fowl’s liver, eggs, and other things are laiddown before it. When all the rest of the rice in the field has been reaped, “the Mother of theRice” is cut down and carried with due honour to the rice-barn, where it is laid on thefloor, and all the other sheaves are piled upon it. The Tomori, we are told, regard theMother of the Rice as a special offering made to the rice-spirit Omonga, who dwells in themoon. If that spirit is not treated with proper respect, for example if the people who fetchrice from the barn are not decently clad, he is angry and punishes the offenders by eatingup twice as much rice in the barn as they have taken out of it; some people have heard himsmacking his lips in the barn, as he devoured the rice. On the other hand the Toradjas of"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"Central Celebes, who also practice the custom of the Rice-mother at harvest, regard her asthe actual mother of the whole harvest, and therefore keep her carefully, lest in her absencethe garnered store of rice should all melt away and disappear.Again, just as in Scotland the old and the young spirit of the corn are represented as an OldWife (Cailleach) and a Maiden respectively, so in the Malay Peninsula we find both theRice-mother and her child represented by different sheaves or bundles of ears on theharvest-field. The ceremony of cutting and bringing home the Soul of the Rice waswitnessed by Mr. W. W. Skeat at Chodoi in Selangor on the twenty-eighth of January 1897.The particular bunch or sheaf which was to serve as the Mother of the Rice-soul hadpreviously been sought and identified by means of the markings or shape of the ears. Fromthis sheaf an aged sorceress, with much solemnity, cut a little bundle of seven ears, anointedthem with oil, tied them round with parti-coloured thread, fumigated them with incense,and having wrapt them in a white cloth deposited them in a little oval-shaped basket. Theseseven ears were the infant Soul of the Rice and the little basket was its cradle. It wascarried home to the farmer’s house by another woman, who held up an umbrella to screenthe tender infant from the hot rays of the sun. Arrived at the house the Rice-child waswelcomed by the women of the family, and laid, cradle and all, on a new sleepingmat withpillows at the head. After that the farmer’s wife was instructed to observe certain rules oftaboo for three days, the rules being in many respects identical with those which have to beobserved for three days after the birth of a real child. Something of the same tender carewhich is thus bestowed on the newly-born Rice-child is naturally extended also to itsparent, the sheaf from whose body it was taken. This sheaf, which remains standing in thefield after the Rice-soul has been carried home and put to bed, is treated as a newly-mademother; that is to say, young shoots of trees are pounded together and scattered broadcastevery evening for three successive days, and when the three days are up you take the pulpof a coco-nut and what are called “goat-flowers,” mix them up, eat them with a little sugar,and spit some of the mixture out among the rice. So after a real birth the young shoots ofthe jack-fruit, the rose-apple, certain kinds of banana, and the thin pulp of young coco-nutsare mixed with dried fish, salt, acid, prawn-condiment, and the like dainties to form a sortof salad, which is administered to mother and child for three successive days. The last sheafis reaped by the farmer’s wife, who carries it back to the house, where it is threshed andmixed with the Rice-soul. The farmer then takes the Rice-soul and its basket and depositsit, together with the product of the last sheaf, in the big circular rice-bin used by theMalays. Some grains from the Rice-soul are mixed with the seed which is to be sown in thefollowing year. In this Rice-mother and Rice-child of the Malay Peninsula we may see thecounterpart and in a sense the prototype of the Demeter and Persephone of ancient Greece.Once more, the European custom of representing the corn-spirit in the double form ofbride and bridegroom has its parallel in a ceremony observed at the rice-harvest in Java.Before the reapers begin to cut the rice, the priest or sorcerer picks out a number of ears ofrice, which are tied together, smeared with ointment, and adorned with flowers. Thusdecked out, the ears are called the padi-peĕngantèn, that is, the Rice-bride and the Rice-bridegroom; their wedding feast is celebrated, and the cutting of the rice beginsimmediately afterwards. Later on, when the rice is being got in, a bridal chamber ispartitioned off in the barn, and furnished with a new mat, a lamp, and all kinds of toiletarticles. Sheaves of rice, to represent the wedding guests, are placed beside the Rice-bride"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"and the Rice-bridegroom. Not till this has been done may the whole harvest be housed inthe barn. And for the first forty days after the rice has been housed, no one may enter thebarn, for fear of disturbing the newly-wedded pair.In the islands of Bali and Lombok, when the time of harvest has come, the owner of thefield himself makes a beginning by cutting “the principal rice” with his own hands andbinding it into two sheaves, each composed of one hundred and eight stalks with theirleaves attached to them. One of the sheaves represents a man and the other a woman, andthey are called “husband and wife.” The male sheaf is wound about with thread so thatnone of the leaves are visible, whereas the female sheaf has its leaves bent over and tied soas to resemble the roll of a woman’s hair. Sometimes, for further distinction, a necklace ofrice-straw is tied round the female sheaf. When the rice is brought home from the field, thetwo sheaves representing the husband and wife are carried by a woman on her head, andare the last of all to be deposited in the barn. There they are laid to rest on a small erectionor on a cushion of rice-straw. The whole arrangement, we are informed, has for its objectto induce the rice to increase and multiply in the granary, so that the owner may get moreout of it than he put in. Hence when the people of Bali bring the two sheaves, the husbandand wife, into the barn, they say, “Increase ye and multiply without ceasing.” When all therice in the barn has been used up, the two sheaves representing the husband and wiferemain in the empty building till they have gradually disappeared or been devoured bymice. The pinch of hunger sometimes drives individuals to eat up the rice of these twosheaves, but the wretches who do so are viewed with disgust by their fellows and brandedas pigs and dogs. Nobody would ever sell these holy sheaves with the rest of their profanebrethren.The same notion of the propagation of the rice by a male and female power findsexpression amongst the Szis of Upper Burma. When the paddy, that is, the rice with thehusks still on it, has been dried and piled in a heap for threshing, all the friends of thehousehold are invited to the threshing-floor, and food and drink are brought out. The heapof paddy is divided and one half spread out for threshing, while the other half is left piledup. On the pile food and spirits are set, and one of the elders, addressing “the father andmother of the paddy-plant,” prays for plenteous harvests in future, and begs that the seedmay bear many fold. Then the whole party eat, drink, and make merry. This ceremony atthe threshing-floor is the only occasion when these people invoke “the father and mother ofthe paddy.”3. The Spirit of the Corn embodied in Human BeingsTHUS the theory which recognises in the European Corn-mother, Corn-maiden, and soforth, the embodiment in vegetable form of the animating spirit of the crops is amplyconfirmed by the evidence of peoples in other parts of the world, who, because they havelagged behind the European races in mental development, retain for that very reason akeener sense of the original motives for observing those rustic rites which among ourselveshave sunk to the level of meaningless survivals. The reader may, however, remember thataccording to Mannhardt, whose theory I am expounding, the spirit of the corn manifestsitself not merely in vegetable but also in human form; the person who cuts the last sheaf or"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"gives the last stroke at threshing passes for a temporary embodiment of the corn-spirit, justas much as the bunch of corn which he reaps or threshes. Now in the parallels which havebeen hitherto adduced from the customs of peoples outside Europe the spirit of the cropsappears only in vegetable form. It remains, therefore, to prove that other races besides ourEuropean peasantry have conceived the spirit of the crops as incorporate in or representedby living men and women. Such a proof, I may remind the reader, is germane to the themeof this book; for the more instances we discover of human beings representing inthemselves the life or animating spirit of plants, the less difficulty will be felt at classingamongst them the King of the Wood at Nemi.The Mandans and Minnitarees of North America used to hold a festival in spring whichthey called the corn-medicine festival of the women. They thought that a certain OldWoman who Never Dies made the crops to grow, and that, living somewhere in the south,she sent the migratory waterfowl in spring as her tokens and representatives. Each sort ofbird represented a special kind of crop cultivated by the Indians: the wild goose stood forthe maize, the wild swan for the gourds, and the wild duck for the beans. So when thefeathered messengers of the Old Woman began to arrive in spring the Indians celebratedthe corn-medicine festival of the women. Scaffolds were set up, on which the people hungdried meat and other things by way of offerings to the Old Woman; and on a certain daythe old women of the tribe, as representatives of the Old Woman who Never Dies,assembled at the scaffolds each bearing in her hand an ear of maize fastened to a stick.They first planted these sticks in the ground, then danced round the scaffolds, and finallytook up the sticks again in their arms. Meanwhile old men beat drums and shook rattles asa musical accompaniment to the performance of the old women. Further, young womencame and put dried flesh into the mouths of the old women, for which they received inreturn a grain of the consecrated maize to eat. Three or four grains of the holy corn werealso placed in the dishes of the young women, to be afterwards carefully mixed with theseed-corn, which they were supposed to fertilise. The dried flesh hung on the scaffoldbelonged to the old women, because they represented the Old Woman who Never Dies. Asimilar corn-medicine festival was held in autumn for the purpose of attracting the herds ofbuffaloes and securing a supply of meat. At that time every woman carried in her arms anuprooted plant of maize. They gave the name of the Old Woman who Never Dies both tothe maize and to those birds which they regarded as symbols of the fruits of the earth, andthey prayed to them in autumn saying, “Mother, have pity on us! send us not the bitter coldtoo soon, lest we have not meat enough! let not all the game depart, that we may havesomething for the winter!” In autumn, when the birds were flying south, the Indiansthought that they were going home to the Old Woman and taking to her the offerings thathad been hung up on the scaffolds, especially the dried meat, which she ate. Here then wehave the spirit or divinity of the corn conceived as an Old Woman and represented inbodily form by old women, who in their capacity of representatives receive some at least ofthe offerings which are intended for her.In some parts of India the harvest-goddess Gauri is represented at once by an unmarriedgirl and by a bundle of wild balsam plants, which is made up into the figure of a womanand dressed as such with mask, garments, and ornaments. Both the human and thevegetable representative of the goddess are worshipped, and the intention of the wholeceremony appears to be to ensure a good crop of rice."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"4. The Double Personification of the Corn as Mother and DaughterCOMPARED with the Corn-mother of Germany and the Harvest-maiden of Scotland, theDemeter and Persephone of Greece are late products of religious growth. Yet as membersof the Aryan family the Greeks must at one time or another have observed harvest customslike those which are still practised by Celts, Teutons, and Slavs, and which, far beyond thelimits of the Aryan world, have been practised by the Indians of Peru and many peoples ofthe East Indies—a sufficient proof that the ideas on which these customs rest are notconfined to any one race, but naturally suggest themselves to all untutored peoples engagedin agriculture. It is probable, therefore, that Demeter and Persephone, those stately andbeautiful figures of Greek mythology, grew out of the same simple beliefs and practiceswhich still prevail among our modern peasantry, and that they were represented by rudedolls made out of the yellow sheaves on many a harvest-field long before their breathingimages were wrought in bronze and marble by the master hands of Phidias and Praxiteles.A reminiscence of that olden time—a scent, so to say, of the harvest-field—lingered to thelast in the title of the Maiden (Kore) by which Persephone was commonly known. Thus ifthe prototype of Demeter is the Corn-mother of Germany, the prototype of Persephone isthe Harvest-maiden which, autumn after autumn, is still made from the last sheaf on theBraes of Balquhidder. Indeed, if we knew more about the peasant-farmers of ancientGreece, we should probably find that even in classical times they continued annually tofashion their Corn-mothers (Demeters) and Maidens (Persephones) out of the ripe corn onthe harvest-fields. But unfortunately the Demeter and Persephone whom we know were thedenizens of towns, the majestic inhabitants of lordly temples; it was for such divinitiesalone that the refined writers of antiquity had eyes; the uncouth rites performed by rusticsamongst the corn were beneath their notice. Even if they noticed them, they probably neverdreamed of any connexion between the puppet of corn-stalks on the sunny stubble-fieldand the marble divinity in the shady coolness of the temple. Still the writings even of thesetown-bred and cultured persons afford us an occasional glimpse of a Demeter as rude asthe rudest that a remote German village can show. Thus the story that Iasion begat a childPlutus ( “wealth,” “abundance”) by Demeter on a thrice-ploughed field, may be comparedwith the West Prussian custom of the mock birth of a child on the harvest-field. In thisPrussian custom the pretended mother represents the Corn-mother (Žytniamatka); thepretended child represents the Corn-baby, and the whole ceremony is a charm to ensure acrop next year. The custom and the legend alike point to an older practice of performing,among the sprouting crops in spring or the stubble in autumn, one of those real or mimicacts of procreation by which, as we have seen, primitive man often seeks to infuse his ownvigorous life into the languid or decaying energies of nature. Another glimpse of the savageunder the civilised Demeter will be afforded farther on, when we come to deal with anotheraspect of those agricultural divinities.The reader may have observed that in modern folk-customs the corn-spirit is generallyrepresented either by a Corn-mother (Old Woman, etc.) or by a Maiden (Harvest-child,etc.), not both by a Corn-mother and by a Maiden. Why then did the Greeks represent thecorn both as a mother and a daughter?In the Breton custom the mother-sheaf—a large figure made out of the last sheaf with asmall corn-doll inside of it—clearly represents both the Corn-mother and the Corn-"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"daughter, the latter still unborn. Again, in the Prussian custom just referred to, the womanwho plays the part of Corn-mother represents the ripe grain; the child appears to representnext year’s corn, which may be regarded, naturally enough, as the child of this year’s corn,since it is from the seed of this year’s harvest that next year’s crop will spring. Further, wehave seen that among the Malays of the Peninsula and sometimes among the Highlandersof Scotland the spirit of the grain is represented in double female form, both as old andyoung, by means of ears taken alike from the ripe crop: in Scotland the old spirit of thecorn appears as the Carline or Cailleach, the young spirit as the Maiden; while among theMalays of the Peninsula the two spirits of the rice are definitely related to each other asmother and child. Judged by these analogies Demeter would be the ripe crop of this year;Persephone would be the seed-corn taken from it and sown in autumn, to reappear inspring. The descent of Persephone into the lower world would thus be a mythicalexpression for the sowing of the seed; her reappearance in spring would signify thesprouting of the young corn. In this way the Persephone of one year becomes the Demeterof the next, and this may very well have been the original form of the myth. But when withthe advance of religious thought the corn came to be personified no longer as a being thatwent through the whole cycle of birth, growth, reproduction, and death within a year, butas an immortal goddess, consistency required that one of the two personifications, themother or the daughter, should be sacrificed. However, the double conception of the cornas mother and daughter may have been too old and too deeply rooted in the popular mindto be eradicated by logic, and so room had to be found in the reformed myth both formother and daughter. This was done by assigning to Persephone the character of the cornsown in autumn and sprouting in spring, while Demeter was left to play the somewhatvague part of the heavy mother of the corn, who laments its annual disappearanceunderground, and rejoices over its reappearance in spring. Thus instead of a regularsuccession of divine beings, each living a year and then giving birth to her successor, thereformed myth exhibits the conception of two divine and immortal beings, one of whomannually disappears into and reappears from the ground, while the other has little to dobut to weep and rejoice at the appropriate seasons.This theory of the double personification of the corn in Greek myth assumes that bothpersonifications (Demeter and Persephone) are original. But if we suppose that the Greekmyth started with a single personification, the aftergrowth of a second personification mayperhaps be explained as follows. On looking over the harvest customs which have beenpassed under review, it may be noticed that they involve two distinct conceptions of thecorn-spirit. For whereas in some of the customs the corn-spirit is treated as immanent inthe corn, in others it is regarded as external to it. Thus when a particular sheaf is called bythe name of the corn-spirit, and is dressed in clothes and handled with reverence, the spiritis clearly regarded as immanent in the corn. But when the spirit is said to make the cropsgrow by passing through them, or to blight the grain of those against whom she has agrudge, she is apparently conceived as distinct from, though exercising power over, thecorn. Conceived in the latter mode the corn-spirit is in a fair way to become a deity of thecorn, if she has not become so already. Of these two conceptions, that of the cornspirit asimmanent in the corn is doubtless the older, since the view of nature as animated byindwelling spirits appears to have generally preceded the view of it as controlled byexternal deities; to put it shortly, animism precedes deism. In the harvest customs of ourEuropean peasantry the corn-spirit seems to be conceived now as immanent in the corn"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"and now as external to it. In Greek mythology, on the other hand, Demeter is viewed ratheras the deity of the corn than as the spirit immanent in it. The process of thought whichleads to the change from the one mode of conception to the other is anthropomorphism, orthe gradual investment of the immanent spirits with more and more of the attributes ofhumanity. As men emerge from savagery the tendency to humanise their divinities gainsstrength; and the more human these become the wider is the breach which severs themfrom the natural objects of which they were at first merely the animating spirits or souls.But in the progress upwards from savagery men of the same generation do not marchabreast; and though the new anthropomorphic gods may satisfy the religious wants of themore developed intelligences, the backward members of the community will cling bypreference to the old animistic notions. Now when the spirit of any natural object such asthe corn has been invested with human qualities, detached from the object, and convertedinto a deity controlling it, the object itself is, by the withdrawal of its spirit, left inanimate;it becomes, so to say, a spiritual vacuum. But the popular fancy, intolerant of such avacuum, in other words, unable to conceive anything as inanimate, immediately creates afresh mythical being, with which it peoples the vacant object. Thus the same natural objectcomes to be represented in mythology by two distinct beings: first by the old spirit nowseparated from it and raised to the rank of a deity; second, by the new spirit, freshlycreated by the popular fancy to supply the place vacated by the old spirit on its elevation toa higher sphere. In such cases the problem for mythology is, having got two distinctpersonifications of the same object, what to do with them? How are their relations to eachother to be adjusted, and room found for both in the mythological system? When the oldspirit or new deity is conceived as creating or producing the object in question, the problemis easily solved. Since the object is believed to be produced by the old spirit, and animatedby the new one, the latter, as the soul of the object, must also owe its existence to theformer; thus the old spirit will stand to the new one as producer to produced, that is, inmythology, as parent to child, and if both spirits are conceived as female, their relation willbe that of mother and daughter. In this way, starting from a single personification of thecorn as female, mythic fancy might in time reach a double personification of it as motherand daughter. It would be very rash to affirm that this was the way in which the myth ofDemeter and Persephone actually took shape; but it seems a legitimate conjecture that thereduplication of deities, of which Demeter and Persephone furnish an example, maysometimes have arisen in the way indicated. For example, among the pairs of deities dealtwith in a former part of this work, it has been shown that there are grounds for regardingboth Isis and her companion god Osiris as personifications of the corn. On the hypothesisjust suggested, Isis would be the old corn-spirit, and Osiris would be the newer one, whoserelationship to the old spirit was variously explained as that of brother, husband, and son;for of course mythology would always be free to account for the coexistence of the twodivinities in more ways than one. It must not, however, be forgotten that this proposedexplanation of such pairs of deities as Demeter and Persephone or Isis and Osiris is purelyconjectural, and is only given for what it is worth.XLVII. Lityerses"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"1. Songs of the Corn ReapersIN THE PRECEDING pages an attempt has been made to show that in the Corn-motherand Harvest-maiden of Northern Europe we have the prototypes of Demeter andPersephone. But an essential feature is still wanting to complete the resemblance. A leadingincident in the Greek myth is the death and resurrection of Persephone; it is this incidentwhich, coupled with the nature of the goddess as a deity of vegetation, links the myth withthe cults of Adonis, Attis, Osiris, and Dionysus; and it is in virtue of this incident that themyth finds a place in our discussion of the Dying God. It remains, therefore, to see whetherthe conception of the annual death and resurrection of a god, which figures so prominentlyin these great Greek and Oriental worships, has not also its origin or its analogy in therustic rites observed by reapers and vine-dressers amongst the corn-shocks and the vines.Our general ignorance of the popular superstitions and customs of the ancients has alreadybeen confessed. But the obscurity which thus hangs over the first beginnings of ancientreligion is fortunately dissipated to some extent in the present case. The worships of Osiris,Adonis, and Attis had their respective seats, as we have seen, in Egypt, Syria, and Phrygia;and in each of these countries certain harvest and vintage customs are known to have beenobserved, the resemblance of which to each other and to the national rites struck theancients themselves, and, compared with the harvest customs of modern peasants andbarbarians, seems to throw some light on the origin of the rites in question.It has been already mentioned, on the authority of Diodorus, that in ancient Egypt thereapers were wont to lament over the first sheaf cut, invoking Isis as the goddess to whomthey owed the discovery of corn. To the plaintive song or cry sung or uttered by Egyptianreapers the Greeks gave the name of Maneros, and explained the name by a story thatManeros, the only son of the first Egyptian king, invented agriculture, and, dying anuntimely death, was thus lamented by the people. It appears, however, that the nameManeros is due to a misunderstanding of the formula maa-ne-hra, “Come to the house,”which has been discovered in various Egyptian writings, for example in the dirge of Isis inthe Book of the Dead. Hence we may suppose that the cry maa-ne-hra was chanted by thereapers over the cut corn as a dirge for the death of the corn-spirit (Isis or Osiris) and aprayer for its return. As the cry was raised over the first ears reaped, it would seem thatthe corn-spirit was believed by the Egyptians to be present in the first corn cut and to dieunder the sickle. We have seen that in the Malay Peninsula and Java the first ears of riceare taken to represent either the Soul of the Rice or the Rice-bride and the Rice-bridegroom. In parts of Russia the first sheaf is treated much in the same way that the lastsheaf is treated elsewhere. It is reaped by the mistress herself, taken home and set in theplace of honour near the holy pictures; afterwards it is threshed separately, and some of itsgrain is mixed with the next year’s seed-corn. In Aberdeenshire, while the last corn cut wasgenerally used to make the clyack sheaf, it was sometimes, though rarely, the first corn cutthat was dressed up as a woman and carried home with ceremony.In Phoenicia and Western Asia a plaintive song, like that chanted by the Egyptian corn-reapers, was sung at the vintage and probably (to judge by analogy) also at harvest. ThisPhoenician song was called by the Greeks Linus or Ailinus and explained, like Maneros, asa lament for the death of a youth named Linus. According to one story Linus was broughtup by a shepherd, but torn to pieces by his dogs. But, like Maneros, the name Linus or"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"Ailinus appears to have originated in a verbal misunderstanding, and to be nothing morethan the cry ai lanu, that is “Woe to us,” which the Phoenicians probably uttered inmourning for Adonis; at least Sappho seems to have regarded Adonis and Linus asequivalent.In Bithynia a like mournful ditty, called Bormus or Borimus, was chanted byMariandynian reapers. Bormus was said to have been a handsome youth, the son of KingUpias or of a wealthy and distinguished man. One summer day, watching the reapers atwork in his fields, he went to fetch them a drink of water and was never heard of more. Sothe reapers sought for him, calling him in plaintive strains, which they continued to chantat harvest ever afterwards.2. Killing the Corn-spiritIN PHRYGIA the corresponding song, sung by harvesters both at reaping and atthreshing, was called Lityerses. According to one story, Lityerses was a bastard son ofMidas, King of Phrygia, and dwelt at Celaenae. He used to reap the corn, and had anenormous appetite. When a stranger happened to enter the corn-field or to pass by it,Lityerses gave him plenty to eat and drink, then took him to the corn-fields on the banks ofthe Maeander and compelled him to reap along with him. Lastly, it was his custom to wrapthe stranger in a sheaf, cut off his head with a sickle, and carry away his body, swathed inthe corn-stalks. But at last Hercules undertook to reap with him, cut off his head with thesickle, and threw his body into the river. As Hercules is reported to have slain Lityerses inthe same way that Lityerses slew others, we may infer that Lityerses used to throw thebodies of his victims into the river. According to another version of the story, Lityerses, ason of Midas, was wont to challenge people to a reaping match with him, and if hevanquished them he used to thrash them; but one day he met with a stronger reaper, whoslew him.There are some grounds for supposing that in these stories of Lityerses we have thedescription of a Phrygian harvest custom in accordance with which certain persons,especially strangers passing the harvest field, were regularly regarded as embodiments ofthe corn-spirit, and as such were seized by the reapers, wrapt in sheaves, and beheaded,their bodies, bound up in the corn-stalks, being after-wards thrown into water as a rain-charm. The grounds for this supposition are, first, the resemblance of the Lityerses story tothe harvest customs of European peasantry, and, second, the frequency of human sacrificesoffered by savage races to promote the fertility of the fields. We will examine these groundssuccessively, beginning with the former.In comparing the story with the harvest customs of Europe, three points deserve specialattention, namely: I. the reaping match and the binding of persons in the sheaves; II. thekilling of the corn-spirit or his representatives; III. the treatment of visitors to the harvestfield or of strangers passing it.I. In regard to the first head, we have seen that in modern Europe the person who cuts orbinds or threshes the last sheaf is often exposed to rough treatment at the hands of his"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"fellow-labourers. For example, he is bound up in the last sheaf, and, thus encased, iscarried or carted about, beaten, drenched with water, thrown on a dunghill, and so forth.Or, if he is spared this horse-play, he is at least the subject of ridicule or is thought to bedestined to suffer some misfortune in the course of the year. Hence the harvesters arenaturally reluctant to give the last cut at reaping or the last stroke at threshing or to bindthe last sheaf, and towards the close of the work this reluctance produces an emulationamong the labourers, each striving to finish his task as fast as possible, in order that hemay escape the invidious distinction of being last. For example, in the Mittelmark districtof Prussia, when the rye has been reaped, and the last sheaves are about to be tied up, thebinders stand in two rows facing each other, every woman with her sheaf and her strawrope before her. At a given signal they all tie up their sheaves, and the one who is the last tofinish is ridiculed by the rest. Not only so, but her sheaf is made up into human shape andcalled the Old Man, and she must carry it home to the farmyard, where the harvestersdance in a circle round her and it. Then they take the Old Man to the farmer and deliver itto him with the words, “We bring the Old Man to the Master. He may keep him till he getsa new one.” After that the Old Man is set up against a tree, where he remains for a longtime, the butt of many jests. At Aschbach in Bavaria, when the reaping is nearly finished,the reapers say, “Now, we will drive out the Old Man.” Each of them sets himself to reap apatch of corn as fast as he can; he who cuts the last handful or the last stalk is greeted bythe rest with an exulting cry, “You have the Old Man.” Sometimes a black mask is fastenedon the reaper’s face and he is dressed in woman’s clothes; or if the reaper is a woman, sheis dressed in man’s clothes. A dance follows. At the supper the Old Man gets twice as largea portion of the food as the others. The proceedings are similar at threshing; the personwho gives the last stroke is said to have the Old Man. At the supper given to the threshershe has to eat out of the cream-ladle and to drink a great deal. Moreover, he is quizzed andteased in all sorts of ways till he frees himself from further annoyance by treating theothers to brandy or beer.These examples illustrate the contests in reaping, threshing, and binding which take placeamongst the harvesters, from their unwillingness to suffer the ridicule and discomfortincurred by the one who happens to finish his work last. It will be remembered that theperson who is last at reaping, binding, or threshing, is regarded as the representative of thecorn-spirit, and this idea is more fully expressed by binding him or her in corn-stalks. Thelatter custom has been already illustrated, but a few more instances may be added. AtKloxin, near Stettin, the harvesters call out to the woman who binds the last sheaf, “Youhave the Old Man, and must keep him.” As late as the first half of the nineteenth centurythe custom was to tie up the woman herself in pease-straw, and bring her with music to thefarmhouse, where the harvesters danced with her till the pease-straw fell off. In othervillages round Stettin, when the last harvest-waggon is being loaded, there is a regular raceamongst the women, each striving not to be last. For she who places the last sheaf on thewaggon is called the Old Man, and is completely swathed in corn-stalks; she is also deckedwith flowers, and flowers and a helmet of straw are placed on her head. In solemnprocession she carries the harvest-crown to the squire, over whose head she holds it whileshe utters a string of good wishes. At the dance which follows, the Old Man has the right tochoose his, or rather her, partner; it is an honour to dance with him. At Gommern, nearMagdeburg, the reaper who cuts the last ears of corn is often wrapt up in corn-stalks socompletely that it is hard to see whether there is a man in the bundle or not. Thus wrapt up"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"he is taken by another stalwart reaper on his back, and carried round the field amidst thejoyous cries of the harvesters. At Neuhausen, near Merseburg, the person who binds thelast sheaf is wrapt in ears of oats and saluted as the Oatsman, whereupon the others danceround him. At Brie, Isle de France, the farmer himself is tied up in the first sheaf. AtDingelstedt, in the district of Erfurt, down to the first half of the nineteenth century it wasthe custom to tie up a man in the last sheaf. He was called the Old Man, and was broughthome on the last waggon, amid huzzas and music. On reaching the farmyard he was rolledround the barn and drenched with water. At Nördlingen in Bavaria the man who gives thelast stroke at threshing is wrapt in straw and rolled on the threshing-floor. In some parts ofOberpfalz, Bavaria, he is said to “get the Old Man,” is wrapt in straw, and carried to aneighbour who has not yet finished his threshing. In Silesia the woman who binds the lastsheaf has to submit to a good deal of horse-play. She is pushed, knocked down, and tied upin the sheaf, after which she is called the corn-puppet (Kornpopel).“In all these cases the idea is that the spirit of the corn—the Old Man of vegetation—isdriven out of the corn last cut or last threshed, and lives in the barn during the winter. Atsowing-time he goes out again to the fields to resume his activity as animating force amongthe sprouting corn.”II. Passing to the second point of comparison between the Lityerses story and Europeanharvest customs, we have now to see that in the latter the corn-spirit is often believed to bekilled at reaping or threshing. In the Romsdal and other parts of Norway, when thehaymaking is over, the people say that “the Old Hay-man has been killed.” In some partsof Bavaria the man who gives the last stroke at threshing is said to have killed the Corn-man, the Oats-man, or the Wheat-man, according to the crop. In the Canton of Tillot, inLorraine, at threshing the last corn the men keep time with their flails, calling out as theythresh, “We are killing the Old Woman! We are killing the Old Woman!” If there is an oldwoman in the house she is warned to save herself, or she will be struck dead. Near Ragnit,in Lithuania, the last handful of corn is left standing by itself, with the words, “The OldWoman (Boba) is sitting in there.” Then a young reaper whets his scythe and, with a strongsweep, cuts down the handful. It is now said of him that “he has cut off the Boba’s head”;and he receives a gratuity from the farmer and a jugful of water over his head from thefarmer’s wife. According to another account, every Lithuanian reaper makes haste tofinish his task; for the Old Rye-woman lives in the last stalks, and whoever cuts the laststalks kills the Old Rye-woman, and by killing her he brings trouble on himself. InWilkischken, in the district of Tilsit, the man who cuts the last corn goes by the name of“the killer of the Rye-woman.” In Lithuania, again, the corn-spirit is believed to be killed atthreshing as well as at reaping. When only a single pile of corn remains to be threshed, allthe threshers suddenly step back a few paces, as if at the word of command. Then they fallto work, plying their flails with the utmost rapidity and vehemence, till they come to thelast bundle. Upon this they fling themselves with almost frantic fury, straining every nerve,and raining blows on it till the word “Halt!” rings out sharply from the leader. The manwhose flail is the last to fall after the command to stop has been given is immediatelysurrounded by all the rest, crying out that “he has struck the Old Rye-woman dead.” Hehas to expiate the deed by treating them to brandy; and, like the man who cuts the lastcorn, he is known as “the killer of the Old Rye-woman.” Sometimes in Lithuania the slaincorn-spirit was represented by a puppet. Thus a female figure was made out of corn-stalks,"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"dressed in clothes, and placed on the threshing-floor, under the heap of corn which was tobe threshed last. Whoever thereafter gave the last stroke at threshing “struck the OldWoman dead.” We have already met with examples of burning the figure which representsthe corn-spirit. In the East Riding of Yorkshire a custom called “burning the Old Witch” isobserved on the last day of harvest. A small sheaf of corn is burnt on the field in a fire ofstubble; peas are parched at the fire and eaten with a liberal allowance of ale; and the ladsand lasses romp about the flames and amuse themselves by blackening each other’s faces.Sometimes, again, the corn-spirit is represented by a man, who lies down under the lastcorn; it is threshed upon his body, and the people say that “the Old Man is being beaten todeath.” We saw that sometimes the farmer’s wife is thrust, together with the last sheaf,under the threshing-machine, as if to thresh her, and that afterwards a pretence is made ofwinnowing her. At Volders, in the Tyrol, husks of corn are stuck behind the neck of theman who gives the last stroke at threshing, and he is throttled with a straw garland. If he istall, it is believed that the corn will be tall next year. Then he is tied on a bundle and flunginto the river. In Carinthia, the thresher who gave the last stroke, and the person whountied the last sheaf on the threshing-floor, are bound hand and foot with straw bands, andcrowns of straw are placed on their heads. Then they are tied, face to face, on a sledge,dragged through the village, and flung into a brook. The custom of throwing therepresentative of the corn-spirit into a stream, like that of drenching him with water, is, asusual, a rain-charm.III. Thus far the representatives of the corn-spirit have generally been the man or womanwho cuts, binds, or threshes the last corn. We now come to the cases in which the corn-spirit is represented either by a stranger passing the harvest-field (as in the Lityerses tale),or by a visitor entering it for the first time. All over Germany it is customary for thereapers or threshers to lay hold of passing strangers and bind them with a rope made ofcorn-stalks, till they pay a forfeit; and when the farmer himself or one of his guests entersthe field or the threshing-floor for the first time, he is treated in the same way. Sometimesthe rope is only tied round his arm or his feet or his neck. But sometimes he is regularlyswathed in corn. Thus at Solör in Norway, whoever enters the field, be he the master or astranger, is tied up in a sheaf and must pay a ransom. In the neighbourhood of Soest, whenthe farmer visits the flax-pullers for the first time, he is completely enveloped in flax.Passers-by are also surrounded by the women, tied up in flax, and compelled to standbrandy. At Nördlingen strangers are caught with straw ropes and tied up in a sheaf tillthey pay a forfeit. Among the Germans of Haselberg, in West Bohemia, as soon as a farmerhad given the last corn to be threshed on the threshing-floor, he was swathed in it and hadto redeem himself by a present of cakes. In the canton of Putanges, in Normandy, apretence of tying up the owner of the land in the last sheaf of wheat is still practised, or atleast was still practised some quarter of a century ago. The task falls to the women alone.They throw themselves on the proprietor, seize him by the arms, the legs, and the body,throw him to the ground, and stretch him on the last sheaf. Then a show is made of bindinghim, and the conditions to be observed at the harvest-supper are dictated to him. When hehas accepted them, he is released and allowed to get up. At Brie, Isle de France, when anyone who does not belong to the farm passes by the harvest-field, the reapers give chase. Ifthey catch him, they bind him in a sheaf an dbite him, one after the other, in the forehead,crying, “You shall carry the key of the field.” “To have the key” is an expression used byharvesters elsewhere in the sense of to cut or bind or thresh the last sheaf; hence, it is"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"equivalent to the phrases “You have the Old Man,” “You are the Old Man,” which areaddressed to the cutter, binder, or thresher of the last sheaf. Therefore, when a stranger, asat Brie, is tied up in a sheaf and told that he will “carry the key of the field,” it is as muchas to say that he is the Old Man, that is, an embodiment of the corn-spirit. In hop-picking,if a well-dressed stranger passes the hop-yard, he is seized by the women, tumbled into thebin, covered with leaves, and not released till he has paid a fine.Thus, like the ancient Lityerses, modern European reapers have been wont to lay hold of apassing stranger and tie him up in a sheaf. It is not to be expected that they shouldcomplete the parallel by cutting off his head; but if they do not take such a strong step,their language and gestures are at least indicative of a desire to do so. For instance, inMecklenburg on the first day of reaping, if the master or mistress or a stranger enters thefield, or merely passes by it, all the mowers face towards him and sharpen their scythes,clashing their whet-stones against them in unison, as if they were making ready to mow.Then the woman who leads the mowers steps up to him and ties a band round his left arm.He must ransom himself by payment of a forfeit. Near Ratzeburg, when the master orother person of mark enters the field or passes by it, all the harvesters stop work andmarch towards him in a body, the men with their scythes in front. On meeting him theyform up in line, men and women. The men stick the poles of their scythes in the ground, asthey do in whetting them; then they take off their caps and hang them on the scythes, whiletheir leader stands forward and makes a speech. When he has done, they all whet theirscythes in measured time very loudly, after which they put on their caps. Two of the womenbinders then come forward; one of them ties the master or stranger (as the case may be)with corn-ears or with a silken band; the other delivers a rhyming address. The followingare specimens of the speeches made by the reaper on these occasions. In some parts ofPomerania every passer-by is stopped, his way being barred with a corn-rope. The reapersform a circle round him and sharpen their scythes, while their leader says:“The men are ready,The scythes are bent,The corn is great and small,The gentleman must be mowed.”Then the process of whetting the scythes is repeated. At Ramin, in the district of Stettin, thestranger, standing encircled by the reapers, is thus addressed:“We’ll stroke the gentlemanWith our naked sword,Wherewith we shear meadows and fields.We shear princes and lords.Labourers are often athirst;If the gentleman will stand beer and brandy"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"The joke will soon be over.But, if our prayer he does not like,The sword has a right to strike.”On the threshing-floor strangers are also regarded as embodiments of the corn-spirit, andare treated accordingly. At Wiedingharde in Schleswig when a stranger comes to thethreshing-floor he is asked, “Shall I teach you the flail-dance?” If he says yes, they put thearms of the threshing-flail round his neck as if he were a sheaf of corn, and press themtogether so tight that he is nearly choked. In some parishes of Wermland (Sweden), when astranger enters the threshing-floor where the threshers are at work, they say that “they willteach him the threshing-song.” Then they put a flail round his neck and a straw rope abouthis body. Also, as we have seen, if a stranger woman enters the threshing-floor, thethreshers put a flail round her body and a wreath of corn-stalks round her neck, and callout, “See the Corn-woman! See! that is how the Corn-maiden looks!”Thus in these harvest-customs of modern Europe the person who cuts, binds, or threshesthe last corn is treated as an embodiment of the corn-spirit by being wrapt up in sheaves,killed in mimicry by agricultural implements, and thrown into the water. Thesecoincidences with the Lityerses story seem to prove that the latter is a genuine descriptionof an old Phrygian harvest-custom. But since in the modern parallels the killing of thepersonal representative of the corn-spirit is necessarily omitted or at most enacted only inmimicry, it is desirable to show that in rude society human beings have been commonlykilled as an agricultural ceremony to promote the fertility of the fields. The followingexamples will make this plain.3. Human Sacrifices for the CropsTHE INDIANS of Guayaquil, in Ecuador, used to sacrifice human blood and the hearts ofmen when they sowed their fields. The people of Cañar (now Cuenca in Ecuador) used tosacrifice a hundred children annually at harvest. The kings of Quito, the Incas of Peru, andfor a long time the Spaniards were unable to suppress the bloody rite. At a Mexicanharvest-festival, when the first-fruits of the season were offered to the sun, a criminal wasplaced between two immense stones, balanced opposite each other, and was crushed bythem as they fell together. His remains were buried, and a feast and dance followed. Thissacrifice was known as “the meeting of the stones.” We have seen that the ancient Mexicansalso sacrificed human beings at all the various stages in the growth of the maize, the age ofthe victims corresponding to the age of the corn; for they sacrificed new-born babes atsowing, older children when the grain had sprouted, and so on till it was fully ripe, whenthey sacrificed old men. No doubt the correspondence between the ages of the victims andthe state of the corn was supposed to enhance the efficacy of the sacrifice.The Pawnees annually sacrificed a human victim in spring when they sowed their fields.The sacrifice was believed to have been enjoined on them by the Morning Star, or by a"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"certain bird which the Morning Star had sent to them as its messenger. The bird wasstuffed and preserved as a powerful talisman. They thought that an omission of thissacrifice would be followed by the total failure of the crops of maize, beans, and pumpkins.The victim was a captive of either sex. He was clad in the gayest and most costly attire, wasfattened on the choicest food, and carefully kept in ignorance of his doom. When he was fatenough, they bound him to a cross in the presence of the multitude, danced a solemn dance,then cleft his head with a tomahawk and shot him with arrows. According to one trader,the squaws then cut pieces of flesh from the victim’s body, with which they greased theirhoes; but this was denied by another trader who had been present at the ceremony.Immediately after the sacrifice the people proceeded to plant their fields. A particularaccount has been preserved of the sacrifice of a Sioux girl by the Pawnees in April 1837 or1838. The girl was fourteen or fifteen years old and had been kept for six months and welltreated. Two days before the sacrifice she was led from wigwam to wigwam, accompaniedby the whole council of chiefs and warriors. At each lodge she received a small billet ofwood and a little paint, which she handed to the warrior next to her. In this way she calledat every wigwam, receiving at each the same present of wood and paint. On the twenty-second of April she was taken out to be sacrificed, attended by the warriors, each of whomcarried two pieces of wood which he had received from her hands. Her body having beenpainted half red and half black, she was attached to a sort of gibbet and roasted for sometime over a slow fire, then shot to death with arrows. The chief sacrificer next tore out herheart and devoured it. While her flesh was still warm it was cut in small pieces from thebones, put in little baskets, and taken to a neighbouring corn-field. There the head chieftook a piece of the flesh from a basket and squeezed a drop of blood upon the newly-deposited grains of corn. His example was followed by the rest, till all the seed had beensprinkled with the blood; it was then covered up with earth. According to one account thebody of the victim was reduced to a kind of paste, which was rubbed or sprinkled not onlyon the maize but also on the potatoes, the beans, and other seeds to fertilise them. By thissacrifice they hoped to obtain plentiful crops.A West African queen used to sacrifice a man and woman in the month of March. Theywere killed with spades and hoes, and their bodies buried in the middle of a field which hadjust been tilled. At Lagos in Guinea it was the custom annually to impale a young girl alivesoon after the spring equinox in order to secure good crops. Along with her were sacrificedsheep and goats, which, with yams, heads of maize, and plantains, were hung on stakes oneach side of her. The victims were bred up for the purpose in the king’s seraglio, and theirminds had been so powerfully wrought upon by the fetish men that they went cheerfully totheir fate. A similar sacrifice used to be annually offered at Benin, in Guinea. TheMarimos, a Bechuana tribe, sacrifice a human being for the crops. The victim chosen isgenerally a short, stout man. He is seized by violence or intoxicated and taken to the fields,where he is killed amongst the wheat to serve as “seed” (so they phrase it). After his bloodhas coagulated in the sun, it is burned along with the frontal bone, the flesh attached to it,and the brain; the ashes are then scattered over the ground to fertilise it. The rest of thebody is eaten.The Bagobos of Mindanao, one of the Philippine Islands, offer a human sacrifice beforethey sow their rice. The victim is a slave, who is hewn to pieces in the forest. The natives ofBontoc in the interior of Luzon, one of the Philippine Islands, are passionate head-hunters."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"Their principal seasons for head-hunting are the times of planting and reaping the rice. Inorder that the crop may turn out well, every farm must get at least one human head atplanting and one at sowing. The head-hunters go out in twos or threes, lie in wait for thevictim, whether man or woman, cut off his or her head, hands, and feet, and bring themback in haste to the village, where they are received with great rejoicings. The skulls are atfirst exposed on the branches of two or three dead trees which stand in an open space ofevery village surrounded by large stones which serve as seats. The people then dance roundthem and feast and get drunk. When the flesh has decayed from the head, the man who cutit off takes it home and preserves it as a relic, while his companions do the same with thehands and the feet. Similar customs are observed by the Apoyaos, another tribe in theinterior of Luzon.Among the Lhota Naga, one of the many savage tribes who inhabit the deep ruggedlabyrinthine glens which wind into the mountains from the rich valley of Brahmapootra, itused to be a common custom to chop off the heads, hands, and feet of people they met with,and then to stick up the severed extremities in their fields to ensure a good crop of grain.They bore no ill-will whatever to the persons upon whom they operated in thisunceremonious fashion. Once they flayed a boy alive, carved him in pieces, and distributedthe flesh among all the villagers, who put it into their corn-bins to avert bad luck andensure plentiful crops of grain. The Gonds of India, a Dravidian race, kidnapped Brahmanboys, and kept them as victims to be sacrificed on various occasions. At sowing andreaping, after a triumphal procession, one of the lads was slain by being punctured with apoisoned arrow. His blood was then sprinkled over the ploughed field or the ripe crop, andhis flesh was devoured. The Oraons or Uraons of Chota Nagpur worship a goddess calledAnna Kuari, who can give good crops and make a man rich, but to induce her to do so it isnecessary to offer human sacrifices. In spite of the vigilance of the British Governmentthese sacrifices are said to be still secretly perpetrated. The victims are poor waifs andstrays whose disappearance attracts no notice. April and May are the months when thecatchpoles are out on the prowl. At that time strangers will not go about the country alone,and parents will not let their children enter the jungle or herd the cattle. When a catchpolehas found a victim, he cuts his throat and carries away the upper part of the ring fingerand the nose. The goddess takes up her abode in the house of any man who has offered hera sacrifice, and from that time his fields yield a double harvest. The form she assumes inthe house is that of a small child. When the householder brings in his unhusked rice, hetakes the goddess and rolls her over the heap to double its size. But she soon grows restlessand can only be pacified with the blood of fresh human victims.But the best known case of human sacrifices, systematically offered to ensure good crops, issupplied by the Khonds or Kandhs, another Dravidian race in Bengal. Our knowledge ofthem is derived from the accounts written by British officers who, about the middle of thenineteenth century, were engaged in putting them down. The sacrifices were offered to theEarth Goddess. Tari Pennu or Bera Pennu, and were believed to ensure good crops andimmunity from all disease and accidents. In particular, they were considered necessary inthe cultivation of turmeric, the Khonds arguing that the turmeric could not have a deep redcolour without the shedding of blood. The victim or Meriah, as he was called, wasacceptable to the goddess only if he had been purchased, or had been born a victim—thatis, the son of a victim father, or had been devoted as a child by his father or guardian."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"Khonds in distress often sold their children for victims, “considering the beatification oftheir souls certain, and their death, for the benefit of mankind, the most honourablepossible.” A man of the Panua tribe was once seen to load a Khond with curses, and finallyto spit in his face, because the Khond had sold for a victim his own child, whom the Panuahad wished to marry. A party of Khonds, who saw this, immediately pressed forward tocomfort the seller of his child, saying, “Your child has died that all the world may live, andthe Earth Goddess herself will wipe that spittle from your face.” The victims were oftenkept for years before they were sacrificed. Being regarded as consecrated beings, they weretreated with extreme affection, mingled with deference, and were welcomed wherever theywent. A Meriah youth, on attaining maturity, was generally given a wife, who was herselfusually a Meriah or victim; and with her he received a portion of land and farm-stock.Their offspring were also victims. Human sacrifices were offered to the Earth Goddess bytribes, branches of tribes, or villages, both at periodical festivals and on extraordinaryoccasions. The periodical sacrifices were generally so arranged by tribes and divisions oftribes that each head of a family was enabled, at least once a year, to procure a shred offlesh for his fields, generally about the time when his chief crop was laid down.The mode of performing these tribal sacrifices was as follows. Ten or twelve days beforethe sacrifice, the victim was devoted by cutting off his hair, which, until then, had been keptunshorn. Crowds of men and women assembled to witness the sacrifice; none might beexcluded, since the sacrifice was declared to be for all mankind. It was preceded by severaldays of wild revelry and gross debauchery. On the day before the sacrifice the victim,dressed in a new garment, was led forth from the village in solemn procession, with musicand dancing, to the Meriah grove, a clump of high forest trees standing a little way fromthe village and untouched by the axe. There they tied him to a post, which was sometimesplaced between two plants of the sankissar shrub. He was then anointed with oil, ghee, andturmeric, and adorned with flowers; and “a species of reverence, which it is not easy todistinguish from adoration,” was paid to him throughout the day. A great struggle nowarose to obtain the smallest relic from his person; a particle of the turmeric paste withwhich he was smeared, or a drop of his spittle, was esteemed of sovereign virtue, especiallyby the women. The crowd danced round the post to music, and addressing the earth, said,“O God, we offer this sacrifice to you; give us good crops, seasons, and health”; thenspeaking to the victim they said, “We bought you with a price, and did not seize you; nowwe sacrifice you according to custom, and no sin rests with us.”On the last morning the orgies, which had been scarcely interrupted during the night, wereresumed, and continued till noon, when they ceased, and the assembly proceeded toconsummate the sacrifice. The victim was again anointed with oil, and each person touchedthe anointed part, and wiped the oil on his own head. In some places they took the victim inprocession round the village, from door to door, where some plucked hair from his head,and others begged for a drop of his spittle, with which they anointed their heads. As thevictim might not be bound nor make any show of resistance, the bones of his arms and, ifnecessary, his legs were broken; but often this precaution was rendered unnecessary bystupefying him with opium. The mode of putting him to death varied in different places.One of the commonest modes seems to have been strangulation, or squeezing to death. Thebranch of a green tree was cleft several feet down the middle; the victim’s neck (in otherplaces, his chest) was inserted in the cleft, which the priest, aided by his assistants, strove"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"with all his force to close. Then he wounded the victim slightly with his axe, whereupon thecrowd rushed at the wretch and hewed the flesh from the bones, leaving the head andbowels untouched. Sometimes he was cut up alive. In Chinna Kimedy he was draggedalong the fields, surrounded by the crowd, who, avoiding his head and intestines, hackedthe flesh from his body with their knives till he died. Another very common mode ofsacrifice in the same district was to fasten the victim to the proboscis of a wooden elephant,which revolved on a stout post, and, as it whirled round, the crowd cut the flesh from thevictim while life remained. In some villages Major Campbell found as many as fourteen ofthese wooden elephants, which had been used at sacrifices. In one district the victim wasput to death slowly by fire. A low stage was formed, sloping on either side like a roof; uponit they laid the victim, his limbs wound round with cords to confine his struggles. Fireswere then lighted and hot brands applied, to make him roll up and down the slopes of thestage as long as possible; for the more tears he shed the more abundant would be thesupply of rain. Next day the body was cut to pieces.The flesh cut from the victim was instantly taken home by the persons who had beendeputed by each village to bring it. To secure its rapid arrival, it was sometimes forwardedby relays of men, and conveyed with postal fleetness fifty or sixty miles. In each village allwho stayed at home fasted rigidly until the flesh arrived. The bearer deposited it in theplace of public assembly, where it was received by the priest and the heads of families. Thepriest divided it into two portions, one of which he offered to the Earth Goddess by buryingit in a hole in the ground with his back turned, and without looking. Then each man addeda little earth to bury it, and the priest poured water on the spot from a hill gourd. Theother portion of flesh he divided into as many shares as there were heads of houses present.Each head of a house rolled his shred of flesh in leaves, and buried it in his favourite field,placing it in the earth behind his back without looking. In some places each man carried hisportion of flesh to the stream which watered his fields, and there hung it on a pole. Forthree days thereafter no house was swept; and, in one district, strict silence was observed,no fire might be given out, no wood cut, and no strangers received. The remains of thehuman victim (namely, the head, bowels, and bones) were watched by strong parties thenight after the sacrifice; and next morning they were burned, along with a whole sheep, ona funeral pile. The ashes were scattered over the fields, laid as paste over the houses andgranaries, or mixed with the new corn to preserve it from insects. Sometimes, however, thehead and bones were buried, not burnt. After the suppression of the human sacrifices,inferior victims were substituted in some places; for instance, in the capital of ChinnaKimedy a goat took the place of the human victim. Others sacrifice a buffalo. They tie it toa wooden post in a sacred grove, dance wildly round it with brandished knives, then, fallingon the living animal, hack it to shreds and tatters in a few minutes, fighting and strugglingwith each other for every particle of flesh. As soon as a man has secured a piece he makesoff with it at full speed to bury it in his fields, according to ancient custom, before the sunhas set, and as some of them have far to go they must run very fast. All the women throwclods of earth at the rapidly retreating figures of the men, some of them taking very goodaim. Soon the sacred grove, so lately a scene of tumult, is silent and deserted except for afew people who remain to guard all that is left of the buffalo, to wit, the head, the bones,and the stomach, which are burned with ceremony at the foot of the stake.In these Khond sacrifices the Meriahs are represented by our authorities as victims offered"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"to propitiate the Earth Goddess. But from the treatment of the victims both before andafter death it appears that the custom cannot be explained as merely a propitiatorysacrifice. A part of the flesh certainly was offered to the Earth Goddess, but the rest wasburied by each householder in his fields, and the ashes of the other parts of the body werescattered over the fields, laid as paste on the granaries, or mixed with the new corn. Theselatter customs imply that to the body of the Meriah there was ascribed a direct or intrinsicpower of making the crops to grow, quite independent of the indirect efficacy which itmight have as an offering to secure the good-will of the deity. In other words, the flesh andashes of the victim were believed to be endowed with a magical or physical power offertilising the land. The same intrinsic power was ascribed to the blood and tears of theMeriah, his blood causing the redness of the turmeric and his tears producing rain; for itcan hardly be doubted that, originally at least, the tears were supposed to bring down therain, not merely to prognosticate it. Similarly the custom of pouring water on the buriedflesh of the Meriah was no doubt a rain-charm. Again, magical power as an attribute of theMeriah appears in the sovereign virtue believed to reside in anything that came from hisperson, as his hair or spittle. The ascription of such power to the Meriah indicates that hewas much more than a mere man sacrificed to propitiate a deity. Once more, the extremereverence paid him points to the same conclusion. Major Campbell speaks of the Meriah as“being regarded as something more than mortal,” and Major Macpherson says, “A speciesof reverence, which it is not easy to distinguish from adoration, is paid to him.” In short,the Meriah seems to have been regarded as divine. As such, he may originally haverepresented the Earth Goddess or, perhaps, a deity of vegetation; though in later times hecame to be regarded rather as a victim offered to a deity than as himself an incarnate god.This later view of the Meriah as a victim rather than a divinity may perhaps have receivedundue emphasis from the European writers who have described the Khond religion.Habituated to the later idea of sacrifice as an offering made to a god for the purpose ofconciliating his favour, European observers are apt to interpret all religious slaughter inthis sense, and to suppose that wherever such slaughter takes place, there must necessarilybe a deity to whom the carnage is believed by the slayers to be acceptable. Thus theirpreconceived ideas may unconsciously colour and warp their descriptions of savage rites.The same custom of killing the representative of a god, of which strong traces appear in theKhond sacrifices, may perhaps be detected in some of the other human sacrifices describedabove. Thus the ashes of the slaughtered Marimo were scattered over the fields; the bloodof the Brahman lad was put on the crop and field; the flesh of the slain Naga was stowed inthe corn-bin; and the blood of the Sioux girl was allowed to trickle on the seed. Again, theidentification of the victim with the corn, in other words, the view that he is an embodimentor spirit of the corn, is brought out in the pains which seem to be taken to secure a physicalcorrespondence between him and the natural object which he embodies or represents. Thusthe Mexicans killed young victims for the young corn and old ones for the ripe corn; theMarimos sacrifice, as “seed,” a short, fat man, the shortness of his stature corresponding tothat of the young corn, his fatness to the condition which it is desired that the crops mayattain; and the Pawnees fattened their victims probably with the same view. Again, theidentification of the victim with the corn comes out in the African custom of killing himwith spades and hoes, and the Mexican custom of grinding him, like corn, between twostones."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"One more point in these savage customs deserves to be noted. The Pawnee chief devouredthe heart of the Sioux girl, and the Marimos and Gonds ate the victim’s flesh. If, as wesuppose, the victim was regarded as divine, it follows that in eating his flesh hisworshippers believed themselves to be partaking of the body of their god.4. The Corn-spirit slain in his Human RepresentativesTHE BARBAROUS rites just described offer analogies to the harvest customs of Europe.Thus the fertilising virtue ascribed to the corn-spirit is shown equally in the savage customof mixing the victim’s blood or ashes with the seed-corn and the European custom ofmixing the grain from the last sheaf with the young corn in spring. Again, the identificationof the person with the corn appears alike in the savage custom of adapting the age andstature of the victim to the age and stature, whether actual or expected, of the crop; in theScotch and Styrian rules that when the corn-spirit is conceived as the Maiden the last cornshall be cut by a young maiden, but when it is conceived as the Corn-mother it shall be cutby an old woman; in the warning given to old women in Lorraine to save themselves whenthe Old Woman is being killed, that is, when the last corn is being threshed; and in theTyrolese expectation that if the man who gives the last stroke at threshing is tall, the nextyear’s corn will be tall also. Further, the same identification is implied in the savage customof killing the representative of the corn-spirit with hoes or spades or by grinding himbetween stones, and in the European custom of pretending to kill him with the scythe or theflail. Once more the Khond custom of pouring water on the buried flesh of the victim isparallel to the European customs of pouring water on the personal representative of thecorn-spirit or plunging him into a stream. Both the Khond and the European customs arerain-charms.To return now to the Lityerses story. It has been shown that in rude society human beingshave been commonly killed to promote the growth of the crops. There is therefore noimprobability in the supposition that they may once have been killed for a like purpose inPhrygia and Europe; and when Phrygian legend and European folk-custom, closelyagreeing with each other, point to the conclusion that men were so slain, we are bound,provisionally at least, to accept the conclusion. Further, both the Lityerses story andEuropean harvest-customs agree in indicating that the victim was put to death as arepresentative of the corn-spirit, and this indication is in harmony with the view whichsome savages appear to take of the victim slain to make the crops flourish. On the whole,then, we may fairly suppose that both in Phrygia and in Europe the representative of thecorn-spirit was annually killed upon the harvest-field. Grounds have been already shownfor believing that similarly in Europe the representative of the tree-spirit was annuallyslain. The proofs of these two remarkable and closely analogous customs are entirelyindependent of each other. Their coincidence seems to furnish fresh presumption in favourof both.To the question, How was the representative of the corn-spirit chosen? one answer hasbeen already given. Both the Lityerses story and European folk-custom show that passingstrangers were regarded as manifestations of the corn-spirit escaping from the cut orthreshed corn, and as such were seized and slain. But this is not the only answer which the"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"evidence suggests. According to the Phrygian legend the victims of Lityerses were notsimply passing strangers, but persons whom he had vanquished in a reaping contest andafterwards wrapt up in corn-sheaves and beheaded. This suggests that the representative ofthe corn-spirit may have been selected by means of a competition on the harvest-field, inwhich the vanquished competitor was compelled to accept the fatal honour. Thesupposition is countenanced by European harvest-customs. We have seen that in Europethere is sometimes a contest amongst the reapers to avoid being last, and that the personwho is vanquished in this competition, that is, who cuts the last corn, is often roughlyhandled. It is true we have not found that a pretence is made of killing him; but on theother hand we have found that a pretence is made of killing the man who gives the laststroke at threshing, that is, who is vanquished in the threshing contest. Now, since it is inthe character of representative of the corn-spirit that the thresher of the last corn is slain inmimicry, and since the same representative character attaches (as we have seen) to thecutter and binder as well as to the thresher of the last corn, and since the same repugnanceis evinced by harvesters to be last in any one of these labours, we may conjecture that apretence has been commonly made of killing the reaper and binder as well as the thresherof the last corn, and that in ancient times this killing was actually carried out. Thisconjecture is corroborated by the common superstition that whoever cuts the last cornmust die soon. Sometimes it is thought that the person who binds the last sheaf on the fieldwill die in the course of next year. The reason for fixing on the reaper, binder, or thresherof the last corn as the representative of the corn-spirit may be this. The corn-spirit issupposed to lurk as long as he can in the corn, retreating before the reapers, the binders,and the threshers at their work. But when he is forcibly expelled from his refuge in the lastcorn cut or the last sheaf bound or the last grain threshed, he necessarily assumes someother form than that of the corn-stalks, which had hitherto been his garment or body. Andwhat form can the expelled corn-spirit assume more naturally than that of the person whostands nearest to the corn from which he (the corn-spirit) has just been expelled? But theperson in question is necessarily the reaper, binder, or thresher of the last corn. He or she,therefore, is seized and treated as the corn-spirit himself.Thus the person who was killed on the harvest-field as the representative of the corn-spiritmay have been either a passing stranger or the harvester who was last at reaping, binding,or threshing. But there is a third possibility, to which ancient legend and modern folk-custom alike point. Lityerses not only put strangers to death; he was himself slain, andapparently in the same way as he had slain others, namely, by being wrapt in a corn-sheaf,beheaded, and cast into the river; and it is implied that this happened to Lityerses on hisown land. Similarly in modern harvest-customs the pretence of killing appears to becarried out quite as often on the person of the master (farmer or squire) as on that ofstrangers. Now when we remember that Lityerses was said to have been a son of the Kingof Phrygia, and that in one account he is himself called a king, and when we combine withthis the tradition that he was put to death, apparently as a representative of the corn-spirit,we are led to conjecture that we have here another trace of the custom of annually slayingone of those divine or priestly kings who are known to have held ghostly sway in manyparts of Western Asia and particularly in Phrygia. The custom appears, as we have seen, tohave been so far modified in places that the king’s son was slain in the king’s stead. Of thecustom thus modified the story of Lityerses would be, in one version at least, areminiscence."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"Turning now to the relation of the Phrygian Lityerses to the Phrygian Attis, it may beremembered that at Pessinus—the seat of a priestly kingship—the high-priest appears tohave been annually slain in the character of Attis, a god of vegetation, and that Attis wasdescribed by an ancient authority as “a reaped ear of corn.” Thus Attis, as an embodimentof the corn-spirit, annually slain in the person of his representative, might be thought to beultimately identical with Lityerses, the latter being simply the rustic prototype out of whichthe state religion of Attis was developed. It may have been so; but, on the other hand, theanalogy of European folk-custom warns us that amongst the same people two distinctdeities of vegetation may have their separate personal representatives, both of whom areslain in the character of gods at different times of the year. For in Europe, as we have seen,it appears that one man was commonly slain in the character of the tree-spirit in spring,and another in the character of the corn-spirit in autumn. It may have been so in Phrygiaalso. Attis was especially a tree-god, and his connexion with corn may have been only suchan extension of the power of a tree-spirit as is indicated in customs like the Harvest-May.Again, the representative of Attis appears to have been slain in spring; whereas Lityersesmust have been slain in summer or autumn, according to the time of the harvest inPhrygia. On the whole, then, while we are not justified in regarding Lityerses as theprototype of Attis, the two may be regarded as parallel products of the same religious idea,and may have stood to each other as in Europe the Old Man of harvest stands to the WildMan, the Leaf Man, and so forth, of spring. Both were spirits or deities of vegetation, andthe personal representatives of both were annually slain. But whereas the Attis worshipbecame elevated into the dignity of a state religion and spread to Italy, the rites of Lityersesseem never to have passed the limits of their native Phrygia, and always retained theircharacter of rustic ceremonies performed by peasants on the harvest-field. At most a fewvillages may have clubbed together, as amongst the Khonds, to procure a human victim tobe slain as representative of the corn-spirit for their common benefit. Such victims mayhave been drawn from the families of priestly kings or kinglets, which would account forthe legendary character of Lityerses as the son of a Phrygian king or as himself a king.When villages did not so club together, each village or farm may have procured its ownrepresentative of the corn-spirit by dooming to death either a passing stranger or theharvester who cut, bound, or threshed the last sheaf. Perhaps in the olden time the practiceof head-hunting as a means of promoting the growth of the corn may have been as commonamong the rude inhabitants of Europe and Western Asia as it still is, or was till lately,among the primitive agricultural tribes of Assam, Burma, the Philippine Islands, and theIndian Archipelago. It is hardly necessary to add that in Phrygia, as in Europe, the oldbarbarous custom of killing a man on the harvest-field or the threshing-floor had doubtlesspassed into a mere pretence long before the classical era, and was probably regarded by thereapers and threshers themselves as no more than a rough jest which the license of aharvest-home permitted them to play off on a passing stranger, a comrade, or even on theirmaster himself.I have dwelt on the Lityerses song at length because it affords so many points ofcomparison with European and savage folk-custom. The other harvest songs of WesternAsia and Egypt, to which attention has been called above, may now be dismissed muchmore briefly. The similarity of the Bithynian Bormus to the Phrygian Lityerses helps tobear out the interpretation which has been given of the latter. Bormus, whose death orrather disappearance was annually mourned by the reapers in a plaintive song, was, like"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"Lityerses, a king’s son or at least the son of a wealthy and distinguished man. The reaperswhom he watched were at work on his own fields, and he disappeared in going to fetchwater for them; according to one version of the story he was carried off by the nymphs,doubtless the nymphs of the spring or pool or river whither he went to draw water. Viewedin the light of the Lityerses story and of European folk-custom, this disappearance ofBormus may be a reminiscence of the custom of binding the farmer himself in a corn-sheafand throwing him into the water. The mournful strain which the reapers sang wasprobably a lamentation over the death of the corn-spirit, slain either in the cut corn or inthe person of a human representative; and the call which they addressed to him may havebeen a prayer that he might return in fresh vigour next year.The Phoenician Linus song was sung at the vintage, at least in the west of Asia Minor, aswe learn from Homer; and this, combined with the legend of Syleus, suggests that inancient times passing strangers were handled by vintagers and vine-diggers in much thesame way as they are said to have been handled by the reaper Lityerses. The LydianSyleus, so ran the legend, compelled passers-by to dig for him in his vineyard, till Herculescame and killed him and dug up his vines by the roots. This seems to be the outline of alegend like that of Lityerses; but neither ancient writers nor modern folk-custom enable usto fill in the details. But, further, the Linus song was probably sung also by Phoenicianreapers, for Herodotus compares it to the Maneros song, which, as we have seen, was alament raised by Egyptian reapers over the cut corn. Further, Linus was identified withAdonis, and Adonis has some claims to be regarded as especially a corn-deity. Thus theLinus lament, as sung at harvest, would be identical with the Adonis lament; each would bethe lamentation raised by reapers over the dead spirit of the corn. But whereas Adonis, likeAttis, grew into a stately figure of mythology, adored and mourned in splendid cities farbeyond the limits of his Phoenician home, Linus appears to have remained a simple dittysung by reapers and vintagers among the corn-sheaves and the vines. The analogy ofLityerses and of folk-custom, both European and savage, suggests that in Phoenicia theslain corn-spirit—the dead Adonis—may formerly have been represented by a humanvictim; and this suggestion is possibly supported by the Harran legend that Tammuz(Adonis) was slain by his cruel lord, who ground his bones in a mill and scattered them tothe wind. For in Mexico, as we have seen, the human victim at harvest was crushedbetween two stones; and both in Africa and India the ashes or other remains of the victimwere scattered over the fields. But the Harran legend may be only a mythical way ofexpressing the grinding of corn in the mill and the scattering of the seed. It seems worthsuggesting that the mock king who was annually killed at the Babylonian festival of theSacaea on the sixteenth day of the month Lous may have represented Tammuz himself. Forthe historian Berosus, who records the festival and its date, probably used the Macedoniancalendar, since he dedicated his history to Antiochus Soter; and in his day the Macedonianmonth Lous appears to have corresponded to the Babylonian month Tammuz. If thisconjecture is right, the view that the mock king at the Sacaea was slain in the character of agod would be established.There is a good deal more evidence that in Egypt the slain corn-spirit—the dead Osiris—was represented by a human victim, whom the reapers slew on the harvest-field, mourninghis death in a dirge, to which the Greeks, through a verbal misunderstanding, gave thename of Maneros. For the legend of Busiris seems to preserve a reminiscence of human"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"sacrifices once offered by the Egyptians in connexion with the worship of Osiris. Busiriswas said to have been an Egyptian king who sacrificed all strangers on the altar of Zeus.The origin of the custom was traced to a dearth which afflicted the land of Egypt for nineyears. A Cyprian seer informed Busiris that the dearth would cease if a man were annuallysacrificed to Zeus. So Busiris instituted the sacrifice. But when Hercules came to Egypt,and was being dragged to the altar to be sacrificed, he burst his bonds and slew Busiris andhis son. Here then is a legend that in Egypt a human victim was annually sacrificed toprevent the failure of the crops, and a belief is implied that an omission of the sacrificewould have entailed a recurrence of that infertility which it was the object of the sacrificeto prevent. So the Pawnees, as we have seen, believed that an omission of the humansacrifice at planting would have been followed by a total failure of their crops. The nameBusiris was in reality the name of a city, pe-Asar, “the house of Osiris,” the city being socalled because it contained the grave of Osiris. Indeed some high modern authoritiesbelieve that Busiris was the original home of Osiris, from which his worship spread to otherparts of Egypt. The human sacrifice were said to have been offered at his grave, and thevictims were red-haired men, whose ashes were scattered abroad by means of winnowing-fans. This tradition of human sacrifices offered at the tomb of Osiris is confirmed by theevidence of the monuments.In the light of the foregoing discussion the Egyptian tradition of Busiris admits of aconsistent and fairly probable explanation. Osiris, the corn-spirit, was annuallyrepresented at harvest by a stranger, whose red hair made him a suitable representative ofthe ripe corn. This man, in his representative character, was slain on the harvest-field, andmourned by the reapers, who prayed at the same time that the corn-spirit might revive andreturn (mââ-ne-rha, Maneros) with renewed vigour in the following year. Finally, thevictim, or some part of him, was burned, and the ashes scattered by winnowing-fans overthe fields to fertilise them. Here the choice of the victim on the ground of his resemblance tothe corn which he was to represent agrees with the Mexican and African customs alreadydescribed. Similarly the woman who died in the character of the Corn-mother at theMexican midsummer sacrifice had her face painted red and yellow in token of the coloursof the corn, and she wore a pasteboard mitre surmounted by waving plumes in imitation ofthe tassel of the maize. On the other hand, at the festival of the Goddess of the White Maizethe Mexicans sacrificed lepers. The Romans sacrificed red-haired puppies in spring toavert the supposed blighting influence of the Dog-star, believing that the crops would thusgrow ripe and ruddy. The heathen of Harran offered to the sun, moon, and planets humanvictims who were chosen on the ground of their supposed resemblance to the heavenlybodies to which they were sacrificed; for example, the priests, clothed in red and smearedwith blood, offered a red-haired, red-cheeked man to “the red planet Mars” in a templewhich was painted red and draped with red hangings. These and the like cases ofassimilating the victim to the god, or to the natural phenomenon which he represents, arebased ultimately on the principle of homoeopathic or imitative magic, the notion being thatthe object aimed at will be most readily attained by means of a sacrifice which resemblesthe effect that it is designed to bring about.The story that the fragments of Osiris’s body were scattered up and down the land, andburied by Isis on the spots where they lay, may very well be a reminiscence of a custom,like that observed by the Khonds, of dividing the human victim in pieces and burying the"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"pieces, often at intervals of many miles from each other, in the fields.Thus, if I am right, the key to the mysteries of Osiris is furnished by the melancholy cry ofthe Egyptian reapers, which down to Roman times could be heard year after year soundingacross the fields, announcing the death of the corn-spirit, the rustic prototype of Osiris.Similar cries, as we have seen, were also heard on all the harvest-fields of Western Asia. Bythe ancients they are spoken of as songs; but to judge from the analysis of the names Linusand Maneros, they probably consisted only of a few words uttered in a prolonged musicalnote which could be heard at a great distance. Such sonorous and long-drawn cries, raisedby a number of strong voices in concert, must have had a striking effect, and could hardlyfail to arrest the attention of any wayfarer who happened to be within hearing. The sounds,repeated again and again, could probably be distinguished with tolerable ease even at adistance; but to a Greek traveller in Asia or Egypt the foreign words would commonlyconvey no meaning, and he might take them, not unnaturally, for the name of some one(Maneros, Linus, Lityerses, Bormus) upon whom the reapers were calling. And if hisjourney led him through more countries than one, as Bithynia and Phrygia, or Phoeniciaand Egypt, while the corn was being reaped, he would have an opportunity of comparingthe various harvest cries of the different peoples. Thus we can readily understand whythese harvest cries were so often noted and compared with each other by the Greeks.Whereas, if they had been regular songs, they could not have been heard at such distances,and therefore could not have attracted the attention of so many travellers; and, moreover,even if the wayfarer were within hearing of them, he could not so easily have picked out thewords.Down to recent times Devonshire reapers uttered cries of the same sort, and performed onthe field a ceremony exactly analogous to that in which, if I am not mistaken, the rites ofOsiris originated. The cry and the ceremony are thus described by an observer who wrotein the first half of the nineteenth century. “After the wheat is all cut, on most farms in thenorth of Devon, the harvest people have a custom of ‘crying the neck.’ I believe that thispractice is seldom omitted on any large farm in that part of the country. It is done in thisway. An old man, or some one else well acquainted with the ceremonies used on theoccasion (when the labourers are reaping the last field of wheat), goes round to the shocksand sheaves, and picks out a little bundle of all the best ears he can find; this bundle he tiesup very neat and trim, and plats and arranges the straws very tastefully. This is called ‘theneck’ of wheat, or wheaten-ears. After the field is cut out, and the pitcher once morecirculated, the reapers, binders, and the women stand round in a circle. The person with‘the neck’ stands in the centre, grasping it with both hands. He first stoops and holds itnear the ground, and all the men forming the ring take off their hats, stooping and holdingthem with both hands towards the ground. They then all begin at once in a very prolongedand harmonious tone to cry ‘The neck!’ at the same time slowly raising themselves upright,and elevating their arms and hats above their heads; the person with ‘the neck’ also raisingit on high. This is done three times. They then change their cry to ‘Wee yen!’—‘Wayyen!’—which they sound in the same prolonged and slow manner as before, with singularharmony and effect, three times. This last cry is accompanied by the same movements ofthe body and arms as in crying ‘the neck.’ ... After having thus repeated ‘the neck’ threetimes, and ‘wee yen,’ or ‘way yen’ as often, they all burst out into a kind of loud and joyouslaugh, flinging up their hats and caps into the air, capering about and perhaps kissing the"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"girls. One of them then gets ‘the neck’ and runs as hard as he can down to the farmhouse,where the dairymaid, or one of the young female domestics, stands at the door preparedwith a pail of water. If he who holds ‘the neck’ can manage to get into the house, in anyway unseen, or openly, by any other way than the door at which the girl stands with thepail of water, then he may lawfully kiss her; but, if otherwise, he is regularly soused withthe contents of the bucket. On a fine still autumn evening the ‘crying of the neck’ has awonderful effect at a distance, far finer than that of the Turkish muezzin, which LordByron eulogises so much, and which he says is preferable to all the bells of Christendom. Ihave once or twice heard upwards of twenty men cry it, and sometimes joined by an equalnumber of female voices. About three years back, on some high grounds, where our peoplewere harvesting, I heard six or seven ‘necks’ cried in one night, although I know that someof them were four miles off. They are heard through the quiet evening air at a considerabledistance sometimes.” Again, Mrs. Bray tells how, travelling in Devonshire, “she saw a partyof reapers standing in a circle on a rising ground, holding their sickles aloft. One in themiddle held up some ears of corn tied together with flowers, and the party shouted threetimes (what she writes as) ‘Arnack, arnack, arnack, we haven, we haven, we haven.’ Theywent home, accompanied by women and children carrying boughs of flowers, shouting andsinging. The manservant who attended Mrs. Bray said ‘it was only the people making theirgames, as they always did, to the spirit of harvest.’” Here, as Miss Burne remarks, “‘arnack,we haven!’ is obviously in the Devon dialect, ‘a neck (or nack)! we have un!’”Another account of this old custom, written at Truro in 1839, runs thus: “Now, when allthe corn was cut at Heligan, the farming men and maidens come in front of the house, andbring with them a small sheaf of corn, the last that has been cut, and this is adorned withribbons and flowers, and one part is tied quite tight, so as to look like a neck. Then they cryout ‘Our (my) side, my side,’ as loud as they can; then the dairymaid gives the neck to thehead farming-man. He takes it, and says, very loudly three times, ‘I have him, I have him, Ihave him.’ Then another farming-man shouts very loudly, ‘What have ye? what have ye?what have ye?’ Then the first says, ‘A neck, a neck, a neck.’ And when he has said this, allthe people make a very great shouting. This they do three times, and after one famousshout go away and eat supper, and dance, and sing songs.” According to another account,“all went out to the field when the last corn was cut, the ‘neck’ was tied with ribbons andplaited, and they danced round it, and carried it to the great kitchen, where by-and-by thesupper was. The words were as given in the previous account, and ‘Hip, hip, hack, heck, Ihave ’ee, I have ’ee, I have ‘ee.’ It was hung up in the hall.” Another account relates thatone of the men rushed from the field with the last sheaf, while the rest pursued him withvessels of water, which they tried to throw over the sheaf before it could be brought into thebarn.In the foregoing customs a particular bunch of ears, generally the last left standing, isconceived as the neck of the corn-spirit, who is consequently beheaded when the bunch iscut down. Similarly in Shropshire the name “neck,” or “the gander’s neck,” used to becommonly given to the last handful of ears left standing in the middle of the field when allthe rest of the corn was cut. It was plaited together, and the reapers, standing ten or twentypaces off, threw their sickles at it. Whoever cut it through was said to have cut off thegander’s neck. The “neck” was taken to the farmer’s wife, who was supposed to keep it inthe house for good luck till the next harvest came round. Near Trèves, the man who reaps"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"the last standing corn “cuts the goat’s neck off.” At Faslane, on the Gareloch(Dumbartonshire), the last handful of standing corn was sometimes called the “head.” AtAurich, in East Friesland, the man who reaps the last corn “cuts the hare’s tail off.” Inmowing down the last corner of a field French reapers sometimes call out, “We have thecat by the tail.” In Bresse (Bourgogne) the last sheaf represented the fox. Beside it a scoreof ears were left standing to form the tail, and each reaper, going back some paces, threwhis sickle at it. He who succeeded in severing it “cut off the fox’s tail,” and a cry of “Youcou cou!” was raised in his honour. These examples leave no room to doubt the meaning ofthe Devonshire and Cornish expression “the neck,” as applied to the last sheaf. The corn-spirit is conceived in human or animal form, and the last standing corn is part of its body—its neck, its head, or its tail. Sometimes, as we have seen, the last corn is regarded as thenavel-string. Lastly, the Devonshire custom of drenching with water the person who bringsin “the neck” is a raincharm, such as we have had many examples of. Its parallel in themysteries of Osiris was the custom of pouring water on the image of Osiris or on the personwho represented him.XLVIII. The Corn-Spirit as an Animal1. Animal Embodiments of the Corn-spiritIN SOME of the examples which I have cited to establish the meaning of the term “neck”as applied to the last sheaf, the corn-spirit appears in animal form as a gander, a goat, ahare, a cat, and a fox. This introduces us to a new aspect of the corn-spirit, which we mustnow examine. By doing so we shall not only have fresh examples of killing the god, but mayhope also to clear up some points which remain obscure in the myths and worship ofAdonis, Attis, Osiris, Dionysus, Demeter, and Virbius.Amongst the many animals whose forms the corn-spirit is supposed to take are the wolf,dog, hare, fox, cock, goose, quail, cat, goat, cow (ox, bull), pig, and horse. In one or other ofthese shapes the corn-spirit is often believed to be present in the corn, and to be caught orkilled in the last sheaf. As the corn is being cut the animal flees before the reapers, and if areaper is taken ill on the field, he is supposed to have stumbled unwittingly on the corn-spirit, who has thus punished the profane intruder. It is said “the Rye-wolf has got hold ofhim,” “the Harvest-goat has given him a push.” The person who cuts the last corn or bindsthe last sheaf gets the name of the animal, as the Rye-wolf, the Rye-sow, the Oats-goat, andso forth, and retains the name sometimes for a year. Also the animal is frequentlyrepresented by a puppet made out of the last sheaf or of wood, flowers, and so on, which iscarried home amid rejoicings on the last harvest-waggon. Even where the last sheaf is notmade up in animal shape, it is often called the Rye-wolf, the Hare, Goat, and so forth.Generally each kind of crop is supposed to have its special animal, which is caught in thelast sheaf, and called the Rye-wolf, the Barley-wolf, the Oats-wolf, the Pea-wolf, or thePotato-wolf, according to the crop; but sometimes the figure of the animal is only made uponce for all at getting in the last crop of the whole harvest. Sometimes the creature isbelieved to be killed by the last stroke of the sickle or scythe. But oftener it is thought to live"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"so long as there is corn still unthreshed, and to be caught in the last sheaf threshed. Hencethe man who gives the last stroke with the flail is told that he has got the Corn-sow, theThreshing-dog, or the like. When the threshing is finished, a puppet is made in the form ofthe animal, and this is carried by the thresher of the last sheaf to a neighbouring farm,where the threshing is still going on. This again shows that the corn-spirit is believed to livewherever the corn is still being threshed. Sometimes the thresher of the last sheaf himselfrepresents the animal; and if the people of the next farm, who are still threshing, catch him,they treat him like the animal he represents, by shutting him up in the pig-sty, calling himwith the cries commonly addressed to pigs, and so forth. These general statements will nowbe illustrated by examples.2. The Corn-spirit as a Wolf or a DogWE begin with the corn-spirit conceived as a wolf or a dog. This conception is common inFrance, Germany, and Slavonic countries. Thus, when the wind sets the corn in wave-likemotion the peasants often say, “The Wolf is going over, or through, the corn,” “the Rye-wolf is rushing over the field,” “the Wolf is in the corn,” “the mad Dog is in the corn,” “thebig Dog is there.” When children wish to go into the corn-fields to pluck ears or gather theblue corn-flowers, they are warned not to do so, for “the big Dog sits in the corn,” or “theWolf sits in the corn, and will tear you in pieces,” “the Wolf will eat you.” The wolf againstwhom the children are warned is not a common wolf, for he is often spoken of as the Corn-wolf, Rye-wolf, or the like; thus they say, “The Rye-wolf will come and eat you up,children,” “the Rye-wolf will carry you off,” and so forth. Still he has all the outwardappearance of a wolf. For in the neighbourhood of Feilenhof (East Prussia), when a wolfwas seen running through a field, the peasants used to watch whether he carried his tail inthe air or dragged it on the ground. If he dragged it on the ground, they went after him,and thanked him for bringing them a blessing, and even set tit-bits before him. But if hecarried his tail high, they cursed him and tried to kill him. Here the wolf is the corn-spiritwhose fertilising power is in his tail.Both dog and wolf appear as embodiments of the corn-spirit in harvest-customs. Thus insome parts of Silesia the person who cuts or binds the last sheaf is called the Wheat-dog orthe Peas-pug. But it is in the harvest-customs of the north-east of France that the idea ofthe Corn-dog comes out most clearly. Thus when a harvester, through sickness, weariness,or laziness, cannot or will not keep up with the reaper in front of him, they say, “The WhiteDog passed near him,” “he has the White Bitch,” or “the White Bitch has bitten him. In theVosges the Harvest-May is called the “Dog of the harvest,” and the person who cuts the lasthandful of hay or wheat is said to “kill the Dog.” About Lons-le-Saulnier, in the Jura, thelast sheaf is called the Bitch. In the neighbourhood of Verdun the regular expression forfinishing the reaping is, “They are going to kill the Dog”; and at Epinal they say, accordingto the crop, “We will kill the Wheat-dog, or the Rye-dog, or the Potato-dog.” In Lorraine itis said of the man who cuts the last corn, “He is killing the Dog of the harvest.” At Dux, inthe Tyrol, the man who gives the last stroke at threshing is said to “strike down the Dog”;and at Ahnebergen, near Stade, he is called, according to the crop, Corn-pug, Rye-pug,Wheat-pug."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"So with the wolf. In Silesia, when the reapers gather round the last patch of standing cornto reap it they are said to be about “to catch the Wolf.” In various parts of Mecklenburg,where the belief in the Corn-wolf is particularly prevalent, every one fears to cut the lastcorn, because they say that the Wolf is sitting in it; hence every reaper exerts himself to theutmost in order not to be the last, and every woman similarly fears to bind the last sheafbecause “the Wolf is in it.” So both among the reapers and the binders there is acompetition not to be the last to finish. And in Germany generally it appears to be acommon saying that “the Wolf sits in the last sheaf.” In some places they call out to thereaper, “Beware of the Wolf”; or they say, “He is chasing the Wolf out of the corn.” InMecklenburg the last bunch of standing corn is itself commonly called the Wolf, and theman who reaps it “has the Wolf,” the animal being described as the Rye-wolf, the Wheat-wolf, the Barley-wolf, and so on according to the particular crop. The reaper of the lastcorn is himself called Wolf or the Rye-wolf, if the crop is rye, and in many parts ofMecklenburg he has to support the character by pretending to bite the other harvesters orby howling like a wolf. The last sheaf of corn is also called the Wolf or the Rye-wolf or theOats-wolf according to the crop, and of the woman who binds it they say, “The Wolf isbiting her,” “She has the Wolf,” “She must fetch the Wolf” (out of the corn). Moreover, sheherself is called Wolf; they cry out to her, “Thou art the Wolf,” and she has to bear thename for a whole year; sometimes, according to the crop, she is called the Rye-wolf or thePotato-wolf. In the island of Rügen not only is the woman who binds the last sheaf calledWolf, but when she comes home she bites the lady of the house and the stewardess, forwhich she receives a large piece of meat. Yet nobody likes to be the Wolf. The same womanmay be Rye-wolf, Wheat-wolf, and Oats-wolf, if she happens to bind the last sheaf of rye,wheat, and oats. At Buir, in the district of Cologne, it was formerly the custom to give tothe last sheaf the shape of a wolf. It was kept in the barn till all the corn was threshed.Then it was brought to the farmer and he had to sprinkle it with beer or brandy. AtBrunshaupten in Mecklenburg the young woman who bound the last sheaf of wheat used totake a handful of stalks out of it and make “the Wheat-wolf” with them; it was the figure ofa wolf about two feet long and half a foot high, the legs of the animal being represented bystiff stalks and its tail and mane by wheat-ears. This Wheat-wolf she carried back at thehead of the harvesters to the village, where it was set up on a high place in the parlour ofthe farm and remained there for a long time. In many places the sheaf called the Wolf ismade up in human form and dressed in clothes. This indicates a confusion of ideas betweenthe corn-spirit conceived in human and in animal form. Generally the Wolf is broughthome on the last waggon with joyful cries. Hence the last waggon-load itself receives thename of the Wolf.Again, the Wolf is supposed to hide himself amongst the cut corn in the granary, until he isdriven out of the last bundle by the strokes of the flail. Hence at Wanzleben, nearMagdeburg, after the threshing the peasants go in procession, leading by a chain a manwho is enveloped in the threshed-out straw and is called the Wolf. He represents the corn-spirit who has been caught escaping from the threshed corn. In the district of Treves it isbelieved that the Corn-wolf is killed at threshing. The men thresh the last sheaf till it isreduced to chopped straw. In this way they think that the Corn-wolf, who was lurking inthe last sheaf, has been certainly killed.In France also the Corn-wolf appears at harvest. Thus they call out to the reaper of the last"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"corn, “You will catch the Wolf.” Near Chambéry they form a ring round the last standingcorn, and cry, “The Wolf is in there.” In Finisterre, when the reaping draws near an end,the harvesters cry, “There is the Wolf; we will catch him.” Each takes a swath to reap, andhe who finishes first calls out, “I’ve caught the Wolf.” In Guyenne, when the last corn hasbeen reaped, they lead a wether all round the field. It is called “the Wolf of the field.” Itshorns are decked with a wreath of flowers and corn-ears, and its neck and body are alsoencircled with garlands and ribbons. All the reapers march, singing, behind it. Then it iskilled on the field. In this part of France the last sheaf is called the coujoulage, which, in thepatois, means a wether. Hence the killing of the wether represents the death of the corn-spirit, considered as present in the last sheaf; but two different conceptions of the corn-spirit—as a wolf and as a wether—are mixed up together.Sometimes it appears to be thought that the Wolf, caught in the last corn, lives during thewinter in the farmhouse, ready to renew his activity as corn-spirit in the spring. Hence atmidwinter, when the lengthening days begin to herald the approach of spring, the Wolfmakes his appearance once more. In Poland a man, with a wolf’s skin thrown over hishead, is led about at Christmas; or a stuffed wolf is carried about by persons who collectmoney. There are facts which point to an old custom of leading about a man enveloped inleaves and called the Wolf, while his conductors collected money.3. The Corn-spirit as a CockANOTHER form which the corn-spirit often assumes is that of a cock. In Austria childrenare warned against straying in the corn-fields, because the Corn-cock sits there, and willpeck their eyes out. In North Germany they say that “the Cock sits in the last sheaf”; andat cutting the last corn the reapers cry, “Now we will chase out the Cock.” When it is cutthey say, “We have caught the Cock.” At Braller, in Transylvania, when the reapers cometo the last patch of corn, they cry, “Here we shall catch the Cock.” At Fürstenwalde, whenthe last sheaf is about to be bound, the master releases a cock, which he has brought in abasket, and lets it run over the field. All the harvesters chase it till they catch it. Elsewherethe harvesters all try to seize the last corn cut; he who succeeds in grasping it must crow,and is called Cock. Among the Wends it is or used to be customary for the farmer to hide alive cock under the last sheaf as it lay on the field; and when the corn was being gatheredup, the harvester who lighted upon this sheaf had a right to keep the cock, provided hecould catch it. This formed the close of the harvest-festival and was known as “the Cock-catching,” and the beer which was served out to the reapers at this time went by the nameof “Cock-beer.” The last sheaf is called Cock, Cock-sheaf, Harvest-cock, Harvest-hen,Autumn-hen. A distinction is made between a Wheat-cock, Bean-cock, and so on,according to the crop. At Wünschensuhl, in Thüringen, the last sheaf is made into theshape of a cock, and called the Harvest-cock. A figure of a cock, made of wood, pasteboard,ears of corn, or flowers, is borne in front of the harvest-waggon, especially in Westphalia,where the cock carries in his beak fruits of the earth of all kinds. Sometimes the image ofthe cock is fastened to the top of a May-tree on the last harvest-waggon. Elsewhere a livecock, or a figure of one, is attached to a harvest-crown and carried on a pole. In Galiciaand elsewhere this live cock is fastened to the garland of corn-ears or flowers, which theleader of the women-reapers carries on her head as she marches in front of the harvest"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"procession. In Silesia a live cock is presented to the master on a plate. The harvest-supper iscalled Harvest-cock, Stubble-cock, etc., and a chief dish at it, at least in some places, is acock. If a waggoner upsets a harvest-waggon, it is said that “he has spilt the Harvest-cock,”and he loses the cock, that is, the harvest-supper. The harvest-waggon, with the figure ofthe cock on it, is driven round the farmhouse before it is taken to the barn. Then the cock isnailed over or at the side of the house-door, or on the gable, and remains there till nextharvest. In East Friesland the person who gives the last stroke at threshing is called theClucking-hen, and grain is strewed before him as if he were a hen.Again, the corn-spirit is killed in the form of a cock. In parts of Germany, Hungary,Poland, and Picardy the reapers place a live cock in the corn which is to be cut last, andchase it over the field, or bury it up to the neck in the ground; afterwards they strike off itshead with a sickle or scythe. In many parts of Westphalia, when the harvesters bring thewooden cock to the farmer, he gives them a live cock, which they kill with whips or sticks,or behead with an old sword, or throw into the barn to the girls, or give to the mistress tocook. It the Harvest-cock has not been spilt—that is, if no waggon has been upset—theharvesters have the right to kill the farmyard cock by throwing stones at it or beheading it.Where this custom has fallen into disuse, it is still common for the farmer’s wife to makecockie-leekie for the harvesters, and to show them the head of the cock which has beenkilled for the soup. In the neighbourhood of Klausenburg, Transylvania, a cock is buriedon the harvest-field in the earth, so that only its head appears. A young man then takes ascythe and cuts off the cock’s head at a single sweep. If he fails to do this, he is called theRed Cock for a whole year, and people fear that next year’s crop will be bad. NearUdvarhely, in Transylvania, a live cock is bound up in the last sheaf and killed with a spit.It is then skinned. The flesh is thrown away, but the skin and feathers are kept till nextyear; and in spring the grain from the last sheaf is mixed with the feathers of the cock andscattered on the field which is to be tilled. Nothing could set in a clearer light theidentification of the cock with the spirit of the corn. By being tied up in the last sheaf andkilled, the cock is identified with the corn, and its death with the cutting of the corn. Bykeeping its feathers till spring, then mixing them with the seed-corn taken from the verysheaf in which the bird had been bound, and scattering the feathers together with the seedover the field, the identity of the bird with the corn is again emphasised, and its quickeningand fertilising power, as an embodiment of the corn-spirit, is intimated in the plainestmanner. Thus the corn-spirit, in the form of a cock, is killed at harvest, but rises to freshlife and activity in spring. Again, the equivalence of the cock to the corn is expressed,hardly less plainly, in the custom of burying the bird in the ground, and cutting off its head(like the ears of corn) with the scythe.4. The Corn-spirit as a HareANOTHER common embodiment of the corn-spirit is the hare. In Galloway the reaping ofthe last standing corn is called “cutting the Hare.” The mode of cutting it is as follows.When the rest of the corn has been reaped, a handful is left standing to form the Hare. It isdivided into three parts and plaited, and the ears are tied in a knot. The reapers then retirea few yards and each throws his or her sickle in turn at the Hare to cut it down. It must becut below the knot, and the reapers continue to throw their sickles at it, one after the other,"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"until one of them succeeds in severing the stalks below the knot. The Hare is then carriedhome and given to a maidservant in the kitchen, who places it over the kitchen-door on theinside. Sometimes the Hare used to be thus kept till the next harvest. In the parish ofMinnigaff, when the Hare was cut, the unmarried reapers ran home with all speed, and theone who arrived first was the first to be married. In Germany also one of the names for thelast sheaf is the Hare. Thus in some parts of Anhalt, when the corn has been reaped andonly a few stalks are left standing, they say, “The Hare will soon come,” or the reapers cryto each other, “Look how the Hare comes jumping out.” In East Prussia they say that theHare sits in the last patch of standing corn, and must be chased out by the last reaper. Thereapers hurry with their work, each being anxious not to have “to chase out the Hare”; forthe man who does so, that is, who cuts the last corn, is much laughed at. At Aurich, as wehave seen, an expression for cutting the last corn is “to cut off the Hare’s tail.” “He iskilling the Hare” is commonly said of the man who cuts the last corn in Germany, Sweden,Holland, France, and Italy. In Norway the man who is thus said to “kill the Hare” mustgive “hare’s blood,” in the form of brandy, to his fellows to drink. In Lesbos, when thereapers are at work in two neighbouring fields, each party tries to finish first in order todrive the Hare into their neighbour’s field; the reapers who succeed in doing so believe thatnext year the crop will be better. A small sheaf of corn is made up and kept beside the holypicture till next harvest.5. The Corn-spirit as a CatAGAIN, the corn-spirit sometimes takes the form of a cat. Near Kiel children are warnednot to go into the corn-fields because “the Cat sits there.” In the Eisenach Oberland theyare told “the Corn-cat will come and fetch you,” “the Corn-cat goes in the corn.” In someparts of Silesia at mowing the last corn they say, “The Cat is caught”; and at threshing, theman who gives the last stroke is called the Cat. In the neighbourhood of Lyons the lastsheaf and the harvest-supper are both called the Cat. About Vesoul when they cut the lastcorn they say, “We have the Cat by the tail.” At Briançon, in Dauphiné, at the beginning ofreaping, a cat is decked out with ribbons, flowers, and ears of corn. It is called the Cat ofthe ball-skin (le chat de peau de balle). If a reaper is wounded at his work, they make thecat lick the wound. At the close of the reaping the cat is again decked out with ribbons andears of corn; then they dance and make merry. When the dance is over the girls solemnlystrip the cat of its finery. At Grüneberg, in Silesia, the reaper who cuts the last corn goes bythe name of the Tom-cat. He is enveloped in rye-stalks and green withes, and is furnishedwith a long plaited tail. Sometimes as a companion he has a man similarly dressed, who iscalled the (female) Cat. Their duty is to run after people whom they see and to beat themwith a long stick. Near Amiens the expression for finishing the harvest is, “They are goingto kill the Cat”; and when the last corn is cut they kill a cat in the farmyard. At threshing,in some parts of France, a live cat is placed under the last bundle of corn to be threshed,and is struck dead with the flails. Then on Sunday it is roasted and eaten as a holiday dish.In the Vosges Mountains the close of haymaking or harvest is called “catching the cat,”“killing the dog,” or more rarely “catching the hare.” The cat, the dog, or the hare is saidto be fat or lean according as the crop is good or bad. The man who cuts the last handful ofhay or of wheat is said to catch the cat or the hare or to kill the dog."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"6. The Corn-spirit as a GoatFURTHER, the corn-spirit often appears in the form of a goat. In some parts of Prussia,when the corn bends before the wind, they say, “The Goats are chasing each other,” “thewind is driving the Goats through the corn,” “the Goats are browsing there,” and theyexpect a very good harvest. Again they say, “The Oats-goat is sitting in the oats-field,” “theCorn-goat is sitting in the rye-field.” Children are warned not to go into the corn-fields topluck the blue corn-flowers, or amongst the beans to pluck pods, because the Rye-goat, theCorn-goat, the Oats-goat, or the Bean-goat is sitting or lying there, and will carry themaway or kill them. When a harvester is taken sick or lags behind his fellows at their work,they call out, “The Harvest-goat has pushed him,” “he has been pushed by the Corn-goat.”In the neighbourhood of Braunsberg (East Prussia) at binding the oats every harvestermakes haste “lest the Corn-goat push him.” At Oefoten, in Norway, each reaper has hisallotted patch to reap. When a reaper in the middle has not finished reaping his piece afterhis neighbours have finished theirs, they say of him, “He remains on the island.” And if thelaggard is a man, they imitate the cry with which they call a he-goat; if a woman, the crywith which they call a she-goat. Near Straubing, in Lower Bavaria, it is said of the manwho cuts the last corn that “he has the Corn-goat, or the Wheat-goat, or the Oats-goat,”according to the crop. Moreover, two horns are set up on the last heap of corn, and it iscalled “the horned Goat.” At Kreutzburg, East Prussia, they call out to the woman who isbinding the last sheaf, “The Goat is sitting in the sheaf.” At Gablingen, in Swabia, when thelast field of oats upon a farm is being reaped, the reapers carve a goat out of wood. Ears ofoats are inserted in its nostrils and mouth, and it is adorned with garlands of flowers. It isset up on the field and called the Oats-goat. When the reaping approaches an end, eachreaper hastens to finish his piece first; he who is the last to finish gets the Oats-goat. Again,the last sheaf is itself called the Goat. Thus, in the valley of the Wiesent, Bavaria, the lastsheaf bound on the field is called the Goat, and they have a proverb, “The field must bear agoat.” At Spachbrücken, in Hesse, the last handful of corn which is cut is called the Goat,and the man who cuts it is much ridiculed. At Dürrenbüchig and about Mosbach in Badenthe last sheaf is also called the Goat. Sometimes the last sheaf is made up in the form of agoat, and they say, “The Goat is sitting in it.” Again, the person who cuts or binds the lastsheaf is called the Goat. Thus, in parts of Mecklenburg they call out to the woman whobinds the last sheaf, “You are the Harvest-goat.” Near Uelzen, in Hanover, the harvestfestival begins with “the bringing of the Harvest-goat”; that is, the woman who bound thelast sheaf is wrapt in straw, crowned with a harvest-wreath, and brought in a wheel-barrow to the village, where a round dance takes place. About Luneburg, also, the womanwho binds the last corn is decked with a crown of corn-ears and is called the Corn-goat. AtMünzesheim in Baden the reaper who cuts the last handful of corn or oats is called theCorn-goat or the Oats-goat. In the Canton St. Gall, Switzerland, the person who cuts thelast handful of corn on the field, or drives the last harvest-waggon to the barn, is called theCorn-goat or the Rye-goat, or simply the Goat. In the Canton Thurgau he is called Corn-goat; like a goat he has a bell hung round his neck, is led in triumph, and drenched withliquor. In parts of Styria, also, the man who cuts the last corn is called Corn-goat, Oats-goat, or the like. As a rule, the man who thus gets the name of Corn-goat has to bear it awhole year till the next harvest."},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"According to one view, the corn-spirit, who has been caught in the form of a goat orotherwise, lives in the farmhouse or barn over winter. Thus, each farm has its ownembodiment of the corn-spirit. But, according to another view, the corn-spirit is the geniusor deity, not of the corn of one farm only, but of all the corn. Hence when the corn on onefarm is all cut, he flees to another where there is still corn left standing. This idea isbrought out in a harvest-custom which was formerly observed in Skye. The farmer whofirst finished reaping sent a man or woman with a sheaf to a neighbouring farmer who hadnot finished; the latter in his turn, when he had finished, sent on the sheaf to his neighbourwho was still reaping; and so the sheaf made the round of the farms till all the corn was cut.The sheaf was called the goabbir bhacagh, that is, the Cripple Goat. The custom appearsnot to be extinct at the present day, for it was reported from Skye not very many years ago.The corn-spirit was probably thus represented as lame because he had been crippled by thecutting of the corn. Sometimes the old woman who brings home the last sheaf must limp onone foot.But sometimes the corn-spirit, in the form of a goat, is believed to be slain on the harvest-field by the sickle or scythe. Thus, in the neighbourhood of Bernkastel, on the Moselle, thereapers determine by lot the order in which they shall follow each other. The first is calledthe fore-reaper, the last the tail-bearer. If a reaper overtakes the man in front he reaps pasthim, bending round so as to leave the slower reaper in a patch by himself. This patch iscalled the Goat; and the man for whom “the Goat is cut” in this way, is laughed and jeeredat by his fellows for the rest of the day. When the tail-bearer cuts the last ears of corn, it issaid, “He is cutting the Goat’s neck off.” In the neighbourhood of Grenoble, before the endof the reaping, a live goat is adorned with flowers and ribbons and allowed to run about thefield. The reapers chase it and try to catch it. When it is caught, the farmer’s wife holds itfast while the farmer cuts off its head. The goat’s flesh serves to furnish the harvest-supper.A piece of the flesh is pickled and kept till the next harvest, when another goat is killed.Then all the harvesters eat of the flesh. On the same day the skin of the goat is made into acloak, which the farmer, who works with his men, must always wear at harvest-time if rainor bad weather sets in. But if a reaper gets pains in his back, the farmer gives him the goat-skin to wear. The reason for this seems to be that the pains in the back, being inflicted bythe corn-spirit, can also be healed by it. Similarly, we saw that elsewhere, when a reaper iswounded at reaping, a cat, as the representative of the corn-spirit, is made to lick thewound. Esthonian reapers of the island of Mon think that the man who cuts the first ears ofcorn at harvest will get pains in his back, probably because the corn-spirit is believed toresent especially the first wound; and, in order to escape pains in the back, Saxon reapersin Transylvania gird their loins with the first handful of ears which they cut. Here, again,the corn-spirit is applied to for healing or protection, but in his original vegetable form, notin the form of a goat or a cat.Further, the corn-spirit under the form of a goat is sometimes conceived as lurking amongthe cut corn in the barn, till he is driven from it by the threshing-flail. Thus in Baden thelast sheaf to be threshed is called the Corn-goat, the Spelt-goat, or the Oats-goat accordingto the kind of grain. Again, near Marktl, in Upper Bavaria, the sheaves are called Straw-goats or simply Goats. They are laid in a great heap on the open field and threshed by tworows of men standing opposite each other, who, as they ply their flails, sing a song in whichthey say that they see the Straw-goat amongst the corn-stalks. The last Goat, that is, the"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"last sheaf, is adorned with a wreath of violets and other flowers and with cakes strungtogether. It is placed right in the middle of the heap. Some of the threshers rush at it andtear the best of it out; others lay on with their flails so recklessly that heads are sometimesbroken. At Oberinntal, in the Tyrol, the last thresher is called Goat. So at Haselberg, inWest Bohemia, the man who gives the last stroke at threshing oats is called the Oats-goat.At Tettnang, in Würtemburg, the thresher who gives the last stroke to the last bundle ofcorn before it is turned goes by the name of the He-goat, and it is said, “He has driven theHe-goat away.” The person who, after the bundle has been turned, gives the last stroke ofall, is called the She-goat. In this custom it is implied that the corn is inhabited by a pair ofcorn-spirits, male and female.Further, the corn-spirit, captured in the form of a goat at threshing, is passed on to aneighbour whose threshing is not yet finished. In Franche Comté, as soon as the threshingis over, the young people set up a straw figure of a goat on the farmyard of a neighbourwho is still threshing. He must give them wine or money in return. At Ellwangen, inWürtemburg, the effigy of a goat is made out of the last bundle of corn at threshing; foursticks form its legs, and two its horns. The man who gives the last stroke with the flail mustcarry the Goat to the barn of a neighbour who is still threshing and throw it down on thefloor; if he is caught in the act, they tie the Goat on his back. A similar custom is observedat Indersdorf, in Upper Bavaria; the man who throws the straw Goat into the neighbour’sbarn imitates the bleating of a goat; if they catch him, they blacken his face and tie theGoat on his back. At Saverne, in Alsace, when a farmer is a week or more behind hisneighbours with his threshing, they set a real stuffed goat or fox before his door.Sometimes the spirit of the corn in goat form is believed to be killed at threshing. In thedistrict of Traunstein, Upper Bavaria, they think that the Oats-goat is in the last sheaf ofoats. He is represented by an old rake set up on end, with an old pot for a head. Thechildren are then told to kill the Oats-goat.7. The Corn-spirit as a Bull, Cow, or OxANOTHER form which the corn-spirit often assumes is that of a bull, cow, or ox. When thewind sweeps over the corn they say at Conitz, in West Prussia, “The Steer is running in thecorn”; when the corn is thick and strong in one spot, they say in some parts of East Prussia,“The Bull is lying in the corn.” When a harvester has overstrained and lamed himself, theysay in the Graudenz district of West Prussia, “The Bull pushed him”; in Lorraine they say,“He has the Bull.” The meaning of both expressions is that he has unwittingly lighted uponthe divine corn-spirit, who has punished the profane intruder with lameness. So nearChambéry when a reaper wounds himself with his sickle, it is said that he has “the woundof the Ox.” In the district of Bunzlau (Silesia) the last sheaf is sometimes made into theshape of a horned ox, stuffed with tow and wrapt in corn-ears. This figure is called the OldMan. In some parts of Bohemia the last sheaf is made up in human form and called theBuffalo-bull. These cases show a confusion of the human with the animal shape of the corn-spirit. The confusion is like that of killing a wether under the name of a wolf. All overSwabia the last bundle of corn on the field is called the Cow; the man who cuts the last ears“has the Cow,” and is himself called Cow or Barley-cow or Oats-cow, according to the"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"crop; at the harvest-supper he gets a nosegay of flowers and corn-ears and a more liberalallowance of drink than the rest. But he is teased and laughed at; so no one likes to be theCow. The Cow was sometimes represented by the figure of a woman made out of ears ofcorn and corn-flowers. It was carried to the farmhouse by the man who had cut the lasthandful of corn. The children ran after him and the neighbours turned out to laugh at him,till the farmer took the Cow from him. Here again the confusion between the human andthe animal form of the corn-spirit is apparent. In various parts of Switzerland the reaperwho cuts the last ears of corn is called Wheat-cow, Corn-cow, Oats-cow, or Corn-steer, andis the butt of many a joke. On the other hand, in the district of Rosenheim, Upper Bavaria,when a farmer is later of getting in his harvest than his neighbours, they set up on his landa Straw-bull, as it is called. This is a gigantic figure of a bull made of stubble on aframework of wood and adorned with flowers and leaves. Attached to it is a label on whichare scrawled doggerel verses in ridicule of the man on whose land the Straw-bull is set up.Again, the corn-spirit in the form of a bull or ox is killed on the harvest-field at the close ofthe reaping. At Pouilly, near Dijon, when the last ears of corn are about to be cut, an oxadorned with ribbons, flowers, and ears of corn is led all round the field, followed by thewhole troop of reapers dancing. Then a man disguised as the Devil cuts the last ears of cornand immediately slaughters the ox. Part of the flesh of the animal is eaten at the harvest-supper; part is pickled and kept till the first day of sowing in spring. At Pont à Moussonand elsewhere on the evening of the last day of reaping, a calf adorned with flowers andears of corn is led thrice round the farmyard, being allured by a bait or driven by men withsticks, or conducted by the farmer’s wife with a rope. The calf chosen for this ceremony isthe calf which was born first on the farm in the spring of the year. It is followed by all thereapers with their tools. Then it is allowed to run free; the reapers chase it, and whoevercatches it is called King of the Calf. Lastly, it is solemnly killed; at Lunéville the man whoacts as butcher is the Jewish merchant of the village.Sometimes again the corn-spirit hides himself amongst the cut corn in the barn to reappearin bull or cow form at threshing. Thus at Wurmlingen, in Thüringen, the man who givesthe last stroke at threshing is called the Cow, or rather the Barley-cow, Oats-cow, Peas-cow, or the like, according to the crop. He is entirely enveloped in straw; his head issurmounted by sticks in imitation of horns, and two lads lead him by ropes to the well todrink. On the way thither he must low like a cow, and for a long time afterwards he goes bythe name of the Cow. At Obermedlingen, in Swabia, when the threshing draws near anend, each man is careful to avoid giving the last stroke. He who does give it “gets the Cow,”which is a straw figure dressed in an old ragged petticoat, hood, and stockings. It is tied onhis back with a straw-rope; his face is blackened, and being bound with straw-ropes to awheelbarrow he is wheeled round the village. Here, again, we meet with that confusionbetween the human and animal shape of the corn-spirit which we have noted in othercustoms. In Canton Schaffhausen the man who threshes the last corn is called the Cow; inCanton Thurgau, the Corn-bull; in Canton Zurich, the Thresher-cow. In the last-mentioned district he is wrapt in straw and bound to one of the trees in the orchard. AtArad, in Hungary, the man who gives the last stroke at threshing is enveloped in straw anda cow’s hide with the horns attached to it. At Pessnitz, in the district of Dresden, the manwho gives the last stroke with the flail is called Bull. He must make a straw-man and set itup before a neighbour’s window. Here, apparently, as in so many cases, the corn-spirit is"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"passed on to a neighbour who has not finished threshing. So at Herbrechtingen, inThüringen, the effigy of a ragged old woman is flung into the barn of the farmer who is lastwith his threshing. The man who throws it in cries, “There is the Cow for you.” If thethreshers catch him they detain him over night and punish him by keeping him from theharvest-supper. In these latter customs the confusion between the human and the animalshape of the corn-spirit meets us again.Further, the corn-spirit in bull form is sometimes believed to be killed at threshing. AtAuxerre, in threshing the last bundle of corn, they call out twelve times, “We are killing theBull.” In the neighbourhood of Bordeaux, where a butcher kills an ox on the fieldimmediately after the close of the reaping, it is said of the man who gives the last stroke atthreshing that “he has killed the Bull.” At Chambéry the last sheaf is called the sheaf of theYoung Ox, and a race takes place to it in which all the reapers join. When the last stroke isgiven at threshing they say that “the Ox is killed”; and immediately thereupon a real ox isslaughtered by the reaper who cut the last corn. The flesh of the ox is eaten by thethreshers at supper.We have seen that sometimes the young corn-spirit, whose task it is to quicken the corn ofthe coming year, is believed to be born as a Corn-baby on the harvest-field. Similarly inBerry the young corn-spirit is sometimes supposed to be born on the field in calf form; forwhen a binder has not rope enough to bind all the corn in sheaves, he puts aside the wheatthat remains over and imitates the lowing of a cow. The meaning is that “the sheaf hasgiven birth to a calf.” In Puy-de-Dôme when a binder cannot keep up with the reaperwhom he or she follows, they say “He (or she) is giving birth to the Calf.” In some parts ofPrussia, in similar circumstances, they call out to the woman, “The Bull is coming,” andimitate the bellowing of a bull. In these cases the woman is conceived as the Corn-cow orold corn-spirit, while the supposed calf is the Corn-calf or young corn-spirit. In some partsof Austria a mythical calf (Muhkälbchen) is believed to be seen amongst the sprouting cornin spring and to push the children; when the corn waves in the wind they say, “The Calf isgoing about.” Clearly, as Mannhardt observes, this calf of the spring-time is the sameanimal which is afterwards believed to be killed at reaping.8. The Corn-spirit as a Horse or MareSOMETIMES the corn-spirit appears in the shape of a horse or mare. Between Kalw andStuttgart, when the corn bends before the wind, they say, “There runs the Horse.” AtBohlingen, near Radolfzell in Baden, the last sheaf of oats is called the Oats-stallion. InHertfordshire, at the end of the reaping, there is or used to be observed a ceremony called“crying the Mare.” The last blades of corn left standing on the field are tied together andcalled the Mare. The reapers stand at a distance and throw their sickles at it; he who cuts itthrough “has the prize, with acclamations and good cheer.” After it is cut the reapers crythrice with a loud voice, “I have her!” Others answer thrice, “What have you?”— “AMare! a Mare! a Mare!”— “Whose is she?” is next asked thrice. “A. B.’s,” naming theowner thrice. “Whither will you send her?”— “To C. D.,” naming some neighbour who hasnot reaped all his corn. In this custom the corn-spirit in the form of a mare is passed onfrom a farm where the corn is all cut to another farm where it is still standing, and where"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"therefore the corn-spirit may be supposed naturally to take refuge. In Shropshire thecustom is similar. The farmer who finishes his harvest last, and who therefore cannot sendthe Mare to any one else, is said “to keep her all winter.” The mocking offer of the Mare toa laggard neighbour was sometimes responded to by a mocking acceptance of her help.Thus an old man told an inquirer, “While we wun at supper, a mon cumm’d wi’ a autar[halter] to fatch her away.” At one place a real mare used to be sent, but the man who rodeher was subjected to some rough treatment at the farmhouse to which he paid hisunwelcome visit.In the neighbourhood of Lille the idea of the corn-spirit in horse form in clearly preserved.When a harvester grows weary at his work, it is said, “He has the fatigue of the Horse.”The first sheaf, called the “Cross of the Horse,” is placed on a cross of boxwood in the barn,and the youngest horse on the farm must tread on it. The reapers dance round the lastblades of corn, crying, “See the remains of the Horse.” The sheaf made out of these lastblades is given to the youngest horse of the parish (commune) to eat. This youngest horse ofthe parish clearly represents, as Mannhardt says, the corn-spirit of the following year, theCorn-foal, which absorbs the spirit of the old Corn-horse by eating the last corn cut; for, asusual, the old corn-spirit takes his final refuge in the last sheaf. The thresher of the lastsheaf is said to “beat the Horse.”9. The Corn-spirit as a Pig (Boar or Sow)THE LAST animal embodiment of the corn-spirit which we shall notice is the pig (boar orsow). In Thüringen, when the wind sets the young corn in motion, they sometimes say,“The Boar is rushing through the corn.” Amongst the Esthonians of the island of Oesel thelast sheaf is called the Ryeboar, and the man who gets it is saluted with a cry of “You havethe Rye-boar on your back!” In reply he strikes up a song, in which he prays for plenty. AtKohlerwinkel, near Augsburg, at the close of the harvest, the last bunch of standing corn iscut down, stalk by stalk, by all the reapers in turn. He who cuts the last stalk “gets theSow,” and is laughed at. In other Swabian villages also the man who cuts the last corn “hasthe Sow,” or “has the Rye-sow.” At Bohlingen, near Radolfzell in Baden, the last sheaf iscalled the Rye-sow or the Wheat-sow, according to the crop; and at Röhrenbach in Badenthe person who brings the last armful for the last sheaf is called the Corn-sow or the Oats-sow. At Friedingen, in Swabia, the thresher who gives the last stroke is called Sow—Barley-sow, Corn-sow, or the like, according to the crop. At Onstmettingen the man who gives thelast stroke at threshing “has the Sow”; he is often bound up in a sheaf and dragged by arope along the ground. And, generally, in Swabia the man who gives the last stroke withthe flail is called Sow. He may, however, rid himself of this invidious distinction by passingon to a neighbour the straw-rope, which is the badge of his position as Sow. So he goes to ahouse and throws the straw-rope into it, crying, “There, I bring you the Sow.” All theinmates give chase; and if they catch him they beat him, shut him up for several hours inthe pig-sty, and oblige him to take the “Sow” away again. In various parts of UpperBavaria the man who gives the last stroke at threshing must “carry the Pig”—that is, eithera straw effigy of a pig or merely a bundle of straw-ropes. This he carries to a neighbouringfarm where the threshing is not finished, and throws it into the barn. If the threshers catchhim they handle him roughly, beating him, blackening or dirtying his face, throwing him"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"into filth, binding the Sow on his back, and so on; if the bearer of the Sow is a woman theycut off her hair. At the harvest supper or dinner the man who “carried the Pig” gets one ormore dumplings made in the form of pigs. When the dumplings are served up by themaidservant, all the people at table cry “Süz, süz, süz !” that being the cry used in callingpigs. Sometimes after dinner the man who “carried the Pig” has his face blackened, and isset on a cart and drawn round the village by his fellows, followed by a crowd crying “Süz,süz, süz !” as if they were calling swine. Sometimes, after being wheeled round the village,he is flung on the dunghill.Again, the corn-spirit in the form of a pig plays his part at sowing-time as well as atharvest. At Neuautz, in Courland, when barley is sown for the first time in the year, thefarmer’s wife boils the chine of a pig along with the tail, and brings it to the sower on thefield. He eats of it, but cuts off the tail and sticks it in the field; it is believed that the ears ofcorn will then grow as long as the tail. Here the pig is the corn-spirit, whose fertilisingpower is sometimes supposed to lie especially in his tail. As a pig he is put in the ground atsowing-time, and as a pig he reappears amongst the ripe corn at harvest. For amongst theneighbouring Esthonians, as we have seen, the last sheaf is called the Rye-boar. Somewhatsimilar customs are observed in Germany. In the Salza district, near Meiningen, a certainbone in the pig is called “the Jew on the winnowing-fan.” The flesh of this bone is boiled onShrove Tuesday, but the bone is put amongst the ashes which the neighbours exchange aspresents on St. Peter’s Day (the twenty-second of February), and then mix with theseedcorn. In the whole of Hesse, Meiningen, and other districts, people eat pea-soup withdried pig-ribs on Ash Wednesday or Candlemas. The ribs are then collected and hung inthe room till sowing-time, when they are inserted in the sown field or in the seed-bagamongst the flax seed. This is thought to be an infallible specific against earth-fleas andmoles, and to cause the flax to grow well and tall.But the idea of the corn-spirit as embodied in pig form is nowhere more clearly expressedthan in the Scandinavian custom of the Yule Boar. In Sweden and Denmark at Yule(Christmas) it is the custom to bake a loaf in the form of a boar-pig. This is called the YuleBoar. The corn of the last sheaf is often used to make it. All through Yule the Yule Boarstands on the table. Often it is kept till the sowing-time in spring, when part of it is mixedwith the seed-corn and part given to the ploughman and plough-horses or ploughoxen toeat, in the expectation of a good harvest. In this custom the corn-spirit, immanent in thelast sheaf, appears at midwinter in the form of a boar made from the corn of the last sheaf;and his quickening influence on the corn is shown by mixing part of the Yule Boar with theseed-corn, and giving part of it to the ploughman and his cattle to eat. Similarly we sawthat the Corn-wolf makes his appearance at mid-winter, the time when the year begins toverge towards spring. Formerly a real boar was sacrificed at Christmas, and apparentlyalso a man in the character of the Yule Boar. This, at least, may perhaps be inferred from aChristmas custom still observed in Sweden. A man is wrapt up in a skin, and carries a wispof straw in his mouth, so that the projecting straws look like the bristles of a boar. A knifeis brought, and an old woman, with her face blackened, pretends to sacrifice him.On Christmas Eve in some parts of the Esthonian island of Oesel they bake a long cakewith the two ends turned up. It is called the Christmas Boar, and stands on the table till themorning of New Year’s Day, when it is distributed among the cattle. In other parts of the"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"island the Christmas Boar is not a cake but a little pig born in March, which the housewifefattens secretly, often without the knowledge of the other members of the family. OnChristmas Eve the little pig is secretly killed, then roasted in the oven, and set on the tablestanding on all fours, where it remains in this posture for several days. In other parts of theisland, again, though the Christmas cake has neither the name nor the shape of a boar, it iskept till the New Year, when half of it is divided among all the members and all thequadrupeds of the family. The other half of the cake is kept till sowing-time comes round,when it is similarly distributed in the morning among human beings and beasts. In otherparts of Esthonia, again, the Christmas Boar, as it is called, is baked of the first rye cut atharvest; it has a conical shape and a cross is impressed on it with a pig’s bone or a key, orthree dints are made in it with a buckle or a piece of charcoal. It stands with a light besideit on the table all through the festal season. On New Year’s Day and Epiphany, beforesunrise, a little of the cake is crumbled with salt and given to the cattle. The rest is kept tillthe day when the cattle are driven out to pasture for the first time in spring. It is then putin the herdsman’s bag, and at evening is divided among the cattle to guard them frommagic and harm. In some places the Christmas Boar is partaken of by farm-servants andcattle at the time of the barley sowing, for the purpose of thereby producing a heavier crop.10. On the Animal Embodiments of the Corn-spiritSO much for the animal embodiments of the corn-spirit as they are presented to us in thefolk-customs of Northern Europe. These customs bring out clearly the sacramentalcharacter of the harvest-supper. The corn-spirit is conceived as embodied in an animal;this divine animal is slain, and its flesh and blood are partaken of by the harvesters. Thusthe cock, the hare, the cat, the goat, and the OX are eaten sacramentally by the harvester,and the pig is eaten sacramentally by ploughmen in spring. Again, as a substitute for thereal flesh of the divine being, bread or dumplings are made in his image and eatensacramentally; thus, pig-shaped dumplings are eaten by the harvesters, and loaves made inboar-shape (the Yule Boar) are eaten in spring by the ploughman and his cattle.The reader has probably remarked the complete parallelism between the conceptions of thecorn-spirit in human and in animal form. The parallel may be here briefly resumed. Whenthe corn waves in the wind it is said either that the Corn-mother or that the Corn-wolf, etc.,is passing through the corn. Children are warned against straying in corn-fields eitherbecause the Corn-mother or because the Corn-wolf, etc., is there. In the last corn cut or thelast sheaf threshed either the Corn-mother or the Corn-wolf, etc., is supposed to be present.The last sheaf is itself called either the Corn-mother or the Corn-wolf, etc., and is made upin the shape either of a woman or of a wolf, etc. The person who cuts, binds, or threshes thelast sheaf is called either the Old Woman or the Wolf, etc., according to the name bestowedon the sheaf itself. As in some places a sheaf made in human form and called the Maiden,the Mother of the Maize, etc., is kept from one harvest to the next in order to secure acontinuance of the corn-spirit’s blessing, so in some places the Harvest-cock and in othersthe flesh of the goat is kept for a similar purpose from one harvest to the next. As in someplaces the grain taken from the Corn-mother is mixed with the seed-corn in spring to makethe crop abundant, so in some places the feathers of the cock, and in Sweden the Yule Boar,are kept till spring and mixed with the seed-corn for a like purpose. As part of the Corn-"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"mother or Maiden is given to the cattle at Christmas or to the horses at the first ploughing,so part of the Yule Boar is given to the ploughing horses or oxen in spring. Lastly, thedeath of the corn-spirit is represented by killing or pretending to kill either his human orhis animal representative; and the worshippers partake sacramentally either of the actualbody and blood of the representative of the divinity, or of bread made in his likeness.Other animal forms assumed by the corn-spirit are the fox, stag, roe, sheep, bear, ass,mouse, quail, stork, swan, and kite. If it is asked why the corn-spirit should be thought toappear in the form of an animal and of so many different animals, we may reply that toprimitive man the simple appearance of an animal or bird among the corn is probablyenough to suggest a mysterious link between the creature and the corn; and when weremember that in the old days, before fields were fenced in, all kinds of animals must havebeen free to roam over them, we need not wonder that the corn-spirit should have beenidentified even with large animals like the horse and cow, which nowadays could not,except by a rare accident, be found straying in an English corn-field. This explanationapplies with peculiar force to the very common case in which the animal embodiment of thecorn-spirit is believed to lurk in the last standing corn. For at harvest a number of wildanimals, such as hares, rabbits, and partridges, are commonly driven by the progress of thereaping into the last patch of standing corn, and make their escape from it as it is being cutdown. So regularly does this happen that reapers and others often stand round the lastpatch of corn armed with sticks or guns, with which they kill the animals as they dart outof their last refuge among the stalks. Now, primitive man, to whom magical changes ofshape seem perfectly credible, finds it most natural that the spirit of the corn, driven fromhis home in the ripe grain, should make his escape in the form of the animal which is seento rush out of the last patch of corn as it falls under the scythe of the reaper. Thus theidentification of the corn-spirit with an animal is analogous to the identification of him witha passing stranger. As the sudden appearance of a stranger near the harvest-field orthreshing-floor is, to the primitive mind, enough to identify him as the spirit of the cornescaping from the cut or threshed corn, so the sudden appearance of an animal issuingfrom the cut corn is enough to identify it with the corn-spirit escaping from his ruinedhome. The two identifications are so analogous that they can hardly be dissociated in anyattempt to explain them. Those who look to some other principle than the one heresuggested for the explanation of the latter identification are bound to show that theirtheory covers the former identification also.XLIX. Ancient Deities of Vegetation as Animals1. Dionysus, the Goat and the BullHOWEVER we may explain it, the fact remains that in peasant folk-lore the corn-spirit isvery commonly conceived and represented in animal form. May not this fact explain therelation in which certain animals stood to the ancient deities of vegetation, Dionysus,Demeter, Adonis, Attis, and Osiris?"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"To begin with Dionysus. We have seen that he was represented sometimes as a goat andsometimes as a bull. As a goat he can hardly be separated from the minor divinities, thePans, Satyrs, and Silenuses, all of whom are closely associated with him and arerepresented more or less completely in the form of goats. Thus, Pan was regularlyportrayed in sculpture and painting with the face and legs of a goat. The Satyrs weredepicted with pointed goat-ears, and sometimes with sprouting horns and short tails. Theywere sometimes spoken of simply as goats; and in the drama their parts were played bymen dressed in goatskins. Silenus is represented in art clad in a goatskin. Further, theFauns, the Italian counterpart of the Greek Pans and Satyrs, are described as being halfgoats, with goat-feet and goat-horns. Again, all these minor goat-formed divinities partakemore or less clearly of the character of woodland deities. Thus, Pan was called by theArcadians the Lord of the Wood. The Silenuses kept company with the tree-nymphs. TheFauns are expressly designated as woodland deities; and their character as such is stillfurther brought out by their association, or even identification, with Silvanus and theSilvanuses, who, as their name of itself indicates, are spirits of the woods. Lastly, theassociation of the Satyrs with the Silenuses, Fauns, and Silvanuses, proves that the Satyrsalso were woodland deities. These goat-formed spirits of the woods have their counterpartsin the folk-lore of Northern Europe. Thus, the Russian wood-spirits, called Ljeschie (fromljes, “wood”), are believed to appear partly in human shape, but with the horns, ears, andlegs of goats. The Ljeschi can alter his stature at pleasure; when he walks in the wood he isas tall as the trees; when he walks in the meadows he is no higher than the grass. Some ofthe Ljeschie are spirits of the corn as well as of the wood; before harvest they are as tall asthe corn-stalks, but after it they shrink to the height of the stubble. This brings out—whatwe have remarked before—the close connexion between tree-spirits and corn-spirits, andshows how easily the former may melt into the latter. Similarly the Fauns, though wood-spirits, were believed to foster the growth of the crops. We have already seen how often thecorn-spirit is represented in folk-custom as a goat. On the whole, then, as Mannhardtargues, the Pans, Satyrs, and Fauns perhaps belong to a widely diffused class of wood-spirits conceived in goat-form. The fondness of goats for straying in woods and nibbling thebark of trees, to which indeed they are most destructive, is an obvious and perhapssufficient reason why wood-spirits should so often be supposed to take the form of goats.The inconsistency of a god of vegetation subsisting upon the vegetation which he personifiesis not one to strike the primitive mind. Such inconsistencies arise when the deity, ceasing tobe immanent in the vegetation, comes to be regarded as its owner or lord; for the idea ofowning the vegetation naturally leads to that of subsisting on it. Sometimes the corn-spirit,originally conceived as immanent in the corn, afterwards comes to be regarded as itsowner, who lives on it and is reduced to poverty and want by being deprived of it. Hence heis often known as “the Poor Man” or “the Poor Woman.” Occasionally the last sheaf is leftstanding on the field for “the Poor Old Woman” or for “the Old Rye-woman.”Thus the representation of wood-spirits in the form of goats appears to be both widespreadand, to the primitive mind, natural. Therefore when we find, as we have done, thatDionysus—a tree-god—is sometimes represented in goat-form, we can hardly avoidconcluding that this representation is simply a part of his proper character as a tree-godand is not to be explained by the fusion of two distinct and independent worships, in one ofwhich he originally appeared as a tree-god and in the other as a goat."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"Dionysus was also figured, as we have seen, in the shape of a bull. After what has gonebefore we are naturally led to expect that his bull form must have been only anotherexpression for his character as a deity of vegetation, especially as the bull is a commonembodiment of the corn-spirit in Northern Europe; and the close association of Dionysuswith Demeter and Persephone in the mysteries of Eleusis shows that he had at least strongagricultural affinities.The probability of this view will be somewhat increased if it can be shown that in otherrites than those of Dionysus the ancients slew an OX as a representative of the spirit ofvegetation. This they appear to have done in the Athenian sacrifice known as “the murderof the OX” (bouphonia). It took place about the end of June or beginning of July, that is,about the time when the threshing is nearly over in Attica. According to tradition thesacrifice was instituted to procure a cessation of drought and dearth which had afflicted theland. The ritual was as follows. Barley mixed with wheat, or cakes made of them, were laidupon the bronze altar of Zeus Polieus on the Acropolis. Oxen were driven round the altar,and the OX which went up to the altar and ate the offering on it was sacrificed. The axeand knife with which the beast was slain had been previously wetted with water brought bymaidens called “water-carriers.” The weapons were then sharpened and handed to thebutchers, one of whom felled the OX with the axe and another cut its throat with the knife.As soon as he had felled the OX, the former threw the axe from him and fled; and the manwho cut the beast’s throat apparently imitated his example. Meantime the OX was skinnedand all present partook of its flesh. Then the hide was stuffed with straw and sewed up;next the stuffed animal was set on its feet and yoked to a plough as if it were ploughing. Atrial then took place in an ancient law-court presided over by the King (as he was called) todetermine who had murdered the OX. The maidens who had brought the water accusedthe men who had sharpened the axe and knife; the men who had sharpened the axe andknife blamed the men who had handed these implements to the butchers; the men who hadhanded the implements to the butchers blamed the butchers; and the butchers laid theblame on the axe and knife, which were accordingly found guilty, condemned, and cast intothe sea.The name of this sacrifice,— “the murder of the OX,”—the pains taken by each person whohad a hand in the slaughter to lay the blame on some one else, together with the formaltrial and punishment of the axe or knife or both, prove that the OX was here regarded notmerely as a victim offered to a god, but as itself a sacred creature, the slaughter of whichwas sacrilege or murder. This is borne out by a statement of Varro that to kill an OX wasformerly a capital crime in Attica. The mode of selecting the victim suggests that the OXwhich tasted the corn was viewed as the corn-deity taking possession of his own. Thisinterpretation is supported by the following custom. In Beauce, in the district of Orleans,on the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth of April they make a straw man called “the greatmondard.” For they say that the old mondard is now dead and it is necessary to make a newone. The straw man is carried in solemn procession up and down the village and at last isplaced upon the oldest apple-tree. There he remains till the apples are gathered, when he istaken down and thrown into the water, or he is burned and his ashes cast into water. Butthe person who plucks the first fruit from the tree succeeds to the title of “the greatmondard.” Here the straw figure, called “the great mondard” and placed on the oldestapple-tree in spring, represents the spirit of the tree, who, dead in winter, revives when the"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"apple-blossoms appear on the boughs. Thus the person who plucks the first fruit from thetree and thereby receives the name of “the great mondard” must be regarded as arepresentative of the tree-spirit. Primitive peoples are usually reluctant to taste the annualfirst-fruits of any crop, until some ceremony has been performed which makes it safe andpious for them to do so. The reason of this reluctance appears to be a belief that the first-fruits either belong to or actually contain a divinity. Therefore when a man or animal isseen boldly to appropriate the sacred first-fruits, he or it is naturally regarded as thedivinity himself in human or animal form taking possession of his own. The time of theAthenian sacrifice, which fell about the close of the threshing, suggests that the wheat andbarley laid upon the altar were a harvest offering; and the sacramental character of thesubsequent repast—all partaking of the flesh of the divine animal—would make it parallelto the harvest-suppers of modern Europe, in which, as we have seen, the flesh of the animalwhich stands for the corn-spirit is eaten by the harvesters. Again, the tradition that thesacrifice was instituted in order to put an end to drought and famine is in favour of takingit as a harvest festival. The resurrection of the corn-spirit, enacted by setting up the stuffedOX and yoking it to the plough, may be compared with the resurrection of the tree-spirit inthe person of his representative, the Wild Man.The OX appears as a representative of the corn-spirit in other parts of the world. At GreatBassam, in Guinea, two oxen are slain annually to procure a good harvest. If the sacrifice isto be effectual, it is necessary that the oxen should weep. So all the women of the village sitin front of the beasts, chanting, “The OX will weep; yes, he will weep!” From time to timeone of the women walks round the beasts, throwing manioc meal or palm wine upon them,especially into their eyes. When tears roll down from the eyes of the oxen, the people dance,singing, “The OX weeps! the OX weeps!” Then two men seize the tails of the beasts and cutthem off at one blow. It is believed that a great misfortune will happen in the course of theyear if the tails are not severed at one blow. The oxen are afterwards killed, and their fleshis eaten by the chiefs. Here the tears of the oxen, like those of the human victims amongstthe Khonds and the Aztecs, are probably a rain-charm. We have already seen that thevirtue of the corn-spirit, embodied in animal form, is sometimes supposed to reside in thetail, and that the last handful of corn is sometimes conceived as the tail of the corn-spirit. Inthe Mithraic religion this conception is graphically set forth in some of the numeroussculptures which represent Mithras kneeling on the back of a bull and plunging a knife intoits flank; for on certain of these monuments the tail of the bull ends in three stalks of corn,and in one of them corn-stalks instead of blood are seen issuing from the wound inflictedby the knife. Such representations certainly suggest that the bull, whose sacrifice appearsto have formed a leading feature in the Mithraic ritual, was conceived, in one at least of itsaspects, as an incarnation of the corn-spirit.Still more clearly does the ox appear as a personification of the corn-spirit in a ceremonywhich is observed in all the provinces and districts of China to welcome the approach ofspring. On the first day of spring, usually on the third or fourth of February, which is alsothe beginning of the Chinese New Year, the governor or prefect of the city goes inprocession to the east gate of the city, and sacrifices to the Divine Husbandman, who isrepresented with a bull’s head on the body of a man. A large effigy of an ox, cow, or buffalohas been prepared for the occasion, and stands outside of the east gate, with agriculturalimplements beside it. The figure is made of differently-coloured pieces of paper pasted on a"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"framework either by a blind man or according to the directions of a necromancer. Thecolours of the paper prognosticate the character of the coming year; if red prevails, therewill be many fires; if white, there will be floods and rain; and so with the other colours. Themandarins walk slowly round the ox, beating it severely at each step with rods of varioushues. It is filled with five kinds of grain, which pour forth when the effigy is broken by theblows of the rods. The paper fragments are then set on fire, and a scramble takes place forthe burning fragments, because the people believe that whoever gets one of them is sure tobe fortunate throughout the year. A live buffalo is next killed, and its flesh is dividedamong the mandarins. According to one account, the effigy of the ox is made of clay, and,after being beaten by the governor, is stoned by the people till they break it in pieces, “fromwhich they expect an abundant year.” Here the corn-spirit appears to be plainlyrepresented by the corn-filled ox, whose fragments may therefore be supposed to bringfertility with them.On the whole we may perhaps conclude that both as a goat and as a bull Dionysus wasessentially a god of vegetation. The Chinese and European customs which I have cited mayperhaps shed light on the custom of rending a live bull or goat at the rites of Dionysus. Theanimal was torn in fragments, as the Khond victim was cut in pieces, in order that theworshippers might each secure a portion of the life-giving and fertilising influence of thegod. The flesh was eaten raw as a sacrament, and we may conjecture that some of it wastaken home to be buried in the fields, or otherwise employed so as to convey to the fruits ofthe earth the quickening influence of the god of vegetation. The resurrection of Dionysus,related in his myth, may have been enacted in his rites by stuffing and setting up the slainox, as was done at the Athenian bouphonia.2. Demeter, the Pig and the HorsePASSING next to the corn-goddess Demeter, and remembering that in European folk-lorethe pig is a common embodiment of the corn-spirit, we may now ask whether the pig, whichwas so closely associated with Demeter, may not have been originally the goddess herself inanimal form. The pig was sacred to her; in art she was portrayed carrying or accompaniedby a pig; and the pig was regularly sacrificed in her mysteries, the reason assigned beingthat the pig injures the corn and is therefore an enemy of the goddess. But after an animalhas been conceived as a god, or a god as an animal, it sometimes happens, as we have seen,that the god sloughs off his animal form and becomes purely anthropomorphic; and thatthen the animal, which at first had been slain in the character of the god, comes to beviewed as a victim offered to the god on the ground of its hostility to the deity; in short, thegod is sacrificed to himself on the ground that he is his own enemy. This happened toDionysus, and it may have happened to Demeter also. And in fact the rites of one of herfestivals, the Thesmophoria, bear out the view that originally the pig was an embodiment ofthe corn-goddess herself, either Demeter or her daughter and double Persephone. The AtticThesmophoria was an autumn festival, celebrated by women alone in October, and appearsto have represented with mourning rites the descent of Persephone (or Demeter) into thelower world, and with joy her return from the dead. Hence the name Descent or Ascentvariously applied to the first, and the name Kalligeneia (fair-born) applied to the third dayof the festival. Now it was customary at the Thesmophoria to throw pigs, cakes of dough,"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"and branches of pine-trees into “the chasms of Demeter and Persephone,” which appear tohave been sacred caverns or vaults. In these caverns or vaults there were said to beserpents, which guarded the caverns and consumed most of the flesh of the pigs and dough-cakes which were thrown in. Afterwards—apparently at the next annual festival—thedecayed remains of the pigs, the cakes, and the pine-branches were fetched by womencalled “drawers,” who, after observing rules of ceremonial purity for three days, descendedinto the caverns, and, frightening away the serpents by clapping their hands, brought upthe remains and placed them on the altar. Whoever got a piece of the decayed flesh andcakes, and sowed it with the seed-corn in his field, was believed to be sure of a good crop.To explain the rude and ancient ritual of the Thesmophoria the following legend was told.At the moment when Pluto carried off Persephone, a swineherd called Eubuleus chanced tobe herding his swine on the spot, and his herd was engulfed in the chasm down which Plutovanished with Persephone. Accordingly at the Thesmophoria pigs were annually throwninto caverns to commemorate the disappearance of the swine of Eubuleus. It follows fromthis that the casting of the pigs into the vaults at the Thesmophoria formed part of thedramatic representation of Persephone’s descent into the lower world; and as no image ofPersephone appears to have been thrown in, we may infer that the descent of the pigs wasnot so much an accompaniment of her descent as the descent itself, in short, that the pigswere Persephone. Afterwards when Persephone or Demeter (for the two are equivalent)took on human form, a reason had to be found for the custom of throwing pigs into cavernsat her festival; and this was done by saying that when Pluto carried off Persephone therehappened to be some swine browsing near, which were swallowed up along with her. Thestory is obviously a forced and awkward attempt to bridge over the gulf between the oldconception of the corn-spirit as a pig and the new conception of her as an anthropomorphicgoddess. A trace of the older conception survived in the legend that when the sad motherwas searching for traces of the vanished Persephone, the footprints of the lost one wereobliterated by the footprints of a pig; originally, we may conjecture, the footprints of thepig were the footprints of Persephone and of Demeter herself. A consciousness of theintimate connexion of the pig with the corn lurks in the legend that the swineherd Eubuleuswas a brother of Triptolemus, to whom Demeter first imparted the secret of the corn.Indeed, according to one version of the story, Eubuleus himself received, jointly with hisbrother Triptolemus, the gift of the corn from Demeter as a reward for revealing to her thefate of Persephone. Further, it is to be noted that at the Thesmophoria the women appearto have eaten swine’s flesh. The meal, if I am right, must have been a solemn sacrament orcommunion, the worshippers partaking of the body of the god.As thus explained, the Thesmophoria has its analogies in the folk-customs of NorthernEurope which have been already described. Just as at the Thesmophoria—an autumnfestival in honour of the corn-goddess—swine’s flesh was partly eaten, partly kept incaverns till the following year, when it was taken up to be sown with the seed-corn in thefields for the purpose of securing a good crop; so in the neighbourhood of Grenoble thegoat killed on the harvest-field is partly eaten at the harvest-supper, partly pickled andkept till the next harvest; so at Pouilly the ox killed on the harvest-field is partly eaten bythe harvesters, partly pickled and kept till the first day of sowing in spring, probably to bethen mixed with the seed, or eaten by the ploughmen, or both; so at Udvarhely the feathersof the cock which is killed in the last sheaf at harvest are kept till spring, and then sown"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"with the seed on the field; so in Hesse and Meiningen the flesh of pigs is eaten on AshWednesday or Candlemas, and the bones are kept till sowing-time, when they are put intothe field sown or mixed with the seed in the bag; so, lastly, the corn from the last sheaf iskept till Christmas, made into the Yule Boar, and afterwards broken and mixed with theseed-corn at sowing in spring. Thus, to put it generally, the corn-spirit is killed in animalform in autumn; part of his flesh is eaten as a sacrament by his worshippers; and part of itis kept till next sowing-time or harvest as a pledge and security for the continuance orrenewal of the corn-spirit’s energies.If persons of fastidious taste should object that the Greeks never could have conceivedDemeter and Persephone to be embodied in the form of pigs, it may be answered that in thecave of Phigalia in Arcadia the Black Demeter was portrayed with the head and mane of ahorse on the body of a woman. Between the portraits of a goddess as a pig, and the portraitof her as a woman with a horse’s head, there is little to choose in respect of barbarism. Thelegend told of the Phigalian Demeter indicates that the horse was one of the animal formsassumed in ancient Greece, as in modern Europe, by the cornspirit. It was said that in hersearch for her daughter, Demeter assumed the form of a mare to escape the addresses ofPoseidon, and that, offended at his importunity, she withdrew in dudgeon to a cave not farfrom Phigalia in the highlands of Western Arcadia. There, robed in black, she tarried solong that the fruits of the earth were perishing, and mankind would have died of famine ifPan had not soothed the angry goddess and persuaded her to quit the cave. In memory ofthis event, the Phigalians set up an image of the Black Demeter in the cave; it represented awoman dressed in a long robe, with the head and mane of a horse. The Black Demeter, inwhose absence the fruits of the earth perish, is plainly a mythical expression for the barewintry earth stripped of its summer mantle of green.3. Attis, Adonis, and the PigPASSING now to Attis and Adonis, we may note a few facts which seem to show that thesedeities of vegetation had also, like other deities of the same class, their animalembodiments. The worshippers of Attis abstained from eating the flesh of swine. Thisappears to indicate that the pig was regarded as an embodiment of Attis. And the legendthat Attis was killed by a boar points in the same direction. For after the examples of thegoat Dionysus and the pig Demeter it may almost be laid down as a rule that an animalwhich is said to have injured a god was originally the god himself. Perhaps the cry of “HyesAttes! Hyes Attes!” which was raised by the worshippers of Attis, may be neither more norless than “Pig Attis! Pig Attis!”—hyes being possibly a Phrygian form of the Greek hy ̄s, “apig.”In regard to Adonis, his connexion with the boar was not always explained by the story thathe had been killed by the animal. According to another story, a boar rent with his tusk thebark of the tree in which the infant Adonis was born. According to yet another story, heperished at the hands of Hephaestus on Mount Lebanon while he was hunting wild boars.These variations in the legend serve to show that, while the connexion of the boar withAdonis was certain, the reason of the connexion was not understood, and that consequentlydifferent stories were devised to explain it. Certainly the pig ranked as a sacred animal"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"among the Syrians. At the great religious metropolis of Hierapolis on the Euphrates pigswere neither sacrificed nor eaten, and if a man touched a pig he was unclean for the rest ofthe day. Some people said this was because the pigs were unclean; others said it wasbecause the pigs were sacred. This difference of opinion points to a hazy state of religiousthought in which the ideas of sanctity and uncleanness are not yet sharply distinguished,both being blent in a sort of vaporous solution to which we give the name of taboo. It isquite consistent with this that the pig should have been held to be an embodiment of thedivine Adonis, and the analogies of Dionysus and Demeter make it probable that the storyof the hostility of the animal to the god was only a late misapprehension of the old view ofthe god as embodied in a pig. The rule that pigs were not sacrificed or eaten byworshippers of Attis and presumably of Adonis, does not exclude the possibility that inthese rituals the pig was slain on solemn occasions as a representative of the god andconsumed sacramentally by the worshippers. Indeed, the sacramental killing and eating ofan animal implies that the animal is sacred, and that, as a general rule, it is spared.The attitude of the Jews to the pig was as ambiguous as that of the heathen Syrians towardsthe same animal. The Greeks could not decide whether the Jews worshipped swine orabominated them. On the one hand they might not eat swine; but on the other hand theymight not kill them. And if the former rule speaks for the uncleanness, the latter speaksstill more strongly for the sanctity of the animal. For whereas both rules may, and one rulemust, be explained on the supposition that the pig was sacred; neither rule must, and onerule cannot, be explained on the supposition that the pig was unclean. If, therefore, weprefer the former supposition, we must conclude that, originally at least, the pig wasrevered rather than abhorred by the Israelites. We are confirmed in this opinion byobserving that down to the time of Isaiah some of the Jews used to meet secretly in gardensto eat the flesh of swine and mice as a religious rite. Doubtless this was a very ancientceremony, dating from a time when both the pig and the mouse were venerated as divine,and when their flesh was partaken of sacramentally on rare and solemn occasions as thebody and blood of gods. And in general it may perhaps be said that all so-called uncleananimals were originally sacred; the reason for not eating them was that they were divine.4. Osiris, the Pig and the BullIN ANCIENT Egypt, within historical times, the pig occupied the same dubious position asin Syria and Palestine, though at first sight its uncleanness is more prominent than itssanctity. The Egyptians are generally said by Greek writers to have abhorred the pig as afoul and loathsome animal. If a man so much as touched a pig in passing, he stepped intothe river with all his clothes on, to wash off the taint. To drink pig’s milk was believed tocause leprosy to the drinker. Swineherds, though natives of Egypt, were forbidden to enterany temple, and they were the only men who were thus excluded. No one would give hisdaughter in marriage to a swineherd, or marry a swineherd’s daughter; the swineherdsmarried among themselves. Yet once a year the Egyptians sacrificed pigs to the moon andto Osiris, and not only sacrificed them, but ate of their flesh, though on any other day of theyear they would neither sacrifice them nor taste of their flesh. Those who were too poor tooffer a pig on this day baked cakes of dough, and offered them instead. This can hardly beexplained except by the supposition that the pig was a sacred animal which was eaten"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"sacramentally by his worshippers once a year.The view that in Egypt the pig was sacred is borne out by the very facts which, to moderns,might seem to prove the contrary. Thus the Egyptians thought, as we have seen, that todrink pig’s milk produced leprosy. But exactly analogous views are held by savages aboutthe animals and plants which they deem most sacred. Thus in the island of Wetar (betweenNew Guinea and Celebes) people believe themselves to be variously descended from wildpigs, serpents, crocodiles, turtles, dogs, and eels; a man may not eat an animal of the kindfrom which he is descended; if he does so, he will become a leper, and go mad. Amongst theOmaha Indians of North America men whose totem is the elk, believe that if they ate theflesh of the male elk they would break out in boils and white spots in different parts of theirbodies. In the same tribe men whose totem is the red maize, think that if they ate red maizethey would have running sores all round their mouths. The Bush negroes of Surinam, whopractise totemism, believe that if they ate the capiaï (an animal like a pig) it would givethem leprosy; perhaps the capiaï is one of their totems. The Syrians, in antiquity, whoesteemed fish sacred, thought that if they ate fish their bodies would break out in ulcers,and their feet and stomach would swell up. The Chasas of Orissa believe that if they wereto injure their totemic animal they would be attacked by leprosy and their line would dieout. These examples prove that the eating of a sacred animal is often believed to produceleprosy or other skin-diseases; so far, therefore, they support the view that the pig musthave been sacred in Egypt, since the effect of drinking its milk was believed to be leprosy.Again, the rule that, after touching a pig, a man had to wash himself and his clothes, alsofavours the view of the sanctity of the pig. For it is a common belief that the effect ofcontact with a sacred object must be removed, by washing or otherwise, before a man isfree to mingle with his fellows. Thus the Jews wash their hands after reading the sacredscriptures. Before coming forth from the tabernacle after the sin-offering, the high priesthad to wash himself, and put off the garments which he had worn in the holy place. It was arule of Greek ritual that, in offering an expiatory sacrifice, the sacrificer should not touchthe sacrifice, and that, after the offering was made, he must wash his body and his clothesin a river or spring before he could enter a city or his own house. The Polynesians feltstrongly the need of ridding themselves of the sacred contagion, if it may be so called,which they caught by touching sacred objects. Various ceremonies were performed for thepurpose of removing this contagion. We have seen, for example, how in Tonga a man whohappened to touch a sacred chief, or anything personally belonging to him, had to performa certain ceremony before he could feed himself with his hands; otherwise it was believedthat he would swell up and die, or at least be afflicted with scrofula or some other disease.We have seen, too, what fatal effects are supposed to follow, and do actually follow, fromcontact with a sacred object in New Zealand. In short, primitive man believes that what issacred is dangerous; it is pervaded by a sort of electrical sanctity which communicates ashock to, even if it does not kill, whatever comes in contact with it. Hence the savage isunwilling to touch or even to see that which he deems peculiarly holy. Thus Bechuanas, ofthe Crocodile clan, think it “hateful and unlucky” to meet or see a crocodile; the sight isthought to cause inflammation of the eyes. Yet the crocodile is their most sacred object;they call it their father, swear by it, and celebrate it in their festivals. The goat is the sacredanimal of the Madenassana Bushmen; yet “to look upon it would be to render the man forthe time impure, as well as to cause him undefined uneasiness.” The Elk clan, among the"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"Omaha Indians, believe that even to touch the male elk would be followed by an eruption ofboils and white spots on the body. Members of the Reptile clan in the same tribe think thatif one of them touches or smells a snake, it will make his hair white. In Samoa people whosegod was a butterfly believed that if they caught a butterfly it would strike them dead.Again, in Samoa the reddish-seared leaves of the banana-tree were commonly used asplates for handing food; but if any member of the Wild Pigeon family had used bananaleaves for this purpose, it was supposed that he would suffer from rheumatic swellings oran eruption all over the body like chicken-pox. The Mori clan of the Bhils in Central Indiaworship the peacock as their totem and make offerings of grain to it; yet members of theclan believe that were they even to set foot on the tracks of a peacock they wouldafterwards suffer from some disease, and if a woman sees a peacock she must veil her faceand look away. Thus the primitive mind seems to conceive of holiness as a sort ofdangerous virus, which a prudent man will shun as far as possible, and of which, if heshould chance to be infected by it, he will carefully disinfect himself by some form ofceremonial purification.In the light of these parallels the beliefs and customs of the Egyptians touching the pig areprobably to be explained as based upon an opinion of the extreme sanctity rather than ofthe extreme uncleanness of the animal; or rather, to put it more correctly, they imply thatthe animal was looked on, not simply as a filthy and disgusting creature, but as a beingendowed with high supernatural powers, and that as such it was regarded with thatprimitive sentiment of religious awe and fear in which the feelings of reverence andabhorrence are almost equally blended. The ancients themselves seem to have been awarethat there was another side to the horror with which swine seemed to inspire the Egyptians.For the Greek astronomer and mathematician Eudoxus, who resided fourteen months inEgypt and conversed with the priests, was of opinion that the Egyptians spared the pig, notout of abhorrence, but from a regard to its utility in agriculture; for, according to him,when the Nile had subsided, herds of swine were turned loose over the fields to tread theseed down into the moist earth. But when a being is thus the object of mixed and implicitlycontradictory feelings, he may be said to occupy a position of unstable equilibrium. Incourse of time one of the contradictory feelings is likely to prevail over the other, andaccording as the feeling which finally predominates is that of reverence or abhorrence, thebeing who is the object of it will rise into a god or sink into a devil. The latter, on the whole,was the fate of the pig in Egypt. For in historical times the fear and horror of the pig seemcertainly to have outweighed the reverence and worship of which he may once have beenthe object, and of which, even in his fallen state, he never quite lost trace. He came to belooked on as an embodiment of Set or Typhon, the Egyptian devil and enemy of Osiris. Forit was in the shape of a black pig that Typhon injured the eye of the god Horus, whoburned him and instituted the sacrifice of the pig, the sun-god Ra having declared the beastabominable. Again, the story that Typhon was hunting a boar when he discovered andmangled the body of Osiris, and that this was the reason why pigs were sacrificed once ayear, is clearly a modernised version of an older story that Osiris, like Adonis and Attis,was slain or mangled by a boar, or by Typhon in the form of a boar. Thus, the annualsacrifice of a pig to Osiris might naturally be interpreted as vengeance inflicted on thehostile animal that had slain or mangled the god. But, in the first place, when an animal isthus killed as a solemn sacrifice once and once only in the year, it generally or alwaysmeans that the animal is divine, that he is spared and respected the rest of the year as a god"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"and slain, when he is slain, also in the character of a god. In the second place, the examplesof Dionysus and Demeter, if not of Attis and Adonis, have taught us that the animal whichis sacrificed to a god on the ground that he is the god’s enemy may have been, andprobably was, originally the god himself. Therefore, the annual sacrifice of a pig to Osiris,coupled with the alleged hostility of the animal to the god, tends to show, first, thatoriginally the pig was a god, and, second, that he was Osiris. At a later age, when Osirisbecame anthropomorphic and his original relation to the pig had been forgotten, theanimal was first distinguished from him, and afterwards opposed as an enemy to him bymythologists who could think of no reason for killing a beast in connexion with the worshipof a god except that the beast was the god’s enemy; or, as Plutarch puts it, not that which isdear to the gods, but that which is the contrary, is fit to be sacrificed. At this later stage thehavoc which a wild boar notoriously makes amongst the corn would supply a plausiblereason for regarding him as the foe of the corn-spirit, though originally, if I am right, thevery freedom with which the boar ranged at will through the corn led people to identifyhim with the corn-spirit, to whom he was afterwards opposed as an enemy.The view which identifies the pig with Osiris derives not a little support from the sacrificeof pigs to him on the very day on which, according to tradition, Osiris himself was killed;for thus the killing of the pig was the annual representation of the killing of Osiris, just asthe throwing of the pigs into the caverns at the Thesmophoria was an annualrepresentation of the descent of Persephone into the lower world; and both customs areparallel to the European practice of killing a goat, cock, and so forth, at harvest as arepresentative of the corn-spirit.Again, the theory that the pig, originally Osiris himself, afterwards came to be regarded asan embodiment of his enemy Typhon, is supported by the similar relation of red-hairedmen and red oxen to Typhon. For in regard to the red-haired men who were burned andwhose ashes were scattered with winnowing-fans, we have seen fair grounds for believingthat originally, like the red-haired puppies killed at Rome in spring, they wererepresentatives of the corn-spirit himself that is, of Osiris, and were slain for the expresspurpose of making the corn turn red or golden. Yet at a later time these men wereexplained to be representatives, not of Osiris, but of his enemy Typhon, and the killing ofthem was regarded as an act of vengeance inflicted on the enemy of the god. Similarly, thered oxen sacrificed by the Egyptians were said to be offered on the ground of theirresemblance to Typhon; though it is more likely that originally they were slain on theground of their resemblance to the corn-spirit Osiris. We have seen that the ox is acommon representative of the corn-spirit and is slain as such on the harvest-field.Osiris was regularly identified with the bull Apis of Memphis and the bull Mnevis ofHeliopolis. But it is hard to say whether these bulls were embodiments of him as the corn-spirit, as the red oxen appear to have been, or whether they were not in origin entirelydistinct deities who came to be fused with Osiris at a later time. The universality of theworship of these two bulls seems to put them on a different footing from the ordinarysacred animals whose worships were purely local. But whatever the original relation ofApis to Osiris may have been, there is one fact about the former which ought not to bepassed over in a disquisition on the custom of killing a god. Although the bull Apis wasworshipped as a god with much pomp and profound reverence, he was not suffered to live"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"beyond a certain length of time which was prescribed by the sacred books, and on theexpiry of which he was drowned in a holy spring. The limit, according to Plutarch, wastwenty-five years; but it cannot always have been enforced, for the tombs of the Apis bullshave been discovered in modern times, and from the inscriptions on them it appears that inthe twenty-second dynasty two of the holy steers lived more than twenty-six years.5. Virbius and the HorseWE are now in a position to hazard a conjecture as to the meaning of the tradition thatVirbius, the first of the divine Kings of the Wood at Aricia, had been killed in the characterof Hippolytus by horses. Having found, first, that spirits of the corn are not infrequentlyrepresented in the form of horses; and, second, that the animal which in later legends issaid to have injured the god was sometimes originally the god himself, we may conjecturethat the horses by which Virbius or Hippolytus was said to have been slain were reallyembodiments of him as a deity of vegetation. The myth that he had been killed by horseswas probably invented to explain certain features in his worship, amongst others thecustom of excluding horses from his sacred grove. For myth changes while custom remainsconstant; men continue to do what their fathers did before them, though the reasons onwhich their fathers acted have been long forgotten. The history of religion is a long attemptto reconcile old custom with new reason, to find a sound theory for an absurd practice. Inthe case before us we may be sure that the myth is more modern than the custom and by nomeans represents the original reason for excluding horses from the grove. From theirexclusion it might be inferred that horses could not be the sacred animals or embodimentsof the god of the grove. But the inference would be rash. The goat was at one time a sacredanimal or embodiment of Athena, as may be inferred from the practice of representing thegoddess clad in a goat-skin (aegis). Yet the goat was neither sacrificed to her as a rule, norallowed to enter her great sanctuary, the Acropolis at Athens. The reason alleged for thiswas that the goat injured the olive, the sacred tree of Athena. So far, therefore, the relationof the goat to Athena is parallel to the relation of the horse to Virbius, both animals beingexcluded from the sanctuary on the ground of injury done by them to the god. But fromVarro we learn that there was an exception to the rule which excluded the goat from theAcropolis. Once a year, he says, the goat was driven on to the Acropolis for a necessarysacrifice. Now, as has been remarked before, when an animal is sacrificed once and onceonly in the year, it is probably slain, not as a victim offered to the god, but as arepresentative of the god himself. Therefore we may infer that if a goat was sacrificed onthe Acropolis once a year, it was sacrificed in the character of Athena herself; and it maybe conjectured that the skin of the sacrificed animal was placed on the statue of the goddessand formed the aegis, which would thus be renewed annually. Similarly at Thebes in Egyptrams were sacred and were not sacrificed. But on one day in the year a ram was killed, andits skin was placed on the statue of the god Ammon. Now, if we knew the ritual of theArician grove better, we might find that the rule of excluding horses from it, like the rule ofexcluding goats from the Acropolis at Athens, was subject to an annual exception, a horsebeing once a year taken into the grove and sacrificed as an embodiment of the god Virbius.By the usual misunderstanding the horse thus killed would come in time to be regarded asan enemy offered up in sacrifice to the god whom he had injured, like the pig which was"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"sacrificed to Demeter and Osiris or the goat which was sacrificed to Dionysus, and possiblyto Athena. It is so easy for a writer to record a rule without noticing an exception that weneed not wonder at finding the rule of the Arician grove recorded without any mention ofan exception such as I suppose. If we had had only the statements of Athenaeus and Pliny,we should have known only the rule which forbade the sacrifice of goats to Athena andexcluded them from the Acropolis, without being aware of the important exception whichthe fortunate preservation of Varro’s work has revealed to us.The conjecture that once a year a horse may have been sacrificed in the Arician grove as arepresentative of the deity of the grove derives some support from the similar sacrifice of ahorse which took place once a year at Rome. On the fifteenth of October in each year achariot-race was run on the Field of Mars. Stabbed with a spear, the right-hand horse ofthe victorious team was then sacrificed to Mars for the purpose of ensuring good crops, andits head was cut off and adorned with a string of loaves. Thereupon the inhabitants of twowards—the Sacred Way and the Subura—contended with each other who should get thehead. If the people of the Sacred Way got it, they fastened it to a wall of the king’s house; ifthe people of the Subura got it, they fastened it to the Mamilian tower. The horse’s tail wascut off and carried to the king’s house with such speed that the blood dripped on the hearthof the house. Further, it appears that the blood of the horse was caught and preserved tillthe twenty-first of April, when the Vestal Virgins mixed it with the blood of the unborncalves which had been sacrificed six days before. The mixture was then distributed toshepherds, and used by them for fumigating their flocks.In this ceremony the decoration of the horse’s head with a string of loaves, and the allegedobject of the sacrifice, namely, to procure a good harvest, seem to indicate that the horsewas killed as one of those animal representatives of the corn-spirit of which we have foundso many examples. The custom of cutting off the horse’s tail is like the African custom ofcutting off the tails of the oxen and sacrificing them to obtain a good crop. In both theRoman and the African custom the animal apparently stands for the corn-spirit, and itsfructifying power is supposed to reside especially in its tail. The latter idea occurs, as wehave seen, in European folk-lore. Again, the practice of fumigating the cattle in spring withthe blood of the horse may be compared with the practice of giving the Old Wife, theMaiden, or the clyack sheaf as fodder to the horses in spring or the cattle at Christmas, andgiving the Yule Boar to the ploughing oxen or horses to eat in spring. All these usages aimat ensuring the blessing of the corn-spirit on the homestead and its inmates and storing itup for another year.The Roman sacrifice of the October horse, as it was called, carries us back to the early dayswhen the Subura, afterwards a low and squalid quarter of the great metropolis, was still aseparate village, whose inhabitants engaged in a friendly contest on the harvest-field withtheir neighbours of Rome, then a little rural town. The Field of Mars on which theceremony took place lay beside the Tiber, and formed part of the king’s domain down tothe abolition of the monarchy. For tradition ran that at the time when the last of the kingswas driven from Rome, the corn stood ripe for the sickle on the crown lands beside theriver; but no one would eat the accursed grain and it was flung into the river in such heapsthat, the water being low with the summer heat, it formed the nucleus of an island. Thehorse sacrifice was thus an old autumn custom observed upon the king’s corn-fields at the"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"end of the harvest. The tail and blood of the horse, as the chief parts of the corn-spirit’srepresentative, were taken to the king’s house and kept there; just as in Germany theharvest-cock is nailed on the gable or over the door of the farmhouse; and as the last sheaf,in the form of the Maiden, is carried home and kept over the fireplace in the Highlands ofScotland. Thus the blessing of the corn-spirit was brought to the king’s house and hearthand, through them, to the community of which he was the head. Similarly in the spring andautumn customs of Northern Europe the May-pole is sometimes set up in front of the houseof the mayor or burgomaster, and the last sheaf at harvest is brought to him as the head ofthe village. But while the tail and blood fell to the king, the neighbouring village of theSubura, which no doubt once had a similar ceremony of its own, was gratified by beingallowed to compete for the prize of the horse’s head. The Mamilian tower, to which theSuburans nailed the horse’s head when they succeeded in carrying it off, appears to havebeen a peel-tower or keep of the old Mamilian family, the magnates of the village. Theceremony thus performed on the king’s fields and at his house on behalf of the whole townand of the neighbouring village presupposes a time when each township performed asimilar ceremony on its own fields. In the rural districts of Latium the villages may havecontinued to observe the custom, each on its own land, long after the Roman hamlets hadmerged their separate harvest-homes in the common celebration on the king’s lands. Thereis no intrinsic improbability in the supposition that the sacred grove of Aricia, like theField of Mars at Rome, may have been the scene of a common harvest celebration, at whicha horse was sacrificed with the same rude rites on behalf of the neighbouring villages. Thehorse would represent the fructifying spirit both of the tree and of the corn, for the twoideas melt into each other, as we see in customs like the Harvest-May.L. Eating the God1. The Sacrament of First-FruitsWE have now seen that the corn-spirit is represented sometimes in human, sometimes inanimal form, and that in both cases he is killed in the person of his representative andeaten sacramentally. To find examples of actually killing the human representative of thecorn-spirit we had naturally to go to savage races; but the harvest-suppers of our Europeanpeasants have furnished unmistakable examples of the sacramental eating of animals asrepresentatives of the corn-spirit. But further, as might have been anticipated, the newcorn is itself eaten sacramentally, that is, as the body of the corn-spirit. In Wermland,Sweden, the farmer’s wife uses the grain of the last sheaf to bake a loaf in the shape of alittle girl; this loaf is divided amongst the whole household and eaten by them. Here the loafrepresents the corn-spirit conceived as a maiden; just as in Scotland the corn-spirit issimilarly conceived and represented by the last sheaf made up in the form of a woman andbearing the name of the Maiden. As usual, the corn-spirit is believed to reside in the lastsheaf; and to eat a loaf made from the last sheaf is, therefore, to eat the corn-spirit itself.Similarly at La Palisse, in France, a man made of dough is hung upon the fir-tree which iscarried on the last harvest-waggon.

In other cases,though the new corn is not baked in loaves of human shape, still the solemn ceremonieswith which it is eaten suffice to indicate that it is partaken of sacramentally, that is, as thebody of the corn-spirit. For example, the following ceremonies used to be observed byLithuanian peasants at eating the new corn. About the time of the autumn sowing, when allthe corn had been got in and the threshing had begun, each farmer held a festival calledSabarios, that is, “the mixing or throwing together.” He took nine good handfuls of eachkind of crop—wheat, barley, oats, flax, beans, lentils, and the rest; and each handful hedivided into three parts. The twentyseven portions of each grain were then thrown on aheap and all mixed up together. The grain used had to be that which was first threshed andwinnowed and which had been set aside and kept for this purpose. A part of the grain thusmixed was employed to bake little loaves, one for each of the household; the rest was mixedwith more barley or oats and made into beer. The first beer brewed from this mixture wasfor the drinking of the farmer, his wife, and children; the second brew was for the servants.The beer being ready, the farmer chose an evening when no stranger was expected. Thenhe knelt down before the barrel of beer, drew a jugful of the liquor and poured it on thebung of the barrel, saying, “O fruitful earth, make rye and barley and all kinds of corn toflourish.” Next he took the jug to the parlour, where his wife and children awaited him. Onthe floor of the parlour lay bound a black or white or speckled (not a red) cock and a hen ofthe same colour and of the same brood, which must have been hatched within the year.Then the farmer knelt down, with the jug in his hand, and thanked God for the harvest andprayed for a good crop next year. Next all lifted up their hands and said, “O God, andthou, O earth, we give you this cock and hen as a free-will offering.” With that the farmerkilled the fowls with the blows of a wooden spoon, for he might not cut their heads off.After the first prayer and after killing each of the birds he poured out a third of the beer.Then his wife boiled the fowls in a new pot which had never been used before. After that, abushel was set, bottom upwards, on the floor, and on it were placed the little loavesmentioned above and the boiled fowls. Next the new beer was fetched, together with a ladleand three mugs, none of which was used except on this occasion. When the farmer hadladled the beer into the mugs, the family knelt down round the bushel. The father thenuttered a prayer and drank off the three mugs of beer. The rest followed his example. Thenthe loaves and the flesh of the fowls were eaten, after which the beer went round again, tillevery one had emptied each of the three mugs nine times. None of the food should remainover; but if anything did happen to be left, it was consumed next morning with the sameceremonies. The bones were given to the dog to eat; if he did not eat them all up, theremains were buried under the dung in the cattle-stall. This ceremony was observed at thebeginning of December. On the day on which it took place no bad word might be spoken.Such was the custom about two hundred years or more ago. At the present day inLithuania, when new potatoes or loaves made from the new corn are being eaten, all thepeople at table pull each other’s hair. The meaning of this last custom is obscure, but asimilar custom was certainly observed by the heathen Lithuanians at their solemnsacrifices. Many of the Esthonians of the island of Oesel will not eat bread baked of the newcorn till they have first taken a bite at a piece of iron. The iron is here plainly a charm,"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"intended to render harmless the spirit that is in the corn. In Sutherlandshire at the presentday, when the new potatoes are dug all the family must taste them, otherwise “the spirits inthem [the potatoes] take offence, and the potatoes would not keep.” In one part ofYorkshire it is still customary for the clergyman to cut the first corn; and my informantbelieves that the corn so cut is used to make the communion bread. If the latter part of thecustom is correctly reported (and analogy is all in its favour), it shows how the Christiancommunion has absorbed within itself a sacrament which is doubtless far older thanChristianity.The Aino or Ainu of Japan are said to distinguish various kinds of millet as male andfemale respectively, and these kinds, taken together, are called “the divine husband andwife cereal” (Umurek haru kamui). “Therefore before millet is pounded and made intocakes for general eating, the old men have a few made for themselves first to worship.When they are ready they pray to them very earnestly and say: ‘O thou cereal deity, weworship thee. Thou hast grown very well this year, and thy flavour will be sweet. Thou artgood. The goddess of fire will be glad, and we also shall rejoice greatly. O thou god, O thoudivine cereal, do thou nourish the people. I now partake of thee. I worship thee and givethee thanks.’ After having thus prayed, they, the worshippers, take a cake and eat it, andfrom this time the people may all partake of the new millet. And so with many gestures ofhomage and words of prayer this kind of food is dedicated to the well-being of the Ainu. Nodoubt the cereal offering is regarded as a tribute paid to a god, but that god is no otherthan the seed itself; and it is only a god in so far as it is beneficial to the human body.”At the close of the rice harvest in the East Indian island of Buru, each clan meets at acommon sacramental meal, to which every member of the clan is bound to contribute alittle of the new rice. This meal is called “eating the soul of the rice,” a name which clearlyindicates the sacramental character of the repast. Some of the rice is also set apart andoffered to the spirits. Amongst the Alfoors of Minahassa, in Celebes, the priest sows thefirst rice-seed and plucks the first ripe rice in each field. This rice he roasts and grinds intomeal, and gives some of it to each of the household. Shortly before the rice-harvest inBoland Mongondo, another district of Celebes, an offering is made of a small pig or a fowl.Then the priest plucks a little rice, first on his own field and next on those of hisneighbours. All the rice thus plucked by him he dries along with his own, and then gives itback to the respective owners, who have it ground and boiled. When it is boiled the womentake it back, with an egg, to the priest, who offers the egg in sacrifice and returns the rice tothe women. Of this rice every member of the family, down to the youngest child, mustpartake. After this ceremony every one is free to get in his rice.Amongst the Burghers or Badagas, a tribe of the Neilgherry Hills in Southern India, thefirst handful of seed is sown and the first sheaf reaped by a Curumbar, a man of a differenttribe, the members of which the Burghers regard as sorcerers. The grain contained in thefirst sheaf “is that day reduced to meal, made into cakes, and, being offered as a first-fruitoblation, is, together with the remainder of the sacrificed animal, partaken of by theBurgher and the whole of his family, as the meat of a federal offering and sacrifice.”Among the Hindoos of Southern India the eating of the new rice is the occasion of a familyfestival called Pongol. The new rice is boiled in a new pot on a fire which is kindled at noonon the day when, according to Hindoo astrologers, the sun enters the tropic of Capricorn."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"The boiling of the pot is watched with great anxiety by the whole family, for as the milkboils, so will the coming year be. If the milk boils rapidly, the year will be prosperous; butit will be the reverse if the milk boils slowly. Some of the new boiled rice is offered to theimage of Ganesa; then every one partakes of it. In some parts of Northern India the festivalof the new crop is known as Navan, that is, “new grain.” When the crop is ripe, the ownertakes the omens, goes to the field, plucks five or six ears of barley in the spring crop andone of the millets in the autumn harvest. This is brought home, parched, and mixed withcoarse sugar, butter, and curds. Some of it is thrown on the fire in the name of the villagegods and deceased ancestors; the rest is eaten by the family.The ceremony of eating the new yams at Onitsha, on the Niger, is thus described: “Eachheadman brought out six yams, and cut down young branches of palm-leaves and placedthem before his gate, roasted three of the yams, and got some kola-nuts and fish. After theyam is roasted, the Libia, or country doctor, takes the yam, scrapes it into a sort of meal,and divides it into halves; he then takes one piece, and places it on the lips of the personwho is going to eat the new yam. The eater then blows up the steam from the hot yam, andafterwards pokes the whole into his mouth, and says, ‘I thank God for being permitted toeat the new yam’; he then begins to chew it heartily, with fish likewise.”Among the Nandi of British East Africa, when the eleusine grain is ripening in autumn,every woman who owns a corn-field goes out into it with her daughters, and they all plucksome of the ripe grain. Each of the women then fixes one grain in her necklace and chewsanother, which she rubs on her forehead, throat, and breast. No mark of joy escapes them;sorrowfully they cut a basketful of the new corn, and carrying it home place it in the loft todry. As the ceiling is of wickerwork, a good deal of the grain drops through the crevicesand falls into the fire, where it explodes with a crackling noise. The people make no attemptto prevent this waste; for they regard the crackling of the grain in the fire as a sign that thesouls of the dead are partaking of it. A few days later porridge is made from the new grainand served up with milk at the evening meal. All the members of the family take some ofthe porridge and dab it on the walls and roofs of the huts; also they put a little in theirmouths and spit it out towards the east and on the outside of the huts. Then, holding upsome of the grain in his hand, the head of the family prays to God for health and strength,and likewise for milk, and everybody present repeats the words of the prayer after him.Amongst the Caffres of Natal and Zululand, no one may eat of the new fruits till after afestival which marks the beginning of the Caffre year and falls at the end of December orthe beginning of January. All the people assemble at the king’s kraal, where they feast anddance. Before they separate the “dedication of the people” takes place. Various fruits of theearth, as corn, mealies, and pumpkins, mixed with the flesh of a sacrificed animal and with“medicine,” are boiled in great pots, and a little of this food is placed in each man’s mouthby the king himself. After thus partaking of the sanctified fruits, a man is himself sanctifiedfor the whole year, and may immediately get in his crops. It is believed that if any manwere to partake of the new fruits before the festival, he would die; if he were detected, hewould be put to death, or at least all his cattle would be taken from him. The holiness of thenew fruits is well marked by the rule that they must be cooked in a special pot which isused only for this purpose, and on a new fire kindled by a magician through the friction oftwo sticks which are called “husband and wife.”"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"Among the Bechuanas it is a rule that before they partake of the new crops they mustpurify themselves. The purification takes place at the commencement of the new year on aday in January which is fixed by the chief. It begins in the great kraal of the tribe, where allthe adult males assemble. Each of them takes in his hand leaves of a gourd called by thenatives lerotse (described as something between a pumpkin and a vegetable marrow); andhaving crushed the leaves he anoints with the expressed juice his big toes and his navel;many people indeed apply the juice to all the joints of their body, but the better-informedsay that this is a vulgar departure from ancient custom. After this ceremony in the greatkraal every man goes home to his own kraal, assembles all the members of his family, men,women, and children, and smears them all with the juice of the lerotse leaves. Some of theleaves are also pounded, mixed with milk in a large wooden dish, and given to the dogs tolap up. Then the porridge plate of each member of the family is rubbed with the lerotseleaves. When this purification has been completed, but not before, the people are free to eatof the new crops.The Bororo Indians of Brazil think that it would be certain death to eat the new maizebefore it has been blessed by the medicine-man. The ceremony of blessing it is as follows.The half-ripe husk is washed and placed before the medicine-man, who by dancing andsinging for several hours, and by incessant smoking, works himself up into a state ofecstasy, whereupon he bites into the husk, trembling in every limb and uttering shrieksfrom time to time. A similar ceremony is performed whenever a large animal or a large fishis killed. The Bororo are firmly persuaded that were any man to touch unconsecratedmaize or meat, before the ceremony had been completed, he and his whole tribe wouldperish.Amongst the Creek Indians of North America, the busk or festival of first-fruits was thechief ceremony of the year. It was held in July or August, when the corn was ripe, andmarked the end of the old year and the beginning of the new one. Before it took place, noneof the Indians would eat or even handle any part of the new harvest. Sometimes each townhad its own busk; sometimes several towns united to hold one in common. Beforecelebrating the busk, the people provided themselves with new clothes and new householdutensils and furniture; they collected their old clothes and rubbish, together with all theremaining grain and other old provisions, cast them together in one common heap, andconsumed them with fire. As a preparation for the ceremony, all the fires in the villagewere extinguished, and the ashes swept clean away. In particular, the hearth or altar of thetemple was dug up and the ashes carried out. Then the chief priest put some roots of thebutton-snake plant, with some green tobacco leaves and a little of the new fruits, at thebottom of the fireplace, which he afterwards commanded to be covered up with white clay,and wetted over with clean water. A thick arbour of green branches of young trees wasthen made over the altar. Meanwhile the women at home were cleaning out their houses,renewing the old hearths, and scouring all the cooking vessels that they might be ready toreceive the new fire and the new fruits. The public or sacred square was carefully swept ofeven the smallest crumbs of previous feasts, “for fear of polluting the first-fruit offerings.”Also every vessel that had contained or had been used about any food during the expiringyear was removed from the temple before sunset. Then all the men who were not known tohave violated the law of the first-fruit offering and that of marriage during the year weresummoned by a crier to enter the holy square and observe a solemn fast. But the women"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"(except six old ones), the children, and all who had not attained the rank of warriors wereforbidden to enter the square. Sentinels were also posted at the corners of the square tokeep out all persons deemed impure and all animals. A strict fast was then observed fortwo nights and a day, the devotees drinking a bitter decoction of button-snake root “inorder to vomit and purge their sinful bodies.” That the people outside the square mightalso be purified, one of the old men laid down a quantity of green tobacco at a corner of thesquare; this was carried off by an old woman and distributed to the people without, whochewed and swallowed it “in order to afflict their souls.” During this general fast, thewomen, children, and men of weak constitution were allowed to eat after mid-day, but notbefore. On the morning when the fast ended, the women brought a quantity of the oldyear’s food to the outside of the sacred square. These provisions were then fetched in andset before the famished multitude, but all traces of them had to be removed before noon.When the sun was declining from the meridian, all the people were commanded by thevoice of a crier to stay within doors, to do no bad act, and to be sure to extinguish andthrow away every spark of the old fire. Universal silence now reigned. Then the high priestmade the new fire by the friction of two pieces of wood, and placed it on the altar under thegreen arbour. This new fire was believed to atone for all past crimes except murder. Next abasket of new fruits was brought; the high priest took out a little of each sort of fruit,rubbed it with bear’s oil, and offered it, together with some flesh, “to the bountiful holyspirit of fire, as a first-fruit offering, and an annual oblation for sin.” He also consecratedthe sacred emetics (the button-snake root and the cassina or black-drink) by pouring alittle of them into the fire. The persons who had remained outside now approached,without entering, the sacred square; and the chief priest thereupon made a speech,exhorting the people to observe their old rites and customs, announcing that the new divinefire had purged away the sins of the past year, and earnestly warning the women that, ifany of them had not extinguished the old fire, or had contracted any impurity, they mustforthwith depart, “lest the divine fire should spoil both them and the people.” Some of thenew fire was then set down outside the holy square; the women carried it home joyfully,and laid it on their unpolluted hearths. When several towns had united to celebrate thefestival, the new fire might thus be carried for several miles. The new fruits were thendressed on the new fires and eaten with bear’s oil, which was deemed indispensable. At onepoint of the festival the men rubbed the new corn between their hands, then on their facesand breasts. During the festival which followed, the warriors, dressed in their wild martialarray, their heads covered with white down and carrying white feathers in their hands,danced round the sacred arbour, under which burned the new fire. The ceremonies lastedeight days, during which the strictest continence was practised. Towards the conclusion ofthe festival the warriors fought a mock battle; then the men and women together, in threecircles, danced round the sacred fire. Lastly, all the people smeared themselves with whiteclay and bathed in running water. They came out of the water believing that no evil couldnow befall them for what they had done amiss in the past. So they departed in joy andpeace.To this day, also, the remnant of the Seminole Indians of Florida, a people of the samestock as the Creeks, hold an annual purification and festival called the Green Corn Dance,at which the new corn is eaten. On the evening of the first day of the festival they quaff anauseous “Black Drink,” as it is called, which acts both as an emetic and a purgative; theybelieve that he who does not drink of this liquor cannot safely eat the new green corn, and"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"besides that he will be sick at some time in the year. While the liquor is being drunk, thedancing begins, and the medicine-men join in it. Next day they eat of the green corn; thefollowing day they fast, probably from fear of polluting the sacred food in their stomachsby contact with common food; but the third day they hold a great feast.Even tribes which do not till the ground sometimes observe analogous ceremonies whenthey gather the first wild fruits or dig the first roots of the season. Thus among the Salishand Tinneh Indians of North-West America, “before the young people eat the first berriesor roots of the season, they always addressed the fruit or plant, and begged for its favourand aid. In some tribes regular First-fruit ceremonies were annually held at the time ofpicking the wild fruit or gathering the roots, and also among the salmon-eating tribes whenthe run of the ‘sockeye’ salmon began. These ceremonies were not so much thanksgivings,as performances to ensure a plentiful crop or supply of the particular object desired, for ifthey were not properly and reverently carried out there was danger of giving offence to the‘spirits’ of the objects, and being deprived of them.” For example, these Indians are fond ofthe young shoots or suckers of the wild raspberry, and they observe a solemn ceremony ateating the first of them in season. The shoots are cooked in a new pot: the people assembleand stand in a great circle with closed eyes, while the presiding chief or medicine-maninvokes the spirit of the plant, begging that it will be propitious to them and grant them agood supply of suckers. After this part of the ceremony is over the cooked suckers arehanded to the presiding officer in a newly carved dish, and a small portion is given to eachperson present, who reverently and decorously eats it.The Thompson Indians of British Columbia cook and eat the sunflower root(Balsamorrhiza sagittata, Nutt.), but they used to regard it as a mysterious being, andobserved a number of taboos in connexion with it; for example, women who were engagedin digging or cooking the root must practice continence, and no man might come near theoven where the women were baking the root. When young people ate the first berries,roots, or other products of the season, they addressed a prayer to the Sunflower-Root asfollows: “I inform thee that I intend to eat thee. Mayest thou always help me to ascend, sothat I may always be able to reach the tops of mountains, and may I never be clumsy! I askthis from thee, Sunflower-Root. Thou art the greatest of all in mystery.” To omit thisprayer would make the eater lazy and cause him to sleep long in the morning.These customs of the Thompson and other Indian tribes of North-West America areinstructive, because they clearly indicate the motive, or at least one of the motives, whichunderlies the ceremonies observed at eating the first fruits of the season. That motive in thecase of these Indians is simply a belief that the plant itself is animated by a conscious andmore or less powerful spirit, who must be propitiated before the people can safely partakeof the fruits or roots which are supposed to be part of his body. Now if this is true of wildfruits and roots, we may infer with some probability that it is also true of cultivated fruitsand roots, such as yams, and in particular that it holds good of the cereals, such as wheat,barley, oats, rice, and maize. In all cases it seems reasonable to infer that the scrupleswhich savages manifest at eating the first fruits of any crop, and the ceremonies which theyobserve before they overcome their scruples, are due at least in large measure to a notionthat the plant or tree is animated by a spirit or even a deity, whose leave must be obtained,or whose favour must be sought, before it is possible to partake with safety of the new crop."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"This indeed is plainly affirmed of the Aino: they call the millet “the divine cereal,” “thecereal deity,” and they pray to and worship him before they will eat of the cakes made fromthe new millet. And even where the indwelling divinity of the first fruits is not expresslyaffirmed, it appears to be implied both by the solemn preparations made for eating themand by the danger supposed to be incurred by persons who venture to partake of themwithout observing the prescribed ritual. In all such cases, accordingly, we may notimproperly describe the eating of the new fruits as a sacrament or communion with a deity,or at all events with a powerful spirit.Among the usages which point to this conclusion are the custom of employing either new orspecially reserved vessels to hold the new fruits, and the practice of purifying the persons ofthe communicants before it is lawful to engage in the solemn act of communion with thedivinity. Of all the modes of purification adopted on these occasions none perhaps bringsout the sacramental virtue of the rite so clearly as the Creek and Seminole practice oftaking a purgative before swallowing the new corn. The intention is thereby to prevent thesacred food from being polluted by contact with common food in the stomach of the eater.For the same reason Catholics partake of the Eucharist fasting; and among the pastoralMasai of Eastern Africa the young warriors, who live on meat and milk exclusively, areobliged to eat nothing but milk for so many days and then nothing but meat for so manymore, and before they pass from the one food to the other they must make sure that none ofthe old food remains in their stomachs; this they do by swallowing a very powerfulpurgative and emetic.In some of the festivals which we have examined, the sacrament of first-fruits is combinedwith a sacrifice or presentation of them to gods or spirits, and in course of time the sacrificeof first-fruits tends to throw the sacrament into the shade, if not to supersede it. The merefact of offering the first-fruits to the gods or spirits comes now to be thought a sufficientpreparation for eating the new corn; the higher powers having received their share, man isfree to enjoy the rest. This mode of viewing the new fruits implies that they are regarded nolonger as themselves instinct with divine life, but merely as a gift bestowed by the godsupon man, who is bound to express his gratitude and homage to his divine benefactors byreturning to them a portion of their bounty.2. Eating the God among the AztecsTHE CUSTOM of eating bread sacramentally as the body of a god was practised by theAztecs before the discovery and conquest of Mexico by the Spaniards. Twice a year, in Mayand December, an image of the great Mexican god Huitzilopochtli or Vitzilipuztli was madeof dough, then broken in pieces, and solemnly eaten by his worshippers. The Mayceremony is thus described by the historian Acosta: “The Mexicans in the month of Maymade their principal feast to their god Vitzilipuztli, and two days before this feast, thevirgins whereof I have spoken (the which were shut up and secluded in the same templeand were as it were religious women) did mingle a quantity of the seed of beets with roastedmaize, and then they did mould it with honey, making an idol of that paste in bigness liketo that of wood, putting instead of eyes grains of green glass, of blue or white; and for teethgrains of maize set forth with all the ornament and furniture that I have said. This being"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"finished, all the noblemen came and brought it an exquisite and rich garment, like untothat of the idol, wherewith they did attire it. Being thus clad and deckt, they did set it in anazured chair and in a litter to carry it on their shoulders. The morning of this feast beingcome, an hour before day all the maidens came forth attired in white, with new ornaments,the which that day were called the Sisters of their god Vitzilipuztli, they came crowned withgarlands of maize roasted and parched, being like unto azahar or the flower of orange; andabout their necks they had great chains of the same, which went bauldrick-wise under theirleft arm. Their cheeks were dyed with vermilion, their arms from the elbow to the wristwere covered with red parrots’ feathers.” Young men, dressed in red robes and crownedlike the virgins with maize, then carried the idol in its litter to the foot of the greatpyramid-shaped temple, up the steep and narrow steps of which it was drawn to the musicof flutes, trumpets, cornets, and drums. “While they mounted up the idol all the peoplestood in the court with much reverence and fear. Being mounted to the top, and that theyhad placed it in a little lodge of roses which they held ready, presently came the young men,which strewed many flowers of sundry kinds, wherewith they filled the temple both withinand without. This done, all the virgins came out of their convent, bringing pieces of pastecompounded of beets and roasted maize, which was of the same paste whereof their idolwas made and compounded, and they were of the fashion of great bones. They deliveredthem to the young men, who carried them up and laid them at the idol’s feet, wherewiththey filled the whole place that it could receive no more. They called these morsels of pastethe flesh and bones of Vitzilipuztli. Having laid abroad these bones, presently came all theancients of the temple, priests, Levites, and all the rest of the ministers, according to theirdignities and antiquities (for herein there was a strict order amongst them) one afteranother, with their veils of diverse colours and works, every one according to his dignityand office, having garlands upon their heads and chains of flowers about their necks; afterthem came their gods and goddesses whom they worshipped, of diverse figures, attired inthe same livery; then putting themselves in order about those morsels and pieces of paste,they used certain ceremonies with singing and dancing. By means whereof they wereblessed and consecrated for the flesh and bones of this idol. This ceremony and blessing(whereby they were taken for the flesh and bones of the idol) being ended, they honouredthose pieces in the same sort as their god. ... All the city came to this goodly spectacle, andthere was a commandment very strictly observed throughout all the land, that the day ofthe feast of the idol of Vitzilipuztli they should eat no other meat but this paste, with honey,whereof the idol was made. And this should be eaten at the point of day, and they shoulddrink no water nor any other thing till after noon: they held it for an ill sign, yea, forsacrilege to do the contrary: but after the ceremonies ended, it was lawful for them to eatanything. During the time of this ceremony they hid the water from their little children,admonishing all such as had the use of reason not to drink any water; which, if they did,the anger of God would come upon them, and they should die, which they did observe verycarefully and strictly. The ceremonies, dancing, and sacrifice ended, the went to unclothethemselves, and the priests and superiors of the temple took the idol of paste, which theyspoiled of all the ornaments it had, and made many pieces, as well of the idol itself as of thetruncheons which they consecrated, and then they gave them to the people in manner of acommunion, beginning with the greater, and continuing unto the rest, both men, women,and little children, who received it with such tears, fear, and reverence as it was anadmirable thing, saying that they did eat the flesh and bones of God, where-with they were"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"grieved. Such as had any sick folks demanded thereof for them, and carried it with greatreverence and veneration.”From this interesting passage we learn that the ancient Mexicans, even before the arrival ofChristian missionaries, were fully acquainted with the doctrine of transubstantiation andacted upon it in the solemn rites of their religion. They believed that by consecrating breadtheir priests could turn it into the very body of their god, so that all who thereupon partookof the consecrated bread entered into a mystic communion with the deity by receiving aportion of his divine substance into themselves. The doctrine of transubstantiation, or themagical conversion of bread into flesh, was also familiar to the Aryans of ancient India longbefore the spread and even the rise of Christianity. The Brahmans taught that the rice-cakes offered in sacrifice were substitutes for human beings, and that they were actuallyconverted into the real bodies of men by the manipulation of the priest. We read that“when it (the rice-cake) still consists of rice-meal, it is the hair. When he pours water on it,it becomes skin. When he mixes it, it becomes flesh: for then it becomes consistent; andconsistent also is the flesh. When it is baked, it becomes bone: for then it becomessomewhat hard; and hard is the bone. And when he is about to take it off (the fire) andsprinkles it with butter, he changes it into marrow. This is the completeness which they callthe fivefold animal sacrifice.”Now, too, we can perfectly understand why on the day of their solemn communion with thedeity the Mexicans refused to eat any other food than the consecrated bread which theyrevered as the very flesh and bones of their God, and why up till noon they might drinknothing at all, not even water. They feared no doubt to defile the portion of God in theirstomachs by contact with common things. A similar pious fear led the Creek and SeminoleIndians, as we saw, to adopt the more thoroughgoing expedient of rinsing out their bodiesby a strong purgative before they dared to partake of the sacrament of first-fruits.At the festival of the winter solstice in December the Aztecs killed their god Huitzilopochtliin effigy first and ate him afterwards. As a preparation for this solemn ceremony an imageof the deity in the likeness of a man was fashioned out of seeds of various sorts, which werekneaded into a dough with the blood of children. The bones of the god were represented bypieces of acacia wood. This image was placed on the chief altar of the temple, and on theday of the festival the king offered incense to it. Early next day it was taken down and seton its feet in a great hall. Then a priest, who bore the name and acted the part of the godQuetzalcoatl, took a flint-tipped dart and hurled it into the breast of the dough-image,piercing it through and through. This was called “killing the god Huitzilopochtli so that hisbody might be eaten.” One of the priests cut out the heart of the image and gave it to theking to eat. The rest of the image was divided into minute pieces, of which every man greatand small, down to the male children in the cradle, receive one to eat. But no woman mighttaste a morsel. The ceremony was called teoqualo, that is, “god is eaten.”At another festival the Mexicans made little images like men, which stood for the cloud-capped mountains. These images were moulded of a paste of various seeds and weredressed in paper ornaments. Some people fashioned five, others ten, others as many asfifteen of them. Having been made, they were placed in the oratory of each house andworshipped. Four times in the course of the night offerings of food were brought to them intiny vessels; and people sang and played the flute before them through all the hours of"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"darkness. At break of day the priests stabbed the images with a weaver’s instrument, cutoff their heads, and tore out their hearts, which they presented to the master of the houseon a green saucer. The bodies of the images were then eaten by all the family, especially bythe servants, “in order that by eating them they might be preserved from certaindistempers, to which those persons who were negligent of worship to those deities conceivedthemselves to be subject.”3. Many Manii at AriciaWE are now able to suggest an explanation of the proverb “There are many Manii atAricia.” Certain loaves made in the shape of men were called by the Romans maniae, and itappears that this kind of loaf was especially made at Aricia. Now, Mania, the name of oneof these loaves, was also the name of the Mother or Grandmother of Ghosts, to whomwoollen effigies of men and women were dedicated at the festival of the Compitalia. Theseeffigies were hung at the doors of all the houses in Rome; one effigy was hung up for everyfree person in the house, and one effigy, of a different kind, for every slave. The reason wasthat on this day the ghosts of the dead were believed to be going about, and it was hopedthat, either out of good nature or through simple inadvertence, they would carry off theeffigies at the door instead of the living people in the house. According to tradition, thesewoollen figures were substitutes for a former custom of sacrificing human beings. Upondata so fragmentary and uncertain, it is impossible to build with confidence; but it seemsworth suggesting that the loaves in human form, which appear to have been baked atAricia, were sacramental bread, and that in the old days, when the divine King of theWood was annually slain, loaves were made in his image, like the paste figures of the godsin Mexico, and were eaten sacramentally by his worshippers. The Mexican sacraments inhonour of Huitzilopochtli were also accompanied by the sacrifice of human victims. Thetradition that the founder of the sacred grove at Aricia was a man named Manius, fromwhom many Manii were descended, would thus be an etymological myth invented toexplain the name maniae as applied to these sacramental loaves. A dim recollection of theoriginal connexion of the loaves with human sacrifices may perhaps be traced in the storythat the effigies dedicated to Mania at the Compitalia were substitutes for human victims.The story itself, however, is probably devoid of foundation, since the practice of putting updummies to divert the attention of ghosts or demons from living people is not uncommon.For example, the Tibetans stand in fear of innumerable earth-demons, all of whom areunder the authority of Old Mother Khön-ma. This goddess, who may be compared to theRoman Mania, the Mother or Grandmother of Ghosts, is dressed in golden-yellow robes,holds a golden noose in her hand, and rides on a ram. In order to bar the dwelling-houseagainst the foul fiends, of whom Old Mother Khön-ma is mistress, an elaborate structuresomewhat resembling a chandelier is fixed above the door on the outside of the house. Itcontains a ram’s skull, a variety of precious objects such as gold-leaf, silver, and turquoise,also some dry food, such as rice, wheat, and pulse, and finally images or pictures of a man,a woman, and a house. “The object of these figures of a man, wife, and house is to deceivethe demons should they still come in spite of this offering, and to mislead them into thebelief that the foregoing pictures are the inmates of the house, so that they may wreak theirwrath on these bits of wood and to save the real human occupants.” When all is ready, a"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"priest prays to Old Mother Khön-ma that she would be pleased to accept these daintyofferings and to close the open doors of the earth, in order that the demons may not comeforth to infest and injure the household.Again, effigies are often employed as a means of preventing or curing sickness; the demonsof disease either mistake the effigies for living people or are persuaded or compelled toenter them, leaving the real men and women well and whole. Thus the Alfoors ofMinahassa, in Celebes, will sometimes transport a sick man to another house, while theyleave on his bed a dummy made up of a pillow and clothes. This dummy the demon issupposed to mistake for the sick man, who consequently recovers. Cure or prevention ofthis sort seems to find especial favour with the natives of Borneo. Thus, when an epidemicis raging among them, the Dyaks of the Katoengouw River set up wooden images at theirdoors in the hope that the demons of the plague may be deluded into carrying off theeffigies instead of the people. Among the Oloh Ngadju of Borneo, when a sick man issupposed to be suffering from the assaults of a ghost, puppets of dough or rice-meal aremade and thrown under the house as substitutes for the patient, who thus rids himself ofthe ghost. In certain of the western districts of Borneo if a man is taken suddenly andviolently sick, the physician, who in this part of the world is generally an old woman,fashions a wooden image and brings it seven times into contact with the sufferer’s head,while she says: “This image serves to take the place of the sick man; sickness, pass over intothe image.” Then, with some rice, salt, and tobacco in a little basket, the substitute iscarried to the spot where the evil spirit is supposed to have entered into the man. There it isset upright on the ground, after the physician has invoked the spirit as follows: “O devil,here is an image which stands instead of the sick man. Release the soul of the sick man andplague the image, for it is indeed prettier and better than he.” Batak magicians can conjurethe demon of disease out of the patient’s body into an image made out of a banana-treewith a human face and wrapt up in magic herbs; the image is then hurriedly removed andthrown away or buried beyond the boundaries of the village. Sometimes the image, dressedas a man or a woman according to the sex of the patient, is deposited at a cross-road orother thoroughfare, in the hope that some passer-by, seeing it, may start and cry out, “Ah!So-and-So is dead”; for such an exclamation is supposed to delude the demon of diseaseinto a belief that he has accomplished his fell purpose, so he takes himself off and leaves thesufferer to get well. The Mai Darat, a Sakai tribe of the Malay Peninsula, attribute allkinds of diseases to the agency of spirits which they call nyani; fortunately, however, themagician can induce these maleficent beings to come out of the sick person and take uptheir abode in rude figures of grass, which are hung up outside the houses in little bell-shaped shrines decorated with peeled sticks. During an epidemic of small-pox the Ewenegroes will sometimes clear a space outside of the town, where they erect a number of lowmounds and cover them with as many little clay figures as there are people in the place.Pots of food and water are also set out for the refreshment of the spirit of small-pox who, itis hoped, will take the clay figures and spare the living folk; and to make assurance doublysure the road into the town is barricaded against him.With these examples before us we may surmise that the woollen effigies, which at thefestival of the Compitalia might be seen hanging at the doors of all the houses in ancientRome, were not substitutes for human victims who had formerly been sacrificed at thisseason, but rather vicarious offerings presented to the Mother or Grandmother of Ghosts,"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"in the hope that on her rounds through the city she would accept or mistake the effigies forthe inmates of the house and so spare the living for another year. It is possible that thepuppets made of rushes, which in the month of May the pontiffs and Vestal Virginsannually threw into the Tiber from the old Sublician bridge at Rome, had originally thesame significance; that is, they may have been designed to purge the city from demoniacinfluence by diverting the attention of the demons from human beings to the puppets andthen toppling the whole uncanny crew, neck and crop, into the river, which would soonsweep them far out to sea. In precisely the same way the natives of Old Calabar usedperiodically to rid their town of the devils which infested it by luring the unwary demonsinto a number of lamentable scarecrows, which they afterwards flung into the river. Thisinterpretation of the Roman custom is supported to some extent by the evidence ofPlutarch, who speaks of the ceremony as “the greatest of purifications.”LI. Homeopathic Magic of a Flesh DietTHE PRACTICE of killing a god has now been traced amongst peoples who have reachedthe agricultural stage of society. We have seen that the spirit of the corn, or of othercultivated plants, is commonly represented either in human or in animal form, and that insome places a custom has prevailed of killing annually either the human or the animalrepresentative of the god. One reason for thus killing the corn-spirit in the person of hisrepresentative has been given implicitly in an earlier part of this work: we may supposethat the intention was to guard him or her (for the corn-spirit is often feminine) from theenfeeblement of old age by transferring the spirit, while still hale and hearty, to the personof a youthful and vigorous successor. Apart from the desirability of renewing his divineenergies, the death of the corn-spirit may have been deemed inevitable under the sickles orthe knives of the reapers, and his worshippers may accordingly have felt bound toacquiesce in the sad necessity. But, further, we have found a widespread custom of eatingthe god sacramentally, either in the shape of the man or animal who represents the god, orin the shape of bread made in human or animal form. The reasons for thus partaking ofthe body of the god are, from the primitive standpoint, simple enough. The savagecommonly believes that by eating the flesh of an animal or man he acquires not only thephysical, but even the moral and intellectual qualities which were characteristic of thatanimal or man; so when the creature is deemed divine, our simple savage naturally expectsto absorb a portion of its divinity along with its material substance. It may be well toillustrate by instances this common faith in the acquisition of virtues or vices of many kindsthrough the medium of animal food, even when there is no pretence that the viands consistof the body or blood of a god. The doctrine forms part of the widely ramified system ofsympathetic or homoeopathic magic.Thus, for example, the Creeks, Cherokee, and kindred tribes of North American Indians“believe that nature is possest of such a property as to transfuse into men and animals thequalities, either of the food they use, or of those objects that are presented to their senses;he who feeds on venison is, according to their physical system, swifter and more sagaciousthan the man who lives on the flesh of the clumsy bear, or helpless dunghill fowls, the slow-footed tame cattle, or the heavy wallowing swine. This is the reason that several of their old"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"men recommend, and say, that formerly their greatest chieftains observed a constant rulein their diet, and seldom ate of any animal of a gross quality, or heavy motion of body,fancying it conveyed a dullness through the whole system, and disabled them from exertingthemselves with proper vigour in their martial, civil, and religious duties.” The ZaparoIndians of Ecuador “will, unless from necessity, in most cases not eat any heavy meats,such as tapir and peccary, but confine themselves to birds, monkeys, deer, fish, etc.,principally because they argue that the heavier meats make them unwieldy, like theanimals who supply the flesh, impeding their agility, and unfitting them for the chase.”Similarly some of the Brazilian Indians would eat no beast, bird, or fish that ran, flew, orswam slowly, lest by partaking of its flesh they should lose their ability and be unable toescape from their enemies. The Caribs abstained from the flesh of pigs lest it should causethem to have small eyes like pigs; and they refused to partake of tortoises from a fear thatif they did so they would become heavy and stupid like the animal. Among the Fans ofWest Africa men in the prime of life never eat tortoises for a similar reason; they imaginethat if they did so, their vigour and fleetness of foot would be gone. But old men may eattortoises freely, because having already lost the power of running they can take no harmfrom the flesh of the slow-footed creature.While many savages thus fear to eat the flesh of slow-footed animals lest they shouldthemselves become slow-footed, the Bushmen of South Africa purposely ate the flesh ofsuch creatures, and the reason which they gave for doing so exhibits a curious refinementof savage philosophy. They imagined that the game which they pursued would beinfluenced sympathetically by the food in the body of the hunter, so that if he had eaten ofswift-footed animals, the quarry would be swift-footed also and would escape him; whereasif he had eaten of slow-footed animals, the quarry would also be slow-footed, and he wouldbe able to overtake and kill it. For that reason hunters of gemsbok particularly avoidedeating the flesh of the swift and agile springbok; indeed they would not even touch it withtheir hands, because they believed the springbok to be a very lively creature which did notgo to sleep at night, and they thought that if they ate springbok, the gemsbok which theyhunted would likewise not be willing to go to sleep, even at night. How, then, could theycatch it?The Namaquas abstain from eating the flesh of hares, because they think it would makethem faint-hearted as a hare. But they eat the flesh of the lion, or drink the blood of theleopard or lion, to get the courage and strength of these beasts. The Bushmen will not givetheir children a jackal’s heart to eat, lest it should make them timid like the jackal; butthey give them a leopard’s heart to eat to make them brave like the leopard. When aWagogo man of East Africa kills a lion, he eats the heart in order to become brave like alion; but he thinks that to eat the heart of a hen would make him timid. When a seriousdisease has attacked a Zulu kraal, the medicine-man takes the bone of a very old dog, orthe bone of an old cow, bull, or other very old animal, and administers it to the healthy aswell as to the sick people, in order that they may live to be as old as the animal of whosebone they have partaken. So to restore the aged Aeson to youth, the witch Medea infusedinto his veins a decoction of the liver of the long-lived deer and the head of a crow that hadoutlived nine generations of men.Among the Dyaks of North-West Borneo young men and warriors may not eat venison,"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"because it would make them as timid as deer; but the women and very old men are free toeat it. However, among the Kayans of the same region, who share the same view as to the illeffect of eating venison, men will partake of the dangerous viand provided it is cooked inthe open air, for then the timid spirit of the animal is supposed to escape at once into thejungle and not to enter into the eater. The Aino believe that the heart of the water-ousel isexceedingly wise, and that in speech the bird is most eloquent. Therefore whenever he iskilled, he should be at once torn open and his heart wrenched out and swallowed before ithas time to grow cold or suffer damage of any kind. If a man swallows it thus, he willbecome very fluent and wise, and will be able to argue down all his adversaries. InNorthern India people fancy that if you eat the eyeballs of an owl you will be able like anowl to see in the dark.When the Kansas Indians were going to war, a feast used to be held in the chief’s hut, andthe principal dish was dog’s flesh, because, said the Indians, the animal who is so bravethat he will let himself be cut in pieces in defence of his master, must needs inspire valour.Men of the Buru and Aru Islands, East Indies, eat the flesh of dogs in order to be bold andnimble in war. Amongst the Papuans of the Port Moresby and Motumotu districts, NewGuinea, young lads eat strong pig, wallaby, and large fish, in order to acquire the strengthof the animal or fish. Some of the natives of Northern Australia fancy that by eating theflesh of the kangaroo or emu they are enabled to jump or run faster than before. The Mirisof Assam prize tiger’s flesh as food for men; it gives them strength and courage. But “it isnot suited for women; it would make them too strong-minded.” In Corea the bones of tigersfetch a higher price than those of leopards as a means of inspiring courage. A Chinaman inSeoul bought and ate a whole tiger to make himself brave and fierce. In Norse legend,Ingiald, son of King Aunund, was timid in his youth, but after eating the heart of a wolf hebecame very bold; Hialto gained strength and courage by eating the heart of a bear anddrinking its blood.In Morocco lethargic patients are given ants to swallow, and to eat lion’s flesh will make acoward brave; but people abstain from eating the hearts of fowls, lest thereby they shouldbe rendered timid. When a child is late in learning to speak, the Turks of Central Asia willgive it the tongues of certain birds to eat. A North American Indian thought that brandymust be a decoction of hearts and tongues, “because,” said he, “after drinking it I fearnothing, and I talk wonderfully.” In Java there is a tiny earthworm which now and thenutters a shrill sound like that of the alarum of a small clock. Hence when a public dancinggirl has screamed herself hoarse in the exercise of her calling, the leader of the troop makesher eat some of these worms, in the belief that thus she will regain her voice and will, afterswallowing them, be able to scream as shrilly as ever. The people of Darfur, in CentralAfrica, think that the liver is the seat of the soul, and that a man may enlarge his soul byeating the liver of an animal. “Whenever an animal is killed its liver is taken out and eaten,but the people are most careful not to touch it with their hands, as it is considered sacred; itis cut up in small pieces and eaten raw, the bits being conveyed to the mouth on the point ofa knife, or the sharp point of a stick. Any one who may accidentally touch the liver isstrictly forbidden to partake of it, which prohibition is regarded as a great misfortune forhim.” Women are not allowed to eat liver, because they have no soul.Again, the flesh and blood of dead men are commonly eaten and drunk to inspire bravery,"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"wisdom, or other qualities for which the men themselves were remarkable, or which aresupposed to have their special seat in the particular part eaten. Thus among the mountaintribes of South-Eastern Africa there are ceremonies by which the youths are formed intoguilds or lodges, and among the rites of initiation there is one which is intended to infusecourage, intelligence, and other qualities into the novices. Whenever an enemy who hasbehaved with conspicuous bravery is killed, his liver, which is considered the seat ofvalour; his ears, which are supposed to be the seat of intelligence; the skin of his forehead,which is regarded as the seat of perseverance; his testicles, which are held to be the seat ofstrength; and other members, which are viewed as the seat of other virtues, are cut fromhis body and baked to cinders. The ashes are carefully kept in the horn of a bull, and,during the ceremonies observed at circumcision, are mixed with other ingredients into akind of paste, which is administered by the tribal priest to the youths. By this means thestrength, valour, intelligence, and other virtues of the slain are believed to be imparted tothe eaters. When Basutos of the mountains have killed a very brave foe, they immediatelycut out his heart and eat it, because this is supposed to give them his courage and strengthin battle. When Sir Charles M’Carthy was killed by the Ashantees in 1824, it is said thathis heart was devoured by the chiefs of the Ashantee army, who hoped by this means toimbibe his courage. His flesh was dried and parcelled out among the lower officers for thesame purpose, and his bones were long kept at Coomassie as national fetishes. The NaurasIndians of New Granada ate the hearts of Spaniards when they had the opportunity,hoping thereby to make themselves as dauntless as the dreaded Castilian chivalry. TheSioux Indians used to reduce to powder the heart of a valiant enemy and swallow thepowder, hoping thus to appropriate the dead man’s valour.But while the human heart is thus commonly eaten for the sake of imbuing the eater withthe qualities of its original owner, it is not, as we have already seen, the only part of thebody which is consumed for this purpose. Thus warriors of the Theddora and Ngarigotribes of South-Eastern Australia used to eat the hands and feet of their slain enemies,believing that in this way they acquired some of the qualities and courage of the dead. TheKamilaroi of New South Wales ate the liver as well as the heart of a brave man to get hiscourage. In Tonquin also there is a popular superstition that the liver of a brave manmakes brave any who partake of it. With a like intent the Chinese swallow the bile ofnotorious bandits who have been executed. The Dyaks of Sarawak used to eat the palms ofthe hands and the flesh of the knees of the slain in order to steady their own hands andstrengthen their own knees. The Tolalaki, notorious head-hunters of Central Celebes,drink the blood and eat the brains of their victims that they may become brave. TheItalones of the Philippine Islands drink the blood of their slain enemies, and eat part of theback of their heads and of their entrails raw to acquire their courage. For the same reasonthe Efugaos, another tribe of the Philippines, suck the brains of their foes. In like mannerthe Kai of German New Guinea eat the brains of the enemies they kill in order to acquiretheir strength. Among the Kimbunda of Western Africa, when a new king succeeds to thethrone, a brave prisoner of war is killed in order that the king and nobles may eat his flesh,and so acquire his strength and courage. The notorious Zulu chief Matuana drank the gallof thirty chiefs, whose people he had destroyed, in the belief that it would make him strong.It is a Zulu fancy that by eating the centre of the forehead and the eyebrow of an enemythey acquire the power of looking steadfastly at a foe. Before every warlike expedition thepeople of Minahassa in Celebes used to take the locks of hair of a slain foe and dabble them"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"in boiling water to extract the courage; this infusion of bravery was then drunk by thewarriors. In New Zealand “the chief was an atua [god], but there were powerful andpowerless gods; each naturally sought to make himself one of the former; the plantherefore adopted was to incorporate the spirits of others with their own; thus, when awarrior slew a chief, he immediately gouged out his eyes and swallowed them, the atuatonga, or divinity, being supposed to reside in that organ; thus he not only killed the body,but also possessed himself of the soul of his enemy, and consequently the more chiefs heslew the greater did his divinity become.”It is now easy to understand why a savage should desire to partake of the flesh of an animalor man whom he regards as divine. By eating the body of the god he shares in the god’sattributes and powers. And when the god is a corn-god, the corn is his proper body; whenhe is a vine-god, the juice of the grape is his blood; and so by eating the bread and drinkingthe wine the worshipper partakes of the real body and blood of his god. Thus the drinkingof wine in the rites of a vine-god like Dionysus is not an act of revelry, it is a solemnsacrament. Yet a time comes when reasonable men find it hard to understand how any onein his senses can suppose that by eating bread or drinking wine he consumes the body orblood of a deity. “When we call corn Ceres and wine Bacchus,” says Cicero, “we use acommon figure of speech; but do you imagine that anybody is so insane as to believe thatthe thing he feeds upon is a god?”LII. Killing the Divine Animal1. Killing the Sacred BuzzardIN THE PRECEDING chapters we saw that many communities which have progressed sofar as to subsist mainly by agriculture have been in the habit of killing and eating theirfarinaceous deities either in their proper form of corn, rice, and so forth, or in theborrowed shapes of animals and men. It remains to show that hunting and pastoral tribes,as well as agricultural peoples, have been in the habit of killing the beings whom theyworship. Among the worshipful beings or gods, if indeed they deserve to be dignified bythat name, whom hunters and shepherds adore and kill are animals pure and simple, notanimals regarded as embodiments of other supernatural beings. Our first example isdrawn from the Indians of California, who living in a fertile country under a serene andtemperate sky, nevertheless rank near the bottom of the savage scale. The Acagchememtribe adored the great buzzard, and once a year they celebrated a great festival calledPanes or bird-feast in its honour. The day selected for the festival was made known to thepublic on the evening before its celebration and preparations were at once made for theerection of a special temple (vanquech), which seems to have been a circular or ovalenclosure of stakes with the stuffed skin of a coyote or prairie-wolf set up on a hurdle torepresent the god Chinigchinich. When the temple was ready, the bird was carried into itin solemn procession and laid on an altar erected for the purpose. Then all the youngwomen, whether married or single, began to run to and fro, as if distracted, some in onedirection and some in another, while the elders of both sexes remained silent spectators of"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"the scene, and the captains, tricked out in paint and feathers, danced round their adoredbird. These ceremonies being concluded, they seized upon the bird and carried it to theprincipal temple, all the assembly uniting in the grand display, and the captains dancingand singing at the head of the procession. Arrived at the temple, they killed the birdwithout losing a drop of its blood. The skin was removed entire and preserved with thefeathers as a relic or for the purpose of making the festal garment or paelt. The carcase wasburied in a hole in the temple, and the old women gathered round the grave weeping andmoaning bitterly, while they threw various kinds of seeds or pieces of food on it, crying out,“Why did you run away? Would you not have been better with us? you would have madepinole (a kind of gruel) as we do, and if you had not run away, you would not have becomea Panes,” and so on. When this ceremony was concluded, the dancing was resumed andkept up for three days and nights. They said that the Panes was a woman who had run offto the mountains and there been changed into a bird by the god Chinigchinich. Theybelieved that though they sacrificed the bird annually, she came to life again and returnedto her home in the mountains. Moreover, they thought that “as often as the bird was killed,it became multiplied; because every year all the different Capitanes celebrated the samefeast of Panes, and were firm in the opinion that the birds sacrificed were but one and thesame female.”The unity in multiplicity thus postulated by the Californians is very noticeable and helps toexplain their motive for killing the divine bird. The notion of the life of a species as distinctfrom that of an individual, easy and obvious as it seems to us, appears to be one which theCalifornian savage cannot grasp. He is unable to conceive the life of the species otherwisethan as an individual life, and therefore as exposed to the same dangers and calamitieswhich menace and finally destroy the life of the individual. Apparently he imagines that aspecies left to itself will grow old and die like an individual, and that therefore some stepmust be taken to save from extinction the particular species which he regards as divine.The only means he can think of to avert the catastrophe is to kill a member of the species inwhose veins the tide of life is still running strong and has not yet stagnated among the fensof old age. The life thus diverted from one channel will flow, he fancies, more freshly andfreely in a new one; in other words, the slain animal will revive and enter on a new term oflife with all the spring and energy of youth. To us this reasoning is transparently absurd,but so too is the custom. A similar confusion, it may be noted, between the individual lifeand the life of the species was made by the Samoans. Each family had for its god aparticular species of animal; yet the death of one of these animals, for example an owl, wasnot the death of the god, “he was supposed to be yet alive, and incarnate in all the owls inexistence.”2. Killing the Sacred RamTHE RUDE Californian rite which we have just considered has a close parallel in thereligion of ancient Egypt. The Thebans and all other Egyptians who worshipped theTheban god Ammon held rams to be sacred, and would not sacrifice them. But once a yearat the festival of Ammon they killed a ram, skinned it, and clothed the image of the god inthe skin. Then they mourned over the ram and buried it in a sacred tomb. The custom wasexplained by a story that Zeus had once exhibited himself to Hercules clad in the fleece and"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"wearing the head of a ram. Of course the ram in this case was simply the beast-god ofThebes, as the wolf was the beast-god of Lycopolis, and the goat was the beast-god ofMendes. In other words, the ram was Ammon himself. On the monuments, it is true,Ammon appears in semi-human form with the body of a man and the head of a ram. Butthis only shows that he was in the usual chrysalis state through which beast-gods regularlypass before they emerge as full-blown anthropomorphic gods. The ram, therefore, waskilled, not as a sacrifice to Ammon, but as the god himself, whose identity with the beast isplainly shown by the custom of clothing his image in the skin of the slain ram. The reasonfor thus killing the ram-god annually may have been that which I have assigned for thegeneral custom of killing a god and for the special Californian custom of killing the divinebuzzard. As applied to Egypt, this explanation is supported by the analogy of the bull-godApis, who was not suffered to outlive a certain term of years. The intention of thus puttinga limit to the life of the human god was, as I have argued, to secure him from the weaknessand frailty of age. The same reasoning would explain the custom—probably an older one—of putting the beast-god to death annually, as was done with the ram of Thebes.One point in the Theban ritual—the application of the skin to the image of the god—deserves particular attention. If the god was at first the living ram, his representation by animage must have originated later. But how did it originate? One answer to this question isperhaps furnished by the practice of preserving the skin of the animal which is slain asdivine. The Californians, as we have seen, preserved the skin of the buzzard; and the skinof the goat, which is killed on the harvest-field as a representative of the corn-spirit, is keptfor various superstitious purposes. The skin in fact was kept as a token or memorial of thegod, or rather as containing in it a part of the divine life, and it had only to be stuffed orstretched upon a frame to become a regular image of him. At first an image of this kindwould be renewed annually, the new image being provided by the skin of the slain animal.But from annual images to permanent images the transition is easy. We have seen that theolder custom of cutting a new May-tree every year was superseded by the practice ofmaintaining a permanent May-pole, which was, however, annually decked with fresh leavesand flowers, and even surmounted each year by a fresh young tree. Similarly when thestuffed skin, as a representative of the god, was replaced by a permanent image of him inwood, stone, or metal, the permanent image was annually clad in the fresh skin of the slainanimal. When this stage had been reached, the custom of killing the ram came naturally tobe interpreted as a sacrifice offered to the image, and was explained by a story like that ofAmmon and Hercules.3. Killing the Sacred SerpentWEST AFRICA appears to furnish another example of the annual killing of a sacredanimal and the preservation of its skin. The negroes of Issapoo, in the island of FernandoPo, regard the cobra-capella as their guardian deity, who can do them good or ill, bestowriches or inflict disease and death. The skin of one of these reptiles is hung tail downwardsfrom a branch of the highest tree in the public square, and the placing of it on the tree is anannual ceremony. As soon as the ceremony is over, all children born within the past yearare carried out and their hands made to touch the tail of the serpent’s skin. The lattercustom is clearly a way of placing the infants under the protection of the tribal god."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"Similarly in Senegambia a python is expected to visit every child of the Python clan withineight days after birth; and the Psylli, a Snake clan of ancient Africa, used to expose theirinfants to snakes in the belief that the snakes would not harm true-born children of theclan.4. Killing the Sacred TurtlesIN THE CALIFORNIAN, Egyptian, and Fernando Po customs the worship of the animalseems to have no relation to agriculture, and may therefore be presumed to date from thehunting or pastoral stage of society. The same may be said of the following custom, thoughthe Zuni Indians of New Mexico, who practise it, are now settled in walled villages or townsof a peculiar type, and practise agriculture and the arts of pottery and weaving. But theZuni custom is marked by certain features which appear to place it in a somewhat differentclass from the preceding cases. It may be well therefore to describe it at full length in thewords of an eye-witness.“With midsummer the heat became intense. My brother [i.e. adopted Indian brother] and Isat, day after day, in the cool under-rooms of our house,—the latter [sic] busy with hisquaint forge and crude appliances, working Mexican coins over into bangles, girdles, ear-rings, buttons, and what not, for savage ornament. Though his tools were wonderfullyrude, the work he turned out by dint of combined patience and ingenuity was remarkablybeautiful. One day as I sat watching him, a procession of fifty men went hastily down thehill, and off westward over the plain. They were solemnly led by a painted and shell-bedecked priest, and followed by the torch-bearing Shu-lu-wit-si or God of Fire. After theyhad vanished, I asked old brother what it all meant.“‘They are going,’ said he, ‘to the city of Ka-ka and the home of our others.’“Four days after, towards sunset, costumed and masked in the beautiful paraphernalia ofthe Ka-k’ok-shi, or ‘Good Dance,’ they returned in file up the same pathway, each bearingin his arms a basket filled with living, squirming turtles, which he regarded and carried astenderly as a mother would her infant. Some of the wretched reptiles were carefullywrapped in soft blankets, their heads and forefeet protruding,—and, mounted on the backsof the plume-bedecked pilgrims, made ludicrous but solemn caricatures of little children inthe same position. While I was at supper upstairs that evening, the governor’s brother-in-law came in. He was welcomed by the family as if a messenger from heaven. He bore in histremulous fingers one of the much abused and rebellious turtles. Paint still adhered to hishands and bare feet, which led me to infer that he had formed one of the sacred embassy.“‘So you went to Ka-thlu-el-lon, did you?’ I asked.“‘E’e,’ replied the weary man, in a voice husky with long chanting, as he sank, almostexhausted, on a roll of skins which had been placed for him, and tenderly laid the turtle onthe floor. No sooner did the creature find itself at liberty than it made off as fast as its lamelegs would take it. Of one accord, the family forsook dish, spoon, and drinking-cup, andgrabbing from a sacred meal-bowl whole handfuls of the contents, hurriedly followed theturtle about the room, into dark corners, around water-jars, behind the grinding-troughs,"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"and out into the middle of the floor again, praying and scattering meal on its back as theywent. At last, strange to say, it approached the foot-sore man who had brought it.“‘Ha!’ he exclaimed with emotion; ‘see it comes to me again; ah, what great favours thefathers of all grant me this day,’ and, passing his hand gently over the sprawling animal, heinhaled from his palm deeply and long, at the same time invoking the favour of the gods.Then he leaned his chin upon his hand, and with large, wistful eyes regarded his uglycaptive as it sprawled about, blinking its meal-bedimmed eyes, and clawing the smoothfloor in memory of its native element. At this juncture I ventured a question:“‘Why do you not let him go, or give him some water?’“Slowly the man turned his eyes toward me, an odd mixture of pain, indignation, and pityon his face, while the worshipful family stared at me with holy horror.“‘Poor younger brother!’ he said at last, ‘know you not how precious it is? It die? It willnot die; I tell you, it cannot die.’“‘But it will die if you don’t feed it and give it water.’“‘I tell you it cannot die; it will only change houses to-morrow, and go back to the home ofits brothers. Ah, well! How should you know?’ he mused. Turning to the blinded turtleagain: ‘Ah! my poor dear lost child or parent, my sister or brother to have been! Whoknows which? Maybe my own great-grandfather or mother!’ And with this he fell toweeping most pathetically, and, tremulous with sobs, which were echoed by the women andchildren, he buried his face in his hands. Filled with sympathy for his grief, howevermistaken, I raised the turtle to my lips and kissed its cold shell; then depositing it on thefloor, hastily left the grief-stricken family to their sorrows. Next day, with prayers andtender beseechings, plumes, and offerings, the poor turtle was killed, and its flesh andbones were removed and deposited in the little river, that it might ‘return once more toeternal life among its comrades in the dark waters of the lake of the dead.’ The shell,carefully scraped and dried, was made into a dance-rattle, and, covered by a piece ofbuckskin, it still hangs from the smoke-stained rafters of my brother’s house. Once aNavajo tried to buy it for a ladle; loaded with indignant reproaches, he was turned cut ofthe house. Were any one to venture the suggestion that the turtle no longer lived, hisremark would cause a flood of tears, and he would be reminded that it had only ‘changedhouses and gone to live for ever in the home of “our lost others.”’”In this custom we find expressed in the clearest way a belief in the transmigration ofhuman souls into the bodies of turtles. The theory of transmigration is held by the MoquiIndians, who belong to the same race as the Zunis. The Moquis are divided into totemclans—the Bear clan, Deer clan, Wolf clan, Hare clan, and so on; they believe that theancestors of the clans were bears, deer, wolves, hares, and so forth; and that at death themembers of each clan become bears, deer, and so on according to the particular clan towhich they belonged. The Zuni are also divided into clans, the totems of which agree closelywith those of the Moquis, and one of their totems is the turtle. Thus their belief intransmigration into the turtle is probably one of the regular articles of their totem faith.What then is the meaning of killing a turtle in which the soul of a kinsman is believed to be"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"present? Apparently the object is to keep up a communication with the other world inwhich the souls of the departed are believed to be assembled in the form of turtles. It is acommon belief that the spirits of the dead return occasionally to their old homes; andaccordingly the unseen visitors are welcomed and feasted by the living, and then sent upontheir way. In the Zuni ceremony the dead are fetched home in the form of turtles, and thekilling of the turtles is the way of sending back the souls to the spirit-land. Thus the generalexplanation given above of the custom of killing a god seems inapplicable to the Zunicustom, the true meaning of which is somewhat obscure. Nor is the obscurity which hangsover the subject entirely dissipated by a later and fuller account which we possess of theceremony. From it we learn that the ceremony forms part of the elaborate ritual whichthese Indians observe at the midsummer solstice for the purpose of ensuring an abundantsupply of rain for the crops. Envoys are despatched to bring “their otherselves, thetortoises,” from the sacred lake Kothluwalawa, to which the souls of the dead are believedto repair. When the creatures have thus been solemnly brought to Zuni, they are placed ina bowl of water and dances are performed beside them by men in costume, who personategods and goddesses. “After the ceremonial the tortoises are taken home by those whocaught them and are hung by their necks to the rafters till morning, when they are throwninto pots of boiling water. The eggs are considered a great delicacy. The meat is seldomtouched except as a medicine, which is curative for cutaneous diseases. Part of the meat isdeposited in the river with kóhakwa (white shell beads) and turquoise beads as offerings toCouncil of the Gods.” This account at all events confirms the inference that the tortoisesare supposed to be reincarnations of the human dead, for they are called the “otherselves”of the Zuni; indeed, what else should they be than the souls of the dead in the bodies oftortoises seeing that they come from the haunted lake? As the principal object of theprayers uttered and of the dances performed at these midsummer ceremonies appears tobe to procure rain for the crops, it may be that the intention of bringing the tortoises toZuni and dancing before them is to intercede with the ancestral spirit, incarnate in theanimals, that they may be pleased to exert their power over the waters of heaven for thebenefit of their living descendants.5. Killing the Sacred BearDOUBT also hangs at first sight over the meaning of the bear-sacrifice offered by the Ainoor Ainu, a primitive people who are found in the Japanese island of Yezo or Yesso, as wellas in Saghalien and the southern of the Kurile Islands. It is not quite easy to define theattitude of the Aino towards the bear. On the one hand they give it the name of kamui or“god”; but as they apply the same word to strangers, it may mean no more than a beingsupposed to be endowed with superhuman, or at all events extraordinary, powers. Again, itis said that “the bear is their chief divinity”; “in the religion of the Aino the bear plays achief part”; “amongst the animals it is especially the bear which receives an idolatrousveneration”; “they worship it after their fashion”; “there is no doubt that this wild beastinspires more of the feeling which prompts worship than the inanimate forces of nature,and the Aino may be distinguished as bear-worshippers.” Yet, on the other hand, they killthe bear whenever they can; “in bygone years the Ainu considered bear-hunting the mostmanly and useful way in which a person could possibly spend his time”; “the men spend"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"the autumn, winter, and spring in hunting deer and bears. Part of their tribute or taxes ispaid in skins, and they subsist on the dried meat”; bear’s flesh is indeed one of their staplefoods; they eat it both fresh and salted; and the skins of bears furnish them with clothing.In fact, the worship of which writers on this subject speak appears to be paid chiefly to thedead animal. Thus, although they kill a bear whenever they can, “in the process ofdissecting the carcass they endeavor to conciliate the deity, whose representative they haveslain, by making elaborate obeisances and deprecatory salutations”; “when a bear has beenkilled the Ainu sit down and admire it, make their salaams to it, worship it, and offerpresents of inao”; “when a bear is trapped or wounded by an arrow, the hunters gothrough an apologetic or propitiatory ceremony.” The skulls of slain bears receive a placeof honour in their huts, or are set up on sacred posts outside the huts, and are treated withmuch respect: libations of millet beer, and of sake, an intoxicating liquor, are offered tothem; and they are addressed as “divine preservers” or “precious divinities.” The skulls offoxes are also fastened to the sacred posts outside the huts; they are regarded as charmsagainst evil spirits, and are consulted as oracles. Yet it is expressly said, “The live fox isrevered just as little as the bear; rather they avoid it as much as possible, considering it awily animal.” The bear can hardly, therefore, be described as a sacred animal of the Aino,nor yet as a totem; for they do not call themselves bears, and they kill and eat the animalfreely. However, they have a legend of a woman who had a son by a bear; and many ofthem who dwell in the mountains pride themselves on being descended from a bear. Suchpeople are called “Descendants of the bear” (Kimun Kamui sanikiri), and in the pride oftheir heart they will say, “As for me, I am a child of the god of the mountains; I amdescended from the divine one who rules in the mountains,” meaning by “the god of themountains” no other than the bear. It is therefore possible that, as our principal authority,the Rev. J. Batchelor, believes, the bear may have been the totem of an Aino clan; but evenif that were so it would not explain the respect shown for the animal by the whole Ainopeople.But it is the bear-festival of the Aino which concerns us here. Towards the end of winter abear cub is caught and brought into the village. If it is very small, it is suckled by an Ainowoman, but should there be no woman able to suckle it, the little animal is fed from thehand or the mouth. During the day it plays about in the hut with the children and is treatedwith great affection. But when the cub grows big enough to pain people by hugging orscratching them, he is shut up in a strong wooden cage, where he stays generally for two orthree years, fed on fish and millet porridge, till it is time for him to be killed and eaten. But“it is a peculiarly striking fact that the young bear is not kept merely to furnish a goodmeal; rather he is regarded and honoured as a fetish, or even as a sort of higher being.” InYezo the festival is generally celebrated in September or October. Before it takes place theAino apologise to their gods, alleging that they have treated the bear kindly as long as theycould, now they can feed him no longer, and are obliged to kill him. A man who gives abear-feast invites his relations and friends; in a small village nearly the whole communitytakes part in the feast; indeed, guests from distant villages are invited and generally come,allured by the prospect of getting drunk for nothing. The form of invitation runs somewhatas follows: “I, so and so, am about to sacrifice the dear little divine thing who residesamong the mountains. My friends and masters, come ye to the feast; we will then unite inthe great pleasure of sending the god away. Come.” When all the people are assembled infront of the cage, an orator chosen for the purpose addresses the bear and tells it that they"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"are about to send it forth to its ancestors. He craves pardon for what they are about to doto it, hopes it will not be angry, and comforts it by assuring the animal that many of thesacred whittled sticks (inao) and plenty of cakes and wine will be sent with it on the longjourney. One speech of this sort which Mr. Batchelor heard ran as follows: “O thou divineone, thou wast sent into the world for us to hunt. O thou precious little divinity, we worshipthee; pray hear our prayer. We have nourished thee and brought thee up with a deal ofpains and trouble, all because we love thee so. Now, as thou hast grown big, we are about tosend thee to thy father and mother. When thou comest to them please speak well of us, andtell them how kind we have been; please come to us again and we will sacrifice thee.”Having been secured with ropes, the bear is then let out of the cage and assailed with ashower of blunt arrows in order to arouse it to fury. When it has spent itself in vainstruggles, it is tied up to a stake, gagged and strangled, its neck being placed between twopoles, which are then violently compressed, all the people eagerly helping to squeeze theanimal to death. An arrow is also discharged into the beast’s heart by a good marksman,but so as not to shed blood, for they think that it would be very unlucky if any of the bloodwere to drip on the ground. However, the men sometimes drink the warm blood of the bear“that the courage and other virtues it possesses may pass into them”; and sometimes theybesmear themselves and their clothes with the blood in order to ensure success in hunting.When the animal has been strangled to death, it is skinned and its head is cut off and set inthe east window of the house, where a piece of its own flesh is placed under its snout,together with a cup of its own meat boiled, some millet dumplings, and dried fish. Prayersare then addressed to the dead animal; amongst other things it is sometimes invited, aftergoing away to its father and mother, to return into the world in order that it may again bereared for sacrifice. When the bear is supposed to have finished eating its own flesh, theman who presides at the feast takes the cup containing the boiled meat, salutes it, anddivides the contents between all the company present: every person, young and old alike,must taste a little. The cup is called “the cup of offering” because it has just been offered tothe dead bear. When the rest of the flesh has been cooked, it is shared out in like manneramong all the people, everybody partaking of at least a morsel; not to partake of the feastwould be equivalent to excommunication, it would be to place the recreant outside the paleof Aino fellowship. Formerly every particle of the bear, except the bones, had to be eatenup at the banquet, but this rule is now relaxed. The head, on being detached from the skin,is set up on a long pole beside the sacred wands (inao) outside of the house, where itremains till nothing but the bare white skull is left. Skulls so set up are worshipped not onlyat the time of the festival, but very often as long as they last. The Aino assured Mr.Batchelor that they really do believe the spirits of the worshipful animals to reside in theskulls; that is why they address them as “divine preservers” and “precious divinities.”The ceremony of killing the bear was witnessed by Dr. B. Scheube on the tenth of August atKunnui, which is a village on Volcano Bay in the island of Yezo or Yesso. As his descriptionof the rite contains some interesting particulars not mentioned in the foregoing account, itmay be worth while to summarize it.On entering the hut he found about thirty Aino present, men, women, and children, alldressed in their best. The master of the house first offered a libation on the fireplace to thegod of the fire, and the guests followed his example. Then a libation was offered to thehouse-god in his sacred corner of the hut. Meanwhile the housewife, who had nursed the"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"bear, sat by herself, silent and sad, bursting now and then into tears. Her grief wasobviously unaffected, and it deepened as the festival went on. Next, the master of the houseand some of the guests went out of the hut and offered libations before the bear’s cage. Afew drops were presented to the bear in a saucer, which he at once upset. Then the womenand girls danced round the cage, their faces turned towards it, their knees slightly bent,rising and hopping on their toes. As they danced they clapped their hands and sang amonotonous song. The housewife and a few old women, who might have nursed manybears, danced tearfully, stretching out their arms to the bear, and addressing it in terms ofendearment. The young folks were less affected; they laughed as well as sang. Disturbed bythe noise, the bear began to rush about his cage and howl lamentably. Next libations wereoffered at the inao (inabos) or sacred wands which stand outside of an Aino hut. Thesewands are about a couple of feet high, and are whittled at the top into spiral shavings. Fivenew wands with bamboo leaves attached to them had been set up for the festival. This isregularly done when a bear is killed; the leaves mean that the animal may come to lifeagain. Then the bear was let out of his cage, a rope was thrown round his neck, and he wasled about in the neighbourhood of the hut. While this was being done the men, headed by achief, shot at the beast with arrows tipped with wooden buttons. Dr. Scheube had to do soalso. Then the bear was taken before the sacred wands, a stick was put in his mouth, ninemen knelt on him and pressed his neck against a beam. In five minutes the animal hadexpired without uttering a sound. Meantime the women and girls had taken post behindthe men, where they danced, lamenting, and beating the men who were killing the bear.The bear’s carcase was next placed on the mat before the sacred wands; and a sword andquiver, taken from the wands, were hung round the beast’s neck. Being a she-bear, it wasalso adorned with a necklace and ear-rings. Then food and drink were offered to it, in theshape of millet-broth, millet-cakes, and a pot of sake. The men now sat down on matsbefore the dead bear, offered libations to it, and drank deep. Meanwhile the women andgirls had laid aside all marks of sorrow, and danced merrily, none more merrily than theold women. When the mirth was at its height two young Aino, who had let the bear out ofhis cage, mounted the roof of the hut and threw cakes of millet among the company, whoall scrambled for them without distinction of age or sex. The bear was next skinned anddisembowelled, and the trunk severed from the head, to which the skin was left hanging.The blood, caught in cups, was eagerly swallowed by the men. None of the women orchildren appeared to drink the blood, though custom did not forbid them to do so. Theliver was cut in small pieces and eaten raw, with salt, the women and children getting theirshare. The flesh and the rest of the vitals were taken into the house to be kept till the nextday but one, and then to be divided among the persons who had been present at the feast.Blood and liver were offered to Dr. Scheube. While the bear was being disembowelled, thewomen and girls danced the same dance which they had danced at the beginning—not,however, round the cage, but in front of the sacred wands. At this dance the old women,who had been merry a moment before, again shed tears freely. After the brain had beenextracted from the bear’s head and swallowed with salt, the skull, detached from the skin,was hung on a pole beside the sacred wands. The stick with which the bear had beengagged was also fastened to the pole, and so were the sword and quiver which had beenhung on the carcase. The latter were removed in about an hour, but the rest remainedstanding. The whole company, men and women, danced noisily before the pole; andanother drinking-bout, in which the women joined, closed the festival."},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"Perhaps the first published account of the bear-feast of the Aino is one which was given tothe world by a Japanese writer in 1652. It has been translated into French and runs thus:“When they find a young bear, they bring it home, and the wife suckles it. When it is grownthey feed it with fish and fowl and kill it in winter for the sake of the liver, which theyesteem an antidote to poison, the worms, colic, and disorders of the stomach. It is of a verybitter taste, and is good for nothing if the bear has been killed in summer. This butcherybegins in the first Japanese month. For this purpose they put the animal’s head betweentwo long poles, which are squeezed together by fifty or sixty people, both men and women.When the bear is dead they eat his flesh, keep the liver as a medicine, and sell the skin,which is black and commonly six feet long, but the longest measure twelve feet. As soon ashe is skinned, the persons who nourished the beast begin to bewail him; afterwards theymake little cakes to regale those who helped them.”The Aino of Saghalien rear bear cubs and kill them with similar ceremonies. We are toldthat they do not look upon the bear as a god but only as a messenger whom they despatchwith various commissions to the god of the forest. The animal is kept for about two years ina cage, and then killed at a festival, which always takes place in winter and at night. Theday before the sacrifice is devoted to lamentation, old women relieving each other in theduty of weeping and groaning in front of the bear’s cage. Then about the middle of thenight or very early in the morning an orator makes a long speech to the beast, remindinghim how they have taken care of him, and fed him well, and bathed him in the river, andmade him warm and comfortable. “Now,” he proceeds, “we are holding a great festival inyour honour. Be not afraid. We will not hurt you. We will only kill you and send you to thegod of the forest who loves you. We are about to offer you a good dinner, the best you haveever eaten among us, and we will all weep for you together. The Aino who will kill you isthe best shot among us. There he is, he weeps and asks your forgiveness; you will feelalmost nothing, it will be done so quickly. We cannot feed you always, as you willunderstand. We have done enough for you; it is now your turn to sacrifice yourself for us.You will ask God to send us, for the winter, plenty of otters and sables, and for thesummer, seals and fish in abundance. Do not forget our messages, we love you much, andour children will never forget you.” When the bear has partaken of his last meal amid thegeneral emotion of the spectators, the old women weeping afresh and the men utteringstifled cries, he is strapped, not without difficulty and danger, and being let out of the cageis led on leash or dragged, according to the state of his temper, thrice round his cage, thenround his master’s house, and lastly round the house of the orator. Thereupon he is tied upto a tree, which is decked with sacred whittled sticks (inao) of the usual sort; and the oratoragain addresses him in a long harangue, which sometimes lasts till the day is beginning tobreak. “Remember,” he cries, “remember! I remind you of your whole life and of theservices we have rendered you. It is now for you to do your duty. Do not forget what I haveasked of you. You will tell the gods to give us riches, that our hunters may return from theforest laden with rare furs and animals good to eat; that our fishers may find troops ofseals on the shore and in the sea, and that their nets may crack under the weight of the fish.We have no hope but in you. The evil spirits laugh at us, and too often they areunfavourable and malignant to us, but they will bow before you. We have given you foodand joy and health; now we kill you in order that you may in return send riches to us andto our children.” To this discourse the bear, more and more surly and agitated, listenswithout conviction; round and round the tree he paces and howls lamentably, till, just as"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"the first beams of the rising sun light up the scene, an archer speeds an arrow to his heart.No sooner has he done so, than the marksman throws away his bow and flings himself onthe ground, and the old men and women do the same, weeping and sobbing. Then theyoffer the dead beast a repast of rice and wild potatoes, and having spoken to him in termsof pity and thanked him for what he has done and suffered, they cut off his head and pawsand keep them as sacred things. A banquet on the flesh and blood of the bear follows.Women were formerly excluded from it, but now they share with the men. The blood isdrunk warm by all present; the flesh is boiled, custom forbids it to be roasted. And as therelics of the bear may not enter the house by the door, and Aino houses in Saghalien haveno windows, a man gets up on the roof and lets the flesh, the head, and the skin downthrough the smoke-hole. Rice and wild potatoes are then offered to the head, and a pipe,tobacco, and matches are considerately placed beside it. Custom requires that the guestsshould eat up the whole animal before they depart; the use of salt and pepper at the meal isforbidden; and no morsel of the flesh may be given to the dogs. When the banquet is over,the head is carried away into the depth of the forest and deposited on a heap of bears’skulls, the bleached and mouldering relics of similar festivals in the past.The Gilyaks, a Tunguzian people of Eastern Siberia, hold a bear-festival of the same sortonce a year in January. “The bear is the object of the most refined solicitude of an entirevillage and plays the chief part in their religious ceremonies.” An old she-bear is shot andher cub is reared, but not suckled, in the village. When the bear is big enough he is takenfrom his cage and dragged through the village. But first they lead him to the bank of theriver, for this is believed to ensure abundance of fish to each family. He is then taken intoevery house in the village, where fish, brandy, and so forth are offered to him. Some peopleprostrate themselves before the beast. His entrance into a house is supposed to bring ablessing; and if he snuffs at the food offered to him, this also is a blessing. Nevertheless theytease and worry, poke and tickle the animal continually, so that he is surly and snappish.After being thus taken to every house, he is tied to a peg and shot dead with arrows. Hishead is then cut off, decked with shavings, and placed on the table where the feast is set out.Here they beg pardon of the beast and worship him. Then his flesh is roasted and eaten inspecial vessels of wood finely carved. They do not eat the flesh raw nor drink the blood, asthe Aino do. The brain and entrails are eaten last; and the skull, still decked with shavings,is placed on a tree near the house. Then the people sing and both sexes dance in ranks, asbears.One of these bear-festivals was witnessed by the Russian traveller L. von Schrenck and hiscompanions at the Gilyak village of Tebach in January 1856. From his detailed report ofthe ceremony we may gather some particulars which are not noticed in the briefer accountswhich I have just summarised. The bear, he tells us, plays a great part in the life of all thepeoples inhabiting the region of the Amoor and Siberia as far as Kamtchatka, but amongnone of them is his importance greater than among the Gilyaks. The immense size whichthe animal attains in the valley of the Amoor, his ferocity whetted by hunger, and thefrequency of his appearance, all combine to make him the most dreaded beast of prey inthe country. No wonder, therefore, that the fancy of the Gilyaks is busied with him andsurrounds him, both in life and in death, with a sort of halo of superstitious fear. Thus, forexample, it is thought that if a Gilyak falls in combat with a bear, his soul transmigratesinto the body of the beast. Nevertheless his flesh has an irresistible attraction for the Gilyak"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"palate, especially when the animal has been kept in captivity for some time and fattened onfish, which gives the flesh, in the opinion of the Gilyaks, a peculiarly delicious flavour. Butin order to enjoy this dainty with impunity they deem it needful to perform a long series ofceremonies, of which the intention is to delude the living bear by a show of respect, and toappease the anger of the dead animal by the homage paid to his departed spirit. The marksof respect begin as soon as the beast is captured. He is brought home in triumph and keptin a cage, where all the villagers take it in turns to feed him. For although he may havebeen captured or purchased by one man, he belongs in a manner to the whole village. Hisflesh will furnish a common feast, and hence all must contribute to support him in his life.The length of time he is kept in captivity depends on his age. Old bears are kept only a fewmonths; cubs are kept till they are full-grown. A thick layer of fat on the captive bear givesthe signal for the festival, which is always held in winter, generally in December butsometimes in January or February. At the festival witnessed by the Russian travellers,which lasted a good many days, three bears were killed and eaten. More than once theanimals were led about in procession and compelled to enter every house in the village,where they were fed as a mark of honour, and to show that they were welcome guests. Butbefore the beasts set out on this round of visits, the Gilyaks played at skipping-rope inpresence, and perhaps, as L. von Schrenck inclined to believe, in honour of the animals.The night before they were killed, the three bears were led by moonlight a long way on theice of the frozen river. That night no one in the village might sleep. Next day, after theanimals had been again led down the steep bank to the river, and conducted thrice roundthe hole in the ice from which the women of the village drew their water, they were taken toan appointed place not far from the village, and shot to death with arrows. The place ofsacrifice or execution was marked as holy by being surrounded with whittled sticks, fromthe tops of which shavings hung in curls. Such sticks are with the Gilyaks, as with the Aino,the regular symbols that accompany all religious ceremonies.When the house has been arranged and decorated for their reception, the skins of thebears, with their heads attached to them, are brought into it, not, however, by the door, butthrough a window, and then hung on a sort of scaffold opposite the hearth on which theflesh is to be cooked. The boiling of the bears’ flesh among the Gilyaks is done only by theoldest men, whose high privilege it is; women and children, young men and boys have nopart in it. The task is performed slowly and deliberately, with a certain solemnity. On theoccasion described by the Russian travellers the kettle was first of all surrounded with athick wreath of shavings, and then filled with snow, for the use of water to cook bear’s fleshis forbidden. Meanwhile a large wooden trough, richly adorned with arabesques andcarvings of all sorts, was hung immediately under the snouts of the bears; on one side of thetrough was carved in relief a bear, on the other side a toad. When the carcases were beingcut up, each leg was laid on the ground in front of the bears, as if to ask their leave, beforebeing placed in the kettle; and the boiled flesh was fished out of the kettle with an ironhook, and set in the trough before the bears, in order that they might be the first to taste oftheir own flesh. As fast, too, as the fat was cut in strips it was hung up in front of the bears,and afterwards laid in a small wooden trough on the ground before them. Last of all theinner organs of the beasts were cut up and placed in small vessels. At the same time thewomen made bandages out of parti-coloured rags, and after sunset these bandages weretied round the bears’ snouts just below the eyes “in order to dry the tears that flowed fromthem.”"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"As soon as the ceremony of wiping away poor bruin’s tears had been performed, theassembled Gilyaks set to work in earnest to devour his flesh. The broth obtained by boilingthe meat had already been partaken of. The wooden bowls, platters, and spoons out ofwhich the Gilyaks eat the broth and flesh of the bears on these occasions are always madespecially for the purpose at the festival and only then; they are elaborately ornamentedwith carved figures of bears and other devices that refer to the animal or the festival, andthe people have a strong superstitious scruple against parting with them. After the boneshad been picked clean they were put back in the kettle in which the flesh had been boiled.And when the festal meal was over, an old man took his stand at the door of the house witha branch of fir in his hand, with which, as the people passed out, he gave a light blow toevery one who had eaten of the bear’s flesh or fat, perhaps as a punishment for theirtreatment of the worshipful animal. In the afternoon the women performed a strangedance. Only one woman danced at a time, throwing the upper part of her body into theoddest postures, while she held in her hands a branch of fir or a kind of wooden castanets.The other women meanwhile played an accompaniment by drumming on the beams of thehouse with clubs. Von Schrenk believed that after the flesh of the bear has been eaten thebones and the skull are solemnly carried out by the oldest people to a place in the forest notfar from the village. There all the bones except the skull are buried. After that a young treeis felled a few inches above the ground, its stump cleft, and the skull wedged into the cleft.When the grass grows over the spot, the skull disappears from view, and that is the end ofthe bear.Another description of the bear-festivals of the Gilyaks has been given us by Mr. LeoSternberg. It agrees substantially with the foregoing accounts, but a few particulars in itmay be noted. According to Mr. Sternberg, the festival is usually held in honour of adeceased relation: the next of kin either buys or catches a bear cub and nurtures it for twoor three years till it is ready for the sacrifice. Only certain distinguished guests (Narch-en)are privileged to partake of the bear’s flesh, but the host and members of his clan eat abroth made from the flesh; great quantities of this broth are prepared and consumed onthe occasion. The guests of honour (Narch-en) must belong to the clan into which the host’sdaughters and the other women of his clan are married: one of these guests, usually thehost’s son-in-law, is entrusted with the duty of shooting the bear dead with an arrow. Theskin, head, and flesh of the slain bear are brought into the house not through the door butthrough the smoke-hole; a quiver full of arrows is laid under the head and beside it aredeposited tobacco, sugar, and other food. The soul of the bear is supposed to carry off thesouls of these things with it on the far journey. A special vessel is used for cooking thebear’s flesh, and the fire must be kindled by a sacred apparatus of flint and steel, whichbelongs to the clan and is handed down from generation to generation, but which is neverused to light fires except on these solemn occasions. Of all the many viands cooked for theconsumption of the assembled people a portion is placed in a special vessel and set beforethe bear’s head: this is called “feeding the head.” After the bear has been killed, dogs aresacrificed in couples of male and female. Before being throttled, they are fed and invited togo to their lord on the highest mountain, to change their skins, and to return next year inthe form of bears. The soul of the dead bear departs to the same lord, who is also lord ofthe primaeval forest; it goes away laden with the offerings that have been made to it, andattended by the souls of the dogs and also by the souls of the sacred whittled sticks, whichfigure prominently at the festival."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"The Goldi, neighbours of the Gilyaks, treat the bear in much the same way. They hunt andkill it; but sometimes they capture a live bear and keep him in a cage, feeding him well andcalling him their son and brother. Then at a great festival he is taken from his cage,paraded about with marked consideration, and afterwards killed and eaten. “The skull,jaw-bones, and ears are then suspended on a tree, as an antidote against evil spirits; but theflesh is eaten and much relished, for they believe that all who partake of it acquire a zestfor the chase, and become courageous.”The Orotchis, another Tunguzian people of the region of the Amoor, hold bear-festivals ofthe same general character. Any one who catches a bear cub considers it his bounden dutyto rear it in a cage for about three years, in order at the end of that time to kill it publiclyand eat the flesh with his friends. The feasts being public, though organised by individuals,the people try to have one in each Orotchi village every year in turn. When the bear istaken out of his cage, he is led about by means of ropes to all the huts, accompanied bypeople armed with lances, bows, and arrows. At each hut the bear and bear-leaders aretreated to something good to eat and drink. This goes on for several days until all the huts,not only in that village but also in the next, have been visited. The days are given up tosport and noisy jollity. Then the bear is tied to a tree or wooden pillar and shot to death bythe arrows of the crowd, after which its flesh is roasted and eaten. Among the Orotchis ofthe Tundja River women take part in the bear-feasts, while among the Orotchis of theRiver Vi the women will not even touch bear’s flesh.In the treatment of the captive bear by these tribes there are features which can hardly bedistinguished from worship. Such, for example, are the prayers offered to it both alive anddead; the offerings of food, including portions of its own flesh, laid before the animal’sskull; and the Gilyak custom of leading the living beast to the river in order to ensure asupply of fish, and of conducting him from house to house in order that every family mayreceive his blessing, just as in Europe a May-tree or a personal representative of the tree-spirit used to be taken from door to door in spring for the sake of diffusing among all andsundry the fresh energies of reviving nature. Again, the solemn participation in his fleshand blood, and particularly the Aino custom of sharing the contents of the cup which hadbeen consecrated by being set before the dead beast, are strongly suggestive of a sacrament,and the suggestion is confirmed by the Gilyak practice of reserving special vessels to holdthe flesh and cooking it on a fire kindled by a sacred apparatus which is never employedexcept on these religious occasions. Indeed our principal authority on Aino religion, theRev. John Batchelor, frankly describes as worship the ceremonious respect which the Ainopay to the bear, and he affirms that the animal is undoubtedly one of their gods. Certainlythe Aino appear to apply their name for god (kamui) freely to the bear; but, as Mr.Batchelor himself points out, that word is used with many different shades of meaning andis applied to a great variety of objects, so that from its application to the bear we cannotsafely argue that the animal is actually regarded as a deity. Indeed we are expressly toldthat the Aino of Saghalien do not consider the bear to be a god but only a messenger to thegods, and the message with which they charge the animal at its death bears out thestatement. Apparently the Gilyaks also look on the bear in the light of an envoy despatchedwith presents to the Lord of the Mountain, on whom the welfare of the people depends. Atthe same time they treat the animal as a being of a higher order than man, in fact as aminor deity, whose presence in the village, so long as he is kept and fed, diffuses blessings,"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"especially by keeping at bay the swarms of evil spirits who are constantly lying in wait forpeople, stealing their goods and destroying their bodies by sickness and disease. Moreover,by partaking of the flesh, blood, or broth of the bear, the Gilyaks, the Aino, and the Goldiare all of opinion that they acquire some portion of the animal’s mighty powers,particularly his courage and strength. No wonder, therefore, that they should treat so greata benefactor with marks of the highest respect and affection.Some light may be thrown on the ambiguous attitude of the Aino to bears by comparingthe similar treatment which they accord to other creatures. For example, they regard theeagle-owl as a good deity who by his hooting warns men of threatened evil and defendsthem against it; hence he is loved, trusted, and devoutly worshipped as a divine mediatorbetween men and the Creator. The various names applied to him are significant both of hisdivinity and of his mediatorship. Whenever an opportunity offers, one of these divine birdsis captured and kept in a cage, where he is greeted with the endearing titles of “Belovedgod” and “Dear little divinity.” Nevertheless the time comes when the dear little divinity isthrottled and sent away in his capacity of mediator to take a message to the superior godsor to the Creator himself. The following is the form of prayer addressed to the eagle-owlwhen it is about to be sacrificed: “Beloved deity, we have brought you up because we lovedyou, and now we are about to send you to your father. We herewith offer you food, inao,wine, and cakes; take them to your parent, and he will be very pleased. When you come tohim say, ‘I have lived a long time among the Ainu, where an Ainu father and an Ainumother reared me. I now come to thee. I have brought a variety of good things. I saw whileliving in Ainuland a great deal of distress. I observed that some of the people werepossessed by demons, some were wounded by wild animals, some were hurt by landslides,others suffered shipwreck, and many were attacked by disease. The people are in greatstraits. My father, hear me, and hasten to look upon the Ainu and help them.’ If you dothis, your father will help us.”Again, the Aino keep eagles in cages, worship them as divinities, and ask them to defendthe people from evil. Yet they offer the bird in sacrifice, and when they are about to do sothey pray to him, saying: “O precious divinity, O thou divine bird, pray listen to my words.Thou dost not belong to this world, for thy home is with the Creator and his golden eagles.This being so, I present thee with these inao and cakes and other precious things. Do thouride upon the inao and ascend to thy home in the glorious heavens. When thou arrivest,assemble the deities of thy own kind together and thank them for us for having governedthe world. Do thou come again, I beseech thee, and rule over us. O my precious one, gothou quietly.” Once more, the Aino revere hawks, keep them in cages, and offer them insacrifice. At the time of killing one of them the following prayer should be addressed to thebird: “O divine hawk, thou art an expert hunter, please cause thy cleverness to descend onme.” If a hawk is well treated in captivity and prayed to after this fashion when he is aboutto be killed, he will surely send help to the hunter.Thus the Aino hopes to profit in various ways by slaughtering the creatures, which,nevertheless, he treats as divine. He expects them to carry messages for him to theirkindred or to the gods in the upper world; he hopes to partake of their virtues byswallowing parts of their bodies or in other ways; and apparently he looks forward to theirbodily resurrection in this world, which will enable him again to catch and kill them, and"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"again to reap all the benefits which he has already derived from their slaughter. For in theprayers addressed to the worshipful bear and the worshipful eagle before they are knockedon the head the creatures are invited to come again, which seems clearly to point to a faithin their future resurrection. If any doubt could exist on this head, it would be dispelled bythe evidence of Mr. Batchelor, who tells us that the Aino “are firmly convinced that thespirits of birds and animals killed in hunting or offered in sacrifice come and live againupon the earth clothed with a body; and they believe, further, that they appear here for thespecial benefit of men, particularly Ainu hunters.” The Aino, Mr. Batchelor tells us,“confessedly slays and eats the beast that another may come in its place and be treated inlike manner”; and at the time of sacrificing the creatures “prayers are said to them whichform a request that they will come again and furnish viands for another feast, as if it werean honour to them to be thus killed and eaten, and a pleasure as well. Indeed such is thepeople’s idea.” These last observations, as the context shows, refer especially to the sacrificeof bears.Thus among the benefits which the Aino anticipates from the slaughter of the worshipfulanimals not the least substantial is that of gorging himself on their flesh and blood, both onthe present and on many a similar occasion hereafter; and that pleasing prospect again isderived from his firm faith in the spiritual immortality and bodily resurrection of the deadanimals. A like faith is shared by many savage hunters in many parts of the world and hasgiven rise to a variety of quaint customs, some of which will be described presently.Meantime it is not unimportant to observe that the solemn festivals at which the Aino, theGilyaks, and other tribes slaughter the tame caged bears with demonstrations of respectand sorrow, are probably nothing but an extension or glorification of similar rites whichthe hunter performs over any wild bear which he chances to kill in the forest. Indeed withregard to the Gilyaks we are expressly informed that this is the case. If we wouldunderstand the meaning of the Gilyak ritual, says Mr. Sternberg, “we must above allremember that the bear-festivals are not, as is usually but falsely assumed, celebrated onlyat the killing of a house-bear but are held on every occasion when a Gilyak succeeds inslaughtering a bear in the chase. It is true that in such cases the festival assumes lessimposing dimensions, but in its essence it remains the same. When the head and skin of abear killed in the forest are brought into the village, they are accorded a triumphalreception with music and solemn ceremonial. The head is laid on a consecrated scaffold,fed, and treated with offerings, just as at the killing of a house-bear; and the guests ofhonour (Narch-en) are also assembled. So, too, dogs are sacrificed, and the bones of thebear are preserved in the same place and with the same marks of respect as the bones of ahouse-bear. Hence the great winter festival is only an extension of the rite which isobserved at the slaughter of every bear.”Thus the apparent contradiction in the practice of these tribes, who venerate and almostdeify the animals which they habitually hunt, kill, and eat, is not so flagrant as at first sightit appears to us: the people have reasons, and some very practical reasons, for acting asthey do. For the savage is by no means so illogical and unpractical as to superficialobservers he is apt to seem; he has thought deeply on the questions which immediatelyconcern him, he reasons about them, and though his conclusions often diverge very widelyfrom ours, we ought not to deny him the credit of patient and prolonged meditation onsome fundamental problems of human existence. In the present case, if he treats bears in"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"general as creatures wholly subservient to human needs and yet singles out certainindividuals of the species for homage which almost amounts to deification, we must nothastily set him down as irrational and inconsistent, but must endeavour to place ourselvesat his point of view, to see things as he sees them, and to divest ourselves of theprepossessions which tinge so deeply our own views of the world. If we do so, we shallprobably discover that, however absurd his conduct may appear to us, the savagenevertheless generally acts on a train of reasoning which seems to him in harmony with thefacts of his limited experience. This I propose to illustrate in the following chapter, where Ishall attempt to show that the solemn ceremonial of the bear-festival among the Ainos andother tribes of North-eastern Asia is only a particularly striking example of the respectwhich on the principles of his rude philosophy the savage habitually pays to the animalswhich he kills and eats.LIII. The Propitiation of Wild Animals By HuntersTHE EXPLANATION of life by the theory of an indwelling and practically immortal soulis one which the savage does not confine to human beings but extends to the animatecreation in general. In so doing he is more liberal and perhaps more logical than thecivilised man, who commonly denies to animals that privilege of immortality which heclaims for himself. The savage is not so proud; he commonly believes that animals areendowed with feelings and intelligence like those of men, and that, like men, they possesssouls which survive the death of their bodies either to wander about as disembodied spiritsor to be born again in animal form.Thus to the savage, who regards all living creatures as practically on a footing of equalitywith man, the act of killing and eating an animal must wear a very different aspect fromthat which the same act presents to us, who regard the intelligence of animals as farinferior to our own and deny them the possession of immortal souls. Hence on theprinciples of his rude philosophy the primitive hunter who slays an animal believes himselfexposed to the vengeance either of its disembodied spirit or of all the other animals of thesame species, whom he considers as knit together, like men, by the ties of kin and theobligations of the blood feud, and therefore as bound to resent the injury done to one oftheir number. Accordingly the savage makes it a rule to spare the life of those animalswhich he has no pressing motive for killing, at least such fierce and dangerous animals asare likely to exact a bloody vengeance for the slaughter of one of their kind. Crocodiles areanimals of this sort. They are only found in hot countries, where, as a rule, food isabundant and primitive man has therefore little reason to kill them for the sake of theirtough and unpalatable flesh. Hence it is a custom with some savages to spare crocodiles, orrather only to kill them in obedience to the law of blood feud, that is, as a retaliation for theslaughter of men by crocodiles. For example, the Dyaks of Borneo will not kill a crocodileunless a crocodile has first killed a man. “For why, say they, should they commit an act ofaggression, when he and his kindred can so easily repay them? But should the alligatortake a human life, revenge becomes a sacred duty of the living relatives, who will trap theman-eater in the spirit of an officer of justice pursuing a criminal. Others, even then, hangback, reluctant to embroil themselves in a quarrel which does not concern them. The man-"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"eating alligator is supposed to be pursued by a righteous Nemesis; and whenever one iscaught they have a profound conviction that it must be the guilty one, or his accomplice.”Like the Dyaks, the natives of Madagascar never kill a crocodile “except in retaliation forone of their friends who has been destroyed by a crocodile. They believe that the wantondestruction of one of these reptiles will be followed by the loss of human life, in accordancewith the principle of lex talionis.” The people who live near the lake Itasy in Madagascarmake a yearly proclamation to the crocodiles, announcing that they will revenge the deathof some of their friends by killing as many crocodiles in return, and warning all well-disposed crocodiles to keep out of the way, as they have no quarrel with them, but onlywith their evil-minded relations who have taken human life. Various tribes of Madagascarbelieve themselves to be descended from crocodiles, and accordingly they view the scalyreptile as, to all intents and purposes, a man and a brother. If one of the animals should sofar forget himself as to devour one of his human kinsfolk, the chief of the tribe, or in hisabsence an old man familiar with the tribal customs, repairs at the head of the people to theedge of the water, and summons the family of the culprit to deliver him up to the arm ofjustice. A hook is then baited and cast into the river or lake. Next day the guilty brother, orone of his family, is dragged ashore, and after his crime has been clearly brought home tohim by a strict interrogation, he is sentenced to death and executed. The claims of justicebeing thus satisfied and the majesty of the law fully vindicated, the deceased crocodile islamented and buried like a kinsman; a mound is raised over his relics and a stone marksthe place of his head.Again, the tiger is another of those dangerous beasts whom the savage prefers to leavealone, lest by killing one of the species he should excite the hostility of the rest. Noconsideration will induce a Sumatran to catch or wound a tiger except in self-defence orimmediately after a tiger has destroyed a friend or relation. When a European has set trapsfor tigers, the people of the neighbourhood have been known to go by night to the place andexplain to the animals that the traps are not set by them nor with their consent. Theinhabitants of the hills near Rajamahall, in Bengal, are very averse to killing a tiger, unlessone of their kinsfolk has been carried off by one of the beasts. In that case they go out forthe purpose of hunting and slaying a tiger; and when they have succeeded they lay theirbows and arrows on the carcase and invoke God, declaring that they slew the animal inretaliation for the loss of a kinsman. Vengeance having been thus taken, they swear not toattack another tiger except under similar provocation.The Indians of Carolina would not molest snakes when they came upon them, but wouldpass by on the other side of the path, believing that if they were to kill a serpent, thereptile’s kindred would destroy some of their brethren, friends, or relations in return. Sothe Seminole Indians spared the rattlesnake, because they feared that the soul of the deadrattlesnake would incite its kinsfolk to take vengeance. The Cherokee regard therattlesnake as the chief of the snake tribe and fear and respect him accordingly. FewCherokee will venture to kill a rattlesnake, unless they cannot help it, and even then theymust atone for the crime by craving pardon of the snake’s ghost either in their own personor through the mediation of a priest, according to a set formula. If these precautions areneglected, the kinsfolk of the dead snake will send one of their number as an avenger ofblood, who will track down the murderer and sting him to death. No ordinary Cherokee"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"dares to kill a wolf, if he can possibly help it; for he believes that the kindred of the slainbeast would surely avenge its death, and that the weapon with which the deed had beendone would be quite useless for the future, unless it were cleaned and exorcised by amedicine-man. However, certain persons who know the proper rites of atonement for sucha crime can kill wolves with impunity, and they are sometimes hired to do so by people whohave suffered from the raids of the wolves on their cattle or fish-traps. In Jebel-Nuba, adistrict of the Eastern Sudan, it is forbidden to touch the nests or remove the young of aspecies of black birds, resembling our blackbirds, because the people believe that theparent birds would avenge the wrong by causing a stormy wind to blow, which woulddestroy the harvest.But the savage clearly cannot afford to spare all animals. He must either eat some of themor starve, and when the question thus comes to be whether he or the animal must perish, heis forced to overcome his superstitious scruples and take the life of the beast. At the sametime he does all he can to appease his victims and their kinsfolk. Even in the act of killingthem he testifies his respect for them, endeavours to excuse or even conceal his share inprocuring their death, and promises that their remains will be honourably treated. By thusrobbing death of its terrors, he hopes to reconcile his victims to their fate and to inducetheir fellows to come and be killed also. For example, it was a principle with theKamtchatkans never to kill a land or sea animal without first making excuses to it andbegging that the animal would not take it ill. Also they offered it cedarnuts and so forth, tomake it think that it was not a victim but a guest at a feast. They believed that thishindered other animals of the same species from growing shy. For instance, after they hadkilled a bear and feasted on its flesh, the host would bring the bear’s head before thecompany, wrap it in grass, and present it with a variety of trifles. Then he would lay theblame of the bear’s death on the Russians, and bid the beast wreak his wrath upon them.Also he would ask the bear to inform the other bears how well he had been treated, thatthey too might come without fear. Seals, sea-lions, and other animals were treated by theKamtchatkans with the same ceremonious respect. Moreover, they used to insert sprigs ofa plant resembling bear’s wort in the mouths of the animals they killed; after which theywould exhort the grinning skulls to have no fear but to go and tell it to their fellows, thatthey also might come and be caught and so partake of this splendid hospitality. When theOstiaks have hunted and killed a bear, they cut off its head and hang it on a tree. Then theygather round in a circle and pay it divine honours. Next they run towards the carcaseuttering lamentations and saying, “Who killed you? It was the Russians. Who cut off yourhead? It was a Russian axe. Who skinned you? It was a knife made by a Russian.” Theyexplain, too, that the feathers which sped the arrow on its flight came from the wing of astrange bird, and that they did nothing but let the arrow go. They do all this because theybelieve that the wandering ghost of the slain bear would attack them on the firstopportunity, if they did not thus appease it. Or they stuff the skin of the slain bear withhay; and after celebrating their victory with songs of mockery and insult, after spitting onand kicking it, they set it up on its hind legs, “and then, for a considerable time, theybestow on it all the veneration due to a guardian god.” When a party of Koryak have killeda bear or a wolf, they skin the beast and dress one of themselves in the skin. Then theydance round the skin-clad man, saying that it was not they who killed the animal, but someone else, generally a Russian. When they kill a fox they skin it, wrap the body in grass, andbid him go tell his companions how hospitably he has been received, and how he has"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"received a new cloak instead of his old one. A fuller account of the Koryak ceremonies isgiven by a more recent writer. He tells us that when a dead bear is brought to the house,the women come out to meet it, dancing with firebrands. The bear-skin is taken off alongwith the head; and one of the women puts on the skin, dances in it, and entreats the bearnot to be angry, but to be kind to the people. At the same time they offer meat on a woodenplatter to the dead beast, saying, “Eat, friend.” Afterwards a ceremony is performed forthe purpose of sending the dead bear, or rather his spirit, away back to his home. He isprovided with provisions for the journey in the shape of puddings or reindeer-flesh packedin a grass bag. His skin is stuffed with grass and carried round the house, after which he issupposed to depart towards the rising sun. The intention of the ceremonies is to protect thepeople from the wrath of the slain bear and his kinsfolk, and so to ensure success in futurebear-hunts. The Finns used to try to persuade a slain bear that he had not been killed bythem, but had fallen from a tree, or met his death in some other way; moreover, they held afuneral festival in his honour, at the close of which bards expatiated on the homage thathad been paid to him, urging him to report to the other bears the high consideration withwhich he had been treated, in order that they also, following his example, might come andbe slain. When the Lapps had succeeded in killing a bear with impunity, they thanked himfor not hurting them and for not breaking the clubs and spears which had given him hisdeath wounds; and they prayed that he would not visit his death upon them by sendingstorms or in any other way. His flesh then furnished a feast.The reverence of hunters for the bear whom they regularly kill and eat may thus be tracedall along the northern region of the Old World from Bering’s Straits to Lappland. Itreappears in similar forms in North America. With the American Indians a bear hunt wasan important event for which they prepared by long fasts and purgations. Before settingout they offered expiatory sacrifices to the souls of bears slain in previous hunts, andbesought them to be favourable to the hunters. When a bear was killed the hunter lit hispipe, and putting the mouth of it between the bear’s lips, blew into the bowl, filling thebeast’s mouth with smoke. Then he begged the bear not to be angry at having been killed,and not to thwart him afterwards in the chase. The carcase was roasted whole and eaten;not a morsel of the flesh might be left over. The head, painted red and blue, was hung on apost and addressed by orators, who heaped praise on the dead beast. When men of theBear clan in the Ottawa tribe killed a bear, they made him a feast of his own flesh, andaddressed him thus: “Cherish us no grudge because we have killed you. You have sense;you see that our children are hungry. They love you and wish to take you into their bodies.Is it not glorious to be eaten by the children of a chief?” Amongst the Nootka Indians ofBritish Columbia, when a bear had been killed, it was brought in and seated before thehead chief in an upright posture, with a chief’s bonnet, wrought in figures, on its head, andits fur powdered over with white down. A tray of provisions was then set before it, and itwas invited by words and gestures to eat. After that the animal was skinned, boiled, andeaten.A like respect is testified for other dangerous creatures by the hunters who regularly trapand kill them. When Caffre hunters are in the act of showering spears on an elephant, theycall out, “Don’t kill us, great captain; don’t strike or tread upon us, mighty chief.” Whenhe is dead they make their excuses to him, pretending that his death was a pure accident.As a mark of respect they bury his trunk with much solemn ceremony; for they say that"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"“the elephant is a great lord; his trunk is his hand.” Before the Amaxosa Caffres attack anelephant they shout to the animal and beg him to pardon them for the slaughter they areabout to perpetrate, professing great submission to his person and explaining clearly theneed they have of his tusks to enable them to procure beads and supply their wants. Whenthey have killed him they bury in the ground, along with the end of his trunk, a few of thearticles they have obtained for the ivory, thus hoping to avert some mishap that wouldotherwise befall them. Amongst some tribes of Eastern Africa, when a lion is killed, thecarcase is brought before the king, who does homage to it by prostrating himself on theground and rubbing his face on the muzzle of the beast. In some parts of Western Africa ifa negro kills a leopard he is bound fast and brought before the chiefs for having killed oneof their peers. The man defends himself on the plea that the leopard is chief of the forestand therefore a stranger. He is then set at liberty and rewarded. But the dead leopard,adorned with a chief’s bonnet, is set up in the village, where nightly dances are held in itshonour. The Baganda greatly fear the ghosts of buffaloes which they have killed, and theyalways appease these dangerous spirits. On no account will they bring the head of a slainbuffalo into a village or into a garden of plantains: they always eat the flesh of the head inthe open country. Afterwards they place the skull in a small hut built for the purpose,where they pour out beer as an offering and pray to the ghost to stay where he is and not toharm them.Another formidable beast whose life the savage hunter takes with joy, yet with fear andtrembling, is the whale. After the slaughter of a whale the maritime Koryak of North-eastern Siberia hold a communal festival, the essential part of which “is based on theconception that the whale killed has come on a visit to the village; that it is staying for sometime, during which it is treated with great respect; that it then returns to the sea to repeatits visit the following year; that it will induce its relatives to come along, telling them of thehospitable reception that has been accorded to it. According to the Koryak ideas, thewhales, like all other animals, constitute one tribe, or rather family, of related individuals,who live in villages like the Koryak. They avenge the murder of one of their number, andare grateful for kindnesses that they may have received.” When the inhabitants of the Isleof St. Mary, to the north of Madagascar, go a-whaling, they single out the young whales forattack and “humbly beg the mother’s pardon, stating the necessity that drives them to killher progeny, and requesting that she will be pleased to go below while the deed is doing,that her maternal feelings may not be outraged by witnessing what must cause her so muchuneasiness.” An Ajumba hunter having killed a female hippopotamus on Lake Azyingo inWest Africa, the animal was decapitated and its quarters and bowels removed. Then thehunter, naked, stepped into the hollow of the ribs, and kneeling down in the bloody poolwashed his whole body with the blood and excretions of the animal, while he prayed to thesoul of the hippopotamus not to bear him a grudge for having killed her and so blightedher hopes of future maternity; and he further entreated the ghost not to stir up otherhippopotamuses to avenge her death by butting at and capsizing his canoe.The ounce, a leopard-like creature, is dreaded for its depredations by the Indians of Brazil.When they have caught one of these animals in a snare, they kill it and carry the bodyhome to the village. There the women deck the carcase with feathers of many colours, putbracelets on its legs, and weep over it, saying, “I pray thee not to take vengeance on ourlittle ones for having been caught and killed through thine own ignorance. For it was not"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"we who deceived thee, it was thyself. Our husbands only set the trap to catch animals thatare good to eat; they never thought to take thee in it. Therefore, let not thy soul counsel thyfellows to avenge thy death on our little ones!” When a Blackfoot Indian has caught eaglesin a trap and killed them, he takes them home to a special lodge, called the eagles’ lodge,which has been prepared for their reception outside of the camp. Here he sets the birds in arow on the ground, and propping up their heads on a stick, puts a piece of dried meat ineach of their mouths in order that the spirits of the dead eagles may go and tell the othereagles how well they are being treated by the Indians. So when Indian hunters of theOrinoco region have killed an animal, they open its mouth and pour into it a few drops ofthe liquor they generally carry with them, in order that the soul of the dead beast mayinform its fellows of the welcome it has met with, and that they too, cheered by the prospectof the same kind reception, may come with alacrity to be killed. When a Teton Indian is ona journey, and he meets a grey spider or a spider with yellow legs, he kills it, because someevil would befall him if he did not. But he is very careful not to let the spider know that hekills it, for if the spider knew, his soul would go and tell the other spiders, and one of themwould be sure to avenge the death of his relation. So in crushing the insect, the Indian says,“O Grandfather Spider, the Thunder-beings kill you.” And the spider is crushed at onceand believes what is told him. His soul probably runs and tells the other spiders that theThunder-beings have killed him; but no harm comes of that. For what can grey or yellow-legged spiders do to the Thunder-beings?But it is not merely dangerous creatures with whom the savage desires to keep on goodterms. It is true that the respect which he pays to wild beasts is in some measureproportioned to their strength and ferocity. Thus the savage Stiens of Cambodia, believingthat all animals have souls which roam about after their death, beg an animal’s pardonwhen they kill it, lest its soul should come and torment them. Also they offer it sacrifices,but these sacrifices are proportioned to the size and strength of the animal. The ceremonieswhich they observe at the death of an elephant are conducted with much pomp and lastseven days. Similar distinctions are drawn by North American Indians. “The bear, thebuffalo, and the beaver are manidos [divinities] which furnish food. The bear isformidable, and good to eat. They render ceremonies to him, begging him to allow himselfto be eaten, although they know he has no fancy for it. We kill you, but you are notannihilated. His head and paws are objects of homage... . Other animals are treatedsimilarly from similar reasons... . Many of the animal manidos, not being dangerous, areoften treated with contempt—the terrapin, the weasel, polecat, etc.” The distinction isinstructive. Animals which are feared, or are good to eat, or both, are treated withceremonious respect; those which are neither formidable nor good to eat are despised. Wehave had examples of reverence paid to animals which are both feared and eaten. Itremains to prove that similar respect is shown to animals which, without being feared, areeither eaten or valued for their skins.When Siberian sable-hunters have caught a sable, no one is allowed to see it, and they thinkthat if good or evil be spoken of the captured sable no more sables will be caught. A hunterhas been known to express his belief that the sables could hear what was said of them as faroff as Moscow. He said that the chief reason why the sable hunt was now so unproductivewas that some live sables had been sent to Moscow. There they had been viewed withastonishment as strange animals, and the sables cannot abide that. Another, though minor,"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"cause of the diminished take of sables was, he alleged, that the world is now much worsethan it used to be, so that nowadays a hunter will sometimes hide the sable which he has gotinstead of putting it into the common stock. This also, said he, the sables cannot abide.Alaskan hunters preserve the bones of sables and beavers out of reach of the dogs for ayear and then bury them carefully, “lest the spirits who look after the beavers and sablesshould consider that they are regarded with contempt, and hence no more should be killedor trapped.” The Canadian Indians were equally particular not to let their dogs gnaw thebones, or at least certain of the bones, of beavers. They took the greatest pains to collectand preserve these bones, and, when the beaver had been caught in a net, they threw theminto the river. To a Jesuit who argued that the beavers could not possibly know whatbecame of their bones, the Indians replied, “You know nothing about catching beavers andyet you will be prating about it. Before the beaver is stone dead, his soul takes a turn in thehut of the man who is killing him and makes a careful note of what is done with his bones.If the bones are given to the dogs, the other beavers would get word of it and would not letthemselves be caught. Whereas, if their bones are thrown into the fire or a river, they arequite satisfied; and it is particularly gratifying to the net which caught them.” Beforehunting the beaver they offered a solemn prayer to the Great Beaver, and presented himwith tobacco; and when the chase was over, an orator pronounced a funeral oration overthe dead beavers. He praised their spirit and wisdom. “You will hear no more,” said he,“the voice of the chieftains who commanded you and whom you chose from among all thewarrior beavers to give you laws. Your language, which the medicine-men understandperfectly, will be heard no more at the bottom of the lake. You will fight no more battleswith the otters, your cruel foes. No, beavers! But your skins shall serve to buy arms; we willcarry your smoked hams to our children; we will keep the dogs from eating your bones,which are so hard.”The elan, deer, and elk were treated by the American Indians with the same punctiliousrespect, and for the same reason. Their bones might not be given to the dogs nor throwninto the fire, nor might their fat be dropped upon the fire, because the souls of the deadanimals were believed to see what was done to their bodies and to tell it to the other beasts,living and dead. Hence, if their bodies were illused, the animals of that species would notallow themselves to be taken, neither in this world nor in the world to come. Among theChiquites of Paraguay a sick man would be asked by the medicine-man whether he had notthrown away some of the flesh of the deer or turtle, and if he answered yes, the medicine-man would say, “That is what is killing you. The soul of the deer or turtle has entered intoyour body to avenge the wrong you did it.” The Canadian Indians would not eat theembryos of the elk, unless at the close of the hunting season; otherwise the mother-elkswould be shy and refuse to be caught.In the Timor-laut islands of the Indian Archipelago the skulls of all the turtles which afisherman has caught are hung up under his house. Before he goes out to catch another, headdresses himself to the skull of the last turtle that he killed, and having inserted betelbetween its jaws, he prays the spirit of the dead animal to entice its kinsfolk in the sea tocome and be caught. In the Poso district of Central Celebes hunters keep the jawbones ofdeer and wild pigs which they have killed and hang them up in their houses near the fire.Then they say to the jawbones, “Ye cry after your comrades, that your grandfathers, ornephews, or children may not go away.” Their notion is that the souls of the dead deer and"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"pigs tarry near their jawbones and attract the souls of living deer and pigs, which are thusdrawn into the toils of the hunter. Thus the wily savage employs dead animals as decoys tolure living animals to their doom.The Lengua Indians of the Gran Chaco love to hunt the ostrich, but when they have killedone of these birds and are bringing home the carcase to the village, they take steps to outwitthe resentful ghost of their victim. They think that when the first natural shock of death ispassed, the ghost of the ostrich pulls himself together and makes after his body. Acting onthis sage calculation, the Indians pluck feathers from the breast of the bird and strew themat intervals along the track. At every bunch of feathers the ghost stops to consider, “Is thisthe whole of my body or only a part of it?” The doubt gives him pause, and when at last hehas made up his mind fully at all the bunches, and has further wasted valuable time by thezigzag course which he invariably pursues in going from one to another, the hunters aresafe at home, and the bilked ghost may stalk in vain round about the village, which he istoo timid to enter.The Esquimaux about Bering Strait believe that the souls of dead sea-beasts, such as seals,walrus, and whales, remain attached to their bladders, and that by returning the bladdersto the sea they can cause the souls to be reincarnated in fresh bodies and so multiply thegame which the hunters pursue and kill. Acting on this belief every hunter carefullyremoves and preserves the bladders of all the sea-beasts that he kills; and at a solemnfestival held once a year in winter these bladders, containing the souls of all the sea-beaststhat have been killed throughout the year, are honoured with dances and offerings of foodin the public assembly-room, after which they are taken out on the ice and thrust throughholes into the water; for the simple Esquimaux imagine that the souls of the animals, inhigh good humour at the kind treatment they have experienced, will thereafter be bornagain as seals, walrus, and whales, and in that form will flock willingly to be again speared,harpooned, or otherwise done to death by the hunters.For like reasons, a tribe which depends for its subsistence, chiefly or in part, upon fishing iscareful to treat the fish with every mark of honour and respect. The Indians of Peru“adored the fish that they caught in greatest abundance; for they said that the first fish thatwas made in the world above (for so they named Heaven) gave birth to all other fish of thatspecies, and took care to send them plenty of its children to sustain their tribe. For thisreason they worshipped sardines in one region, where they killed more of them than of anyother fish; in others, the skate; in others, the dogfish; in others, the golden fish for itsbeauty; in others, the crawfish; in others, for want of larger gods, the crabs, where theyhad no other fish, or where they knew not how to catch and kill them. In short, they hadwhatever fish was most serviceable to them as their gods.” The Kwakiutl Indians of BritishColumbia think that when a salmon is killed its soul returns to the salmon country. Hencethey take care to throw the bones and offal into the sea, in order that the soul mayreanimate them at the resurrection of the salmon. Whereas if they burned the bones thesoul would be lost, and so it would be quite impossible for that salmon to rise from thedead. In like manner the Ottawa Indians of Canada, believing that the souls of dead fishpassed into other bodies of fish, never burned fish bones, for fear of displeasing the souls ofthe fish, who would come no more to the nets. The Hurons also refrained from throwingfish bones into the fire, lest the souls of the fish should go and warn the other fish not to let"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"themselves be caught, since the Hurons would burn their bones. Moreover, they had menwho preached to the fish and persuaded them to come and be caught. A good preacher wasmuch sought after, for they thought that the exhortations of a clever man had a great effectin drawing the fish to the nets. In the Huron fishing village where the French missionarySagard stayed, the preacher to the fish prided himself very much on his eloquence, whichwas of a florid order. Every evening after supper, having seen that all the people were intheir places and that a strict silence was observed, he preached to the fish. His text was thatthe Hurons did not burn fish bones. “Then enlarging on this theme with extraordinaryunction, he exhorted and conjured and invited and implored the fish to come and be caughtand to be of good courage and to fear nothing, for it was all to serve their friends whohonoured them and did not burn their bones.” The natives of the Duke of York Islandannually decorate a canoe with flowers and ferns, lade it, or are supposed to lade it, withshell-money, and set it adrift to compensate the fish for their fellows who have been caughtand eaten. It is especially necessary to treat the first fish caught with consideration in orderto conciliate the rest of the fish, whose conduct may be supposed to be influenced by thereception given to those of their kind which were the first to be taken. Accordingly theMaoris always put back into the sea the first fish caught, “with a prayer that it may temptother fish to come and be caught.”Still more stringent are the precautions taken when the fish are the first of the season. Onsalmon rivers, when the fish begin to run up the stream in spring, they are received withmuch deference by tribes who, like the Indians of the Pacific Coast of North America,subsist largely upon a fish diet. In British Columbia the Indians used to go out to meet thefirst fish as they came up the river: “They paid court to them, and would address themthus: ‘You fish, you fish; you are all chiefs, you are; you are all chiefs.’” Amongst theTlingit of Alaska the first halibut of the season is carefully handled and addressed as achief, and a festival is given in his honour, after which the fishing goes on. In spring, whenthe winds blow soft from the south and the salmon begin to run up the Klamath river, theKaroks of California dance for salmon, to ensure a good catch. One of the Indians, calledthe Kareya or God-man, retires to the mountains and fasts for ten days. On his return thepeople flee, while he goes to the river, takes the first salmon of the catch, eats some of it,and with the rest kindles the sacred fire in the sweating house. “No Indian may take asalmon before this dance is held, nor for ten days after it, even if his family are starving.”The Karoks also believe that a fisherman will take no salmon if the poles of which hisspearing-booth is made were gathered on the river-side, where the salmon might have seenthem. The poles must be brought from the top of the highest mountain. The fisherman willalso labour in vain if he uses the same poles a second year in booths or weirs, “because theold salmon will have told the young ones about them. There is a favourite fish of the Ainowhich appears in their rivers about May and June. They prepare for the fishing byobserving rules of ceremonial purity, and when they have gone out to fish, the women athome must keep strict silence or the fish would hear them and disappear. When the firstfish is caught he is brought home and passed through a small opening at the end of the hut,but not through the door; for if he were passed through the door, “the other fish wouldcertainly see him and disappear.” This may partly explain the custom observed by othersavages of bringing game in certain cases into their huts, not by the door, but by thewindow, the smoke-hole, or by a special opening at the back of the hut."},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"With some savages a special reason for respecting the bones of game, and generally of theanimals which they eat, is a belief that, if the bones are preserved, they will in course oftime be reclothed with flesh, and thus the animal will come to life again. It is, therefore,clearly for the interest of the hunter to leave the bones intact since to destroy them wouldbe to diminish the future supply of game. Many of the Minnetaree Indians “believe that thebones of those bisons which they have slain and divested of flesh rise again clothed withrenewed flesh, and quickened with life, and become fat, and fit for slaughter the succeedingJune.” Hence on the western prairies of America, the skulls of buffaloes may be seenarranged in circles and symmetrical piles, awaiting the resurrection. After feasting on adog, the Dacotas carefully collect the bones, scrape, wash, and bury them, “partly, as it issaid, to testify to the dog-species, that in feasting upon one of their number no disrespectwas meant to the species itself, and partly also from a belief that the bones of the animalwill rise and reproduce another.” In sacrificing an animal the Lapps regularly put aside thebones, eyes, ears, heart, lungs, sexual parts (if the animal was a male), and a morsel of fleshfrom each limb. Then, after eating the remainder of the flesh, they laid the bones and therest in anatomical order in a coffin and buried them with the usual rites, believing that thegod to whom the animal was sacrificed would reclothe the bones with flesh and restore theanimal to life in Jabme-Aimo, the subterranean world of the dead. Sometimes, as afterfeasting on a bear, they seem to have contented themselves with thus burying the bones.Thus the Lapps expected the resurrection of the slain animal to take place in anotherworld, resembling in this respect the Kamtchatkans, who believed that every creature,down to the smallest fly, would rise from the dead and live underground. On the otherhand, the North American Indians looked for the resurrection of the animals in the presentworld. The habit, observed especially by Mongolian peoples, of stuffing the skin of asacrificed animal, or stretching it on a framework, points rather to a belief in aresurrection of the latter sort. The objection commonly entertained by primitive peoples tobreak the bones of the animals which they have eaten or sacrificed may be based either ona belief in the resurrection of the animals, or on a fear of intimidating other creatures ofthe same species and offending the ghosts of the slain animals. The reluctance of NorthAmerican Indians and Esquimaux to let dogs gnaw the bones of animals is perhaps only aprecaution to prevent the bones from being broken.But after all the resurrection of dead game may have its inconveniences, and accordinglysome hunters take steps to prevent it by hamstringing the animal so as to prevent it or itsghost from getting up and running away. This is the motive alleged for the practice by Kouihunters in Laos; they think that the spells which they utter in the chase may lose theirmagical virtue, and that the slaughtered animal may consequently come to life again andescape. To prevent that catastrophe they therefore hamstring the beast as soon as they havebutchered it. When an Esquimau of Alaska has killed a fox, he carefully cuts the tendons ofall the animal’s legs in order to prevent the ghost from reanimating the body and walkingabout. But hamstringing the carcase is not the only measure which the prudent savageadopts for the sake of disabling the ghost of his victim. In old days, when the Aino went outhunting and killed a fox first, they took care to tie its mouth up tightly in order to preventthe ghost of the animal from sallying forth and warning its fellows against the approach ofthe hunter. The Gilyaks of the Amoor River put out the eyes of the seals they have killed,lest the ghosts of the slain animals should know their slayers and avenge their death byspoiling the seal-hunt."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"Besides the animals which primitive man dreads for their strength and ferocity, and thosewhich he reveres on account of the benefits which he expects from them, there is anotherclass of creatures which he sometimes deems it necessary to conciliate by worship andsacrifice. These are the vermin that infest his crops and his cattle. To rid himself of thesedeadly foes the farmer has recourse to many superstitious devices, of which, though someare meant to destroy or intimidate the vermin, others aim at propitiating them andpersuading them by fair means to spare the fruits of the earth and the herds. ThusEsthonian peasants, in the island of Oesel, stand in great awe of the weevil, an insect whichis exceedingly destructive to the grain. They give it a fine name, and if a child is about tokill a weevil they say, “Don’t do it; the more we hurt him, the more he hurts us.” If theyfind a weevil they bury it in the earth instead of killing it. Some even put the weevil under astone in the field and offer corn to it. They think that thus it is appeased and does lessharm. Amongst the Saxons of Transylvania, in order to keep sparrows from the corn, thesower begins by throwing the first handful of seed backwards over his head, saying, “Thatis for you, sparrows.” To guard the corn against the attacks of leaf-flies he shuts his eyesand scatters three handfuls of oats in different directions. Having made this offering to theleaf-flies he feels sure that they will spare the corn. A Transylvanian way of securing thecrops against all birds, beasts, and insects, is this: after he has finished sowing, the sowergoes once more from end to end of the field imitating the gesture of sowing, but with anempty hand. As he does so he says, “I sow this for the animals; I sow it for every thing thatflies and creeps, that walks and stands, that sings and springs, in the name of God theFather, etc.” The following is a German way of freeing a garden from caterpillars. Aftersunset or at midnight the mistress of the house, or another female member of the family,walks all round the garden dragging a broom after her. She may not look behind her, andmust keep murmuring, “Good evening, Mother Caterpillar, you shall come with yourhusband to church.” The garden gate is left open till the following morning.Sometimes in dealing with vermin the farmer aims at hitting a happy mean betweenexcessive rigour on the one hand and weak indulgence on the other; kind but firm, hetempers severity with mercy. An ancient Greek treatise on farming advises thehusbandman who would rid his lands of mice to act thus: “Take a sheet of paper and writeon it as follows: ‘I adjure you, ye mice here present, that ye neither injure me nor sufferanother mouse to do so. I give you yonder field’ (here you specify the field); ‘but if ever Icatch you here again, by the Mother of the Gods I will rend you in seven pieces.’ Write this,and stick the paper on an unhewn stone in the field before sunrise, taking care to keep thewritten side up.” In the Ardennes they say that to get rid of rats you should repeat thefollowing words: “Erat verbum, apud Deum vestrum. Male rats and female rats, I conjureyou, by the great God, to go out of my house, out of all my habitations, and to betakeyourselves to such and such a place, there to end your days. Decretis, reversis etdesembarassis virgo potens, clemens, justitiae.” Then write the same words on pieces ofpaper, fold them up, and place one of them under the door by which the rats are to goforth, and the other on the road which they are to take. This exorcism should be performedat sunrise. Some years ago an American farmer was reported to have written a civil letterto the rats, telling them that his crops were short, that he could not afford to keep themthrough the winter, that he had been very kind to them, and that for their own good hethought they had better leave him and go to some of his neighbours who had more grain.This document he pinned to a post in his barn for the rats to read."},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"Sometimes the desired object is supposed to be attained by treating with high distinctionone or two chosen individuals of the obnoxious species, while the rest are pursued withrelentless rigour. In the East Indian island of Bali, the mice which ravage the rice-fields arecaught in great numbers, and burned in the same way that corpses are burned. But two ofthe captured mice are allowed to live, and receive a little packet of white linen. Then thepeople bow down before them, as before gods, and let them go. When the farms of the SeaDyaks or Ibans of Sarawak are much pestered by birds and insects, they catch a specimenof each kind of vermin (one sparrow, one grasshopper, and so on), put them in a tiny boatof bark well-stocked with provisions, and then allow the little vessel with its obnoxiouspassengers to float down the river. If that does not drive the pests away, the Dyaks resort towhat they deem a more effectual mode of accomplishing the same purpose. They make aclay crocodile as large as life and set it up in the fields, where they offer it food, rice-spirit,and cloth, and sacrifice a fowl and a pig before it. Mollified by these attentions, theferocious animal very soon gobbles up all the creatures that devour the crops. In Albania, ifthe fields or vineyards are ravaged by locusts or beetles, some of the women will assemblewith dishevelled hair, catch a few of the insects, and march with them in a funeralprocession to a spring or stream, in which they drown the creatures. Then one of thewomen sings, “O locusts and beetles who have left us bereaved,” and the dirge is taken upand repeated by all the women in chorus. Thus by celebrating the obsequies of a few locustsand beetles, they hope to bring about the death of them all. When caterpillars invaded avineyard or field in Syria, the virgins were gathered, and one of the caterpillars was takenand a girl made its mother. Then they bewailed and buried it. Thereafter they conductedthe “mother” to the place where the caterpillars were, consoling her, in order that all thecaterpillars might leave the garden.LIV. Types of Animal Sacrament1. The Egyptian and the Aino Types of SacramentWE are now perhaps in a position to understand the ambiguous behaviour of the Aino andGilyaks towards the bear. It has been shown that the sharp line of demarcation which wedraw between mankind and the lower animals does not exist for the savage. To him manyof the other animals appear as his equals or even his superiors, not merely in brute forcebut in intelligence; and if choice or necessity leads him to take their lives, he feels bound,out of regard to his own safety, to do it in a way which will be as inoffensive as possible notmerely to the living animal, but to its departed spirit and to all the other animals of thesame species, which would resent an affront put upon one of their kind much as a tribe ofsavages would revenge an injury or insult offered to a tribesman. We have seen that amongthe many devices by which the savage seeks to atone for the wrong done by him to hisanimal victims one is to show marked deference to a few chosen individuals of the species,for such behaviour is apparently regarded as entitling him to exterminate with impunity allthe rest of the species upon which he can lay hands. This principle perhaps explains theattitude, at first sight puzzling and contradictory, of the Aino towards the bear. The fleshand skin of the bear regularly afford them food and clothing; but since the bear is an"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"intelligent and powerful animal, it is necessary to offer some satisfaction or atonement tothe bear species for the loss which it sustains in the death of so many of its members. Thissatisfaction or atonement is made by rearing young bears, treating them, so long as theylive, with respect, and killing them with extraordinary marks of sorrow and devotion. Sothe other bears are appeased, and do not resent the slaughter of their kind by attacking theslayers or deserting the country, which would deprive the Aino of one of their means ofsubsistence.Thus the primitive worship of animals conforms to two types, which are in some respectsthe converse of each other. On the one hand, animals are worshipped, and are thereforeneither killed nor eaten. On the other hand, animals are worshipped because they arehabitually killed and eaten. In both types of worship the animal is revered on account ofsome benefit, positive or negative, which the savage hopes to receive from it. In the formerworship the benefit comes either in the positive shape of protection, advice, and help whichthe animal affords the man, or in the negative shape of abstinence from injuries which it isin the power of the animal to inflict. In the latter worship the benefit takes the materialform of the animal’s flesh and skin. The two types of worship are in some measureantithetical: in the one, the animal is not eaten because it is revered; in the other, it isrevered because it is eaten. But both may be practised by the same people, as we see in thecase of the North American Indians, who, while they apparently revere and spare theirtotem animals, also revere the animals and fish upon which they subsist. The aborigines ofAustralia have totemism in the most primitive form known to us; but there is no clearevidence that they attempt, like the North American Indians, to conciliate the animalswhich they kill and eat. The means which the Australians adopt to secure a plentiful supplyof game appear to be primarily based, not on conciliation, but on sympathetic magic, aprinciple to which the North American Indians also resort for the same purpose. Hence, asthe Australians undoubtedly represent a ruder and earlier stage of human progress thanthe American Indians, it would seem that before hunters think of worshipping the game asa means of ensuring an abundant supply of it, they seek to attain the same end bysympathetic magic. This, again, would show—what there is good reason for believing—thatsympathetic magic is one of the earliest means by which man endeavours to adapt theagencies of nature to his needs.Corresponding to the two distinct types of animal worship, there are two distinct types ofthe custom of killing the animal god. On the one hand, when the revered animal ishabitually spared, it is nevertheless killed—and sometimes eaten—on rare and solemnoccasions. Examples of this custom have been already given and an explanation of themoffered. On the other hand, when the revered animal is habitually killed, the slaughter ofany one of the species involves the killing of the god, and is atoned for on the spot byapologies and sacrifices, especially when the animal is a powerful and dangerous one; and,in addition to this ordinary and everyday atonement, there is a special annual atonement,at which a select individual of the species is slain with extraordinary marks of respect anddevotion. Clearly the two types of sacramental killing—the Egyptian and the Aino types, aswe may call them for distinction—are liable to be confounded by an observer; and, beforewe can say to which type any particular example belongs, it is necessary to ascertainwhether the animal sacramentally slain belongs to a species which is habitually spared, orto one which is habitually killed by the tribe. In the former case the example belongs to the"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"Egyptian type of sacrament, in the latter to the Aino type.The practice of pastoral tribes appears to furnish examples of both types of sacrament.“Pastoral tribes,” says Adolf Bastian, “being sometimes obliged to sell their herds tostrangers who may handle the bones disrespectfully, seek to avert the danger which such asacrilege would entail by consecrating one of the herd as an object of worship, eating itsacramentally in the family circle with closed doors, and afterwards treating the bones withall the ceremonious respect which, strictly speaking, should be accorded to every head ofcattle, but which, being punctually paid to the representative animal, is deemed to be paidto all. Such family meals are found among various peoples, especially those of theCaucasus. When amongst the Abchases the shepherds in spring eat their common mealwith their loins girt and their staves in their hands, this may be looked upon both as asacrament and as an oath of mutual help and support. For the strongest of all oaths is thatwhich is accompanied with the eating of a sacred substance, since the perjured personcannot possibly escape the avenging god whom he has taken into his body and assimilated.”This kind of sacrament is of the Aino or expiatory type, since it is meant to atone to thespecies for the possible ill-usage of individuals. An expiation, similar in principle butdifferent in details, is offered by the Kalmucks to the sheep, whose flesh is one of theirstaple foods. Rich Kalmucks are in the habit of consecrating a white ram under the title of“the ram of heaven” or “the ram of the spirit.” The animal is never shorn and never sold;but when it grows old and its owner wishes to consecrate a new one, the old ram must bekilled and eaten at a feast to which the neighbours are invited. On a lucky day, generally inautumn when the sheep are fat, a sorcerer kills the old ram, after sprinkling it with milk.Its flesh is eaten; the skeleton, with a portion of the fat, is burned on a turf altar; and theskin, with the head and feet, is hung up.An example of a sacrament of the Egyptian type is furnished by the Todas, a pastoralpeople of Southern India, who subsist largely upon the milk of their buffaloes. Amongstthem “the buffalo is to a certain degree held sacred” and “is treated with great kindness,even with a degree of adoration, by the people.” They never eat the flesh of the cow buffalo,and as a rule abstain from the flesh of the male. But to the latter rule there is a singleexception. Once a year all the adult males of the village join in the ceremony of killing andeating a very young male calf—seemingly under a month old. They take the animal into thedark recesses of the village wood, where it is killed with a club made from the sacred tree ofthe Todas (the Millingtonia). A sacred fire having been made by the rubbing of sticks, theflesh of the calf is roasted on the embers of certain trees, and is eaten by the men alone,women being excluded from the assembly. This is the only occasion on which the Todas eatbuffalo flesh. The Madi or Moru tribe of Central Africa, whose chief wealth is their cattle,though they also practise agriculture, appear to kill a lamb sacramentally on certainsolemn occasions. The custom is thus described by Dr. Felkin: “A remarkable custom isobserved at stated times—once a year, I am led to believe. I have not been able to ascertainwhat exact meaning is attached to it. It appears, however, to relieve the people’s minds, forbeforehand they evince much sadness, and seem very joyful when the ceremony is dulyaccomplished. The following is what takes place: A large concourse of people of all agesassemble, and sit down round a circle of stones, which is erected by the side of a road(really a narrow path). A very choice lamb is then fetched by a boy, who leads it four timesround the assembled people. As it passes they pluck off little bits of its fleece and place"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"them in their hair, or on to some other part of their body. The lamb is then led up to thestones, and there killed by a man belonging to a kind of priestly order, who takes some ofthe blood and sprinkles it four times over the people. He then applies it individually. On thechildren he makes a small ring of blood over the lower end of the breast bone, on womenand girls he makes a mark above the breasts, and the men he touches on each shoulder. Hethen proceeds to explain the ceremony, and to exhort the people to show kindness... . Whenthis discourse, which is at times of great length, is over, the people rise, each places a leaf onor by the circle of stones, and then they depart with signs of great joy. The lamb’s skull ishung on a tree near the stones, and its flesh is eaten by the poor. This ceremony is observedon a small scale at other times. If a family is in any great trouble, through illness orbereavement, their friends and neighbours come together and a lamb is killed; this isthought to avert further evil. The same custom prevails at the grave of departed friends,and also on joyful occasions, such as the return of a son home after a very prolongedabsence.” The sorrow thus manifested by the people at the annual slaughter of the lambseems to show that the lamb slain is a sacred or divine animal, whose death is mourned byhis worshippers, just as the death of the sacred buzzard was mourned by the Californiansand the death of the Theban ram by the Egyptians. The smearing each of the worshipperswith the blood of the lamb is a form of communion with the divinity; the vehicle of thedivine life is applied externally instead of being taken internally, as when the blood isdrunk or the flesh eaten.2. Processions with Sacred AnimalsTHE FORM of communion in which the sacred animal is taken from house to house, thatall may enjoy a share of its divine influence, has been exemplified by the Gilyak custom ofpromenading the bear through the village before it is slain. A similar form of communionwith the sacred snake is observed by a Snake tribe in the Punjaub. Once a year in themonth of September the snake is worshipped by all castes and religions for nine days only.At the end of August the Mirasans, especially those of the Snake tribe, make a snake ofdough which they paint black and red, and place on a winnowing basket. This basket theycarry round the village, and on entering any house they say: “God be with you all! Mayevery ill be far! May our patron’s (Gugga’s) word thrive!” Then they present the basketwith the snake, saying: “A small cake of flour: a little bit of butter: if you obey the snake,you and yours shall thrive!” Strictly speaking, a cake and butter should be given, but it isseldom done. Every one, however, gives something, generally a handful of dough or somecorn. In houses where there is a new bride or whence a bride has gone, or where a son hasbeen born, it is usual to give a rupee and a quarter, or some cloth. Sometimes the bearers ofthe snake also sing:“Give the snake a piece of cloth, and he will send a lively bride!”When every house has been thus visited, the dough snake is buried and a small grave is"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"erected over it. Thither during the nine days of September the women come to worship.They bring a basin of curds, a small portion of which they offer at the snake’s grave,kneeling on the ground and touching the earth with their foreheads. Then they go homeand divide the rest of the curds among the children. Here the dough snake is clearly asubstitute for a real snake. Indeed, in districts where snakes abound the worship is offered,not at the grave of the dough snake, but in the jungles where snakes are known to be.Besides this yearly worship, performed by all the people, the members of the Snake tribeworship in the same way every morning after a new moon. The Snake tribe is notuncommon in the Punjaub. Members of it will not kill a snake, and they say that its bitedoes not hurt them. If they find a dead snake, they put clothes on it and give it a regularfuneral.Ceremonies closely analogous to this Indian worship of the snake have survived in Europeinto recent times, and doubtless date from a very primitive paganism. The best-knownexample is the “hunting of the wren.” By many European peoples—the ancient Greeks andRomans, the modern Italians, Spaniards, French, Germans, Dutch, Danes, Swedes,English, and Welsh—the wren has been designated the king, the little king, the king ofbirds, the hedge king, and so forth, and has been reckoned amongst those birds which it isextremely unlucky to kill. In England it is supposed that if any one kills a wren or harriesits nest, he will infallibly break a bone or meet with some dreadful misfortune within theyear; sometimes it is thought that the cows will give bloody milk. In Scotland the wren iscalled “the Lady of Heaven’s hen,” and boys say:“Malisons, malisons, mair than ten,That harry the Ladye of Heaven’s hen!”At Saint Donan, in Brittany, people believe that if children touch the young wrens in thenest, they will suffer from the fire of St. Lawrence, that is, from pimples on the face, legs,and so on. In other parts of France it is thought that if a person kills a wren or harries itsnest, his house will be struck by lightning, or that the fingers with which he did the deedwill shrivel up and drop off, or at least be maimed, or that his cattle will suffer in their feet.Notwithstanding such beliefs, the custom of annually killing the wren has prevailed widelyboth in this country and in France. In the Isle of Man down to the eighteenth century thecustom was observed on Christmas Eve, or rather Christmas morning. On the twenty-fourth of December, towards evening, all the servants got a holiday; they did not go to bedall night, but rambled about till the bells rang in all the churches at midnight. Whenprayers were over, they went to hunt the wren, and having found one of these birds theykilled it and fastened it to the top of a long pole with its wings extended. Thus they carriedit in procession to every house chanting the following rhyme:“We hunted the wren for Robin the Bobbin,We hunted the wren for Jack of the Can,"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"We hunted the wren for Robin the Bobbin,We hunted the wren for every one.”When they had gone from house to house and collected all the money they could, they laidthe wren on a bier and carried it in procession to the parish churchyard, where they madea grave and buried it “with the utmost solemnity, singing dirges over her in the Mankslanguage, which they call her knell; after which Christmas begins.” The burial over, thecompany outside the churchyard formed a circle and danced to music.A writer of the eighteenth century says that in Ireland the wren “is still hunted and killedby the peasants on Christmas Day, and on the following (St. Stephen’s Day) he is carriedabout, hung by the leg, in the centre of two hoops, crossing each other at right angles, and aprocession made in every village, of men, women, and children, singing an Irish catch,importing him to be the king of all birds.” Down to the present time the “hunting of thewren” still takes place in parts of Leinster and Connaught. On Christmas Day or St.Stephen’s Day the boys hunt and kill the wren, fasten it in the middle of a mass of holly andivy on the top of a broomstick, and on St. Stephen’s Day go about with it from house tohouse, singing:“The wren, the wren, the king of all birds,St. Stephen’s Day was caught in the furze;Although he is little, his family’s great,I pray you, good landlady, give us a treat.”Money or food (bread, butter, eggs, etc.) were given them, upon which they feasted in theevening.In the first half of the nineteenth century similar customs were still observed in variousparts of the south of France. Thus at Carcassone, every year on the first Sunday ofDecember the young people of the street Saint Jean used to go out of the town armed withsticks, with which they beat the bushes, looking for wrens. The first to strike down one ofthese birds was proclaimed King. Then they returned to the town in procession, headed bythe King, who carried the wren on a pole. On the evening of the last day of the year theKing and all who had hunted the wren marched through the streets of the town to the lightof torches, with drums beating and fifes playing in front of them. At the door of everyhouse they stopped, and one of them wrote with chalk on the door vive le roi! with thenumber of the year which was about to begin. On the morning of Twelfth Day the Kingagain marched in procession with great pomp, wearing a crown and a blue mantle andcarrying a sceptre. In front of him was borne the wren fastened to the top of a pole, whichwas adorned with a verdant wreath of olive, of oak, and sometimes of mistletoe grown onan oak. After hearing high mass in the parish church of St. Vincent, surrounded by hisofficers and guards, the King visited the bishop, the mayor, the magistrates, and the chief"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"inhabitants, collecting money to defray the expenses of the royal banquet which took placein the evening and wound up with a dance.The parallelism between this custom of “hunting the wren” and some of those which wehave considered, especially the Gilyak procession with the bear, and the Indian one withthe snake, seems too close to allow us to doubt that they all belong to the same circle ofideas. The worshipful animal is killed with special solemnity once a year; and before orimmediately after death he is promenaded from door to door, that each of his worshippersmay receive a portion of the divine virtues that are supposed to emanate from the dead ordying god. Religious processions of this sort must have had a great place in the ritual ofEuropean peoples in prehistoric times, if we may judge from the numerous traces of themwhich have survived in folk-custom. For example, on the last day of the year, or Hogmanayas it was called, it used to be customary in the Highlands of Scotland for a man to dresshimself up in a cow’s hide and thus attired to go from house to house, attended by youngfellows, each of them armed with a staff, to which a bit of raw hide was tied. Round everyhouse the hide-clad man used to run thrice deiseal, that is, according to the course of thesun, so as to keep the house on his right hand; while the others pursued him, beating thehide with their staves and thereby making a loud noise like the beating of a drum. In thisdisorderly procession they also struck the walls of the house. On being admitted, one of theparty, standing within the threshold, pronounced a blessing on the family in these words:“May God bless the house and all that belongs to it, cattle, stones, and timber! In plenty ofmeat, of bed and body clothes, and health of men may it ever abound!” Then each of theparty singed in the fire a little bit of the hide which was tied to his staff; and having done sohe applied the singed hide to the nose of every person and of every domestic animalbelonging to the house. This was imagined to secure them from diseases and othermisfortunes, particularly from witchcraft, throughout the ensuing year. The wholeceremony was called calluinn because of the great noise made in beating the hide. It wasobserved in the Hebrides, including St. Kilda, down to the second half of the eighteenthcentury at least, and it seems to have survived well into the nineteenth century.LV. The Transference of Evil1. The Transference to Inanimate ObjectsWE have now traced the practice of killing a god among peoples in the hunting, pastoral,and agricultural stages of society; and I have attempted to explain the motives which ledmen to adopt so curious a custom. One aspect of the custom still remains to be noticed. Theaccumulated misfortunes and sins of the whole people are sometimes laid upon the dyinggod, who is supposed to bear them away for ever, leaving the people innocent and happy.The notion that we can transfer our guilt and sufferings to some other being who will bearthem for us is familiar to the savage mind. It arises from a very obvious confusion betweenthe physical and the mental, between the material and the immaterial. Because it is possibleto shift a load of wood, stones, or what not, from our own back to the back of another, thesavage fancies that it is equally possible to shift the burden of his pains and sorrows to"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"another, who will suffer them in his stead. Upon this idea he acts, and the result is anendless number of very unamiable devices for palming off upon some one else the troublewhich a man shrinks from bearing himself. In short, the principle of vicarious suffering iscommonly understood and practised by races who stand on a low level of social andintellectual culture. In the following pages I shall illustrate the theory and the practice asthey are found among savages in all their naked simplicity, undisguised by the refinementsof metaphysics and the subtleties of theology.The devices to which the cunning and selfish savage resorts for the sake of easing himself atthe expense of his neighbour are manifold; only a few typical examples out of a multitudecan be cited. At the outset it is to be observed that the evil of which a man seeks to ridhimself need not be transferred to a person; it may equally well be transferred to an animalor a thing, though in the last case the thing is often only a vehicle to convey the trouble tothe first person who touches it. In some of the East Indian islands they think that epilepsycan be cured by striking the patient on the face with the leaves of certain trees and thenthrowing them away. The disease is believed to have passed into the leaves, and to havebeen thrown away with them. To cure toothache some of the Australian blacks apply aheated spear-thrower to the cheek. The spear-thrower is then cast away, and the toothachegoes with it in the shape of a black stone called karriitch. Stones of this kind are found inold mounds and sandhills. They are carefully collected and thrown in the direction ofenemies in order to give them toothache. The Bahima, a pastoral people of Uganda, oftensuffer from deep-seated abscesses: “their cure for this is to transfer the disease to someother person by obtaining herbs from the medicine-man, rubbing them over the placewhere the swelling is, and burying them in the road where people continually pass; the firstperson who steps over these buried herbs contracts the disease, and the original patientrecovers.”Sometimes in case of sickness the malady is transferred to an effigy as a preliminary topassing it on to a human being. Thus among the Baganda the medicine-man wouldsometimes make a model of his patient in clay; then a relative of the sick man would rubthe image over the sufferer’s body and either bury it in the road \\??\\ it in the grass by thewayside. The first person who stepped over the image or passed by it would catch thedisease. Sometimes the effigy was made out of a plantain-flower tied up so as to look like aperson; it was used in the same way as the clay figure. But the use of images for thismaleficent purpose was a capital crime; any person caught in the act of burying one ofthem in the public road would surely have been put to death.In the western district of the island of Timor, when men or women are making long andtiring journeys, they fan themselves with leafy branches, which they afterwards throwaway on particular spots where their forefathers did the same before them. The fatiguewhich they felt is thus supposed to have passed into the leaves and to be left behind. Othersuse stones instead of leaves. Similarly in the Babar Archipelago tired people will strikethemselves with stones, believing that they thus transfer to the stones the weariness whichthey felt in their own bodies. They then throw away the stones in places which are speciallyset apart for the purpose. A like belief and practice in many distant parts of the world havegiven rise to those cairns or heaps of sticks and leaves which travellers often observe besidethe path, and to which every passing native adds his contribution in the shape of a stone, or"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"stick, or leaf. Thus in the Solomon and Banks’ Islands the natives are wont to throw sticks,stones, or leaves upon a heap at a place of steep descent, or where a difficult path begins,saying, “There goes my fatigue.” The act is not a religious rite, for the thing thrown on theheap is not an offering to spiritual powers, and the words which accompany the act are nota prayer. It is nothing but a magical ceremony for getting rid of fatigue, which the simplesavage fancies he can embody in a stick, leaf, or stone, and so cast it from him.2. The Transference to AnimalsANIMALS are often employed as a vehicle for carrying away or transferring the evil.When a Moor has a headache he will sometimes take a lamb or a goat and beat it till it fallsdown, believing that the headache will thus be transferred to the animal. In Morocco mostwealthy Moors keep a wild boar in their stables, in order that the jinn and evil spirits maybe diverted from the horses and enter into the boar. Amongst the Caffres of South Africa,when other remedies have failed, “natives sometimes adopt the custom of taking a goat intothe presence of a sick man, and confess the sins of the kraal over the animal. Sometimes afew drops of blood from the sick man are allowed to fall on the head of the goat, which isturned out into an uninhabited part of the veldt. The sickness is supposed to be transferredto the animal, and to become lost in the desert.” In Arabia, when the plague is raging, thepeople will sometimes lead a camel through all the quarters of the town in order that theanimal may take the pestilence on itself. Then they strangle it in a sacred place and imaginethat they have rid themselves of the camel and of the plague at one blow. It is said thatwhen smallpox is raging the savages of Formosa will drive the demon of disease into a sow,then cut off the animal’s ears and burn them or it, believing that in this way they ridthemselves of the plague.Amongst the Malagasy the vehicle for carrying away evils is called a faditra. “The faditra isanything selected by the sikidy [divining board] for the purpose of taking away any hurtfulevils or diseases that might prove injurious to an individual’s happiness, peace, orprosperity. The faditra may be either ashes, cut money, a sheep, a pumpkin, or anythingelse the sikidy may choose to direct. After the particular article is appointed, the priestcounts upon it all the evils that may prove injurious to the person for whom it is made, andwhich he then charges the faditra to take away for ever. If the faditra be ashes, it is blown,to be carried away by the wind. If it be cut money, it is thrown to the bottom of deep water,or where it can never be found. If it be a sheep, it is carried away to a distance on theshoulders of a man, who runs with all his might, mumbling as he goes, as if in the greatestrage against the faditra, for the evils it is bearing away. If it be a pumpkin, it is carried onthe shoulders to a little distance, and there dashed upon the ground with every appearanceof fury and indignation.” A Malagasy was informed by a diviner that he was doomed to abloody death, but that possibly he might avert his fate by performing a certain rite.Carrying a small vessel full of blood upon his head, he was to mount upon the back of abullock; while thus mounted, he was to spill the blood upon the bullock’s head, and thensend the animal away into the wilderness, whence it might never return.The Bataks of Sumatra have a ceremony which they call “making the curse to fly away.”When a woman is childless, a sacrifice is offered to the gods of three grasshoppers,"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"representing a head of cattle, a buffalo, and a horse. Then a swallow is set free, with aprayer that the curse may fall upon the bird and fly away with it. “The entrance into ahouse of an animal which does not generally seek to share the abode of man is regarded bythe Malays as ominous of misfortune. If a wild bird flies into a house, it must be carefullycaught and smeared with oil, and must then be released in the open air, a formula beingrecited in which it is bidden to fly away with all the ill-luck and misfortunes of theoccupier.” In antiquity Greek women seem to have done the same with swallows whichthey caught in the house: they poured oil on them and let them fly away, apparently for thepurpose of removing ill-luck from the household. The Huzuls of the Carpathians imaginethat they can transfer freckles to the first swallow they see in spring by washing their facein flowing water and saying, “Swallow, swallow, take my freckles, and give me rosycheeks.”Among the Badagas of the Neilgherry Hills in Southern India, when a death has takenplace, the sins of the deceased are laid upon a buffalo calf. For this purpose the peoplegather round the corpse and carry it outside of the village. There an elder of the tribe,standing at the head of the corpse, recites or chants a long list of sins such as any Badagamay commit, and the people repeat the last word of each line after him. The confession ofsins is thrice repeated. “By a conventional mode of expression, the sum total of sins a manmay do is said to be thirteen hundred. Admitting that the deceased has committed them all,the performer cries aloud, ‘Stay not their flight to God’s pure feet.’ As he closes, the wholeassembly chants aloud ‘Stay not their flight.’ Again the performer enters into details, andcries, ‘He killed the crawling snake. It is a sin.’ In a moment the last word is caught up, andall the people cry ‘It is a sin.’ As they shout, the performer lays his hand upon the calf. Thesin is transferred to the calf. Thus the whole catalogue is gone through in this impressiveway. But this is not enough. As the last shout ‘Let all be well’ dies away, the performergives place to another, and again confession is made, and all the people shout ‘It is a sin.’ Athird time it is done. Then, still in solemn silence, the calf is let loose. Like the Jewishscapegoat, it may never be used for secular work.” At a Badaga funeral witnessed by theRev. A. C. Clayton the buffalo calf was led thrice round the bier, and the dead man’s handwas laid on its head. “By this act, the calf was supposed to receive all the sins of thedeceased. It was then driven away to a great distance, that it might contaminate no one,and it was said that it would never be sold, but looked on as a dedicated sacred animal.”The idea of this ceremony is, that the sins of the deceased enter the calf, or that the task ofhis absolution is laid on it. They say that the calf very soon disappears, and that it is neverheard of.”3. The Transference to MenAGAIN, men sometimes play the part of scapegoat by diverting to themselves the evils thatthreaten others. When a Cingalese is dangerously ill, and the physicians can do nothing, adevil-dancer is called in, who by making offerings to the devils, and dancing in the masksappropriate to them, conjures these demons of disease, one after the other, out of the sickman’s body and into his own. Having thus successfully extracted the cause of the malady,the artful dancer lies down on a bier, and shamming death is carried to an open placeoutside the village. Here, being left to himself, he soon comes to life again, and hastens back"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"to claim his reward. In 1590 a Scotch which of the name of Agnes Sampson was convictedof curing a certain Robert Kers of a disease “laid upon him by a westland warlock when hewas at Dumfries, whilk sickness she took upon herself, and kept the same with greatgroaning and torment till the morn, at whilk time there was a great din heard in thehouse.” The noise was made by the witch in her efforts to shift the disease, by means ofclothes, from herself to a cat or dog. Unfortunately the attempt partly miscarried. Thedisease missed the animal and hit Alexander Douglas of Dalkeith, who dwined and died ofit, while the original patient, Robert Kers, was made whole.“In one part of New Zealand an expiation for sin was felt to be necessary; a service wasperformed over an individual, by which all the sins of the tribe were supposed to betransferred to him, a fern stalk was previously tied to his person, with which he jumpedinto the river, and there unbinding, allowed it to float away to the sea, bearing their sinswith it.” In great emergencies the sins of the Rajah of Manipur used to be transferred tosomebody else, usually to a criminal, who earned his pardon by his vicarious sufferings. Toeffect the transference the Rajah and his wife, clad in fine robes, bathed on a scaffolderected in the bazaar, while the criminal crouched beneath it. With the water whichdripped from them on him their sins also were washed away and fell on the humanscapegoat. To complete the transference the Rajah and his wife made over their fine robesto their substitute, while they themselves, clad in new raiment, mixed with the people tillevening. In Travancore, when a Rajah is near his end, they seek out a holy Brahman, whoconsents to take upon himself the sins of the dying man in consideration of the sum of tenthousand rupees. Thus prepared to immolate himself on the altar of duty, the saint isintroduced into the chamber of death, and closely embraces the dying Rajah, saying to him,“O King, I undertake to bear all your sins and diseases. May your Highness live long andreign happily.” Having thus taken to himself the sins of the sufferer, he is sent away fromthe country and never more allowed to return. At Utch Kurgan in Turkestan Mr. Schuylersaw an old man who was said to get his living by taking on himself the sins of the dead, andthenceforth devoting his life to prayer for their souls.In Uganda, when an army had returned from war, and the gods warned the king by theiroracles that some evil had attached itself to the soldiers, it was customary to pick out awoman slave from the captives, together with a cow, a goat, a fowl, and a dog from thebooty, and to send them back under a strong guard to the borders of the country fromwhich they had come. There their limbs were broken and they were left to die; for theywere too crippled to crawl back to Uganda. In order to ensure the transference of the evilto these substitutes, bunches of grass were rubbed over the people and cattle and then tiedto the victims. After that the army was pronounced clean and was allowed to return to thecapital. So on his accession a new king of Uganda used to wound a man and send him awayas a scapegoat to Bunyoro to carry away any uncleanliness that might attach to the king orqueen.4. The Transference of Evil in EuropeTHE EXAMPLES of the transference of evil hitherto adduced have been mostly drawnfrom the customs of savage or barbarous peoples. But similar attempts to shift the burden"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"of disease, misfortune, and sin from one’s self to another person, or to an animal or thing,have been common also among the civilised nations of Europe, both in ancient and moderntimes. A Roman cure for fever was to pare the patient’s nails, and stick the parings withwax on a neighbour’s door before sunrise; the fever then passed from the sick man to hisneighbour. Similar devices must have been resorted to by the Greeks; for in laying downlaws for his ideal state, Plato thinks it too much to expect that men should not be alarmedat finding certain wax figures adhering to their doors or to the tombstones of their parents,or lying at cross-roads. In the fourth century of our era Marcellus of Bordeaux prescribeda cure for warts, which has still a great vogue among the superstitious in various parts ofEurope. You are to touch your warts with as many little stones as you have warts; thenwrap the stones in an ivy leaf, and throw them away in a thoroughfare. Whoever picksthem up will get the warts, and you will be rid of them. People in the Orkney Islands willsometimes wash a sick man, and then throw the water down at a gateway, in the belief thatthe sickness will leave the patient and be transferred to the first person who passes throughthe gate. A Bavarian cure for fever is to write upon a piece of paper, “Fever, stay away, Iam not at home,” and to put the paper in somebody’s pocket. The latter then catches thefever, and the patient is rid of it. A Bohemian prescription for the same malady is this.Take an empty pot, go with it to a cross-road, throw it down, and run away. The firstperson who kicks against the pot will catch your fever, and you will be cured.Often in Europe, as among savages, an attempt is made to transfer a pain or malady from aman to an animal. Grave writers of antiquity recommended that, if a man be stung by ascorpion, he should sit upon an ass with his face to the tail, or whisper in the animal’s ear,“A scorpion has stung me”; in either case, they thought, the pain would be transferredfrom the man to the ass. Many cures of this sort are recorded by Marcellus. For example,he tells us that the following is a remedy for toothache. Standing booted under the open skyon the ground, you catch a frog by the head, spit into its mouth, ask it to carry away theache, and then let it go. But the ceremony must be performed on a lucky day and at a luckyhour. In Cheshire the ailment known as aphtha or thrush, which affects the mouth orthroat of infants, is not uncommonly treated in much the same manner. A young frog isheld for a few moments with its head inside the mouth of the sufferer, whom it is supposedto relieve by taking the malady to itself. “I assure you,” said an old woman who had oftensuperintended such a cure, “we used to hear the poor frog whooping and coughing, mortalbad, for days after; it would have made your heart ache to hear the poor creature coughingas it did about the garden.” A Northamptonshire, Devonshire, and Welsh cure for a coughis to put a hair of the patient’s head between two slices of buttered bread and give thesandwich to a dog. The animal will thereupon catch the cough and the patient will lose it.Sometimes an ailment is transferred to an animal by sharing food with it. Thus inOldenburg, if you are sick of a fever you set a bowl of sweet milk before a dog and say,“Good luck, you hound! may you be sick and I be sound!” Then when the dog has lappedsome of the milk, you take a swig at the bowl; and then the dog must lap again, and thenyou must swig again; and when you and the dog have done it the third time, he will havethe fever and you will be quit of it.A Bohemian cure for fever is to go out into the forest before the sun is up and look for asnipe’s nest. When you have found it, take out one of the young birds and keep it besideyou for three days. Then go back into the wood and set the snipe free. The fever will leave"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"you at once. The snipe has taken it away. So in Vedic times the Hindoos of old sentconsumption away with a blue jay. They said, “O consumption, fly away, fly away with theblue jay! With the wild rush of the storm and the whirlwind, oh, vanish away!” In thevillage of Llandegla in Wales there is a church dedicated to the virgin martyr St. Tecla,where the falling sickness is, or used to be, cured by being transferred to a fowl. Thepatient first washed his limbs in a sacred well hard by, dropped fourpence into it as anoffering, walked thrice round the well, and thrice repeated the Lord’s prayer. Then thefowl, which was a cock or a hen according as the patient was a man or a woman, was putinto a basket and carried round first the well and afterwards the church. Next the suffererentered the church and lay down under the communion table till break of day. After thathe offered sixpence and departed, leaving the fowl in the church. If the bird died, thesickness was supposed to have been transferred to it from the man or woman, who was nowrid of the disorder. As late as 1855 the old parish clerk of the village remembered quite wellto have seen the birds staggering about from the effects of the fits which had beentransferred to them.Often the sufferer seeks to shift his burden of sickness or ill-luck to some inanimate object.In Athens there is a little chapel of St. John the Baptist built against an ancient column.Fever patients resort thither, and by attaching a waxed thread to the inner side of thecolumn believe that they transfer the fever from themselves to the pillar. In the Mark ofBrandenburg they say that if you suffer from giddiness you should strip yourself nakedand run thrice round a flax-field after sunset; in that way the flax will get the giddiness andyou will be rid of it.But perhaps the thing most commonly employed in Europe as a receptacle for sickness andtrouble of all sorts is a tree or bush. A Bulgarian cure for fever is to run thrice around awillow-tree at sunrise, crying, “The fever shall shake thee, and the sun shall warm me.” Inthe Greek island of Karpathos the priest ties a red thread round the neck of a sick person.Next morning the friends of the patient remove the thread and go out to the hillside, wherethey tie the thread to a tree, thinking that they thus transfer the sickness to the tree.Italians attempt to cure fever in like manner by tethering it to a tree The sufferer ties athread round his left wrist at night, and hangs the thread on a tree next morning. The feveris thus believed to be tied up to the tree, and the patient to be rid of it; but he must becareful not to pass by that tree again, otherwise the fever would break loose from its bondsand attack him afresh. A Flemish cure for the ague is to go early in the morning to an oldwillow, tie three knots in one of its branches, say, “Good-morrow, Old One, I give thee thecold; good-morrow, Old One,” then turn and run away without looking round. InSonnenberg, if you would rid yourself of gout you should go to a young fir-tree and tie aknot in one of its twigs, saying, “God greet thee, noble fir. I bring thee my gout. Here will Itie a knot and bind my gout into it. In the name,” etc.Another way of transferring gout from a man to a tree is this. Pare the nails of thesufferer’s fingers and clip some hairs from his legs. Bore a hole in an oak, stuff the nailsand hair in the hole, stop up the hole again, and smear it with cow’s dung. If, for threemonths thereafter, the patient is free of gout, you may be sure the oak has it in his stead. InCheshire if you would be rid of warts, you have only to rub them with a piece of bacon, cuta slit in the bark of an ash-tree, and slip the bacon under the bark. Soon the warts will"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"disappear from your hand, only however to reappear in the shape of rough excrescences orknobs on the bark of the tree. At Berkhampstead, in Hertfordshire, there used to be certainoak-trees which were long celebrated for the cure of ague. The transference of the maladyto the tree was simple but painful. A lock of the sufferer’s hair was pegged into an oak;then by a sudden wrench he left his hair and his ague behind him in the tree.LVI. The Public Expulsion of Evils1. The Omnipresence of DemonsIN THE FOREGOING chapter the primitive principle of the transference of ills to anotherperson, animal, or thing was explained and illustrated. But similar means have beenadopted to free a whole community from diverse evils that afflict it. Such attempts todismiss at once the accumulated sorrows of a people are by no means rare or exceptional;on the contrary they have been made in many lands, and from being occasional they tendto become periodic and annual.It needs some effort on our part to realise the frame of mind which prompts these attempts.Bred in a philosophy which strips nature of personality and reduces it to the unknowncause of an orderly series of impressions on our senses, we find it hard to put ourselves inthe place of the savage, to whom the same impressions appear in the guise of spirits or thehandiwork of spirits. For ages the army of spirits, once so near, has been receding fartherand farther from us, banished by the magic wand of science from hearth and home, fromruined cell and ivied tower, from haunted glade and lonely mere, from the riven murkycloud that belches forth the lightning, and from those fairer clouds that pillow the silverymoon or fret with flakes of burning red the golden eve. The spirits are gone even from theirlast stronghold in the sky, whose blue arch no longer passes, except with children, for thescreen that hides from mortal eyes the glories of the celestial world. Only in poets’ dreamsor impassioned flights of oratory is it given to catch a glimpse of the last flutter of thestandards of the retreating host, to hear the beat of their invisible wings, the sound of theirmocking laughter, or the swell of angel music dying away in the distance. Far otherwise is itwith the savage. To his imagination the world still teems with those motley beings whom amore sober philosophy has discarded. Fairies and goblins, ghosts and demons, still hoverabout him both waking and sleeping. They dog his footsteps, dazzle his senses, enter intohim, harass and deceive and torment him in a thousand freakish and mischievous ways.The mishaps that befall him, the losses he sustains, the pains he has to endure, hecommonly sets down, if not to the magic of his enemies, to the spite or anger or caprice ofthe spirits. Their constant presence wearies him, their sleepless malignity exasperates him;he longs with an unspeakable longing to be rid of them altogether, and from time to time,driven to bay, his patience utterly exhausted, he turns fiercely on his persecutors andmakes a desperate effort to chase the whole pack of them from the land, to clear the air oftheir swarming multitudes, that he may breathe more freely and go on his way unmolested,at least for a time. Thus it comes about that the endeavour of primitive people to make aclean sweep of all their troubles generally takes the form of a grand hunting out and"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"expulsion of devils or ghosts. They think that if they can only shake off these their accursedtormentors, they will make a fresh start in life, happy and innocent; the tales of Eden andthe old poetic golden age will come true again.2. The Occasional Expulsion of EvilsWE can therefore understand why those general clearances of evil, to which from time totime the savage resorts, should commonly take the form of a forcible expulsion of devils. Inthese evil spirits primitive man sees the cause of many if not of most of his troubles, and hefancies that if he can only deliver himself from them, things will go better with him. Thepublic attempts to expel the accumulated ills of a whole community may be divided intotwo classes, according as the expelled evils are immaterial and invisible or are embodied ina material vehicle or scape-goat. The former may be called the direct or immediateexpulsion of evils; the latter the indirect or mediate expulsion, or the expulsion byscapegoat. We begin with examples of the former.In the island of Rook, between New Guinea and New Britain, when any misfortune hashappened, all the people run together, scream, curse, howl, and beat the air with sticks todrive away the devil, who is supposed to be the author of the mishap. From the spot wherethe mishap took place they drive him step by step to the sea, and on reaching the shore theyredouble their shouts and blows in order to expel him from the island. He generally retiresto the sea or to the island of Lottin. The natives of New Britain ascribe sickness, drought,the failure of crops, and in short all misfortunes, to the influence of wicked spirits. So attimes when many people sicken and die, as at the beginning of the rainy season, all theinhabitants of a district, armed with branches and clubs, go out by moonlight to the fields,where they beat and stamp on the ground with wild howls till morning, believing that thisdrives away the devils; and for the same purpose they rush through the village withburning torches. The natives of New Caledonia are said to believe that all evils are causedby a powerful and malignant spirit; hence in order to rid themselves of him they will fromtime to time dig a great pit, round which the whole tribe gathers. After cursing the demon,they fill up the pit with earth, and trample on the top with loud shouts. This they callburying the evil spirit. Among the Dieri tribe of Central Australia, when a serious illnessoccurs, the medicine-men expel Cootchie or the devil by beating the ground in and outsideof the camp with the stuffed tail of a kangaroo, until they have chased the demon away tosome distance from the camp.When a village has been visited by a series of disasters or a severe epidemic, the inhabitantsof Minahassa in Celebes lay the blame upon the devils who are infesting the village andwho must be expelled from it. Accordingly, early one morning all the people, men, women,and children, quit their homes, carrying their household goods with them, and take uptheir quarters in temporary huts which have been erected outside the village. Here theyspend several days, offering sacrifices and preparing for the final ceremony. At last themen, some wearing masks, others with their faces blackened, and so on, but all armed withswords, guns, pikes, or brooms, steal cautiously and silently back to the deserted village.Then, at a signal from the priest, they rush furiously up and down the streets and into andunder the houses (which are raised on piles above the ground), yelling and striking on"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"walls, doors, and windows, to drive away the devils. Next, the priests and the rest of thepeople come with the holy fire and march nine times round each house and thrice roundthe ladder that leads up to it, carrying the fire with them. Then they take the fire into thekitchen, where it must burn for three days continuously. The devils are now driven away,and great and general is the joy.The Alfoors of Halmahera attribute epidemics to the devil who comes from other villages tocarry them off. So, in order to rid the village of the disease, the sorcerer drives away thedevil. From all the villagers he receives a costly garment and places it on four vessels, whichhe takes to the forest and leaves at the spot where the devil is supposed to be. Then withmocking words he bids the demon abandon the place. In the Kei Islands to the south-westof New Guinea, the evil spirits, who are quite distinct from the souls of the dead, form amighty host. Almost every tree and every cave is the lodging-place of one of these fiends,who are moreover extremely irascible and apt to fly out on the smallest provocation. Theymanifest their displeasure by sending sickness and other calamities. Hence in times ofpublic misfortune, as when an epidemic is raging, and all other remedies have failed, thewhole population go forth with the priest at their head to a place at some distance from thevillage. Here at sunset they erect a couple of poles with a cross-bar between them, to whichthey attach bags of rice, wooden models of pivot-guns, gongs, bracelets, and so on. Then,when everybody has taken his place at the poles and a death-like silence reigns, the priestlifts up his voice and addresses the spirits in their own language as follows: “Ho! ho! ho! yeevil spirits who dwell in the trees, ye evil spirits who live in the grottoes, ye evil spirits wholodge in the earth, we give you these pivot-guns, these gongs, etc. Let the sickness cease andnot so many people die of it.” Then everybody runs home as fast as their legs can carrythem.In the island of Nias, when a man is seriously ill and other remedies have been tried in vain,the sorcerer proceeds to exorcise the devil who is causing the illness. A pole is set up infront of the house, and from the top of the pole a rope of palm-leaves is stretched to theroof of the house. Then the sorcerer mounts the roof with a pig, which he kills and allows toroll from the roof to the ground. The devil, anxious to get the pig, lets himself down hastilyfrom the roof by the rope of palm-leaves, and a good spirit, invoked by the sorcerer,prevents him from climbing up again. If this remedy fails, it is believed that other devilsmust still be lurking in the house. So a general hunt is made after them. All the doors andwindows in the house are closed, except a single dormer-window in the roof. The men, shutup in the house, hew and slash with their swords right and left to the clash of gongs and therub-a-dub of drums. Terrified at this onslaught, the devils escape by the dormer-window,and sliding down the rope of palm-leaves take themselves off. As all the doors andwindows, except the one in the roof, are shut, the devils cannot get into the house again. Inthe case of an epidemic, the proceedings are similar. All the gates of the village, except one,are closed; every voice is raised, every gong and drum beaten, every sword brandished.Thus the devils are driven out and the last gate is shut behind them. For eight daysthereafter the village is in a state of siege, no one being allowed to enter it.When cholera has broken out in a Burmese village the able-bodied men scramble on theroofs and lay about them with bamboos and billets of wood, while all the rest of thepopulation, old and young, stand below and thump drums, blow trumpets, yell, scream,"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"beat floors, walls, tin pans, everything to make a din. This uproar, repeated on threesuccessive nights, is thought to be very effective in driving away the cholera demons. Whensmallpox first appeared amongst the Kumis of South-Eastern India, they thought it was adevil come from Aracan. The villages were placed in a state of siege, no one being allowedto leave or enter them. A monkey was killed by being dashed on the ground, and its bodywas hung at the village gate. Its blood, mixed with small river pebbles, was sprinkled on thehouses, the threshold of every house was swept with the monkey’s tail, and the fiend wasadjured to depart.When an epidemic is raging on the Gold Coast of West Africa, the people will sometimesturn out, armed with clubs and torches, to drive the evil spirits away. At a given signal thewhole population begin with frightful yells to beat in every corner of the houses, then rushlike mad into the streets waving torches and striking frantically in the empty air. Theuproar goes on till somebody reports that the cowed and daunted demons have made goodtheir escape by a gate of the town or village; the people stream out after them, pursue themfor some distance into the forest, and warn them never to return. The expulsion of thedevils is followed by a general massacre of all the cocks in the village or town, lest by theirunseasonable crowing they should betray to the banished demons the direction they musttake to return to their old homes. When sickness was prevalent in a Huron village, and allother remedies had been tried in vain, the Indians had recourse to the ceremony calledLonouyroya, “which is the principal invention and most proper means, so they say, to expelfrom the town or village the devils and evil spirits which cause, induce, and import all themaladies and infirmities which they suffer in body and mind.” Accordingly, one eveningthe men would begin to rush like madmen about the village, breaking and upsettingwhatever they came across in the wigwams. They threw fire and burning brands about thestreets, and all night long they ran howling and singing without cessation. Then they alldreamed of something, a knife, dog, skin, or whatever it might be, and when morning camethey went from wigwam to wigwam asking for presents. These they received silently, till theparticular thing was given them which they had dreamed about. On receiving it theyuttered a cry of joy and rushed from the hut, amid the congratulations of all present. Thehealth of those who received what they had dreamed of was believed to be assured;whereas those who did not get what they had set their hearts upon regarded their fate assealed.Sometimes, instead of chasing the demon of disease from their homes, savages prefer toleave him in peaceable possession, while they themselves take to flight and attempt toprevent him from following in their tracks. Thus when the Patagonians were attacked bysmall-pox, which they attributed to the machinations of an evil spirit, they used to abandontheir sick and flee, slashing the air with their weapons and throwing water about in orderto keep off the dreadful pursuer; and when after several days’ march they reached a placewhere they hoped to be beyond his reach, they used by way of precaution to plant all theircutting weapons with the sharp edges turned towards the quarter from which they hadcome, as if they were repelling a charge of cavalry. Similarly, when the Lules or TonocotesIndians of the Gran Chaco were attacked by an epidemic, they regularly sought to evade itby flight, but in so doing they always followed a sinuous, not a straight, course; becausethey said that when the disease made after them he would be so exhausted by the turningsand windings of the route that he would never be able to come up with them. When the"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"Indians of New Mexico were decimated by smallpox or other infectious disease, they usedto shift their quarters every day, retreating into the most sequestered parts of themountains and choosing the thorniest thickets they could find, in the hope that thesmallpox would be too afraid of scratching himself on the thorns to follow them. Whensome Chins on a visit to Rangoon were attacked by cholera, they went about with drawnswords to scare away the demon, and they spent the day hiding under bushes so that hemight not be able to find them.3. The Periodic Expulsion of EvilsTHE EXPULSION of evils, from being occasional, tends to become periodic. It comes to bethought desirable to have a general riddance of evil spirits at fixed times, usually once ayear, in order that the people may make a fresh start in life, freed from all the malignantinfluences which have been long accumulating about them. Some of the Australian blacksannually expelled the ghosts of the dead from their territory. The ceremony was witnessedby the Rev. W. Ridley on the banks of the River Barwan. “A chorus of twenty, old andyoung, were singing and beating time with boomerangs... . Suddenly, from under a sheet ofbark darted a man with his body whitened by pipeclay, his head and face coloured withlines of red and yellow, and a tuft of feathers fixed by means of a stick two feet above thecrown of his head. He stood twenty minutes perfectly still, gazing upwards. An aboriginalwho stood by told me he was looking for the ghosts of dead men. At last he began to movevery slowly, and soon rushed to and fro at full speed, flourishing a branch as if to driveaway some foes invisible to us. When I thought this pantomime must be almost over, tenmore, similarly adorned, suddenly appeared from behind the trees, and the whole partyjoined in a brisk conflict with their mysterious assailants. ... At last, after some rapidevolutions in which they put forth all their strength, they rested from the exciting toil whichthey had kept up all night and for some hours after sunrise; they seemed satisfied that theghosts were driven away for twelve months. They were performing the same ceremony atevery station along the river, and I am told it is an annual custom.”Certain seasons of the year mark themselves naturally out as appropriate moments for ageneral expulsion of devils. Such a moment occurs towards the close of an Arctic winter,when the sun reappears on the horizon after an absence of weeks or months. Accordingly,at Point Barrow, the most northerly extremity of Alaska, and nearly of America, theEsquimaux choose the moment of the sun’s reappearance to hunt the mischievous spiritTuña from every house. The ceremony was witnessed by the members of the United StatesPolar Expedition, who wintered at Point Barrow. A fire was built in front of the council-house, and an old woman was posted at the entrance to every house. The men gatheredround the council-house while the young women and girls drove the spirit out of everyhouse with their knives, stabbing viciously under the bunk and deer-skins, and calling uponTuña to be gone. When they thought he had been driven out of every hole and corner, theythrust him down through the hole in the floor and chased him into the open air with loudcries and frantic gestures. Meanwhile the old woman at the entrance of the house madepasses with a long knife in the air to keep him from returning. Each party drove the spirittowards the fire and invited him to go into it. All were by this time drawn up in a semicircleround the fire, when several of the leading men made specific charges against the spirit;"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"and each after his speech brushed his clothes violently, calling on the spirit to leave himand go into the fire. Two men now stepped forward with rifles loaded with blankcartridges, while a third brought a vessel of urine and flung it on the flames. At the sametime one of the men fired a shot into the fire; and as the cloud of steam rose it received theother shot, which was supposed to finish Tunña for the time being.In late autumn, when storms rage over the land and break the icy fetters by which thefrozen sea is as yet but slightly bound, when the loosened floes are driven against eachother and break with loud crashes, and when the cakes of ice are piled in wild disorder oneupon another, the Esquimaux of Baffin Land fancy they hear the voices of the spirits whopeople the mischief-laden air. Then the ghosts of the dead knock wildly at the huts, whichthey cannot enter, and woe to the hapless wight whom they catch; he soon sickens and dies.Then the phantom of a huge hairless dog pursues the real dogs, which expire in convulsionsand cramps at sight of him. All the countless spirits of evil are abroad striving to bringsickness and death, foul weather and failure in hunting on the Esquimaux. Most dreaded ofall these spectral visitants are Sedna, mistress of the nether world, and her father, to whoseshare dead Esquimaux fall. While the other spirits fill the air and the water, she rises fromunder ground. It is then a busy season for the wizards. In every house you may hear themsinging and praying, while they conjure the spirits, seated in a mystic gloom at the back ofthe hut, which is dimly lit by a lamp burning low. The hardest task of all is to drive awaySedna, and this is reserved for the most powerful enchanter. A rope is coiled on the floor ofa large hut in such a way as to leave a small opening at the top, which represents thebreathing hole of a seal. Two enchanters stand beside it, one of them grasping a spear as ifhe were watching a seal-hole in winter, the other holding the harpoon-line. A third sorcerersits at the back of the hut chanting a magic song to lure Sedna to the spot. Now she is heardapproaching under the floor of the hut, breathing heavily; now she emerges at the hole;now she is harpooned and sinks away in angry haste, dragging the harpoon with her, whilethe two men hold on to the line with all their might. The struggle is severe, but at last by adesperate wrench she tears herself away and returns to her dwelling in Adlivun. When theharpoon is drawn up out of the hole it is found to be splashed with blood, which theenchanters proudly exhibit as a proof of their prowess. Thus Sedna and the other evilspirits are at last driven away, and next day a great festival is celebrated by old and youngin honour of the event. But they must still be cautious, for the wounded Sedna is furiousand will seize any one she may find outside of his hut; so they all wear amulets on the top oftheir hoods to protect themselves against her. These amulets consist of pieces of the firstgarments that they wore after birth.The Iroquois inaugurated the new year in January, February, or March (the time varied)with a “festival of dreams” like that which the Hurons observed on special occasions. Thewhole ceremonies lasted several days, or even weeks, and formed a kind of saturnalia. Menand women, variously disguised, went from wigwam to wigwam smashing and throwingdown whatever they came across. It was a time of general license; the people were supposedto be out of their senses, and therefore not to be responsible for what they did. Accordingly,many seized the opportunity of paying off old scores by belabouring obnoxious persons,drenching them with ice-cold water, and covering them with filth or hot ashes. Othersseized burning brands or coals and flung them at the heads of the first persons they met.The only way of escaping from these persecutors was to guess what they had dreamed of."},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"On one day of the festival the ceremony of driving away evil spirits from the village tookplace. Men clothed in the skins of wild beasts, their faces covered with hideous masks, andtheir hands with the shell of the tortoise, went from hut to hut making frightful noises; inevery hut they took the fuel from the fire and scattered the embers and ashes about thefloor with their hands. The general confession of sins which preceded the festival wasprobably a preparation for the public expulsion of evil influences; it was a way of strippingthe people of their moral burdens, that these might be collected and cast out.In September the Incas of Peru celebrated a festival called Situa, the object of which was tobanish from the capital and its vicinity all disease and trouble. The festival fell inSeptember because the rains begin about this time, and with the first rains there wasgenerally much sickness. As a preparation for the festival the people fasted on the first dayof the moon after the autumnal equinox. Having fasted during the day, and the night beingcome, they baked a coarse paste of maize. This paste was made of two sorts. One waskneaded with the blood of children aged from five to ten years, the blood being obtained bybleeding the children between the eyebrows. These two kinds of paste were bakedseparately, because they were for different uses. Each family assembled at the house of theeldest brother to celebrate the feast; and those who had no elder brother went to the houseof their next relation of greater age. On the same night all who had fasted during the daywashed their bodies, and taking a little of the blood-kneaded paste, rubbed it over theirhead, face, breast, shoulders, arms and legs. They did this in order that the paste mighttake away all their infirmities. After this the head of the family anointed the threshold withthe same paste, and left it there as a token that the inmates of the house had performedtheir ablutions and cleansed their bodies. Meantime the High Priest performed the sameceremonies in the temple of the Sun. As soon as the Sun rose, all the people worshipped andbesought him to drive all evils out of the city, and then they broke their fast with the pastethat had been kneaded without blood. When they had paid their worship and broken theirfast, which they did at a stated hour, in order that all might adore the Sun as one man, anInca of the blood royal came forth from the fortress, as a messenger of the Sun, richlydressed, with his mantle girded round his body, and a lance in his hand. The lance wasdecked with feathers of many hues, extending from the blade to the socket, and fastenedwith rings of gold. He ran down the hill from the fortress brandishing his lance, till hereached the centre of the great square, where stood the golden urn, like a fountain, thatwas used for the sacrifice of the fermented juice of the maize. Here four other Incas of theblood royal awaited him, each with a lance in his hand, and his mantle girded up to run.The messenger touched their four lances with his lance, and told them that the Sun badethem, as his messengers, drive the evils out of the city. The four Incas then separated andran down the four royal roads which led out of the city to the four quarters of the world.While they ran, all the people, great and small, came to the doors of their houses, and withgreat shouts of joy and gladness shook their clothes, as if they were shaking off dust, whilethey cried, “Let the evils be gone. How greatly desired has this festival been by us. OCreator of all things, permit us to reach another year, that we may see another feast likethis.” After they had shaken their clothes, they passed their hands over their heads, faces,arms, and legs, as if in the act of washing. All this was done to drive the evils out of theirhouses, that the messengers of the Sun might banish them from the city; and it was donenot only in the streets through which the Incas ran, but generally in all quarters of the city.Moreover, they all danced, the Inca himself amongst them, and bathed in the rivers and"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"fountains, saying that their maladies would come out of them. Then they took great torchesof straw, bound round with cords. These they lighted, and passed from one to the other,striking each other with them, and saying, “Let all harm go away.” Meanwhile the runnersran with their lances for a quarter of a league outside the city, where they found four otherIncas ready, who received the lances from their hands and ran with them. Thus the lanceswere carried by relays of runners for a distance of five or six leagues, at the end of whichthe runners washed themselves and their weapons in rivers, and set up the lances, in sign ofa boundary within which the banished evils might not return.The negroes of Guinea annually banish the devil from all their towns with much ceremonyat a time set apart for the purpose. At Axim, on the Gold Coast, this annual expulsion ispreceded by a feast of eight days, during which mirth and jollity, skipping, dancing, andsinging prevail, and “a perfect lampooning liberty is allowed, and scandal so highly exalted,that they may freely sing of all the faults, villanies, and frauds of their superiors as well asinferiors, without punishment, or so much as the least interruption.” On the eighth daythey hunt out the devil with a dismal cry, running after him and pelting him with sticks,stones, and whatever comes to hand. When they have driven him far enough out of thetown, they all return. In this way he is expelled from more than a hundred towns at thesame time. To make sure that he does not return to their houses, the women wash andscour all their wooden and earthen vessels, “to free them from all uncleanness and thedevil.”At Cape Coast Castle, on the Gold Coast, the ceremony was witnessed on the ninth ofOctober, 1844, by an Englishman, who has described it as follows: “To-night the annualcustom of driving the evil spirit, Abonsam, out of the town has taken place. As soon as theeight o’clock gun fired in the fort the people began firing muskets in their houses, turningall their furniture out of doors, beating about in every corner of the rooms with sticks, etc.,and screaming as loudly as possible, in order to frighten the devil. Being driven out of thehouses, as they imagine, they sallied forth into the streets, throwing lighted torches about,shouting, screaming, beating sticks together, rattling old pans, making the most horridnoise, in order to drive him out of the town into the sea. The custom is preceded by fourweeks’ dead silence; no gun is allowed to be fired, no drum to be beaten, no palaver to bemade between man and man. If, during these weeks, two natives should disagree and makea noise in the town, they are immediately taken before the king and fined heavily. If a dogor pig, sheep or goat be found at large in the street, it may be killed, or taken by anyone,the former owner not being allowed to demand any compensation. This silence is designedto deceive Abonsam, that, being off his guard, he may be taken by surprise, and frightenedout of the place. If anyone die during the silence, his relatives are not allowed to weep untilthe four weeks have been completed.”Sometimes the date of the annual expulsion of devils is fixed with reference to theagricultural seasons. Thus among the Hos of Togoland, in West Africa, the expulsion isperformed annually before the people partake of the new yams. The chiefs summon thepriests and magicians and tell them that the people are now to eat the new yams and bemerry, therefore they must cleanse the town and remove the evils. Accordingly the evilspirits, witches, and all the ills that infest the people are conjured into bundles of leaves andcreepers, fastened to poles, which are carried away and set up in the earth on various roads"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"outside the town. During the following night no fire may be lit and no food eaten. Nextmorning the women sweep out their hearths and houses, and deposit the sweepings onbroken wooden plates. Then the people pray, saying, “All ye sicknesses that are in our bodyand plague us, we are come to-day to throw you out.” Thereupon they run as fast as theycan in the direction of Mount Adaklu, smiting their mouths and screaming, “Out to-day!Out to-day! That which kills anybody, out to-day! Ye evil spirits, out to-day! and all thatcauses our heads to ache, out to-day! Anlo and Adaklu are the places whither all ill shallbetake itself!” When they have come to a certain tree on Mount Adaklu, they throweverything away and return home.At Kiriwina, in South-Eastern New Guinea, when the new yams had been harvested, thepeople feasted and danced for many days, and a great deal of property, such as armlets,native money, and so forth, was displayed conspicuously on a platform erected for thepurpose. When the festivities were over, all the people gathered together and expelled thespirits from the village by shouting, beating the posts of the houses, and overturningeverything under which a wily spirit might be supposed to lurk. The explanation which thepeople gave to a missionary was that they had entertained and feasted the spirits andprovided them with riches, and it was now time for them to take their departure. Had theynot seen the dances, and heard the songs, and gorged themselves on the souls of the yams,and appropriated the souls of the money and all the other fine things set out on theplatform? What more could the spirits want? So out they must go.Among the Hos of North-Eastern India the great festival of the year is the harvest home,held in January, when the granaries are full of grain, and the people, to use their ownexpression, are full of devilry. “They have a strange notion that at this period, men andwomen are so overcharged with vicious propensities, that it is absolutely necessary for thesafety of the person to let off steam by allowing for a time full vent to the passions.” Theceremonies open with a sacrifice to the village god of three fowls, a cock and two hens, oneof which must be black. Along with them are offered flowers of the palas tree (Buteafrondosa), bread made from rice-flour, and sesamum seeds. These offerings are presentedby the village priest, who prays that during the year about to begin they and their childrenmay be preserved from all misfortune and sickness, and that they may have seasonablerain and good crops. Prayer is also made in some places for the souls of the dead. At thistime an evil spirit is supposed to infest the place, and to get rid of it men, women, andchildren go in procession round and through every part of the village with sticks in theirhands, as if beating for game, singing a wild chant, and shouting vociferously, till they feelassured that the evil spirit must have fled. Then they give themselves up to feasting anddrinking rice-beer, till they are in a fit state for the wild debauch which follows. Thefestival now “becomes a saturnale, during which servants forget their duty to their masters,children their reverence for parents, men their respect for women, and women all notionsof modesty, delicacy, and gentleness; they become raging bacchantes.” Usually the Hos arequiet and reserved in manner, decorous and gentle to women. But during this festival“their natures appear to undergo a temporary change. Sons and daughters revile theirparents in gross language, and parents their children; men and women become almost likeanimals in the indulgence of their amorous propensities.” The Mundaris, kinsmen andneighbours of the Hos, keep the festival in much the same manner. “The resemblance to aSaturnale is very complete, as at this festival the farm labourers are feasted by their"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"masters, and allowed the utmost freedom of speech in addressing them. It is the festival ofthe harvest home; the termination of one year’s toil, and a slight respite from it before theycommence again.”Amongst some of the Hindoo Koosh tribes, as among the Hos and Mundaris, the expulsionof devils takes place after harvest. When the last crop of autumn has been got in, it isthought necessary to drive away evil spirits from the granaries. A kind of porridge is eaten,and the head of the family takes his matchlock and fires it into the floor. Then, goingoutside, he sets to work loading and firing till his powder-horn is exhausted, while all hisneighbours are similarly employed. The next day is spent in rejoicings. In Chitral thisfestival is called “devil-driving.” On the other hand the Khonds of India expel the devils atseed-time instead of at harvest. At this time they worship Pitteri Pennu, the god of increaseand of gain in every shape. On the first day of the festival a rude car is made of a basket setupon a few sticks, tied upon the bamboo rollers for wheels. The priest takes this car first tothe house of the lineal head of the tribe, to whom precedence is given in all ceremoniesconnected with agriculture. Here he receives a little of each kind of seed and some feathers.He then takes the car to all the other houses in the village, each of which contributes thesame things. Lastly, the car is conducted to a field without the village, attended by all theyoung men, who beat each other and strike the air violently with long sticks. The seed thuscarried out is called the share of the “evil spirits, spoilers of the seed.” “These areconsidered to be driven out with the car; and when it and its contents are abandoned tothem, they are held to have no excuse for interfering with the rest of the seed-corn.”The people of Bali, an island to the east of Java, have periodical expulsions of devils upon agreat scale. Generally the time chosen for the expulsion is the day of the “dark moon” inthe ninth month. When the demons have been long unmolested the country is said to be“warm,” and the priest issues orders to expel them by force, lest the whole of Bali should berendered uninhabitable. On the day appointed the people of the village or district assembleat the principal temple. Here at a cross-road offerings are set out for the devils. Afterprayers have been recited by the priests, the blast of a horn summons the devils to partakeof the meal which has been prepared for them. At the same time a number of men stepforward and light their torches at the holy lamp which burns before the chief priest.Immediately afterwards, followed by the bystanders, they spread in all directions andmarch through the streets and lanes crying, “Depart! go away!” Wherever they pass, thepeople who have stayed at home hasten, by a deafening clatter on doors, beams, rice-blocks, and so forth, to take their share in the expulsion of devils. Thus chased from thehouses, the fiends flee to the banquet which has been set out for them; but here the priestreceives them with curses which finally drive them from the district. When the last devilhas taken his departure, the uproar is succeeded by a dead silence, which lasts during thenext day also. The devils, it is thought, are anxious to return to their old homes, and inorder to make them think that Bali is not Bali but some desert island, no one may stir fromhis own abode for twenty-four hours. Even ordinary household work, including cooking, isdiscontinued. Only the watchmen may show themselves in the streets. Wreaths of thornsand leaves are hung at all the entrances to warn strangers from entering. Not till the thirdday is this state of siege raised, and even then it is forbidden to work at the rice-fields or tobuy and sell in the market. Most people still stay at home, whiling away the time with cardsand dice."},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"In Tonquin a theckydaw or general expulsion of maleyolent spirits commonly took placeonce a year, especially if there was a great mortality amongst men, the elephants or horsesof the general’s stable, or the cattle of the country, “the cause of which they attribute to themalicious spirits of such men as have been put to death for treason, rebellion, andconspiring the death of the king, general, or princes, and that in revenge of the punishmentthey have suffered, they are bent to destroy everything and commit horrible violence. Toprevent which their superstition has suggested to them the institution of this theckydaw, asa proper means to drive the devil away, and purge the country of evil spirits.” The dayappointed for the ceremony was generally the twenty-fifth of February, one month afterthe beginning of the new year, which fell on the twenty-fifth of January. The intermediatemonth was a season of feasting, merry-making of all kinds, and general licence. During thewhole month the great seal was kept shut up in a box, face downwards, and the law was, asit were, laid asleep. All courts of justice were closed; debtors could not be seized; smallcrimes, such as petty larceny, fighting, and assault, escaped with impunity; only treasonand murder were taken account of and the malefactors detained till the great seal shouldcome into operation again. At the close of the saturnalia the wicked spirits were drivenaway. Great masses of troops and artillery having been drawn up with flying colours andall the pomp of war, “the general beginneth then to offer meat offerings to the criminaldevils and malevolent spirits (for it is usual and customary likewise amongst them to feastthe condemned before their execution), inviting them to eat and drink, when presently heaccuses them in a strange language, by characters and figures, etc., of many offences andcrimes committed by them, as to their having disquieted the land, killed his elephants andhorses, etc., for all which they justly deserve to be chastised and banished the country.Whereupon three great guns are fired as the last signal; upon which all the artillery andmusquets are discharged, that, by their most terrible noise the devils may be driven away;and they are so blind as to believe for certain, that they really and effectually put them toflight.”In Cambodia the expulsion of evil spirits took place in March. Bits of broken statues andstones, considered as the abode of the demons, were collected and brought to the capital.Here as many elephants were collected as could be got together. On the evening of the fullmoon volleys of musketry were fired and the elephants charged furiously to put the devilsto flight. The ceremony was performed on three successive days. In Siam the banishment ofdemons is annually carried into effect on the last day of the old year. A signal gun is firedfrom the palace; it is answered from the next station, and so on from station to station, tillthe firing has reached the outer gate of the city. Thus the demons are driven out step bystep. As soon as this is done a consecrated rope is fastened round the circuit of the citywalls to prevent the banished demons from returning. The rope is made of tough couch-grass and is painted in alternate stripes of red, yellow, and blue.Annual expulsions of demons, witches, or evil influences appear to have been commonamong the heathen of Europe, if we may judge from the relics of such customs among theirdescendants at the present day. Thus among the heathen Wotyaks, a Finnish people ofEastern Russia, all the young girls of the village assemble on the last day of the year or onNew Year’s Day, armed with sticks, the ends of which are split in nine places. With thesethey beat every corner of the house and yard, saying, “We are driving Satan out of thevillage.” Afterwards the sticks are thrown into the river below the village, and as they float"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"down stream Satan goes with them to the next village, from which he must be driven out inturn. In some villages the expulsion is managed otherwise. The unmarried men receivefrom every house in the village groats, flesh, and brandy. These they take to the fields, lighta fire under a fir-tree, boil the groats, and eat of the food they have brought with them,after pronouncing the words, “Go away into the wilderness, come not into the house.” Thenthey return to the village and enter every house where there are young women. They takehold of the young women and throw them into the snow, saying, “May the spirits of diseaseleave you.” The remains of the groats and the other food are then distributed among all thehouses in proportion to the amount that each contributed, and each family consumes itsshare. According to a Wotyak of the Malmyz district the young men throw into the snowwhomever they find in the houses, and this is called “driving out Satan”; moreover, some ofthe boiled groats are cast into the fire with the words, “O god, afflict us not with sicknessand pestilence, give us not up as a prey to the spirits of the wood.” But the most antiqueform of the ceremony is that observed by the Wotyaks of the Kasan Government. First ofall a sacrifice is offered to the Devil at noon. Then all the men assemble on horseback in thecentre of the village, and decide with which house they shall begin. When this question,which often gives rise to hot disputes, is settled, they tether their horses to the paling, andarm themselves with whips, clubs of lime-wood and bundles of lighted twigs. The lightedtwigs are believed to have the greatest terrors for Satan. Thus armed, they proceed withfrightful cries to beat every corner of the house and yard, then shut the door, and spit atthe ejected fiend. So they go from house to house, till the Devil has been driven from everyone. Then they mount their horses and ride out of the village, yelling wildly andbrandishing their clubs in every direction. Outside of the village they fling away the clubsand spit once more at the Devil. The Cheremiss, another Finnish people of Eastern Russia,chase Satan from their dwellings by beating the walls with cudgels of lime-wood. For thesame purpose they fire guns, stab the ground with knives, and insert burning chips of woodin the crevices. Also they leap over bonfires, shaking out their garments as they do so; andin some districts they blow on long trumpets of lime-tree bark to frighten him away. Whenhe has fled to the wood, they pelt the trees with some of the cheese-cakes and eggs whichfurnished the feast.In Christian Europe the old heathen custom of expelling the powers of evil at certain timesof the year has survived to modern times. Thus in some villages of Calabria the month ofMarch is inaugurated with the expulsion of the witches. It takes place at night to the soundof the church bells, the people running about the streets and crying, “March is come.” Theysay that the witches roam about in March, and the ceremony is repeated every Fridayevening during the month. Often, as might have been anticipated, the ancient pagan ritehas attached itself to church festivals. In Albania on Easter Eve the young people lighttorches of resinous wood and march in procession, swinging them, through the village. Atlast they throw the torches into the river, crying, “Ha, Kore! we throw you into the river,like these torches, that you may never return.” Silesian peasants believe that on GoodFriday the witches go their rounds and have great power for mischief. Hence about Oels,near Strehlitz, the people on that day arm themselves with old brooms and drive thewitches from house and home, from farmyard and cattle-stall, making a great uproar andclatter as they do so.In Central Europe the favourite time for expelling the witches is, or was, Walpurgis Night,"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"the Eve of May Day, when the baleful powers of these mischievous beings were supposed tobe at their height. In the Tyrol, for example, as in other places, the expulsion of the powersof evil at this season goes by the name of “Burning out the Witches.” It takes place on MayDay, but people have been busy with their preparations for days before. On a Thursday atmidnight bundles are made up of resinous splinters, black and red spotted hemlock,caperspurge, rosemary, and twigs of the sloe. These are kept and burned on May Day bymen who must first have received plenary absolution from the Church. On the last threedays of April all the houses are cleansed and fumigated with juniper berries and rue. OnMay Day, when the evening bell has rung and the twilight is falling, the ceremony of“Burning out the Witches” begins. Men and boys make a racket with whips, bells, pots, andpans; the women carry censers; the dogs are unchained and run barking and yelpingabout. As soon as the church bells begin to ring, the bundles of twigs, fastened on poles, areset on fire and the incense is ignited. Then all the house-bells and dinner-bells are rung,pots and pans are clashed, dogs bark, every one must make a noise. And amid this hubbuball scream at the pitch of their voices:“Witch flee, flee from here, or it will go ill with thee.”Then they run seven times round the houses, the yards, and the village. So the witches aresmoked out of their lurking-places and driven away. The custom of expelling the witches onWalpurgis Night is still, or was down to recent years, observed in many parts of Bavariaand among the Germans of Bohemia. Thus in the Böhmer-wald Mountains all the youngfellows of the village assemble after sunset on some height, especially at a cross-road, andcrack whips for a while in unison with all their strength. This drives away the witches; forso far as the sound of the whips is heard, these maleficent beings can do no harm. In someplaces, while the young men are cracking their whips, the herdsmen wind their horns, andthe long-drawn notes, heard far off in the silence of night, are very effectual for banningthe witches.Another witching time is the period of twelve days between Christmas and Epiphany.Hence in some parts of Silesia the people burn pine-resin all night long between Christmasand the New Year in order that the pungent smoke may drive witches and evil spirits faraway from house and homestead; and on Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve they fireshots over fields and meadows, into shrubs and trees, and wrap straw round the fruit-trees,to prevent the spirits from doing them harm. On New Year’s Eve, which is SaintSylvester’s Day, Bohemian lads, armed with guns, form themselves into circles and firethrice into the air. This is called “Shooting the Witches” and is supposed to frighten thewitches away. The last of the mystic twelve days is Epiphany or Twelfth Night, and it hasbeen selected as a proper season for the expulsion of the powers of evil in various parts ofEurope. Thus at Brunnen, on the Lake of Lucerne, boys go about in procession on TwelfthNight carrying torches and making a great noise with horns, bells, whips, and so forth tofrighten away two female spirits of the wood, Strudeli and Strätteli. The people think thatif they do not make enough noise, there will be little fruit that year. Again, in Labruguière,a canton of Southern France, on the eve of Twelfth Day the people run through the streets,"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"jangling bells, clattering kettles, and doing everything to make a discordant noise. Then bythe light of torches and blazing faggots they set up a prodigious hue and cry, an ear-splitting uproar, hoping thereby to chase all the wandering ghosts and devils from thetown.LVII. Public Scapegoats1. The Expulsion of Embodied EvilsTHUS far we have dealt with that class of the general expulsion of evils which I have calleddirect or immediate. In this class the evils are invisible, at least to common eyes, and themode of deliverance consists for the most part in beating the empty air and raising such ahubbub as may scare the mischievous spirits and put them to flight. It remains to illustratethe second class of expulsions, in which the evil influences are embodied in a visible form orare at least supposed to be loaded upon a material medium, which acts as a vehicle to drawthem off from the people, village, or town.The Pomos of California celebrate an expulsion of devils every seven years, at which thedevils are represented by disguised men. “Twenty or thirty men array themselves inharlequin rig and barbaric paint, and put vessels of pitch on their heads; then they secretlygo out into the surrounding mountains. These are to personify the devils. A herald goes upto the top of the assembly-house, and makes a speech to the multitude. At a signal agreedupon in the evening the masqueraders come in from the mountains, with the vessels ofpitch flaming on their heads, and with all the frightful accessories of noise, motion, andcostume which the savage mind can devise in representation of demons. The terrifiedwomen and children flee for life, the men huddle them inside a circle, and, on the principleof fighting the devil with fire, they swing blazing firebrands in the air, yell, whoop, andmake frantic dashes at the marauding and bloodthirsty devils, so creating a terrificspectacle, and striking great fear into the hearts of the assembled hundreds of women, whoare screaming and fainting and clinging to their valorous protectors. Finally the devilssucceed in getting into the assembly-house, and the bravest of the men enter and hold aparley with them. As a conclusion of the whole farce, the men summon courage, the devilsare expelled from the assembly-house, and with a prodigious row and racket of shamfighting are chased away into the mountains.” In spring, as soon as the willow-leaves werefull grown on the banks of the river, the Mandan Indians celebrated their great annualfestival, one of the features of which was the expulsion of the devil. A man, painted black torepresent the devil, entered the village from the prairie, chased and frightened the women,and acted the part of a buffalo bull in the buffalo dance, the object of which was to ensure aplentiful supply of buffaloes during the ensuing year. Finally he was chased from thevillage, the women pursuing him with hisses and gibes, beating him with sticks, and peltinghim with dirt.Some of the native tribes of Central Queensland believe in a noxious being called Molonga,who prowls unseen and would kill men and violate women if certain ceremonies were not"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"performed. These ceremonies last for five nights and consist of dances, in which only men,fantastically painted and adorned, take part. On the fifth night Molonga himself,personified by a man tricked out with red ochre and feathers and carrying a long feather-tipped spear, rushes forth from the darkness at the spectators and makes as if he wouldrun them through. Great is the excitement, loud are the shrieks and shouts, but afteranother feigned attack the demon vanishes in the gloom. On the last night of the year thepalace of the Kings of Cambodia is purged of devils. Men painted as fiends are chased byelephants about the palace courts. When they have been expelled, a consecrated thread ofcotton is stretched round the palace to keep them out. In Munzerabad, a district of Mysorein Southern India, when cholera or smallpox has broken out in a parish, the inhabitantsassemble and conjure the demon of the disease into a wooden image, which they carry,generally at midnight, into the next parish. The inhabitants of that parish in like mannerpass the image on to their neighbours, and thus the demon is expelled from one village afteranother, until he comes to the bank of a river into which he is finally thrown.Oftener, however, the expelled demons are not represented at all, but are understood to bepresent invisibly in the material and visible vehicle which conveys them away. Here, again,it will be convenient to distinguish between occasional and periodical expulsions. We beginwith the former.2. The Occasional Expulsion of Evils in a Material VehicleTHE VEHICLE which conveys away the demons may be of various kinds. A common oneis a little ship or boat. Thus, in the southern district of the island of Ceram, when a wholevillage suffers from sickness, a small ship is made and filled with rice, tobacco, eggs, and soforth, which have been contributed by all the people. A little sail is hoisted on the ship.When all is ready, a man calls out in a very loud voice, “O all ye sicknesses, ye smallpoxes,agues, measles, etc., who have visited us so long and wasted us so sorely, but who now ceaseto plague us, we have made ready this ship for you, and we have furnished you withprovender sufficient for the voyage. Ye shall have no lack of food nor of betel-leaves nor ofareca nuts nor of tobacco. Depart, and sail away from us directly; never come near usagain; but go to a land which is far from here. Let all the tides and winds waft you speedilythither, and so convey you thither that for the time to come we may live sound and well,and that we may never see the sun rise on you again.” Then ten or twelve men carry thevessel to the shore, and let it drift away with the land-breeze, feeling convinced that theyare free from sickness for ever, or at least till the next time. If sickness attacks them again,they are sure it is not the same sickness, but a different one, which in due time they dismissin the same manner. When the demon-laden bark is lost to sight, the bearers return to thevillage, whereupon a man cries out, “The sicknesses are now gone, vanished, expelled, andsailed away.” At this all the people come running out of their houses, passing the wordfrom one to the other with great joy, beating on gongs and on tinkling instruments.Similar ceremonies are commonly resorted to in other East Indian islands. Thus in Timor-laut, to mislead the demons who are causing sickness, a small proa, containing the image ofa man and provisioned for a long voyage, is allowed to drift away with wind and tide. As itis being launched, the people cry, “O sickness, go from here; turn back; what do you herein this poor land?” Three days after this ceremony a pig is killed, and part of the flesh isoffered to Dudilaa, who lives in the sun. One of the oldest men says, “Old sir, I beseech you"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"make well the grand-children, children, women, and men, that we may be able to eat porkand rice and to drink palmwine. I will keep my promise. Eat your share, and make all thepeople in the village well.” If the proa is stranded at any inhabited spot, the sickness willbreak out there. Hence a stranded proa excites much alarm amongst the coast population,and they immediately burn it, because demons fly from fire. In the island of Buru the proawhich carries away the demons of disease is about twenty feet long, rigged out with sails,oars, anchor, and so on, and well stocked with provisions. For a day and a night the peoplebeat gongs and drums, and rush about to frighten the demons. Next morning ten stalwartyoung men strike the people with branches, which have been previously dipped in anearthen pot of water. As soon as they have done so, they run down to the beach, put thebranches on board the proa, launch another boat in great haste, and tow the disease-burdened bark far out to sea. There they cast it off, and one of them calls out,“Grandfather Smallpox, go away—go willingly away—go visit another land; we have madeyou food ready for the voyage, we have now nothing more to give.” When they have landed,all the people bathe together in the sea. In this ceremony the reason for striking the peoplewith the branches is clearly to rid them of the disease-demons, which are then supposed tobe transferred to the branches. Hence the haste with which the branches are deposited inthe proa and towed away to sea. So in the inland districts of Ceram, when smallpox orother sickness is raging, the priest strikes all the houses with consecrated branches, whichare then thrown into the river, to be carried down to the sea; exactly as amongst theWotyaks of Russia the sticks which have been used for expelling the devils from the villageare thrown into the river, that the current may sweep the baleful burden away. The plan ofputting puppets in the boat to represent sick persons, in order to lure the demons afterthem, is not uncommon. For example, most of the pagan tribes on the coast of Borneo seekto drive away epidemic disease as follows. They carve one or more rough human imagesfrom the pith of the sago palm and place them on a small raft or boat or full-rigged Malayship together with rice and other food. The boat is decked with blossoms of the areca palmand with ribbons made from its leaves, and thus adorned the little craft is allowed to floatout to sea with the ebb-tide, bearing, as the people fondly think or hope, the sickness awaywith it.Often the vehicle which carries away the collected demons or ills of a whole community isan animal or scapegoat. In the Central Provinces of India, when cholera breaks out in avillage, every one retires after sunset to his house. The priests then parade the streets,taking from the roof of each house a straw, which is burnt with an offering of rice, ghee,and turmeric, at some shrine to the east of the village. Chickens daubed with vermilion aredriven away in the direction of the smoke, and are believed to carry the disease with them.If they fail, goats are tried, and last of all pigs. When cholera rages among the Bhars,Mallans, and Kurmis of India, they take a goat or a buffalo—in either case the animal mustbe a female, and as black as possible—then having tied some grain, cloves, and red lead ina yellow cloth on its back they turn it out of the village. The animal is conducted beyond theboundary and not allowed to return. Sometimes the buffalo is marked with a red pigmentand driven to the next village, where he carries the plague with him.Amongst the Dinkas, a pastoral people of the White Nile, each family possesses a sacredcow. When the country is threatened with war, famine, or any other public calamity, thechiefs of the village require a particular family to surrender their sacred cow to serve as a"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"scapegoat. The animal is driven by the women to the brink of the river and across it to theother bank, there to wander in the wilderness and fall a prey to ravening beasts. Then thewomen return in silence and without looking behind them; were they to cast a backwardglance, they imagine that the ceremony would have no effect. In 1857, when the AymaraIndians of Bolivia and Peru were suffering from a plague, they loaded a black llama withthe clothes of the plague-stricken people, sprinkled brandy on the clothes, and then turnedthe animal loose on the mountains, hoping that it would carry the pest away with it.Occasionally the scapegoat is a man. For example, from time to time the gods used to warnthe King of Uganda that his foes the Banyoro were working magic against him and hispeople to make them die of disease. To avert such a catastrophe the king would send ascapegoat to the frontier of Bunyoro, the land of the enemy. The scapegoat consisted ofeither a man and a boy or a woman and her child, chosen because of some mark or bodilydefect, which the gods had noted and by which the victims were to be recognised. With thehuman victims were sent a cow, a goat, a fowl, and a dog; and a strong guard escortedthem to the land which the god had indicated. There the limbs of the victims were brokenand they were left to die a lingering death in the enemy’s country, being too crippled tocrawl back to Uganda. The disease or plague was thought to have been thus transferred tothe victims and to have been conveyed back in their persons to the land from which itcame.Some of the aboriginal tribes of China, as a protection against pestilence, select a man ofgreat muscular strength to act the part of scapegoat. Having besmeared his face with paint,he performs many antics with the view of enticing all pestilential and noxious influences toattach themselves to him only. He is assisted by a priest. Finally the scapegoat, hotlypursued by men and women beating gongs and tom-toms, is driven with great haste out ofthe town or village. In the Punjaub a cure for the murrain is to hire a man of the Chamarcaste, turn his face away from the village, brand him with a red-hot sickle, and let him goout into the jungle taking the murrain with him. He must not look back.3. The Periodic Expulsion of Evils in a Material VehicleTHE MEDIATE expulsion of evils by means of a scapegoat or other material vehicle, likethe immediate expulsion of them in invisible form, tends to become periodic, and for a likereason. Thus every year, generally in March, the people of Leti, Moa, and Lakor, islands ofthe Indian Archipelago, send away all their diseases to sea. They make a proa about six feetlong, rig it with sails, oars, rudder, and other gear, and every family deposits in its somerice, fruit, a fowl, two eggs, insects that ravage the fields, and so on. Then they let it driftaway to sea, saying, “Take away from here all kinds of sickness, take them to other islands,to other lands, distribute them in places that lie eastward, where the sun rises.” The Biajasof Borneo annually send to sea a little bark laden with the sins and misfortunes of thepeople. The crew of any ship that falls in with the ill-omened bark at sea will suffer all thesorrows with which it is laden. A like custom is annually observed by the Dusuns of theTuaran district in British North Borneo. The ceremony is the most important of the wholeyear. Its aim is to bring good luck to the village during the ensuing year by solemnlyexpelling all the evil spirits that may have collected in or about the houses throughout thelast twelve months. The task of routing out the demons and banishing them devolves chieflyon women. Dressed in their finest array, they go in procession through the village. One of"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"them carries a small sucking pig in a basket on her back; and all of them bear wands, withwhich they belabour the little pig at the appropriate moment; its squeals help to attract thevagrant spirits. At every house the women dance and sing, clashing castanets or cymbals ofbrass and jingling bunches of little brass bells in both hands. When the performance hasbeen repeated at every house in the village, the procession defiles down to the river, and allthe evil spirits, which the performers have chased from the houses, follow them to the edgeof the water. There a raft has been made ready and moored to the bank. It containsofferings of food, cloth, cooking-pots, and swords; and the deck is crowded with figures ofmen, women, animals, and birds, all made out of the leaves of the sago palm. The evilspirits now embark on the raft, and when they are all aboard, it is pushed off and allowedto float down with the current, carrying the demons with it. Should the raft run agroundnear the village, it is shoved off with all speed, lest the invisible passengers should seize theopportunity of landing and returning to the village. Finally, the sufferings of the little pig,whose squeals served to decoy the demons from their lurking-places, are terminated bydeath, for it is killed and its carcase thrown away.Every year, at the beginning of the dry season, the Nicobar Islanders carry the model of aship through their villages. The devils are chased out of the huts, and driven on board thelittle ship, which is then launched and suffered to sail away with the wind. The ceremonyhas been described by a catechist, who witnessed it at Car Nicobar in July 1897. For threedays the people were busy preparing two very large floating cars, shaped like canoes, fittedwith sails, and loaded with certain leaves, which possessed the valuable property ofexpelling devils. While the young people were thus engaged, the exorcists and the elders satin a house singing songs by turns; but often they would come forth, pace the beach armedwith rods, and forbid the devil to enter the village. The fourth day of the solemnity bore aname which means “Expelling the Devil by Sails.” In the evening all the villagersassembled, the women bringing baskets of ashes and bunches of devil-expelling leaves.These leaves were then distributed to everybody, old and young. When all was ready, aband of robust men, attended by a guard of exorcists, carried one of the cars down to thesea on the right side of the village graveyard, and set it floating in the water. As soon asthey had returned, another band of men carried the other car to the beach and floated itsimilarly in the sea to the left of the graveyard. The demon-laden barks being nowlaunched, the women threw ashes from the shore, and the whole crowd shouted, saying,“Fly away, devil, fly away, never come again!” The wind and the tide being favourable, thecanoes sailed quickly away; and that night all the people feasted together with great joy,because the devil had departed in the direction of Chowra. A similar expulsion of devilstakes place once a year in other Nicobar villages; but the ceremonies are held at differenttimes in different places.Amongst many of the aboriginal tribes of China, a great festival is celebrated in the thirdmonth of every year. It is held by way of a general rejoicing over what the people believe tobe a total annihilation of the ills of the past twelve months. The destruction is supposed tobe effected in the following way. A large earthenware jar filled with gunpowder, stones,and bits of iron is buried in the earth. A train of gunpowder, communicating with the jar,is then laid; and a match being applied, the jar and its contents are blown up. The stonesand bits of iron represent the ills and disasters of the past year, and the dispersion of themby the explosion is believed to remove the ills and disasters themselves. The festival is"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"attended with much revelling and drunkenness.At Old Calabar on the coast of Guinea, the devils and ghosts are, or used to be, publiclyexpelled once in two years. Among the spirits thus driven from their haunts are the souls ofall the people who died since the last lustration of the town. About three weeks or a monthbefore the expulsion, which according to one account takes place in the month ofNovember, rude effigies representing men and animals, such as crocodiles, leopards,elephants, bullocks, and birds, are made of wicker-work or wood, and being hung withstrips of cloth and bedizened with gew-gaws, are set before the door of every house. Aboutthree o’clock in the morning of the day appointed for the ceremony the whole populationturns out into the streets, and proceeds with a deafening uproar and in a state of the wildestexcitement to drive all lurking devils and ghosts into the effigies, in order that they may bebanished with them from the abodes of men. For this purpose bands of people roamthrough the streets knocking on doors, firing guns, beating drums, blowing on horns,ringing bells, clattering pots and pans, shouting and hallooing with might and main, inshort making all the noise it is possible for them to raise. The hubbub goes on till theapproach of dawn, when it gradually subsides and ceases altogether at sunrise. By this timethe houses have been thoroughly swept, and all the frightened spirits are supposed to havehuddled into the effigies or their fluttering drapery. In these wicker figures are alsodeposited the sweepings of the houses and the ashes of yesterday’s fires. Then the demon-laden images are hastily snatched up, carried in tumultuous procession down to the brinkof the river, and thrown into the water to the tuck of drums. The ebb-tide bears them awayseaward, and thus the town is swept clean of ghosts and devils for another two years.Similar annual expulsions of embodied evils are not unknown in Europe. On the evening ofEaster Sunday the gypsies of Southern Europe take a wooden vessel like a band-box, whichrests cradle-wise on two cross pieces of wood. In this they place herbs and simples, togetherwith the dried carcase of a snake, or lizard, which every person present must first havetouched with his fingers. The vessel is then wrapt in white and red wool, carried by theoldest man from tent to tent, and finally thrown into running water, not, however, beforeevery member of the band has spat into it once, and the sorceress has uttered some spellsover it. They believe that by performing this ceremony they dispel all the illnesses thatwould otherwise have afflicted them in the course of the year; and that if any one finds thevessel and opens it out of curiosity, he and his will be visited by all the maladies which theothers have escaped.The scapegoat by means of which the accumulated ills of a whole year are publicly expelledis sometimes an animal. For example, among the Garos of Assam, “besides the sacrificesfor individual cases of illness, there are certain ceremonies which are observed once a yearby a whole community or village, and are intended to safeguard its members from dangersof the forest, and from sickness and mishap during the coming twelve months. Theprincipal of these is the Asongtata ceremony. Close to the outskirts of every big village anumber of stones may be noticed stuck into the ground, apparently without order ormethod. These are known by the name of asong, and on them is offered the sacrifice whichthe Asongtata demands. The sacrifice of a goat takes place, and a month later, that of alangur (Entellus monkey) or a bamboo-rat is considered necessary. The animal chosen hasa rope fastened round its neck and is led by two men, one on each side of it, to every house"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"in the village. It is taken inside each house in turn, the assembled villagers, meanwhile,beating the walls from the outside, to frighten and drive out any evil spirits which mayhave taken up their residence within. The round of the village having been made in thismanner, the monkey or rat is led to the outskirts of the village, killed by a blow of a dao,which disembowels it, and then crucified on bamboos set up in the ground. Round thecrucified animal long, sharp bamboo stakes are placed, which form chevaux de frise roundabout it. These commemorate the days when such defences surrounded the villages on allsides to keep off human enemies, and they are now a symbol to ward off sickness anddangers to life from the wild animals of the forest. The langur required for the purpose ishunted down some days before, but should it be found impossible to catch one, a brownmonkey may take its place; a hulock may not be used.” Here the crucified ape or rat is thepublic scapegoat, which by its vicarious sufferings and death relieves the people from allsickness and mishap in the coming year.Again, on one day of the year the Bhotiyas of Juhar, in the Western Himalayas, take a dog,intoxicate him with spirits and bhang or hemp, and having fed him with sweetmeats, leadhim round the village and let him loose. They then chase and kill him with sticks andstones, and believe that, when they have done so, no disease or misfortune will visit thevillage during the year. In some parts of Breadalbane it was formerly the custom on NewYear’s Day to take a dog to the door, give him a bit of bread, and drive him out, saying,“Get away, you dog! Whatever death of men or loss of cattle would happen in this house tothe end of the present year, may it all light on your head!” On the Day of Atonement, whichwas the tenth day of the seventh month, the Jewish high-priest laid both his hands on thehead of a live goat, confessed over it all the iniquities of the Children of Israel, and, havingthereby transferred the sins of the people to the beast, sent it away into the wilderness.The scapegoat upon whom the sins of the people are periodically laid, may also be a humanbeing. At Onitsha, on the Niger, two human beings used to be annually sacrificed to takeaway the sins of the land. The victims were purchased by public subscription. All personswho, during the past year, had fallen into gross sins, such as incendiarism, theft, adultery,witchcraft, and so forth, were expected to contribute 28 ngugas, or a little over £2. Themoney thus collected was taken into the interior of the country and expended in thepurchase of two sickly persons “to be offered as a sacrifice for all these abominablecrimes—one for the land and one for the river.” A man from a neighbouring town washired to put them to death. On the twenty-seventh of February 1858 the Rev. J. C. Taylorwitnessed the sacrifice of one of these victims. The sufferer was a woman, about nineteen ortwenty years of age. They dragged her alive along the ground, face downwards, from theking’s house to the river, a distance of two miles, the crowds who accompanied her crying,“Wickedness! wickedness!” The intention was “to take away the iniquities of the land. Thebody was dragged along in a merciless manner, as if the weight of all their wickedness wasthus carried away.” Similar customs are said to be still secretly practised every year bymany tribes in the delta of the Niger in spite of the vigilance of the British Government.Among the Yoruba negroes of West Africa “the human victim chosen for sacrifice, andwho may be either a freeborn or a slave, a person of noble or wealthy parentage, or one ofhumble birth, is, after he has been chosen and marked out for the purpose, called anOluwo. He is always well fed and nourished and supplied with whatever he should desireduring the period of his confinement. When the occasion arrives for him to be sacrificed"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"and offered up, he is commonly led about and paraded through the streets of the town orcity of the Sovereign who would sacrifice him for the well-being of his government and ofevery family and individual under it, in order that he might carry off the sin, guilt,misfortune and death of all without exception. Ashes and chalk would be employed to hidehis identity by the one being freely thrown over his head, and his face painted with thelatter, whilst individuals would often rush out of their houses to lay their hands upon himthat they might thus transfer to him their sin, guilt, trouble, and death.” This parade over,he is taken to an inner sanctuary and beheaded. His last words or dying groans are thesignal for an outburst of joy among the people assembled outside, who believe that thesacrifice has been accepted and the divine wrath appeased.In Siam it used to be the custom on one day of the year to single out a woman broken downby debauchery, and carry her on a litter through all the streets to the music of drums andhautboys. The mob insulted her and pelted her with dirt; and after having carried herthrough the whole city, they threw her on a dunghill or a hedge of thorns outside theramparts, forbidding her ever to enter the walls again. They believed that the woman thusdrew upon herself all the malign influences of the air and of evil spirits. The Bataks ofSumatra offer either a red horse or a buffalo as a public sacrifice to purify the land andobtain the favour of the gods. Formerly, it is said, a man was bound to the same stake asthe buffalo, and when they killed the animal, the man was driven away; no one mightreceive him, converse with him, or give him food. Doubtless he was supposed to carry awaythe sins and misfortunes of the people.Sometimes the scapegoat is a divine animal. The people of Malabar share the Hindooreverence for the cow, to kill and eat which “they esteem to be a crime as heinous ashomicide or wilful murder.” Nevertheless the “Bramans transfer the sins of the people intoone or more Cows, which are then carry’d away, both the Cows and the Sins wherewiththese Beasts are charged, to what place the Braman shall appoint.” When the ancientEgyptians sacrificed a bull, they invoked upon its head all the evils that might otherwisebefall themselves and the land of Egypt, and thereupon they either sold the bull’s head tothe Greeks or cast it into the river. Now, it cannot be said that in the times known to us theEgyptians worshipped bulls in general, for they seem to have commonly killed and eatenthem. But a good many circumstances point to the conclusion that originally all cattle, bullsas well as cows, were held sacred by the Egyptians. For not only were all cows esteemedholy by them and never sacrificed, but even bulls might not be sacrificed unless they hadcertain natural marks; a priest examined every bull before it was sacrificed; if it had theproper marks, he put his seal on the animal in token that it might be sacrificed; and if aman sacrificed a bull which had not been sealed, he was put to death. Moreover, theworship of the black bulls Apis and Mnevis, especially the former, played an importantpart in Egyptian religion; all bulls that died a natural death were carefully buried in thesuburbs of the cities, and their bones were afterwards collected from all parts of Egypt andinterred in a single spot; and at the sacrifice of a bull in the great rites of Isis all theworshippers beat their breasts and mourned. On the whole, then, we are perhaps entitledto infer that bulls were originally, as cows were always, esteemed sacred by the Egyptians,and that the slain bull upon whose head they laid the misfortunes of the people was once adivine scapegoat. It seems not improbable that the lamb annually slain by the Madis ofCentral Africa is a divine scapegoat, and the same supposition may partly explain the Zuni"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"sacrifice of the turtle.Lastly, the scapegoat may be a divine man. Thus, in November the Gonds of India worshipGhansyam Deo, the protector of the crops, and at the festival the god himself is said todescend on the head of one of the worshippers, who is suddenly seized with a kind of fitand, after staggering about, rushes off into the jungle, where it is believed that, if left tohimself, he would die mad. However, they bring him back, but he does not recover hissenses for one or two days. The people think that one man is thus singled out as a scapegoatfor the sins of the rest of the village. In the temple of the Moon the Albanians of the EasternCaucasus kept a number of sacred slaves, of whom many were inspired and prophesied.When one of these men exhibited more than usual symptoms of inspiration or insanity, andwandered solitary up and down the woods, like the Gond in the jungle, the high priest hadhim bound with a sacred chain and maintained him in luxury for a year. At the end of theyear he was anointed with unguents and led forth to be sacrificed. A man whose business itwas to slay these human victims and to whom practice had given dexterity, advanced fromthe crowd and thrust a sacred spear into the victim’s side, piercing his heart. From themanner in which the slain man fell, omens were drawn as to the welfare of thecommonwealth. Then the body was carried to a certain spot where all the people stoodupon it as a purificatory ceremony. This last circumstance clearly indicates that the sins ofthe people were transferred to the victim, just as the Jewish priest transferred the sins ofthe people to the scapegoat by laying his hands on the animal’s head; and since the manwas believed to be possessed by the divine spirit, we have here an undoubted example of aman-god slain to take away the sins and misfortunes of the people.In Tibet the ceremony of the scapegoat presents some remarkable features. The Tibetannew year begins with the new moon which appears about the fifteenth of February. Fortwenty-three days afterwards the government of Lhasa, the capital, is taken out of thehands of the ordinary rulers and entrusted to the monk of the Debang monastery whooffers to pay the highest sum for the privilege. The successful bidder is called the Jalno, andhe announces his accession to power in person, going through the streets of Lhasa with asilver stick in his hand. Monks from all the neighbouring monasteries and templesassemble to pay him homage. The Jalno exercises his authority in the most arbitrarymanner for his own benefit, as all the fines which he exacts are his by purchase. The profithe makes is about ten times the amount of the purchase money. His men go about thestreets in order to discover any conduct on the part of the inhabitants that can be foundfault with. Every house in Lhasa is taxed at this time, and the slightest offence is punishedwith unsparing rigour by fines. This severity of the Jalno drives all working classes out ofthe city till the twenty-three days are over. But if the laity go out, the clergy come in. All theBuddhist monasteries of the country for miles round about open their gates and disgorgetheir inmates. All the roads that lead down into Lhasa from the neighbouring mountainsare full of monks hurrying to the capital, some on foot, some on horseback, some ridingasses or lowing oxen, all carrying their prayer-books and culinary utensils. In suchmultitudes do they come that the streets and squares of the city are encumbered with theirswarms, and incarnadined with their red cloaks. The disorder and confusion areindescribable. Bands of the holy men traverse the streets chanting prayers, or uttering wildcries. They meet, they jostle, they quarrel, they fight; bloody noses, black eyes, and brokenheads are freely given and received. All day long, too, from before the peep of dawn till"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"after darkness has fallen, these red-cloaked monks hold services in the dim incense-ladenair of the great Machindranath temple, the cathedral of Lhasa; and thither they crowdthrice a day to receive their doles of tea and soup and money. The cathedral is a vastbuilding, standing in the centre of the city, and surrounded by bazaars and shops. The idolsin it are richly inlaid with gold and precious stones.Twenty-four days after the Jalno has ceased to have authority, he assumes it again, and forten days acts in the same arbitrary manner as before. On the first of the ten days thepriests again assemble at the cathedral, pray to the gods to prevent sickness and other evilsamong the people, “and, as a peace-offering, sacrifice one man. The man is not killedpurposely, but the ceremony he undergoes often proves fatal. Grain is thrown against hishead, and his face is painted half white, half black.” Thus grotesquely disguised, andcarrying a coat of skin on his arm, he is called the King of the Years, and sits daily in themarket-place, where he helps himself to whatever he likes and goes about shaking a blackyak’s tail over the people, who thus transfer their bad luck to him. On the tenth day, all thetroops in Lhasa march to the great temple and form in line before it. The King of the Yearsis brought forth from the temple and receives small donations from the assembledmultitude. He then ridicules the Jalno, saying to him, “What we perceive through the fivesenses is no illusion. All you teach is untrue,” and the like. The Jalno, who represents theGrand Lama for the time being, contests these heretical opinions; the dispute waxes warm,and at last both agree to decide the questions at issue by a cast of the dice, the Jalnooffering to change places with the scapegoat should the throw be against him. If the King ofthe Years wins, much evil is prognosticated; but if the Jalno wins, there is great rejoicing,for it proves that his adversary has been accepted by the gods as a victim to bear all thesins of the people of Lhasa. Fortune, however, always favours the Jalno, who throws sixeswith unvarying success, while his opponent turns up only ones. Nor is this so extraordinaryas at first sight it might appear; for the Jalno’s dice are marked with nothing but sixes andhis adversary’s with nothing but ones. When he sees the finger of Providence thus plainlypointed against him, the King of the Years is terrified and flees away upon a white horse,with a white dog, a white bird, salt, and so forth, which have all been provided for him bythe government. His face is still painted half white and half black, and he still wears hisleathern coat. The whole populace pursues him, hooting, yelling, and firing blank shots involleys after him. Thus driven out of the city, he is detained for seven days in the greatchamber of horrors at the Samyas monastery, surrounded by monstrous and terrificimages of devils and skins of huge serpents and wild beasts. Thence he goes away into themountains of Chetang, where he has to remain an outcast for several months or a year in anarrow den. If he dies before the time is out, the people say it is an auspicious omen; but ifhe survives, he may return to Lhasa and play the part of scapegoat over again the followingyear.This quaint ceremonial, still annually observed in the secluded capital of Buddhism—theRome of Asia—is interesting because it exhibits, in a clearly marked religious stratification,a series of divine redeemers themselves redeemed, of vicarious sacrifices vicariously atonedfor, of gods undergoing a process of fossilisation, who, while they retain the privileges, havedisburdened themselves of the pains and penalties of divinity. In the Jalno we may withoutundue straining discern a successor of those temporary kings, those mortal gods, whopurchase a short lease of power and glory at the price of their lives. That he is the"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"temporary substitute of the Grand Lama is certain; that he is, or was once, liable to act asscapegoat for the people is made nearly certain by his offer to change places with the realscapegoat—the King of the Years—if the arbitrament of the dice should go against him. Itis true that the conditions under which the question is now put to the hazard have reducedthe offer to an idle form. But such forms are no mere mushroom growths, springing up ofthemselves in a night. If they are now lifeless formalities, empty husks devoid ofsignificance, we may be sure that they once had a life and a meaning; if at the present daythey are blind alleys leading nowhere, we may be certain that in former days they werepaths that led somewhere, if only to death. That death was the goal to which of old theTibetan scapegoat passed after his brief period of licence in the market-place, is aconjecture that has much to commend it. Analogy suggests it; the blank shots fired afterhim, the statement that the ceremony often proves fatal, the belief that his death is a happyomen, all confirm it. We need not wonder then that the Jalno, after paying so dear to act asdeputy-deity for a few weeks, should have preferred to die by deputy rather than in hisown person when his time was up. The painful but necessary duty was accordingly laid onsome poor devil, some social outcast, some wretch with whom the world had gone hard,who readily agreed to throw away his life at the end of a few days if only he might have hisfling in the meantime. For observe that while the time allowed to the original deputy—theJalno—was measured by weeks, the time allowed to the deputy’s deputy was cut down todays, ten days according to one authority, seven days according to another. So short a ropewas doubtless thought a long enough tether for so black or sickly a sheep; so few sands inthe hour-glass, slipping so fast away, sufficed for one who had wasted so many preciousyears. Hence in the jack-pudding who now masquerades with motley countenance in themarket-place of Lhasa, sweeping up misfortune with a black yak’s tail, we may fairly seethe substitute of a substitute, the vicar of a vicar, the proxy on whose back the heavyburden was laid when it had been lifted from nobler shoulders. But the clue, if we havefollowed it aright, does not stop at the Jalno; it leads straight back to the pope of Lhasahimself, the Grand Lama, of whom the Jalno is merely the temporary vicar. The analogy ofmany customs in many lands points to the conclusion that, if this human divinity stoops toresign his ghostly power for a time into the hands of a substitute, it is, or rather was once,for no other reason than that the substitute might die in his stead. Thus through the mist ofages unillumined by the lamp of history, the tragic figure of the pope of Buddhism—God’svicar on earth for Asia—looms dim and sad as the man-god who bore his people’s sorrows,the Good Shepherd who laid down his life for the sheep.4. On Scapegoats in GeneralTHE FOREGOING survey of the custom of publicly expelling the accumulated evils of avillage or town or country suggests a few general observations.In the first place, it will not be disputed that what I have called the immediate and themediate expulsions of evil are identical in intention; in other words, that whether the evilsare conceived of as invisible or as embodied in a material form, is a circumstance entirelysubordinate to the main object of the ceremony, which is simply to effect a total clearanceof all the ills that have been infesting a people. If any link were wanting to connect the twokinds of expulsion, it would be furnished by such a practice as that of sending the evils"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"away in a litter or a boat. For here, on the one hand, the evils are invisible and intangible;and, on the other hand, there is a visible and tangible vehicle to convey them away. And ascapegoat is nothing more than such a vehicle.In the second place, when a general clearance of evils is resorted to periodically, theinterval between the celebrations of the ceremony is commonly a year, and the time of yearwhen the ceremony takes place usually coincides with some well-marked change of season,such as the beginning or end of winter in the arctic and temperate zones, and the beginningor end of the rainy season in the tropics. The increased mortality which such climaticchanges are apt to produce, especially amongst ill-fed, ill-clothed, and ill-housed savages, isset down by primitive man to the agency of demons, who must accordingly be expelled.Hence, in the tropical regions of New Britain and Peru, the devils are or were driven out atthe beginning of the rainy season; hence, on the dreary coasts of Baffin Land, they arebanished at the approach of the bitter Arctic winter. When a tribe has taken to husbandry,the time for the general expulsion of devils is naturally made to agree with one of the greatepochs of the agricultural year, as sowing, or harvest; but, as these epochs themselvesnaturally coincide with changes of season, it does not follow that the transition from thehunting or pastoral to the agricultural life involves any alteration in the time of celebratingthis great annual rite. Some of the agricultural communities of India and the HindooKoosh, as we have seen, hold their general clearance of demons at harvest, others atsowing-time. But, at whatever season of the year it is held, the general expulsion of devilscommonly marks the beginning of the new year. For, before entering on a new year, peopleare anxious to rid themselves of the troubles that have harassed them in the past; hence itcomes about that in so many communities the beginning of the new year is inauguratedwith a solemn and public banishment of evil spirits.In the third place, it is to be observed that this public and periodic expulsion of devils iscommonly preceded or followed by a period of general license, during which the ordinaryrestraints of society are thrown aside, and all offences, short of the gravest, are allowed topass unpunished. In Guinea and Tonquin the period of license precedes the publicexpulsion of demons; and the suspension of the ordinary government in Lhasa previous tothe expulsion of the scapegoat is perhaps a relic of a similar period of universal license.Amongst the Hos of India the period of license follows the expulsion of the devil. Amongstthe Iroquois it hardly appears whether it preceded or followed the banishment of evils. Inany case, the extraordinary relaxation of all ordinary rules of conduct on such occasions isdoubtless to be explained by the general clearance of evils which precedes or follows it. Onthe one hand, when a general riddance of evil and absolution from all sin is in immediateprospect, men are encouraged to give the rein to their passions, trusting that the comingceremony will wipe out the score which they are running up so fast. On the other hand,when the ceremony has just taken place, men’s minds are freed from the oppressive sense,under which they generally labour, of an atmosphere surcharged with devils; and in thefirst revulsion of joy they overleap the limits commonly imposed by custom and morality.When the ceremony takes place at harvest-time, the elation of feeling which it excites isfurther stimulated by the state of physical wellbeing produced by an abundant supply offood.Fourthly, the employment of a divine man or animal as a scapegoat is especially to be"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"noted; indeed, we are here directly concerned with the custom of banishing evils only in sofar as these evils are believed to be transferred to a god who is afterwards slain. It may besuspected that the custom of employing a divine man or animal as a public scapegoat ismuch more widely diffused than appears from the examples cited. For, as has already beenpointed out, the custom of killing a god dates from so early a period of human history thatin later ages, even when the custom continues to be practised, it is liable to bemisinterpreted. The divine character of the animal or man is forgotten, and he comes to beregarded merely as an ordinary victim. This is especially likely to be the case when it is adivine man who is killed. For when a nation becomes civilised, if it does not drop humansacrifices altogether, it at least selects as victims only such wretches as would be put todeath at any rate. Thus the killing of a god may sometimes come to be confounded with theexecution of a criminal.If we ask why a dying god should be chosen to take upon himself and carry away the sinsand sorrows of the people, it may be suggested that in the practice of using the divinity as ascapegoat we have a combination of two customs which were at one time distinct andindependent. On the one hand we have seen that it has been customary to kill the human oranimal god in order to save his divine life from being weakened by the inroads of age. Onthe other hand we have seen that it has been customary to have a general expulsion of evilsand sins once a year. Now, if it occurred to people to combine these two customs, the resultwould be the employment of the dying god as a scapegoat. He was killed, not originally totake away sin, but to save the divine life from the degeneracy of old age; but, since he hadto be killed at any rate, people may have thought that they might as well seize theopportunity to lay upon him the burden of their sufferings and sins, in order that he mightbear it away with him to the unknown world beyond the grave.The use of the divinity as a scapegoat clears up the ambiguity which, as we saw, appears tohang about the European folk-custom of “carrying out Death.” Grounds have been shownfor believing that in this ceremony the so-called Death was originally the spirit ofvegetation, who was annually slain in spring, in order that he might come to life again withall the vigour of youth. But, as I pointed out, there are certain features in the ceremonywhich are not explicable on this hypothesis alone. Such are the marks of joy with which theeffigy of Death is carried out to be buried or burnt, and the fear and abhorrence of itmanifested by the bearers. But these features become at once intelligible if we suppose thatthe Death was not merely the dying god of vegetation, but also a public scapegoat, uponwhom were laid all the evils that had afflicted the people during the past year. Joy on suchan occasion is natural and appropriate; and if the dying god appears to be the object ofthat fear and abhorrence which are properly due not to himself, but to the sins andmisfortunes with which he is laden, this arises merely from the difficulty of distinguishing,or at least of marking the distinction, between the bearer and the burden. When theburden is of a baleful character, the bearer of it will be feared and shunned just as much asif he were himself instinct with those dangerous properties of which, as it happens, he isonly the vehicle. Similarly we have seen that disease-laden and sin-laden boats are dreadedand shunned by East Indian peoples. Again, the view that in these popular customs theDeath is a scapegoat as well as a representative of the divine spirit of vegetation derivessome support from the circumstance that its expulsion is always celebrated in spring andchiefly by Slavonic peoples. For the Slavonic year began in spring; and thus, in one of its"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"aspects, the ceremony of “carrying out Death” would be an example of the widespreadcustom of expelling the accumulated evils of the old year before entering on a new one.LVIII. Human Scapegoats in Classical Antiquity1. The Human Scapegoat in Ancient RomeWE are now prepared to notice the use of the human scapegoat in classical antiquity. Everyyear on the fourteenth of March a man clad in skins was led in procession through thestreets of Rome, beaten with long white rods, and driven out of the city. He was calledMamurius Veturius, that is, “the old Mars,” and as the ceremony took place on the daypreceding the first full moon of the old Roman year (which began on the first of March),the skin-clad man must have represented the Mars of the past year, who was driven out atthe beginning of a new one. Now Mars was originally not a god of war but of vegetation.For it was to Mars that the Roman husbandman prayed for the prosperity of his corn andhis vines, his fruit-trees and his copses; it was to Mars that the priestly college of the ArvalBrothers, whose business it was to sacrifice for the growth of the crops, addressed theirpetitions almost exclusively; and it was to Mars, as we saw, that a horse was sacrificed inOctober to secure an abundant harvest. Moreover, it was to Mars, under his title of “Marsof the woods” (Mars Silvanus), that farmers offered sacrifice for the welfare of their cattle.We have already seen that cattle are commonly supposed to be under the special patronageof tree-gods. Once more, the consecration of the vernal month of March to Mars seems topoint him out as the deity of the sprouting vegetation. Thus the Roman custom of expellingthe old Mars at the beginning of the new year in spring is identical with the Slavoniccustom of “carrying out Death,” if the view here taken of the latter custom is correct. Thesimilarity of the Roman and Slavonic customs has been already remarked by scholars, whoappear, however, to have taken Mamurius Veturius and the corresponding figures in theSlavonic ceremonies to be representatives of the old year rather than of the old god ofvegetation. It is possible that ceremonies of this kind may have come to be thus interpretedin later times even by the people who practised them. But the personification of a period oftime is too abstract an idea to be primitive. However, in the Roman, as in the Slavonic,ceremony, the representative of the god appears to have been treated not only as a deity ofvegetation but also as a scapegoat. His expulsion implies this; for there is no reason why thegod of vegetation, as such, should be expelled the city. But it is otherwise if he is also ascapegoat; it then becomes necessary to drive him beyond the boundaries, that he maycarry his sorrowful burden away to other lands. And, in fact, Mamurius Veturius appearsto have been driven away to the land of the Oscans, the enemies of Rome.2. The Human Scapegoat in Ancient GreeceTHE ANCIENT Greeks were also familiar with the use of a human scapegoat. InPlutarch’s native town of Chaeronea a ceremony of this kind was performed by the chief"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"magistrate at the Town Hall, and by each householder at his own home. It was called the“expulsion of hunger.” A slave was beaten with rods of the agnus castus, and turned out ofdoors with the words, “Out with hunger, and in with wealth and health.” When Plutarchheld the office of chief magistrate of his native town he performed this ceremony at theTown Hall, and he has recorded the discussion to which the custom afterwards gave rise.But in civilised Greece the custom of the scapegoat took darker forms than the innocentrite over which the amiable and pious Plutarch presided. Whenever Marseilles, one of thebusiest and most brilliant of Greek colonies, was ravaged by a plague, a man of the poorerclasses used to offer himself as a scapegoat. For a whole year he was maintained at thepublic expense, being fed on choice and pure food. At the expiry of the year he was dressedin sacred garments, decked with holy branches, and led through the whole city, whileprayers were uttered that all the evils of the people might fall on his head. He was then castout of the city or stoned to death by the people outside of the walls. The Atheniansregularly maintained a number of degraded and useless beings at the public expense; andwhen any calamity, such as plague, drought, or famine, befell the city, they sacrificed twoof these outcast scapegoats. One of the victims was sacrificed for the men and the other forthe women. The former wore round his neck a string of black, the latter a string of whitefigs. Sometimes, it seems, the victim slain on behalf of the women was a woman. They wereled about the city and then sacrificed, apparently by being stoned to death outside the city.But such sacrifices were not confined to extraordinary occasions of public calamity; itappears that every year, at the festival of the Thargelia in May, two victims, one for themen and one for the women, were led out of Athens and stoned to death. The city ofAbdera in Thrace was publicly purified once a year, and one of the burghers, set apart forthe purpose, was stoned to death as a scapegoat or vicarious sacrifice for the life of all theothers; six days before his execution he was excommunicated, “in order that he alone mightbear the sins of all the people.”From the Lover’s Leap, a white bluff at the southern end of their island, the Leucadiansused annually to hurl a criminal into the sea as a scapegoat. But to lighten his fall theyfastened live birds and feathers to him, and a flotilla of small boats waited below to catchhim and convey him beyond the boundary. Probably these humane precautions were amitigation of an earlier custom of flinging the scapegoat into the sea to drown. TheLeucadian ceremony took place at the time of a sacrifice to Apollo, who had a temple orsanctuary on the spot. Elsewhere it was customary to cast a young man every year into thesea, with the prayer, “Be thou our offscouring.” This ceremony was supposed to rid thepeople of the evils by which they were beset, or according to a somewhat differentinterpretation it redeemed them by paying the debt they owed to the sea-god. As practisedby the Greeks of Asia Minor in the sixth century before our era, the custom of thescapegoat was as follows. When a city suffered from plague, famine, or other publiccalamity, an ugly or deformed person was chosen to take upon himself all the evils whichafflicted the community. He was brought to a suitable place, where dried figs, a barley loaf,and cheese were put into his hand. These he ate. Then he was beaten seven times upon hisgenital organs with squills and branches of the wild fig and other wild trees, while the flutesplayed a particular tune. Afterwards he was burned on a pyre built of the wood of foresttrees; and his ashes were cast into the sea. A similar custom appears to have been annuallycelebrated by the Asiatic Greeks at the harvest festival of the Thargelia."},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"In the ritual just described the scourging of the victim with squills, branches of the wild fig,and so forth, cannot have been intended to aggravate his sufferings, otherwise any stickwould have been good enough to beat him with. The true meaning of this part of theceremony has been explained by W. Mannhardt. He points out that the ancients attributedto squills a magical power of averting evil influences, and that accordingly they hung themup at the doors of their houses and made use of them in purificatory rites. Hence theArcadian custom of whipping the image of Pan with squills at a festival, or whenever thehunters returned empty-handed, must have been meant, not to punish the god, but topurify him from the harmful influences which were impeding him in the exercise of hisdivine functions as a god who should supply the hunter with game. Similarly the object ofbeating the human scapegoat on the genital organs with squills and so on, must have beento release his reproductive energies from any restraint or spell under which they might belaid by demoniacal or other malignant agency; and as the Thargelia at which he wasannually sacrificed was an early harvest festival celebrated in May, we must recognise inhim a representative of the creative and fertilising god of vegetation. The representative ofthe god was annually slain for the purpose I have indicated, that of maintaining the divinelife in perpetual vigour, untainted by the weakness of age; and before he was put to death itwas not unnatural to stimulate his reproductive powers in order that these might betransmitted in full activity to his successor, the new god or new embodiment of the old god,who was doubtless supposed immediately to take the place of the one slain. Similarreasoning would lead to a similar treatment of the scapegoat on special occasions, such asdrought or famine. If the crops did not answer to the expectation of the husbandman, thiswould be attributed to some failure in the generative powers of the god whose function itwas to produce the fruits of the earth. It might be thought that he was under a spell or wasgrowing old and feeble. Accordingly he was slain in the person of his representative, withall the ceremonies already described, in order that, born young again, he might infuse hisown youthful vigour into the stagnant energies of nature. On the same principle we canunderstand why Mamurius Veturius was beaten with rods, why the slave at theChaeronean ceremony was beaten with the agnus castus (a tree to which magical propertieswere ascribed), why the effigy of Death in some parts of Europe is assailed with sticks andstones, and why at Babylon the criminal who played the god scourged before he wascrucified. The purpose of the scourging was not to intensify the agony of the divinesufferer, but on the contrary to dispel any malignant influences by which at the suprememoment he might conceivably be beset.Thus far I have assumed that the human victims at the Thargelia represented the spirits ofvegetation in general, but it has been well remarked by Mr. W. R. Paton that these poorwretches seem to have masqueraded as the spirits of fig-trees in particular. He points outthat the process of caprification, as it is called, that is, the artificial fertilisation of thecultivated fig-trees by hanging strings of wild figs among the boughs, takes place in Greeceand Asia Minor in June about a month after the date of the Thargelia, and he suggests thatthe hanging of the black and white figs round the necks of the two human victims, one ofwhom represented the men and the other the women, may have been a direct imitation ofthe process of caprification designed, on the principle of imitative magic, to assist thefertilisation of the fig-trees. And since caprification is in fact a marriage of the male fig-treewith the female fig-tree, Mr. Paton further supposes that the loves of the trees may, on thesame principle of imitative magic, have been simulated by a mock or even a real marriage"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"between the two human victims, one of whom appears sometimes to have been a woman.On this view the practice of beating the human victims on their genitals with branches ofwild fig-trees and with squills was a charm intended to stimulate the generative powers ofthe man and woman who for the time being personated the male and the female fig-treesrespectively, and who by their union in marriage, whether real or pretended, were believedto help the trees to bear fruit.The interpretation which I have adopted of the custom of beating the human scapegoatwith certain plants is supported by many analogies. Thus among the Kai of German NewGuinea, when a man wishes to make his banana shoots bear fruit quickly, he beats themwith a stick cut from a banana-tree which has already borne fruit. Here it is obvious thatfruitfulness is believed to inhere in a stick cut from a fruitful tree and to be imparted bycontact to the young banana plants. Similarly in New Caledonia a man will beat his taroplants lightly with a branch, saying as he does so, “I beat this taro that it may grow,” afterwhich he plants the branch in the ground at the end of the field. Among the Indians ofBrazil at the mouth of the Amazon, when a man wishes to increase the size of his generativeorgan, he strikes it with the fruit of a white aquatic plant called aninga, which growsluxuriantly on the banks of the river. The fruit, which is inedible, resembles a banana, andis clearly chosen for this purpose on account of its shape. The ceremony should beperformed three days before or after the new moon. In the county of Bekes, in Hungary,barren women are fertilised by being struck with a stick which has first been used toseparate pairing dogs. Here a fertilising virtue is clearly supposed to be inherent in thestick and to be conveyed by contact to the women. The Toradjas of Central Celebes thinkthat the plant Dracaena terminalis has a strong soul, because when it is lopped, it soongrows up again. Hence when a man is ill, his friends will sometimes beat him on the crownof the head with Dracaena leaves in order to strengthen his weak soul with the strong soulof the plant.These analogies, accordingly, support the interpretation which, following my predecessorsW. Mannhardt and Mr. W. R. Paton, I have given of the beating inflicted on the humanvictims at the Greek harvest festival of the Thargelia. That beating, being administered tothe generative organs of the victims by fresh green plants and branches, is most naturallyexplained as a charm to increase the reproductive energies of the men or women either bycommunicating to them the fruitfulness of the plants and branches, or by ridding them ofthe maleficent influences; and this interpretation is confirmed by the observation that thetwo victims represented the two sexes, one of them standing for the men in general and theother for the women. The season of the year when the ceremony was performed, namelythe time of the corn harvest, tallies well with the theory that the rite had an agriculturalsignificance. Further, that it was above all intended to fertilise the fig-trees is stronglysuggested by the strings of black and white figs which were hung round the necks of thevictims, as well as by the blows which were given their genital organs with the branches ofa wild fig-tree; since this procedure closely resembles the procedure which ancient andmodern husbandmen in Greek lands have regularly resorted to for the purpose of actuallyfertilising their fig-trees. When we remember what an important part the artificialfertilisation of the date palm-tree appears to have played of old not only in the husbandrybut in the religion of Mesopotamia, there seems no reason to doubt that the artificialfertilisation of the fig-tree may in like manner have vindicated for itself a place in the"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"solemn ritual of Greek religion.If these considerations are just, we must apparently conclude that while the human victimsat the Thargelia certainly appear in later classical times to have figured chiefly as publicscapegoats, who carried away with them the sins, misfortunes, and sorrows of the wholepeople, at an earlier time they may have been looked on as embodiments of vegetation,perhaps of the corn but particularly of the fig-trees; and that the beating which theyreceived and the death which they died were intended primarily to brace and refresh thepowers of vegetation then beginning to droop and languish under the torrid heat of theGreek summer.The view here taken of the Greek scapegoat, if it is correct, obviates an objection whichmight otherwise be brought against the main argument of this book. To the theory that thepriest of Aricia was slain as a representative of the spirit of the grove, it might have beenobjected that such a custom has no analogy in classical antiquity. But reasons have nowbeen given for believing that the human being periodically and occasionally slain by theAsiatic Greeks was regularly treated as an embodiment of a divinity of vegetation.Probably the persons whom the Athenians kept to be sacrificed were similarly treated asdivine. That they were social outcasts did not matter. On the primitive view a man is notchosen to be the mouth-piece or embodiment of a god on account of his high moral qualitiesor social rank. The divine afflatus descends equally on the good and the bad, the lofty andthe lowly. If then the civilised Greeks of Asia and Athens habitually sacrificed men whomthey regarded as incarnate gods, there can be no inherent improbability in the suppositionthat at the dawn of history a similar custom was observed by the semibarbarous Latins inthe Arician Grove.But to clinch the argument, it is clearly desirable to prove that the custom of putting todeath a human representative of a god was known and practised in ancient Italy elsewherethan in the Arician Grove. This proof I now propose to adduce.3. The Roman SaturnaliaWE have seen that many peoples have been used to observe an annual period of license,when the customary restraints of law and morality are thrown aside, when the wholepopulation give themselves up to extravagant mirth and jollity, and when the darkerpassions find a vent which would never be allowed them in the more staid and sober courseof ordinary life. Such outbursts of the pent-up forces of human nature, too oftendegenerating into wild orgies of lust and crime, occur most commonly at the end of theyear, and are frequently associated, as I have had occasion to point out, with one or otherof the agricultural seasons, especially with the time of sowing or of harvest. Now, of allthese periods of license the one which is best known and which in modern language hasgiven its name to the rest, is the Saturnalia. This famous festival fell in December, the lastmonth of the Roman year, and was popularly supposed to commemorate the merry reignof Saturn, the god of sowing and of husbandry, who lived on earth long ago as a righteousand beneficent king of Italy, drew the rude and scattered dwellers on the mountainstogether, taught them to till the ground, gave them laws, and ruled in peace. His reign was"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"the fabled Golden Age: the earth brought forth abundantly: no sound of war or discordtroubled the happy world: no baleful love of lucre worked like poison in the blood of theindustrious and contented peasantry. Slavery and private property were alike unknown:all men had all things in common. At last the good god, the kindly king, vanished suddenly;but his memory was cherished to distant ages, shrines were reared in his honour, and manyhills and high places in Italy bore his name. Yet the bright tradition of his reign wascrossed by a dark shadow: his altars are said to have been stained with the blood of humanvictims, for whom a more merciful age afterwards substituted effigies. Of this gloomy sideof the god’s religion there is little or no trace in the descriptions which ancient writers haveleft us of the Saturnalia. Feasting and revelry and all the mad pursuit of pleasure are thefeatures that seem to have especially marked this carnival of antiquity, as it went on forseven days in the streets and public squares and houses of ancient Rome from theseventeenth to the twenty-third of December.But no feature of the festival is more remarkable, nothing in it seems to have struck theancients themselves more than the license granted to slaves at this time. The distinctionbetween the free and the servile classes was temporarily abolished. The slave might rail athis master, intoxicate himself like his betters, sit down at table with them, and not even aword of reproof would be administered to him for conduct which at any other season mighthave been punished with stripes, imprisonment, or death. Nay, more, masters actuallychanged places with their slaves and waited on them at table; and not till the serf had doneeating and drinking was the board cleared and dinner set for his master. So far was thisinversion of ranks carried, that each household became for a time a mimic republic inwhich the high offices of state were discharged by the slaves, who gave their orders and laiddown the law as if they were indeed invested with all the dignity of the consulship, thepraetorship, and the bench. Like the pale reflection of power thus accorded to bondsmen atthe Saturnalia was the mock kingship for which freemen cast lots at the same season. Theperson on whom the lot fell enjoyed the title of king, and issued commands of a playful andludicrous nature to his temporary subjects. One of them he might order to mix the wine,another to drink, another to sing, another to dance, another to speak in his own dispraise,another to carry a flute-girl on his back round the house.Now, when we remember that the liberty allowed to slaves at this festive season wassupposed to be an imitation of the state of society in Saturn’s time, and that in general theSaturnalia passed for nothing more or less than a temporary revival or restoration of thereign of that merry monarch, we are tempted to surmise that the mock king who presidedover the revels may have originally represented Saturn himself. The conjecture is stronglyconfirmed, if not established, by a very curious and interesting account of the way in whichthe Saturnalia was celebrated by the Roman soldiers stationed on the Danube in the reignof Maximian and Diocletian. The account is preserved in a narrative of the martyrdom ofSt. Dasius, which was unearthed from a Greek manuscript in the Paris library, andpublished by Professor Franz Cumont of Ghent. Two briefer descriptions of the event andof the custom are contained in manuscripts at Milan and Berlin; one of them had alreadyseen the light in an obscure volume printed at Urbino in 1727, but its importance for thehistory of the Roman religion, both ancient and modern, appears to have been overlookeduntil Professor Cumont drew the attention of scholars to all three narratives by publishingthem together some years ago. According to these narratives, which have all the"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"appearance of being authentic, and of which the longest is probably based on officialdocuments, the Roman soldiers at Durostorum in Lower Moesia celebrated the Saturnaliayear by year in the following manner. Thirty days before the festival they chose by lot fromamongst themselves a young and handsome man, who was then clothed in royal attire toresemble Saturn. Thus arrayed and attended by a multitude of soldiers he went about inpublic with full license to indulge his passions and to taste of every pleasure, however baseand shameful. But if his reign was merry, it was short and ended tragically; for when thethirty days were up and the festival of Saturn had come, he cut his own throat on the altarof the god whom he personated. In the year A.D. 303 the lot fell upon the Christian soldierDasius, but he refused to play the part of the heathen god and soil his last days bydebauchery. The threats and arguments of his commanding officer Bassus failed to shakehis constancy, and accordingly he was beheaded, as the Christian martyrologist recordswith minute accuracy, at Durostorum by the soldier John on Friday the twentieth day ofNovember, being the twenty-fourth day of the moon, at the fourth hour.Since this narrative was published by Professor Cumont, its historical character, which hadbeen doubted or denied, has received strong confirmation from an interesting discovery. Inthe crypt of the cathedral which crowns the promontory of Ancona there is preserved,among other remarkable antiquities, a white marble sarcophagus bearing a Greekinscription, in characters of the age of Justinian, to the following effect: “Here lies the holymartyr Dasius, brought from Durostorum.” The sarcophagus was transferred to the cryptof the cathedral in 1848 from the church of San Pellegrino, under the high altar of which,as we learn from a Latin inscription let into the masonry, the martyr’s bones still reposewith those of two other saints. How long the sarcophagus was deposited in the church ofSan Pellegrino, we do not know; but it is recorded to have been there in the year 1650. Wemay suppose that the saint’s relics were transferred for safety to Ancona at some time inthe troubled centuries which followed his martyrdom, when Moesia was occupied andravaged by successive hordes of barbarian invaders. At all events it appears certain fromthe independent and mutually confirmatory evidence of the martyrology and themonuments that Dasius was no mythical saint, but a real man, who suffered death for hisfaith at Durostorum in one of the early centuries of the Christian era. Finding the narrativeof the nameless martyrologist thus established as to the principal fact recorded, namely, themartyrdom of St. Dasius, we may reasonably accept his testimony as to the manner andcause of the martyrdom, all the more because his narrative is precise, circumstantial, andentirely free from the miraculous element. Accordingly I conclude that the account whichhe gives of the celebration of the Saturnalia among the Roman soldiers is trustworthy.This account sets in a new and lurid light the office of the King of the Saturnalia, theancient Lord of Misrule, who presided over the winter revels at Rome in the time of Horaceand Tacitus. It seems to prove that his business had not always been that of a mereharlequin or merry-andrew whose only care was that the revelry should run high and thefun grow fast and furious, while the fire blazed and crackled on the hearth, while thestreets swarmed with festive crowds, and through the clear frosty air, far away to thenorth, Soracte showed his coronal of snow. When we compare this comic monarch of thegay, the civilised metropolis with his grim counterpart of the rude camp on the Danube,and when we remember the long array of similar figures, ludicrous yet tragic, who in otherages and in other lands, wearing mock crowns and wrapped in sceptred palls, have played"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"their little pranks for a few brief hours or days, then passed before their time to a violentdeath, we can hardly doubt that in the King of the Saturnalia at Rome, as he is depicted byclassical writers, we see only a feeble emasculated copy of that original, whose strongfeatures have been fortunately preserved for us by the obscure author of the Martyrdom ofSt. Dasius. In other words, the martyrologist’s account of the Saturnalia agrees so closelywith the accounts of similar rites elsewhere which could not possibly have been known tohim, that the substantial accuracy of his description may be regarded as established; andfurther, since the custom of putting a mock king to death as a representative of a godcannot have grown out of a practice of appointing him to preside over a holiday revel,whereas the reverse may very well have happened, we are justified in assuming that in anearlier and more barbarous age it was the universal practice in ancient Italy, wherever theworship of Saturn prevailed, to choose a man who played the part and enjoyed all thetraditionary privileges of Saturn for a season, and then died, whether by his own oranother’s hand, whether by the knife or the fire or on the gallows-tree, in the character ofthe good god who gave his life for the world. In Rome itself and other great towns thegrowth of civilisation had probably mitigated this cruel custom long before the Augustanage, and transformed it into the innocent shape it wears in the writings of the few classicalwriters who bestow a passing notice on the holiday King of the Saturnalia. But in remoterdistricts the older and sterner practice may long have survived; and even if after theunification of Italy the barbarous usage was suppressed by the Roman government, thememory of it would be handed down by the peasants and would tend from time to time, asstill happens with the lowest forms of superstition among ourselves, to lead to arecrudescence of the practice, especially among the rude soldiery on the outskirts of theempire over whom the once iron hand of Rome was beginning to relax its grasp.The resemblance between the Saturnalia of ancient and the Carnival of modern Italy hasoften been remarked; but in the light of all the facts that have come before us, we may wellask whether the resemblance does not amount to identity. We have seen that in Italy,Spain, and France, that is, in the countries where the influence of Rome has been deepestand most lasting, a conspicuous feature of the Carnival is a burlesque figure personifyingthe festive season, which after a short career of glory and dissipation is publicly shot, burnt,or otherwise destroyed, to the feigned grief or genuine delight of the populace. If the viewhere suggested of the Carnival is correct, this grotesque personage is no other than a directsuccessor of the old King of the Saturnalia, the master of the revels, the real man whopersonated Saturn and, when the revels were over, suffered a real death in his assumedcharacter. The King of the Bean on Twelfth Night and the mediaeval Bishop of Fools,Abbot of Unreason, or Lord of Misrule are figures of the same sort and may perhaps havehad a similar origin. Whether that was so or not, we may conclude with a fair degree ofprobability that if the King of the Wood at Aricia lived and died as an incarnation of asylvan deity, he had of old a parallel at Rome in the men who, year by year, were slain inthe character of King Saturn, the god of the sown and sprouting seed.LIX. Killing the God in MexicoBY NO PEOPLE does the custom of sacrificing the human representative of a god appear"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"to have been observed so commonly and with so much solemnity as by the Aztecs of ancientMexico. With the ritual of these remarkable sacrifices we are well acquainted, for it hasbeen fully described by the Spaniards who conquered Mexico in the sixteenth century, andwhose curiosity was naturally excited by the discovery in this distant region of a barbarousand cruel religion which presented many curious points of analogy to the doctrine andritual of their own church. “They took a captive,” says the Jesuit Acosta, “such as theythought good; and afore they did sacrifice him unto their idols, they gave him the name ofthe idol, to whom he should be sacrificed, and apparelled him with the same ornaments liketheir idol, saying, that he did represent the same idol. And during the time that thisrepresentation lasted, which was for a year in some feasts, in others six months, and inothers less, they reverenced and worshipped him in the same manner as the proper idol;and in the meantime he did eat, drink, and was merry. When he went through the streets,the people came forth to worship him, and every one brought him an alms, with childrenand sick folks, that he might cure them, and bless them, suffering him to do all things at hispleasure, only he was accompanied with ten or twelve men lest he should fly. And he (to theend he might be reverenced as he passed) sometimes sounded upon a small flute, that thepeople might prepare to worship him. The feast being come, and he grown fat, they killedhim, opened him, and ate him, making a solemn sacrifice of him.”This general description of the custom may now be illustrated by particular examples.Thus at the festival called Toxcatl, the greatest festival of the Mexican year, a young manwas annually sacrificed in the character of Tezcatlipoca, “the god of gods,” after havingbeen maintained and worshipped as that great deity in person for a whole year. Accordingto the old Franciscan monk Sahagun, our best authority on the Aztec religion, the sacrificeof the human god fell at Easter or a few days later, so that, if he is right, it wouldcorrespond in date as well as in character to the Christian festival of the death andresurrection of the Redeemer. More exactly he tells us that the sacrifice took place on thefirst day of the fifth Aztec month, which according to him began on the twenty-third ortwenty-seventh day of April.At this festival the great god died in the person of one human representative and came tolife again in the person of another, who was destined to enjoy the fatal honour of divinityfor a year and to perish, like all his predecessors, at the end of it. The young man singledout for this high dignity was carefully chosen from among the captives on the ground of hispersonal beauty. He had to be of unblemished body, slim as a reed and straight as a pillar,neither too tall nor too short. If through high living he grew too fat, he was obliged toreduce himself by drinking salt water. And in order that he might behave in his loftystation with becoming grace and dignity he was carefully trained to comport himself like agentleman of the first quality, to speak correctly and elegantly, to play the flute, to smokecigars and to snuff at flowers with a dandified air. He was honourably lodged in the temple,where the nobles waited on him and paid him homage, bringing him meat and serving himlike a prince. The king himself saw to it that he was apparelled in gorgeous attire, “foralready he esteemed him as a god.” Eagle down was gummed to his head and white cock’sfeathers were stuck in his hair, which drooped to his girdle. A wreath of flowers likeroasted maize crowned his brows, and a garland of the same flowers passed over hisshoulders and under his armpits. Golden ornaments hung from his nose, golden armletsadorned his arms, golden bells jingled on his legs at every step he took; earrings of"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"turquoise dangled from his ears, bracelets of turquoise bedecked his wrists; necklaces ofshells encircled his neck and depended on his breast; he wore a mantle of network, andround his middle a rich waistcloth. When this bejewelled exquisite lounged through thestreets playing on his flute, puffing at a cigar, and smelling at a nosegay, the people whomhe met threw themselves on the earth before him and prayed to him with sighs and tears,taking up the dust in their hands and putting it in their mouths in token of the deepesthumiliation and subjection. Women came forth with children in their arms and presentedthem to him, saluting him as a god. For “he passed for our Lord God; the peopleacknowledged him as the Lord.” All who thus worshipped him on his passage he salutedgravely and courteously. Lest he should flee, he was everywhere attended by a guard ofeight pages in the royal livery, four of them with shaven crowns like the palace-slaves, andfour of them with the flowing locks of warriors; and if he contrived to escape, the captain ofthe guard had to take his place as the representative of the god and to die in his stead.Twenty days before he was to die, his costume was changed, and four damsels delicatelynurtured and bearing the names of four goddesses—the Goddess of Flowers, the Goddessof the Young Maize, the Goddess “Our Mother among the Water,” and the Goddess ofSalt—were given him to be his brides, and with them he consorted. During the last fivedays divine honours were showered on the destined victim. The king remained in his palacewhile the whole court went after the human god. Solemn banquets and dances followedeach other in regular succession and at appointed places. On the last day the young man,attended by his wives and pages, embarked in a canoe covered with a royal canopy and wasferried across the lake to a spot where a little hill rose from the edge of the water. It wascalled the Mountain of Parting, because there his wives bade him a last farewell. Then,accompanied only by his pages, he repaired to a small and lonely temple by the wayside.Like the Mexican temples in general, it was built in the form of a pyramid; and as theyoung man ascended the stairs he broke at every step one of the flutes on which he hadplayed in the days of his glory. On reaching the summit he was seized and held down by thepriests on his back upon a block of stone, while one of them cut open his breast, thrust hishand into the wound, and wrenching out his heart held it up in sacrifice to the sun. Thebody of the dead god was not, like the bodies of common victims, sent rolling down thesteps of the temple, but was carried down to the foot, where the head was cut off andspitted on a pike. Such was the regular end of the man who personated the greatest god ofthe Mexican pantheon.The honour of living for a short time in the character of a god and dying a violent death inthe same capacity was not restricted to men in Mexico; women were allowed, or rathercompelled, to enjoy the glory and to share the doom as representatives of goddesses. Thusat a great festival in September, which was preceded by a strict fast of seven days, theysanctified a young slave girl of twelve or thirteen years, the prettiest they could find, torepresent the Maize Goddess Chicomecohuatl. They invested her with the ornaments of thegoddess, putting a mitre on her head and maize-cobs round her neck and in her hands, andfastening a green feather upright on the crown of her head to imitate an ear of maize. Thisthey did, we are told, in order to signify that the maize was almost ripe at the time of thefestival, but because it was still tender they chose a girl of tender years to play the part ofthe Maize Goddess. The whole long day they led the poor child in all her finery, with thegreen plume nodding on her head, from house to house dancing merrily to cheer peopleafter the dulness and privations of the fast."},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"In the evening all the people assembled at the temple, the courts of which they lit up by amultitude of lanterns and candles. There they passed the night without sleeping, and atmidnight, while the trumpets, flutes, and horns discoursed solemn music, a portableframework or palanquin was brought forth, bedecked with festoons of maize-cobs andpeppers and filled with seeds of all sorts. This the bearers set down at the door of thechamber in which the wooden image of the goddess stood. Now the chamber was adornedand wreathed, both outside and inside, with wreaths of maize-cobs, peppers, pumpkins,roses, and seeds of every kind, a wonder to behold; the whole floor was covered deep withthese verdant offerings of the pious. When the music ceased, a solemn procession cameforth of priests and dignitaries, with flaring lights and smoking censers, leading in theirmidst the girl who played the part of the goddess. Then they made her mount theframework, where she stood upright on the maize and peppers and pumpkins with which itwas strewed, her hands resting on two bannisters to keep her from falling. Then the priestsswung the smoking censers round her; the music struck up again, and while it played, agreat dignitary of the temple suddenly stepped up to her with a razor in his hand andadroitly shore off the green feather she wore on her head, together with the hair in which itwas fastened, snipping the lock off by the root. The feather and the hair he then presentedto the wooden image of the goddess with great solemnity and elaborate ceremonies,weeping and giving her thanks for the fruits of the earth and the abundant crops which shehad bestowed on the people that year; and as he wept and prayed, all the people, standingin the courts of the temple, wept and prayed with him. When that ceremony was over, thegirl descended from the framework and was escorted to the place where she was to spendthe rest of the night. But all the people kept watch in the courts of the temple by the light oftorches till break of day.The morning being come, and the courts of the temple being still crowded by the multitude,who would have deemed it sacrilege to quit the precincts, the priests again brought forththe damsel attired in the costume of the goddess, with the mitre on her head and the cobs ofmaize about her neck. Again she mounted the portable framework or palanquin and stoodon it, supporting herself by her hands on the bannisters. Then the elders of the templelifted it on their shoulders, and while some swung burning censers and others played oninstruments or sang, they carried it in procession through the great courtyard to the hall ofthe god Huitzilopochtli and then back to the chamber, where stood the wooden image of theMaize Goddess, whom the girl personated. There they caused the damsel to descend fromthe palanquin and to stand on the heaps of corn and vegetables that had been spread inprofusion on the floor of the sacred chamber. While she stood there all the elders andnobles came in a line, one behind the other, carrying saucers full of dry and clotted bloodwhich they had drawn from their ears by way of penance during the seven days’ fast. Oneby one they squatted on their haunches before her, which was the equivalent of falling ontheir knees with us, and scraping the crust of blood from the saucer cast it down before heras an offering in return for the benefits which she, as the embodiment of the MaizeGoddess, had conferred upon them. When the men had thus humbly offered their blood tothe human representative of the goddess, the women, forming a long line, did so likewise,each of them dropping on her hams before the girl and scraping her blood from the saucer.The ceremony lasted a long time, for great and small, young and old, all without exceptionhad to pass before the incarnate deity and make their offering. When it was over, thepeople returned home with glad hearts to feast on flesh and viands of every sort as merrily,"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"we are told, as good Christians at Easter partake of meat and other carnal mercies afterthe long abstinence of Lent. And when they had eaten and drunk their fill and rested afterthe night watch, they returned quite refreshed to the temple to see the end of the festival.And the end of the festival was this. The multitude being assembled, the priests solemnlyincensed the girl who personated the goddess; then they threw her on her back on the heapof corn and seeds, cut off her head, caught the gushing blood in a tub, and sprinkled theblood on the wooden image of the goddess, the walls of the chamber, and the offerings ofcorn, peppers, pumpkins, seeds, and vegetables which cumbered the floor. After that theyflayed the headless trunk, and one of the priests made shift to squeeze himself into thebloody skin. Having done so they clad him in all the robes which the girl had worn; theyput the mitre on his head, the necklace of golden maize-cobs about his neck, the maize-cobsof feathers and gold in his hands; and thus arrayed they led him forth in public, all of themdancing to the tuck of drum, while he acted as fugleman, skipping and posturing at thehead of the procession as briskly as he could be expected to do, incommoded as he was bythe tight and clammy skin of the girl and by her clothes, which must have been much toosmall for a grown man.In the foregoing custom the identification of the young girl with the Maize Goddess appearsto be complete. The golden maize-cobs which she wore round her neck, the artificial maize-cobs which she carried in her hands, the green feather which was stuck in her hair inimitation (we are told) of a green ear of maize, all set her forth as a personification of thecorn-spirit; and we are expressly informed that she was specially chosen as a young girl torepresent the young maize, which at the time of the festival had not yet fully ripened.Further, her identification with the corn and the corn-goddess was clearly announced bymaking her stand on the heaps of maize and there receive the homage and blood-offeringsof the whole people, who thereby returned her thanks for the benefits which in hercharacter of a divinity she was supposed to have conferred upon them. Once more, thepractice of beheading her on a heap of corn and seeds and sprinkling her blood, not only onthe image of the Maize Goddess, but on the piles of maize, peppers, pumpkins, seeds, andvegetables, can seemingly have had no other object but to quicken and strengthen the cropsof corn and the fruits of the earth in general by infusing into their representatives the bloodof the Corn Goddess herself. The analogy of this Mexican sacrifice, the meaning of whichappears to be indisputable, may be allowed to strengthen the interpretation which I havegiven of other human sacrifices offered for the crops. If the Mexican girl, whose blood wassprinkled on the maize, indeed personated the Maize Goddess, it becomes more than everprobable that the girl whose blood the Pawnees similarly sprinkled on the seed cornpersonated in like manner the female Spirit of the Corn; and so with the other humanbeings whom other races have slaughtered for the sake of promoting the growth of thecrops.Lastly, the concluding act of the sacred drama, in which the body of the dead MaizeGoddess was flayed and her skin worn, together with all her sacred insignia, by a man whodanced before the people in this grim attire, seems to be best explained on the hypothesisthat it was intended to ensure that the divine death should be immediately followed by thedivine resurrection. If that was so, we may infer with some degree of probability that thepractice of killing a human representative of a deity has commonly, perhaps always, beenregarded merely as a means of perpetuating the divine energies in the fulness of youthful"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"vigour, untainted by the weakness and frailty of age, from which they must have suffered ifthe deity had been allowed to die a natural death.These Mexican rites suffice to prove that human sacrifices of the sort I suppose to haveprevailed at Aricia were, as a matter of fact, regularly offered by a people whose level ofculture was probably not inferior, if indeed it was not distinctly superior, to that occupiedby the Italian races at the early period to which the origin of the Arician priesthood mustbe referred. The positive and indubitable evidence of the prevalence of such sacrifices inone part of the world may reasonably be allowed to strengthen the probability of theirprevalence in places for which the evidence is less full and trustworthy. Taken all together,the facts which we have passed in review seem to show that the custom of killing menwhom their worshippers regard as divine has prevailed in many parts of the world.LX. Between Heaven and Earth1. Not to touch the EarthAT THE OUTSET of this book two questions were proposed for answer: Why had thepriest of Aricia to slay his predecessor? And why, before doing so, had he to pluck theGolden Bough? Of these two questions the first has now been answered. The priest ofAricia, if I am right, was one of those sacred kings or human divinities on whose life thewelfare of the community and even the course of nature in general are believed to beintimately dependent. It does not appear that the subjects or worshippers of such aspiritual potentate form to themselves any very clear notion of the exact relationship inwhich they stand to him; probably their ideas on the point are vague and fluctuating, andwe should err if we attempted to define the relationship with logical precision. All that thepeople know, or rather imagine, is that somehow they themselves, their cattle, and theircrops are mysteriously bound up with their divine king, so that according as he is well or illthe community is healthy or sickly, the flocks and herds thrive or languish with disease,and the fields yield an abundant or a scanty harvest. The worst evil which they canconceive of is the natural death of their ruler, whether he succumb to sickness or old age,for in the opinion of his followers such a death would entail the most disastrousconsequences on themselves and their possessions; fatal epidemics would sweep away manand beast, the earth would refuse her increase, nay, the very frame of nature itself might bedissolved. To guard against these catastrophes it is necessary to put the king to death whilehe is still in the full bloom of his divine manhood, in order that his sacred life, transmittedin unabated force to his successor, may renew its youth, and thus by successivetransmissions through a perpetual line of vigorous incarnations may remain eternally freshand young, a pledge and security that men and animals shall in like manner renew theiryouth by a perpetual succession of generations, and that seedtime and harvest, and summerand winter, and rain and sunshine shall never fail. That, if my conjecture is right, was whythe priest of Aricia, the King of the Wood at Nemi, had regularly to perish by the sword ofhis successor."},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"But we have still to ask, What was the Golden Bough? and why had each candidate for theArician priesthood to pluck it before he could slay the priest? These questions I will nowtry to answer.It will be well to begin by noticing two of those rules or taboos by which, as we have seen,the life of divine kings or priests is regulated. The first of the rules to which I would call thereader’s attention is that the divine personage may not touch the ground with his foot. Thisrule was observed by the supreme pontiff of the Zapotecs in Mexico; he profaned hissanctity if he so much as touched the ground with his foot. Montezuma, emperor of Mexico,never set foot on the ground; he was always carried on the shoulders of noblemen, and if helighted anywhere they laid rich tapestry for him to walk upon. For the Mikado of Japan totouch the ground with his foot was a shameful degradation; indeed, in the sixteenthcentury, it was enough to deprive him of his office. Outside his palace he was carried onmen’s shoulders; within it he walked on exquisitely wrought mats. The king and queen ofTahiti might not touch the ground anywhere but within their hereditary domains; for theground on which they trod became sacred. In travelling from place to place they werecarried on the shoulders of sacred men. They were always accompanied by several pairs ofthese sanctified attendants; and when it became necessary to change their bearers, the kingand queen vaulted on to the shoulders of their new bearers without letting their feet touchthe ground. It was an evil omen if the king of Dosuma touched the ground, and he had toperform an expiatory ceremony. Within his palace the king of Persia walked on carpets onwhich no one else might tread; outside of it he was never seen on foot but only in a chariotor on horseback. In old days the king of Siam never set foot upon the earth, but wascarried on a throne of gold from place to place. Formerly neither the kings of Uganda, northeir mothers, nor their queens might walk on foot outside of the spacious enclosures inwhich they lived. Whenever they went forth they were carried on the shoulders of men ofthe Buffalo clan, several of whom accompanied any of these royal personages on a journeyand took it in turn to bear the burden. The king sat astride the bearer’s neck with a legover each shoulder and his feet tucked under the bearer’s arms. When one of these royalcarriers grew tired he shot the king onto the shoulders of a second man without allowingthe royal feet to touch the ground. In this way they went at a great pace and travelled longdistances in a day, when the king was on a journey. The bearers had a special hut in theking’s enclosure in order to be at hand the moment they were wanted. Among the Bakuba,or rather Bushongo, a nation in the southern region of the Congo, down to a few years agopersons of the royal blood were forbidden to touch the ground; they must sit on a hide, achair, or the back of a slave, who crouched on hands and feet; their feet rested on the feetof others. When they travelled they were carried on the backs of men; but the kingjourneyed in a litter supported on shafts. Among the Ibo people about Awka, in SouthernNigeria, the priest of the Earth has to observe many taboos; for example, he may not see acorpse, and if he meets one on the road he must hide his eyes with his wristlet. He mustabstain from many foods, such as eggs, birds of all sorts, mutton, dog, bush-buck, and soforth. He may neither wear nor touch a mask, and no masked man may enter his house. Ifa dog enters his house, it is killed and thrown out. As priest of the Earth he may not sit onthe bare ground, nor eat things that have fallen on the ground, nor may earth be thrown athim. According to ancient Brahmanic ritual a king at his inauguration trod on a tiger’sskin and a golden plate; he was shod with shoes of boar’s skin, and so long as he livedthereafter he might not stand on the earth with his bare feet."},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"But besides persons who are permanently sacred or tabooed and are therefore permanentlyforbidden to touch the ground with their feet, there are others who enjoy the character ofsanctity or taboo only on certain occasions, and to whom accordingly the prohibition inquestion only applies at the definite seasons during which they exhale the odour of sanctity.Thus among the Kayans or Bahaus of Central Borneo, while the priestesses are engaged inthe performance of certain rites they may not step on the ground, and boards are laid forthem to tread on. Warriors, again, on the war-path are surrounded, so to say, by anatmosphere of taboo; hence some Indians of North America might not sit on the bareground the whole time they were out on a warlike expedition. In Laos the hunting ofelephants gives rise to many taboos; one of them is that the chief hunter may not touch theearth with his foot. Accordingly, when he alights from his elephant, the others spread acarpet of leaves for him to step upon.Apparently holiness, magical virtue, taboo, or whatever we may call that mysteriousquality which is supposed to pervade sacred or tabooed persons, is conceived by theprimitive philosopher as a physical substance or fluid, with which the sacred man ischarged just as a Leyden jar is charged with electricity; and exactly as the electricity in thejar can be discharged by contact with a good conductor, so the holiness or magical virtue inthe man can be discharged and drained away by contact with the earth, which on thistheory serves as an excellent conductor for the magical fluid. Hence in order to preservethe charge from running to waste, the sacred or tabooed personage must be carefullyprevented from touching the ground; in electrical language he must be insulated, if he isnot to be emptied of the precious substance or fluid with which he, as a vial, is filled to thebrim. And in many cases apparently the insulation of the tabooed person is recommendedas a precaution not merely for his own sake but for the sake of others; for since the virtueof holiness or taboo is, so to say, a powerful explosive which the smallest touch maydetonate, it is necessary in the interest of the general safety to keep it within narrowbounds, lest breaking out it should blast, blight, and destroy whatever it comes into contactwith.2. Not to see the SunTHE SECOND rule to be here noted is that the sun may not shine upon the divine person.This rule was observed both by the Mikado and by the pontiff of the Zapotecs. The latter“was looked upon as a god whom the earth was not worthy to hold, nor the sun to shineupon.” The Japanese would not allow that the Mikado should expose his sacred person tothe open air, and the sun was not thought worthy to shine on his head. The Indians ofGranada, in South America, “kept those who were to be rulers or commanders, whethermen or women, locked up for several years when they were children, some of them sevenyears, and this so close that they were not to see the sun, for if they should happen to see itthey forfeited their lordship, eating certain sorts of food appointed; and those who weretheir keepers at certain times went into their retreat or prison and scourged themseverely.” Thus, for example, the heir to the throne of Bogota, who was not the son but thesister’s son of the king, had to undergo a rigorous training from his infancy; he lived incomplete retirement in a temple, where he might not see the sun nor eat salt nor conversewith a woman; he was surrounded by guards who observed his conduct and noted all his"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"actions; if he broke a single one of the rules laid down for him, he was deemed infamousand forfeited all his rights to the throne. So, too, the heir to the kingdom of Sogamoso,before succeeding to the crown, had to fast for seven years in the temple, being shut up inthe dark and not allowed to see the sun or light. The prince who was to become Inca ofPeru had to fast for a month without seeing light.3. The Seclusion of Girls at PubertyNOW it is remarkable that the foregoing two rules—not to touch the ground and not to seethe sun—are observed either separately or conjointly by girls at puberty in many parts ofthe world. Thus amongst the negroes of Loango girls at puberty are confined in separatehuts, and they may not touch the ground with any part of their bare body. Among theZulus and kindred tribes of South Africa, when the first signs of puberty show themselves“while a girl is walking, gathering wood, or working in the field, she runs to the river andhides herself among the reeds for the day, so as not to be seen by men. She covers her headcarefully with her blanket that the sun may not shine on it and shrivel her up into awithered skeleton, as would result from exposure to the sun’s beams. After dark shereturns to her home and is secluded” in a hut for some time. With the Awa-nkonde, a tribeat the northern end of Lake Nyassa, it is a rule that after her first menstruation a girl mustbe kept apart, with a few companions of her own sex, in a darkened house. The floor iscovered with dry banana leaves, but no fire may be lit in the house, which is called “thehouse of the Awasungu,” that is, “of maidens who have no hearts.”In New Ireland girls are confined for four or five years in small cages, being kept in thedark and not allowed to set foot on the ground. The custom has been thus described by aneye-witness. “I heard from a teacher about some strange custom connected with some ofthe young girls here, so I asked the chief to take me to the house where they were. Thehouse was about twenty-five feet in length, and stood in a reed and bamboo enclosure,across the entrance to which a bundle of dried grass was suspended to show that it wasstrictly ‘tabu.’ Inside the house were three conical structures about seven or eight feet inheight, and about ten or twelve feet in circumference at the bottom, and for about four feetfrom the ground, at which point they tapered off to a point at the top. These cages weremade of the broad leaves of the pandanus-tree, sewn quite close together so that no lightand little or no air could enter. On one side of each is an opening which is closed by adouble door of plaited cocoa-nut tree and pandanus-tree leaves. About three feet from theground there is a stage of bamboos which forms the floor. In each of these cages we weretold there was a young woman confined, each of whom had to remain for at least four orfive years, without ever being allowed to go outside the house. I could scarcely credit thestory when I heard it; the whole thing seemed too horrible to be true. I spoke to the chief,and told him that I wished to see the inside of the cages, and also to see the girls that Imight make them a present of a few beads. He told me that it was ‘tabu,’ forbidden for anymen but their own relations to look at them; but I suppose the promised beads acted as aninducement, and so he sent away for some old lady who had charge, and who alone isallowed to open the doors. While we were waiting we could hear the girls talking to thechief in a querulous way as if objecting to something or expressing their fears. The oldwoman came at length and certainly she did not seem a very pleasant jailor or guardian;"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"nor did she seem to favour the request of the chief to allow us to see the girls, as sheregarded us with anything but pleasant looks. However, she had to undo the door when thechief told her to do so, and then the girls peeped out at us, and, when told to do so, theyheld out their hands for the beads. I, however, purposely sat at some distance away andmerely held out the beads to them, as I wished to draw them quite outside, that I mightinspect the inside of the cages. This desire of mine gave rise to another difficulty, as thesegirls were not allowed to put their feet to the ground all the time they were confined inthese places. However, they wished to get the beads, and so the old lady had to go outsideand collect a lot of pieces of wood and bamboo, which she placed on the ground, and thengoing to one of the girls, she helped her down and held her hand as she stepped from onepiece of wood to another until she came near enough to get the beads I held out to her. Ithen went to inspect the inside of the cage out of which she had come, but could scarely putmy head inside of it, the atmosphere was so hot and stifling. It was clean and containednothing but a few short lengths of bamboo for holding water. There was only room for thegirl to sit or lie down in a crouched position on the bamboo platform, and when the doorsare shut it must be nearly or quite dark inside. The girls are never allowed to come outexcept once a day to bathe in a dish or wooden bowl placed close to each cage. They saythat they perspire profusely. They are placed in these stifling cages when quite young, andmust remain there until they are young women, when they are taken out and have each agreat marriage feast provided for them. One of them was about fourteen or fifteen yearsold, and the chief told us that she had been there for five years, but would soon be takenout now. The other two were about eight and ten years old, and they have to stay there forseveral years longer.”In Kabadi, a district of British New Guinea, “daughters of chiefs, when they are abouttwelve or thirteen years of age, are kept indoors for two or three years, never beingallowed, under any pretence, to descend from the house, and the house is so shaded that thesun cannot shine on them.” Among the Yabim and Bukaua, two neighbouring and kindredtribes on the coast of Northern New Guinea, a girl at puberty is secluded for some five orsix weeks in an inner part of the house; but she may not sit on the floor, lest heruncleanliness should cleave to it, so a log of wood is placed for her to squat on. Moreover,she may not touch the ground with her feet; hence if she is obliged to quit the house for ashort time, she is muffled up in mats and walks on two halves of a coco-nut shell, which arefastened like sandals to her feet by creeping plants. Among the Ot Danoms of Borneo girlsat the age of eight or ten years are shut up in a little room or cell of the house, and cut offfrom all intercourse with the world for a long time. The cell, like the rest of the house, israised on piles above the ground, and is lit by a single small window opening on a lonelyplace, so that the girl is in almost total darkness. She may not leave the room on any pretextwhatever, not even for the most necessary purposes. None of her family may see her all thetime she is shut up, but a single slave woman is appointed to wait on her. During her lonelyconfinement, which often lasts seven years, the girl occupies herself in weaving mats orwith other handiwork. Her bodily growth is stunted by the long want of exercise, andwhen, on attaining womanhood, she is brought out, her complexion is pale and wax-like.She is now shown the sun, the earth, the water, the trees, and the flowers, as if she werenewly born. Then a great feast is made, a slave is killed, and the girl is smeared with hisblood. In Ceram girls at puberty were formerly shut up by themselves in a hut which waskept dark. In Yap, one of the Caroline Islands, should a girl be overtaken by her first"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"menstruation on the public road, she may not sit down on the earth, but must beg for acoco-nut shell to put under her. She is shut up for several days in a small hut at a distancefrom her parents’ house, and afterwards she is bound to sleep for a hundred days in one ofthe special houses which are provided for the use of menstruous women.In the island of Mabuiag, Torres Straits, when the signs of puberty appear on a girl, acircle of bushes is made in a dark corner of the house. Here, decked with shoulder-belts,armlets, leglets just below the knees, and anklets, wearing a chaplet on her head, and shellornaments in her ears, on her chest, and on her back, she squats in the midst of the bushes,which are piled so high round about her that only her head is visible. In this state ofseclusion she must remain for three months. All this time the sun may not shine upon her,but at night she is allowed to slip out of the hut, and the bushes that hedge her in are thenchanged. She may not feed herself or handle food, but is fed by one or two old women, hermaternal aunts, who are especially appointed to look after her. One of these women cooksfood for her at a special fire in the forest. The girl is forbidden to eat turtle or turtle eggsduring the season when the turtles are breeding; but no vegetable food is refused her. Noman, not even her own father, may come into the house while her seclusion lasts; for if herfather saw her at this time he would certainly have bad luck in his fishing, and wouldprobably smash his canoe the very next time he went out in it. At the end of the threemonths she is carried down to a freshwater creek by her attendants, hanging on to theirshoulders in such a way that her feet do not touch the ground, while the women of the tribeform a ring round her, and thus escort her to the beach. Arrived at the shore, she isstripped of her ornaments, and the bearers stagger with her into the creek, where theyimmerse her, and all the other women join in splashing water over both the girl and herbearers. When they come out of the water one of the two attendants makes a heap of grassfor her charge to squat upon. The other runs to the reef, catches a small crab, tears off itsclaws, and hastens back with them to the creek. Here in the meantime a fire has beenkindled, and the claws are roasted at it. The girl is then fed by her attendants with theroasted claws. After that she is freshly decorated, and the whole party marches back to thevillage in a single rank, the girl walking in the centre between her two old aunts, who holdher by the wrists. The husbands of her aunts now receive her and lead her into the house ofone of them, where all partake of food, and the girl is allowed once more to feed herself inthe usual manner. A dance follows, in which the girl takes a prominent part, dancingbetween the husbands of the two aunts who had charge of her in her retirement.Among the Yaraikanna tribe of Cape York Peninsula, in Northern Queensland, a girl atpuberty is said to live by herself for a month or six weeks; no man may see her, though anywoman may. She stays in a hut or shelter specially made for her, on the floor of which shelies supine. She may not see the sun, and towards sunset she must keep her eyes shut untilthe sun has gone down, otherwise it is thought that her nose will be diseased. During herseclusion she may eat nothing that lives in salt water, or a snake would kill her. An oldwoman waits upon her and supplies her with roots, yams, and water. Some Australiantribes are wont to bury their girls at such seasons more or less deeply in the ground,perhaps in order to hide them from the light of the sun.Among the Indians of California a girl at her first menstruation “was thought to bepossessed of a particular degree of supernatural power, and this was not always regarded"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"as entirely defiling or malevolent. Often, however, there was a strong feeling of the powerof evil inherent in her condition. Not only was she secluded from her family and thecommunity, but an attempt was made to seclude the world from her. One of the injunctionsmost strongly laid upon her was not to look about her. She kept her head bowed and wasforbidden to see the world and the sun. Some tribes covered her with a blanket. Many ofthe customs in this connection resembled those of the North Pacific Coast most strongly,such as the prohibition to the girl to touch or scratch her head with her hand, a specialimplement being furnished her for the purpose. Sometimes she could eat only when fed andin other cases fasted altogether.”Among the Chinook Indians who inhabited the coast of Washington State, when a chief’sdaughter attained to puberty, she was hidden for five days from the view of the people; shemight not look at them nor at the sky, nor might she pick berries. It was believed that if shewere to look at the sky, the weather would be bad; that if she picked berries, it would rain;and that when she hung her towel of cedar-bark on a spruce-tree, the tree withered up atonce. She went out of the house by a separate door and bathed in a creek far from thevillage. She fasted for some days, and for many days more she might not eat fresh food.Amongst the Aht or Nootka Indians of Vancouver Island, when girls reach puberty theyare placed in a sort of gallery in the house “and are there surrounded completely withmats, so that neither the sun nor any fire can be seen. In this cage they remain for severaldays. Water is given them, but no food. The longer a girl remains in this retirement thegreater honour is it to the parents; but she is disgraced for life if it is known that she hasseen fire or the sun during this initiatory ordeal.” Pictures of the mythical thunder-bird arepainted on the screens behind which she hides. During her seclusion she may neither movenor lie down, but must always sit in a squatting posture. She may not touch her hair withher hands, but is allowed to scratch her head with a comb or a piece of bone provided forthe purpose. To scratch her body is also forbidden, as it is believed that every scratchwould leave a scar. For eight months after reaching maturity she may not eat any freshfood, particularly salmon; moreover, she must eat by herself, and use a cup and dish of herown.In the Tsetsaut tribe of British Columbia a girl at puberty wears a large hat of skin whichcomes down over her face and screens it from the sun. It is believed that if she were toexpose her face to the sun or to the sky, rain would fall. The hat protects her face alsoagainst the fire, which ought not to strike her skin; to shield her hands she wears mittens.In her mouth she carries the tooth of an animal to prevent her own teeth from becominghollow. For a whole year she may not see blood unless her face is blackened; otherwise shewould grow blind. For two years she wears the hat and lives in a hut by herself, althoughshe is allowed to see other people. At the end of two years a man takes the hat from herhead and throws it away. In the Bilqula or Bella Coola tribe of British Columbia, when agirl attains puberty she must stay in the shed which serves as her bedroom, where she has aseparate fireplace. She is not allowed to descend to the main part of the house, and may notsit by the fire of the family. For four days she is bound to remain motionless in a sittingposture. She fasts during the day, but is allowed a little food and drink very early in themorning. After the four days’ seclusion she may leave her room, but only through aseparate opening cut in the floor, for the houses are raised on piles. She may not yet come"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"into the chief room. In leaving the house she wears a large hat which protects her faceagainst the rays of the sun. It is believed that if the sun were to shine on her face her eyeswould suffer. She may pick berries on the hills, but may not come near the river or sea fora whole year. Were she to eat fresh salmon she would lose her senses, or her mouth wouldbe changed into a long beak.Amongst the Tlingit (Thlinkeet) or Kolosh Indians of Alaska, when a girl showed signs ofwomanhood she used to be confined to a little hut or cage, which was completely blockedup with the exception of a small air-hole. In this dark and filthy abode she had to remain ayear, without fire, exercise, or associates. Only her mother and a female slave might supplyher with nourishment. Her food was put in at the little window; she had to drink out of thewing-bone of a white-headed eagle. The time of her seclusion was afterwards reduced insome places to six or three months or even less. She had to wear a sort of hat with longflaps, that her gaze might not pollute the sky; for she was thought unfit for the sun to shineupon, and it was imagined that her look would destroy the luck of a hunter, fisher, orgambler, turn things to stone, and do other mischief. At the end of her confinement her oldclothes were burnt, new ones were made, and a feast was given, at which a slit was cut inher under lip parallel to the mouth, and a piece of wood or shell was inserted to keep theaperture open. Among the Koniags, an Esquimau people of Alaska, a girl at puberty wasplaced in a small hut in which she had to remain on her hands and feet for six months; thenthe hut was enlarged a little so as to allow her to straighten her back, but in this postureshe had to remain for six months more. All this time she was regarded as an unclean beingwith whom no one might hold intercourse.When symptoms of puberty appeared on a girl for the first time, the Guaranis of SouthernBrazil, on the borders of Paraguay, used to sew her up in her hammock, leaving only asmall opening in it to allow her to breathe. In this condition, wrapt up and shrouded like acorpse, she was kept for two or three days or so long as the symptoms lasted, and duringthis time she had to observe a most rigorous fast. After that she was entrusted to a matron,who cut the girl’s hair and enjoined her to abstain most strictly from eating flesh of anykind until her hair should be grown long enough to hide her ears. In similar circumstancesthe Chiriguanos of South-eastern Bolivia hoisted the girl in her hammock to the roof,where she stayed for a month: the second month the hammock was let half-way down fromthe roof; and in the third month old women, armed with sticks, entered the hut and ranabout striking everything they met, saying they were hunting the snake that had woundedthe girl.Among the Matacos or Mataguayos, an Indian tribe of the Gran Chaco, a girl at pubertyhas to remain in seclusion for some time. She lies covered up with branches or other thingsin a corner of the hut, seeing no one and speaking to no one, and during this time she mayeat neither flesh nor fish. Meantime a man beats a drum in front of the house. Among theYuracares, an Indian tribe of Eastern Bolivia, when a girl perceives the signs of puberty,her father constructs a little hut of palm leaves near the house. In this cabin he shuts up hisdaughter so that she cannot see the light, and there she remains fasting rigorously for fourdays.Amongst the Macusis of British Guiana, when a girl shows the first signs of puberty, she ishung in a hammock at the highest point of the hut. For the first few days she may not leave"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"the hammock by day, but at night she must come down, light a fire, and spend the nightbeside it, else she would break out in sores on her neck, throat, and other parts of her body.So long as the symptoms are at their height, she must fast rigorously. When they haveabated, she may come down and take up her abode in a little compartment that is made forher in the darkest corner of the hut. In the morning she may cook her food, but it must beat a separate fire and in a vessel of her own. After about ten days the magician comes andundoes the spell by muttering charms and breathing on her and on the more valuable ofthe things with which she has come in contact. The pots and drinking-vessels which sheused are broken and the fragments buried. After her first bath, the girl must submit to bebeaten by her mother with thin rods without uttering a cry. At the end of the second periodshe is again beaten, but not afterwards. She is now “clean,” and can mix again with people.Other Indians of Guiana, after keeping the girl in her hammock at the top of the hut for amonth, expose her to certain large ants, whose bite is very painful. Sometimes, in additionto being stung with ants, the sufferer has to fast day and night so long as she remains slungup on high in her hammock, so that when she comes down she is reduced to a skeleton.When a Hindoo maiden reaches maturity she is kept in a dark room for four days, and isforbidden to see the sun. She is regarded as unclean; no one may touch her. Her diet isrestricted to boiled rice, milk, sugar, curd, and tamarind without salt. On the morning ofthe fifth day she goes to a neighbouring tank, accompanied by five women whose husbandsare alive. Smeared with turmeric water, they all bathe and return home, throwing away themat and other things that were in the room. The Rarhi Brahmans of Bengal compel a girlat puberty to live alone, and do not allow her to see the face of any male. For three days sheremains shut up in a dark room, and has to undergo certain penances. Fish, flesh, andsweetmeats are forbidden her; she must live upon rice and ghee. Among the Tiyans ofMalabar a girl is thought to be polluted for four days from the beginning of her firstmenstruation. During this time she must keep to the north side of the house, where shesleeps on a grass mat of a particular kind, in a room festooned with garlands of youngcoco-nut leaves. Another girl keeps her company and sleeps with her, but she may nottouch any other person, tree or plant. Further, she may not see the sky, and woe betide herif she catches sight of a crow or a cat! Her diet must be strictly vegetarian, without salt,tamarinds, or chillies. She is armed against evil spirits by a knife, which is placed on themat or carried on her person.In Cambodia a girl at puberty is put to bed under a mosquito curtain, where she shouldstay a hundred days. Usually, however, four, five, ten, or twenty days are thought enough;and even this, in a hot climate and under the close meshes of the curtain, is sufficientlytrying. According to another account, a Cambodian maiden at puberty is said to “enterinto the shade.” During her retirement, which, according to the rank and position of herfamily, may last any time from a few days to several years, she has to observe a number ofrules, such as not to be seen by a strange man, not to eat flesh or fish, and so on. She goesnowhere, not even to the pagoda. But this state of seclusion is discontinued during eclipses;at such times she goes forth and pays her devotions to the monster who is supposed to causeeclipses by catching the heavenly bodies between his teeth. This permission to break herrule of retirement and appear abroad during an eclipse seems to show how literally theinjunction is interpreted which forbids maidens entering on womanhood to look upon thesun."},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"A superstition so widely diffused as this might be expected to leave traces in legends andfolk-tales. And it has done so. The old Greek story of Danae, who was confined by herfather in a subterranean chamber or a brazen tower, but impregnated by Zeus, whoreached her in the shape of a shower of gold, perhaps belongs to this class of tales. It has itscounterpart in the legend which the Kirghiz of Siberia tell of their ancestry. A certainKhan had a fair daughter, whom he kept in a dark iron house, that no man might see her.An old woman tended her; and when the girl was grown to maidenhood she asked the oldwoman, “Where do you go so often?” “My child,” said the old dame, “there is a brightworld. In that bright world your father and mother live, and all sorts of people live there.That is where I go.” The maiden said, “Good mother, I will tell nobody, but show me thatbright world.” So the old woman took the girl out of the iron house. But when she saw thebright world, the girl tottered and fainted; and the eye of God fell upon her, and sheconceived. Her angry father put her in a golden chest and sent her floating away (fairy goldcan float in fairyland) over the wide sea. The shower of gold in the Greek story, and the eyeof God in the Kirghiz legend, probably stand for sunlight and the sun. The idea thatwomen may be impregnated by the sun is not uncommon in legends, and there are eventraces of it in marriage customs.4. Reasons for the Seclusion of Girls at PubertyTHE MOTIVE for the restraints so commonly imposed on girls at puberty is the deeplyengrained dread which primitive man universally entertains of menstruous blood. He fearsit at all times but especially on its first appearance; hence the restrictions under whichwomen lie at their first menstruation are usually more stringent than those which they haveto observe at any subsequent recurrence of the mysterious flow. Some evidence of the fearand of the customs based on it has been cited in an earlier part of this work; but as theterror, for it is nothing less, which the phenomenon periodically strikes into the mind of thesavage has deeply influenced his life and institutions, it may be well to illustrate the subjectwith some further examples.Thus in the Encounter Bay tribe of South Australia there is, or used to be, a “superstitionwhich obliges a woman to separate herself from the camp at the time of her monthly illness,when if a young man or boy should approach, she calls out, and he immediately makes acircuit to avoid her. If she is neglectful upon this point, she exposes herself to scolding, andsometimes to severe beating by her husband or nearest relation, because the boys are toldfrom their infancy, that if they see the blood they will early become grey-headed, and theirstrength will fail prematurely.” The Dieri of Central Australia believe that if women atthese times were to eat fish or bathe in a river, the fish would all die and the water woulddry up. The Arunta of the same region forbid menstruous women to gather the irriakurabulbs, which form a staple article of diet for both men and women. They think that were awoman to break this rule, the supply of bulbs would fail.In some Australian tribes the seclusion of menstruous women was even more rigid, and wasenforced by severer penalties than a scolding or a beating. Thus “there is a regulationrelating to camps in the Wakelbura tribe which forbids the women coming into theencampment by the same path as the men. Any violation of this rule would in a large camp"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"be punished with death. The reason for this is the dread with which they regard themenstrual period of women. During such a time, a woman is kept entirely away from thecamp, half a mile at least. A woman in such a condition has boughs of some tree of hertotem tied round her loins, and is constantly watched and guarded, for it is thought thatshould any male be so unfortunate as to see a woman in such a condition, he would die. Ifsuch a woman were to let herself be seen by a man, she would probably be put to death.When the woman has recovered, she is painted red and white, her head covered withfeathers, and returns to the camp.”In Muralug, one of the Torres Straits Islands, a menstruous woman may not eat anythingthat lives in the sea, else the natives believe that the fisheries would fail. In Galela, to thewest of New Guinea, women at their monthly periods may not enter a tobacco-field, or theplants would be attacked by disease. The Minangkabauers of Sumatra are persuaded thatif a woman in her unclean state were to go near a rice-field, the crop would be spoiled.The Bushmen of South Africa think that, by a glance of a girl’s eye at the time when sheought to be kept in strict retirement, men become fixed in whatever positions they happento occupy, with whatever they were holding in their hands, and are changed into trees thattalk. Cattle-rearing tribes of South Africa hold that their cattle would die if the milk weredrunk by a menstruous woman; and they fear the same disaster if a drop of her blood wereto fall on the ground and the oxen were to pass over it. To prevent such a calamity womenin general, not menstruous women only, are forbidden to enter the cattle enclosure; andmore than that, they may not use the ordinary paths in entering the village or in passingfrom one hut to another. They are obliged to make circuitous tracks at the back of the hutsin order to avoid the ground in the middle of the village where the cattle stand or lie down.These women’s tracks may be seen at every Caffre village. Among the Baganda, in likemanner, no menstruous woman might drink milk or come into contact with any milk-vessel; and she might not touch anything that belonged to her husband, nor sit on his mat,nor cook his food. If she touched anything of his at such a time it was deemed equivalent towishing him dead or to actually working magic for his destruction. Were she to handle anyarticle of his, he would surely fall ill; were she to touch his weapons, he would certainly bekilled in the next battle. Further, the Baganda would not suffer a menstruous woman tovisit a well; if she did so, they feared that the water would dry up, and that she herselfwould fall sick and die, unless she confessed her fault and the medicine-man madeatonement for her. Among the Akikuyu of British East Africa, if a new hut is built in avillage and the wife chances to menstruate in it on the day she lights the first fire there, thehut must be broken down and demolished the very next day. The woman may on noaccount sleep a second night in it; there is a curse both on her and on it.According to the Talmud, if a woman at the beginning of her period passes between twomen, she thereby kills one of them. Peasants of the Lebanon think that menstruous womenare the cause or many misfortunes; their shadow causes flowers to wither and trees toperish, it even arrests the movements of serpents; if one of them mounts a horse, the animalmight die or at least be disabled for a long time.The Guayquiries of the Orinoco believe that when a woman has her courses, everythingupon which she steps will die, and that if a man treads on the place where she has passed,his legs will immediately swell up. Among the Bri-bri Indians of Costa Rica a married"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"woman at her periods uses for plates only banana leaves, which, when she has done withthem, she throws away in a sequestered spot; for should a cow find and eat them, theanimal would waste away and perish. Also she drinks only out of a special vessel, becauseany person who should afterwards drink out of the same vessel would infallibly pine awayand die.Among most tribes of North American Indians the custom was that women in their coursesretired from the camp or the village and lived during the time of their uncleanness inspecial huts or shelters which were appropriated to their use. There they dwelt apart,eating and sleeping by themselves, warming themselves at their own fires, and strictlyabstaining from all communications with men, who shunned them just as if they werestricken with the plague.Thus, to take examples, the Creek and kindred Indians of the United States compelledwomen at menstruation to live in separate huts at some distance from the village. There thewomen had to stay, at the risk of being surprised and cut off by enemies. It was thought “amost horrid and dangerous pollution” to go near the women at such times; and the dangerextended to enemies who, if they slew the women, had to cleanse themselves from thepollution by means of certain sacred herbs and roots. The Stseelis Indians of BritishColumbia imagined that if a menstruous woman were to step over a bundle of arrows, thearrows would thereby be rendered useless and might even cause the death of their owner;and similarly that if she passed in front of a hunter who carried a gun, the weapon wouldnever shoot straight again. Among the Chippeways and other Indians of the Hudson BayTerritory, menstruous women are excluded from the camp, and take up their abode in hutsof branches. They wear long hoods, which effectually conceal the head and breast. Theymay not touch the household furniture nor any objects used by men; for their touch “issupposed to defile them, so that their subsequent use would be followed by certain mischiefor misfortune,” such as disease or death. They must drink out of a swan’s bone. They maynot walk on the common paths nor cross the tracks of animals. They “are never permittedto walk on the ice of rivers or lakes, or near the part where the men are hunting beaver, orwhere a fishing-net is set, for fear of averting their success. They are also prohibited atthose times from partaking of the head of any animal, and even from walking in or crossingthe track where the head of a deer, moose, beaver, and many other animals have latelybeen carried, either on a sledge or on the back. To be guilty of a violation of this custom isconsidered as of the greatest importance; because they firmly believe that it would be ameans of preventing the hunter from having an equal success in his future excursions.” Sothe Lapps forbid women at menstruation to walk on that part of the shore where thefishers are in the habit of setting out their fish; and the Esquimaux of Bering Strait believethat if hunters were to come near women in their courses they would catch no game. For alike reason the Carrier Indians will not suffer a menstruous woman to cross the tracks ofanimals; if need be, she is carried over them. They think that if she waded in a stream or alake, the fish would die.Amongst the civilised nations of Europe the superstitions which cluster round thismysterious aspect of woman’s nature are not less extravagant than those which prevailamong savages. In the oldest existing cyclopaedia—the Natural History of Pliny—the list ofdangers apprehended from menstruation is longer than any furnished by mere barbarians."},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"According to Pliny, the touch of a menstruous woman turned wine to vinegar, blightedcrops, killed seedlings, blasted gardens, brought down the fruit from trees, dimmedmirrors, blunted razors, rusted iron and brass (especially at the waning of the moon), killedbees, or at least drove them from their hives, caused mares to miscarry, and so forth.Similarly, in various parts of Europe, it is still believed that if a woman in her coursesenters a brewery the beer will turn sour; if she touches beer, wine, vinegar, or milk, it willgo bad; if she makes jam, it will not keep; if she mounts a mare, it will miscarry; if shetouches buds, they will wither; if she climbs a cherry tree, it will die. In Brunswick peoplethink that if a menstruous woman assists at the killing of a pig, the pork will putrefy. In theGreek island of Calymnos a woman at such times may not go to the well to draw water, norcross a running stream, nor enter the sea. Her presence in a boat is said to raise storms.Thus the object of secluding women at menstruation is to neutralise the dangerousinfluences which are supposed to emanate from them at such times. That the danger isbelieved to be especially great at the first menstruation appears from the unusualprecautions taken to isolate girls at this crisis. Two of these precautions have beenillustrated above, namely, the rules that the girls may not touch the ground nor see the sun.The general effect of these rules is to keep her suspended, so to say, between heaven andearth. Whether enveloped in her hammock and slung up to the roof, as in South America,or raised above the ground in a dark and narrow cage, as in New Ireland, she may beconsidered to be out of the way of doing mischief, since, being shut off both from the earthand from the sun, she can poison neither of these great sources of life by her deadlycontagion. In short, she is rendered harmless by being, in electrical language, insulated.But the precautions thus taken to isolate or insulate the girl are dictated by a regard forher own safety as well as for the safety of others. For it is thought that she herself wouldsuffer if she were to neglect the prescribed regimen. Thus Zulu girls, as we have seen,believe that they would shrivel to skeletons if the sun were to shine on them at puberty, andthe Macusis imagine that, if a young woman were to transgress the rules, she would sufferfrom sores on various parts of her body. In short, the girl is viewed as charged with apowerful force which, if not kept within bounds, may prove destructive both to herself andto all with whom she comes in contact. To repress this force within the limits necessary forthe safety of all concerned is the object of the taboos in question.The same explanation applies to the observance of the same rules by divine kings andpriests. The uncleanness, as it is called, of girls at puberty and the sanctity of holy men donot, to the primitive mind, differ materially from each other. They are only differentmanifestations of the same mysterious energy which, like energy in general, is in itselfneither good nor bad, but becomes beneficent or maleficent according to its application.Accordingly, if, like girls at puberty, divine personages may neither touch the ground norsee the sun, the reason is, on the one hand, a fear lest their divinity might, at contact withearth or heaven, discharge itself with fatal violence on either; and, on the other hand, anapprehension that the divine being, thus drained of his ethereal virtue, might thereby beincapacitated for the future performance of those magical functions, upon the properdischarge of which the safety of the people and even of the world is believed to hang. Thusthe rules in question fall under the head of the taboos which we examined in an earlier partof this book; they are intended to preserve the life of the divine person and with it the life ofhis subjects and worshippers. Nowhere, it is thought, can his precious yet dangerous life be"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"at once so safe and so harmless as when it is neither in heaven nor in earth, but, as far aspossible, suspended between the two.LXI. The Myth of BalderA DEITY whose life might in a sense be said to be neither in heaven nor on earth butbetween the two, was the Norse Balder, the good and beautiful god, the son of the great godOdin, and himself the wisest, mildest, best beloved of all the immortals. The story of hisdeath, as it is told in the younger or prose Edda, runs thus. Once on a time Balder dreamedheavy dreams which seemed to forebode his death. Thereupon the gods held a council andresolved to make him secure against every danger. So the goddess Frigg took an oath fromfire and water, iron and all metals, stones and earth, from trees, sicknesses and poisons,and from all four-footed beasts, birds, and creeping things, that they would not hurtBalder. When this was done Balder was deemed invulnerable; so the gods amusedthemselves by setting him in their midst, while some shot at him, others hewed at him, andothers threw stones at him. But whatever they did, nothing could hurt him; and at this theywere all glad. Only Loki, the mischief-maker, was displeased, and he went in the guise of anold woman to Frigg, who told him that the weapons of the gods could not wound Balder,since she had made them all swear not to hurt him. Then Loki asked, “Have all thingssworn to spare Balder?” She answered, “East of Walhalla grows a plant called mistletoe; itseemed to me too young to swear.” So Loki went and pulled the mistletoe and took it to theassembly of the gods. There he found the blind god Hother standing at the outside of thecircle. Loki asked him, “Why do you not shoot at Balder?” Hother answered, “Because Ido not see where he stands; besides I have no weapon.” Then said Loki, “Do like the restand show Balder honour, as they all do. I will show you where he stands, and do you shootat him with this twig.” Hother took the mistletoe and threw it at Balder, as Loki directedhim. The mistletoe struck Balder and pierced him through and through, and he fell downdead. And that was the greatest misfortune that ever befell gods and men. For a while thegods stood speechless, then they lifted up their voices and wept bitterly. They took Balder’sbody and brought it to the sea-shore. There stood Balder’s ship; it was called Ringhorn,and was the hugest of all ships. The gods wished to launch the ship and to burn Balder’sbody on it, but the ship would not stir. So they sent for a giantess called Hyrrockin. Shecame riding on a wolf and gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers andall the earth shook. Then Balder’s body was taken and placed on the funeral pile upon hisship. When his wife Nanna saw that, her heart burst for sorrow and she died. So she waslaid on the funeral pile with her husband, and fire was put to it. Balder’s horse, too, withall its trappings, was burned on the pile.Whether he was a real or merely a mythical personage, Balder was worshipped in Norway.On one of the bays of the beautiful Sogne Fiord, which penetrates far into the depths of thesolemn Norwegian mountains, with their sombre pine-forests and their lofty cascadesdissolving into spray before they reach the dark water of the fiord far below, Balder had agreat sanctuary. It was called Balder’s Grove. A palisade enclosed the hallowed ground,and within it stood a spacious temple with the images of many gods, but none of them wasworshipped with such devotion as Balder. So great was the awe with which the heathen"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"regarded the place that no man might harm another there, nor steal his cattle, nor defilehimself with women. But women cared for the images of the gods in the temple; theywarmed them at the fire, anointed them with oil, and dried them with cloths.Whatever may be thought of an historical kernel underlying a mythical husk in the legendof Balder, the details of the story suggest that it belongs to that class of myths which havebeen dramatised an ritual, or, to put it otherwise, which have been performed as magicalceremonies for the sake of producing those natural effects which they describe in figurativelanguage. A myth is never so graphic and precise in its details as when it is, so to speak, thebook of the words which are spoken and acted by the performers of the sacred rite. Thatthe Norse story of Balder was a myth of this sort will become probable if we can prove thatceremonies resembling the incidents in the tale have been performed by Norsemen andother European peoples. Now the main incidents in the tale are two—first, the pulling ofthe mistletoe, and second, the death and burning of the god; and both of them may perhapsbe found to have had their counterparts in yearly rites observed, whether separately orconjointly, by people in various parts of Europe. These rites will be described anddiscussed in the following chapters. We shall begin with the annual festivals of fire andshall reserve the pulling of the mistletoe for consideration later on.LXII. The Fire-Festivals of Europe1. The Fire-festivals in generalALL over Europe the peasants have been accustomed from time immemorial to kindlebonfires on certain days of the year, and to dance round or leap over them. Customs of thiskind can be traced back on historical evidence to the Middle Ages, and their analogy tosimilar customs observed in antiquity goes with strong internal evidence to prove that theirorigin must be sought in a period long prior to the spread of Christianity. Indeed theearliest proof of their observance in Northern Europe is furnished by the attempts made byChristian synods in the eighth century to put them down as heathenish rites. Notuncommonly effigies are burned in these fires, or a pretence is made of burning a livingperson in them; and there are grounds for believing that anciently human beings wereactually burned on these occasions. A brief view of the customs in question will bring outthe traces of human sacrifice, and will serve at the same time to throw light on theirmeaning.The seasons of the year when these bonfires are most commonly lit are spring andmidsummer; but in some places they are kindled also at the end of autumn or during thecourse of the winter, particularly on Hallow E’en (the thirty-first of October), ChristmasDay, and the Eve of Twelfth Day. Space forbids me to describe all these festivals at length;a few specimens must serve to illustrate their general character. We shall begin with thefire-festivals of spring, which usually fall on the first Sunday of Lent (Quadragesima orInvocavit), Easter Eve, and May Day."},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"2. The Lenten FiresTHE CUSTOM of kindling bonfires on the first Sunday in Lent has prevailed in Belgium,the north of France, and many parts of Germany. Thus in the Belgian Ardennes for a weekor a fortnight before the “day of the great fire,” as it is called, children go about from farmto farm collecting fuel. At Grand Halleux any one who refuses their request is pursued nextday by the children, who try to blacken his face with the ashes of the extinct fire. When theday has come, they cut down bushes, especially juniper and broom, and in the eveninggreat bonfires blaze on all the heights. It is a common saying that seven bonfires should beseen if the village is to be safe from conflagrations. If the Meuse happens to be frozen hardat the time, bonfires are lit also on the ice. At Grand Halleux they set up a pole calledmakral, or “the witch,” in the midst of the pile, and the fire is kindled by the man who waslast married in the village. In the neighbourhood of Morlanwelz a straw man is burnt in thefire. Young people and children dance and sing round the bonfires, and leap over theembers to secure good crops or a happy marriage within the year, or as a means ofguarding themselves against colic. In Brabant on the same Sunday, down to the beginningof the nineteenth century, women and men disguised in female attire used to go withburning torches to the fields, where they danced and sang comic songs for the purpose, asthey alleged, of driving away “the wicked sower,” who is mentioned in the Gospel for theday. At Pâturages, in the province of Hainaut, down to about 1840 the custom wasobserved under the name of Escouvion or Scouvion. Every year on the first Sunday of Lent,which was called the Day of the Little Scouvion, young folks and children used to run withlighted torches through the gardens and orchards. As they ran they cried at the pitch oftheir voices:“Bear apples, bear pears, and cherries all blackTo Scouvion!”At these words the torch-bearer whirled his blazing brand and hurled it among thebranches of the apple-trees, the pear-trees, and the cherry-trees. The next Sunday wascalled the Day of the Great Scouvion, and the same race with lighted torches among thetrees of the orchards was repeated in the afternoon till darkness fell.In the French department of the Ardennes the whole village used to dance and sing aroundthe bonfires which were lighted on the first Sunday in Lent. Here, too, it was the person lastmarried, sometimes a man and sometimes a woman, who put the match to the fire. Thecustom is still kept up very commonly in the district. Cats used to be burnt in the fire orroasted to death by being held over it; and while they were burning the shepherds drovetheir flocks through the smoke and flames as a sure means of guarding them againstsickness and witchcraft. In some communes it was believed that the livelier the danceround the fire, the better would be the crops that year.In the French province of Franche-Comté, to the west of the Jura Mountains, the first"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"Sunday of Lent is known as the Sunday of the Firebrands (Brandons), on account of thefires which it is customary to kindle on that day. On the Saturday or the Sunday the villagelads harness themselves to a cart and drag it about the streets, stopping at the doors of thehouses where there are girls and begging fora faggot. When they have got enough, they cartthe fuel to a spot at some little distance from the village, pile it up, and set it on fire. All thepeople of the parish come out to see the bonfire. In some villages, when the bells have rungthe Angelus, the signal for the observance is given by cries of, “To the fire! to the fire!”Lads, lasses, and children dance round the blaze, and when the flames have died down theyvie with each other in leaping over the red embers. He or she who does so without singeinghis or her garments will be married within the year. Young folk also carry lighted torchesabout the streets or the fields, and when they pass an orchard they cry out, “More fruitthan leaves!” Down to recent years at Laviron, in the department of Doubs, it was theyoung married couples of the year who had charge of the bonfires. In the midst of thebonfire a pole was planted with a wooden figure of a cock fastened to the top. Then therewere races, and the winner received the cock as a prize.In Auvergne fires are everywhere kindled on the evening of the first Sunday in Lent. Everyvillage, every hamlet, even every ward, every isolated farm has its bonfire or figo, as it iscalled, which blazes up as the shades of night are falling. The fires may be seen flaring onthe heights and in the plains; the people dance and sing round about them and leapthrough the flames. Then they proceed to the ceremony of the Grannas-mias. A granno-miois a torch of straw fastened to the top of a pole. When the pyre is half consumed, thebystanders kindle the torches at the expiring flames and carry them into the neighbouringorchards, fields, and gardens, wherever there are fruit-trees. As they march they sing at thetop of their voices, “Granno my friend, Granno my father, Granno my mother.” Then theypass the burning torches under the branches of every tree, singing.“Brando, brandounci tsaque brantso, in plan panei!”that is, “Firebrand burn; every branch a basketful!” In some villages the people also runacross the sown fields and shake the ashes of the torches on the ground; also they put someof the ashes in the fowls’ nests, in order that the hens may lay plenty of eggs throughout theyear. When all these ceremonies have been performed, everybody goes home and feasts;the special dishes of the evening are fritters and pancakes. Here the application of the fireto the fruit-trees, to the sown fields, and to the nests of the poultry is clearly a charmintended to ensure fertility; and the Granno to whom the invocations are addressed, andwho gives his name to the torches, may possibly be, as Dr. Pommerol suggests, no otherthan the ancient Celtic god Grannus, whom the Romans identified with Apollo, and whoseworship is attested by inscriptions found not only in France but in Scotland and on theDanube.The custom of carrying lighted torches of straw (brandons) about the orchards and fields tofertilise them on the first Sunday of Lent seems to have been common in France, whether itwas accompanied with the practice of kindling bonfires or not. Thus in the province of"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"Picardy “on the first Sunday of Lent people carried torches through the fields, exorcisingthe field-mice, the darnel, and the smut. They imagined that they did much good to thegardens and caused the onions to grow large. Children ran about the fields, torch in hand,to make the land more fertile.” At Verges, a village between the Jura and the Combe d’Ain,the torches at this season were kindled on the top of a mountain, and the bearers went toevery house in the village, demanding roasted peas and obliging all couples who had beenmarried within the year to dance. In Berry, a district of Central France, it appears thatbonfires are not lighted on this day, but when the sun has set the whole population of thevillages, armed with blazing torches of straw, disperse over the country and scour thefields, the vineyards, and the orchards. Seen from afar, the multitude of moving lights,twinkling in the darkness, appear like will-o’-the-wisps chasing each other across theplains, along the hillsides, and down the valleys. While the men wave their flambeaus aboutthe branches of the fruit-trees, the women and children tie bands of wheaten-straw roundthe tree-trunks. The effect of the ceremony is supposed to be to avert the various plaguesfrom which the fruits of the earth are apt to suffer; and the bands of straw fastened roundthe stems of the trees are believed to render them fruitful.In Germany, Austria, and Switzerland at the same season similar customs have prevailed.Thus in the Eifel Mountains, Rhenish Prussia, on the first Sunday in Lent young peopleused to collect straw and brushwood from house to house. These they carried to aneminence and piled up round a tall, slim beech-tree, to which a piece of wood was fastenedat right angles to form a cross. The structure was known as the “hut” or “castle.” Fire wasset to it and the young people marched round the blazing “castle” bareheaded, eachcarrying a lighted torch and praying aloud. Sometimes a straw-man was burned in the“hut.” People observed the direction in which the smoke blew from the fire. If it blewtowards the corn-fields, it was a sign that the harvest would be abundant. On the same day,in some parts of the Eifel, a great wheel was made of straw and dragged by three horses tothe top of the hill. Thither the village boys marched at nightfall, set fire to the wheel, andsent it rolling down the slope. At Oberstattfeld the wheel had to be provided by the youngman who was last married. About Echternach in Luxemburg the same ceremony is called“burning the witch.” At Voralberg in the Tyrol, on the first Sunday in Lent, a slenderyoung fir-tree is surrounded with a pile of straw and firewood. To the top of the tree isfastened a human figure called the “witch,” made of old clothes and stuffed withgunpowder. At night the whole is set on fire and boys and girls dance round it, swingingtorches and singing rhymes in which the words “corn in the winnowing-basket, the ploughin the earth” may be distinguished. In Swabia on the first Sunday in Lent a figure calledthe “witch” or the “old wife” or “winter’s grandmother” is made up of clothes and fastenedto a pole. This is stuck in the middle of a pile of wood, to which fire is applied. While the“witch” is burning, the young people throw blazing discs into the air. The discs are thinround pieces of wood, a few inches in diameter, with notched edges to imitate the rays ofthe sun or stars. They have a hole in the middle, by which they are attached to the end of awand. Before the disc is thrown it is set on fire, the wand is swung to and fro, and theimpetus thus communicated to the disc is augmented by dashing the rod sharply against asloping board. The burning disc is thus thrown off, and mounting high into the air,describes a long fiery curve before it reaches the ground. The charred embers of theburned “witch” and discs are taken home and planted in the flax-fields the same night, inthe belief that they will keep vermin from the fields. In the Rhön Mountains, situated on"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"the borders of Hesse and Bavaria, the people used to march to the top of a hill or eminenceon the first Sunday in Lent. Children and lads carried torches, brooms daubed with tar,and poles swathed in straw. A wheel, wrapt in combustibles, was kindled and rolled downthe hill; and the young people rushed about the fields with their burning torches andbrooms, till at last they flung them in a heap, and standing round them, struck up a hymnor a popular song. The object of running about the fields with the blazing torches was to“drive away the wicked sower.” Or it was done in honour of the Virgin, that she mightpreserve the fruits of the earth throughout the year and bless them. In neighbouringvillages of Hesse, between the Rhön and the Vogel Mountains, it is thought that whereverthe burning wheels roll, the fields will be safe from hail and strom.In Switzerland, also, it is or used to be customary to kindle bonfires on high places on theevening of the first Sunday in Lent, and the day is therefore popularly known as SparkSunday. The custom prevailed, for example, throughout the canton of Lucerne. Boys wentabout from house to house begging for wood and straw, then piled the fuel on aconspicuous mountain or hill round about a pole, which bore a straw effigy called “thewitch.” At nightfall the pile was set on fire, and the young folks danced wildly round it,some of them cracking whips or ringing bells; and when the fire burned low enough, theyleaped over it. This was called “burning the witch.” In some parts of the canton also theyused to wrap old wheels in straw and thorns, put a light to them, and send them rolling andblazing down hill. The more bonfires could be seen sparkling and flaring in the darkness,the more fruitful was the year expected to be; and the higher the dancers leaped beside orover the fire, the higher, it was thought, would grow the flax. In some districts it was thelast married man or woman who must kindle the bonfire.It seems hardly possible to separate from these bonfires, kindled on the first Sunday inLent, the fires in which, about the same season, the effigy called Death is burned as part ofthe ceremony of “carrying out Death.” We have seen that at Spachendorf, in AustrianSilesia, on the morning of Rupert’s Day (Shrove Tuesday?), a straw-man, dressed in a furcoat and a fur cap, is laid in a hole outside the village and there burned, and that while it isblazing every one seeks to snatch a fragment of it, which he fastens to a branch of thehighest tree in his garden or buries in his field, believing that this will make the crops togrow better. The ceremony is known as the “burying of Death.” Even when the straw-manis not designated as Death, the meaning of the observance is probably the same; for thename Death, as I have tried to show, does not express the original intention of theceremony. At Cobern in the Eifel Mountains the lads make up a straw-man on ShroveTuesday. The effigy is formally tried and accused of having perpetrated all the thefts thathave been committed in the neighbourhood throughout the year. Being condemned todeath, the straw-man is led through the village, shot, and burned upon a pyre. They danceround the blazing pile, and the last bride must leap over it. In Oldenburg on the evening ofShrove Tuesday people used to make long bundles of straw, which they set on fire, andthen ran about the fields waving them, shrieking, and singing wild songs. Finally theyburned a straw-man on the field. In the district of Düsseldorf the straw-man burned onShrove Tuesday was made of an unthreshed sheaf of corn. On the first Monday after thespring equinox the urchins of Zurich drag a straw-man on a little cart through the streets,while at the same time the girls carry about a May-tree. When vespers ring, the straw-manis burned. In the district of Aachen on Ash Wednesday, a man used to be encased in peas-"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"straw and taken to an appointed place. Here he slipped quietly out of his straw casing,which was then burned, the children thinking that it was the man who was being burned.In the Val di Ledro (Tyrol) on the last day of the Carnival a figure is made up of straw andbrushwood and then burned. The figure is called the Old Woman, and the ceremony“burning the Old Woman.”3. The Easter FiresANOTHER occasion on which these fire-festivals are held is Easter Eve, the Saturdaybefore Easter Sunday. On that day it has been customary in Catholic countries toextinguish all the lights in the churches, and then to make a new fire, sometimes with flintand steel, sometimes with a burning-glass. At this fire is lit the great Paschal or Eastercandle, which is then used to rekindle all the extinguished lights in the church. In manyparts of Germany a bonfire is also kindled, by means of the new fire, on some open spacenear the church. It is consecrated, and the people bring sticks of oak, walnut, and beech,which they char in the fire, and then take home with them. Some of these charred sticks arethereupon burned at home in a newly-kindled fire, with a prayer that God will preserve thehomestead from fire, lightning, and hail. Thus every house receives “new fire.” Some of thesticks are kept throughout the year and laid on the hearth-fire during heavy thunder-storms to prevent the house from being struck by lightning, or they are inserted in the roofwith the like intention. Others are placed in the fields, gardens, and meadows, with aprayer that God will keep them from blight and hail. Such fields and gardens are thoughtto thrive more than others; the corn and the plants that grow in them are not beaten downby hail, nor devoured by mice, vermin, and beetles; no witch harms them, and the ears ofcorn stand close and full. The charred sticks are also applied to the plough. The ashes ofthe Easter bonfire, together with the ashes of the consecrated palm-branches, are mixedwith the seed at sowing. A wooden figure called Judas is sometimes burned in theconsecrated bonfire, and even where this custom has been abolished the bonfire itself insome places goes by the name of “the burning of Judas.”The essentially pagan character of the Easter fire festival appears plainly both from themode in which it is celebrated by the peasants and from the superstitious beliefs which theyassociate with it. All over Northern and Central Germany, from Altmark and Anhalt onthe east, through Brunswick, Hanover, Oldenburg, the Harz district, and Hesse toWestphalia the Easter bonfires still blaze simultaneously on the hill-tops. As many as fortymay sometimes be counted within sight at once. Long before Easter the young people havebeen busy collecting firewood; every farmer contributes, and tar-barrels, petroleum cases,and so forth go to swell the pile. Neighbouring villages vie with each other as to which shallsend up the greatest blaze. The fires are always kindled, year after year, on the same hill,which accordingly often takes the name of Easter Mountain. It is a fine spectacle to watchfrom some eminence the bonfires flaring up one after another on the neighbouring heights.As far as their light reaches, so far, in the belief of the peasants, the fields will be fruitful,and the houses on which they shine will be safe from conflagration or sickness. AtVolkmarsen and other places in Hesse the people used to observe which way the wind blewthe flames, and then they sowed flax seed in that direction, confident that it would growwell. Brands taken from the bonfires preserve houses from being struck by lightning; and"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"the ashes increase the fertility of the fields, protect them from mice, and mixed with thedrinking-water of cattle make the animals thrive and ensure them against plague. As theflames die down, young and old leap over them, and cattle are sometimes driven throughthe smouldering embers. In some places tar-barrels or wheels wrapt in straw used to be seton fire, and then sent rolling down the hillside. In others the boys light torches and wisps ofstraw at the bonfires and rush about brandishing them in their hands.In Münsterland these Easter fires are always kindled upon certain definite hills, which arehence known as Easter or Paschal Mountains. The whole community assembles about thefire. The young men and maidens, singing Easter hymns, march round and round the fire,till the blaze dies down. Then the girls jump over the fire in a line, one after the other, eachsupported by two young men who hold her hands and run beside her. In the twilight boyswith blazing bundles of straw run over the fields to make them fruitful. At Delmenhorst, inOldenburg, it used to be the custom to cut down two trees, plant them in the ground side byside, and pile twelve tar-barrels against each. Brush-wood was then heaped about the trees,and on the evening of Easter Saturday the boys, after rushing about with blazing bean-poles in their hands, set fire to the whole. At the end of the ceremony the urchins tried toblacken each other and the clothes of grown-up people. In the Altmark it is believed that asfar as the blaze of the Easter bonfire is visible, the corn will grow well throughout the year,and no conflagration will break out. At Braunröde, in the Harz Mountains, it was thecustom to burn squirrels in the Easter bonfire. In the Altmark, bones were burned in it.Near Forchheim, in Upper Franken, a straw-man called the Judas used to be burned in thechurchyards on Easter Saturday. The whole village contributed wood to the pyre on whichhe perished, and the charred sticks were afterwards kept and planted in the fields onWalpurgis Day (the first of May) to preserve the wheat from blight and mildew. About ahundred years ago or more the custom at Althenneberg, in Upper Bavaria, used to be asfollows. On the afternoon of Easter Saturday the lads collected wood, which they piled in acornfield, while in the middle of the pile they set up a tall wooden cross all swathed instraw. After the evening service they lighted their lanterns at the consecrated candle in thechurch, and ran with them at full speed to the pyre, each striving to get there first. The firstto arrive set fire to the heap. No woman or girl might come near the bonfire, but they wereallowed to watch it from a distance. As the flames rose the men and lads rejoiced and mademerry, shouting, “We are burning the Judas!” The man who had been the first to reach thepyre and to kindle it was rewarded on Easter Sunday by the women, who gave himcoloured eggs at the church door. The object of the whole ceremony was to keep off thehail. At other villages of Upper Bavaria the ceremony, which took place between nine andten at night on Easter Saturday, was called “burning the Easter Man.” On a height about amile from the village the young fellows set up a tall cross enveloped in straw, so that itlooked like a man with his arms stretched out. This was the Easter Man. No lad undereighteen years of age might take part in the ceremony. One of the young men stationedhimself beside the Easter Man, holding in his hand a consecrated taper which he hadbrought from the church and lighted. The rest stood at equal intervals in a great circleround the cross. At a given signal they raced thrice round the circle, and then at a secondsignal ran straight at the cross and at the lad with the lighted taper beside it; the one whoreached the goal first had the right of setting fire to the Easter Man. Great was thejubilation while he was burning. When he had been consumed in the flames, three lads"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"were chosen from among the rest, and each of the three drew a circle on the ground with astick thrice round the ashes. Then they all left the spot. On Easter Monday the villagersgathered the ashes and strewed them on their fields; also they planted in the fieldspalmbranches which had been consecrated on Palm Sunday, and sticks which had beencharred and hallowed on Good Friday, all for the purpose of protecting their fields againstshowers of hail. In some parts of Swabia the Easter fires might not be kindled with iron orsteel or flint, but only by the friction of wood.The custom of the Easter fires appears to have prevailed all over Central and WesternGermany from north to south. We find it also in Holland, where the fires were kindled onthe highest eminences, and the people danced round them and leaped through the flames orover the glowing embers. Here too, as often in Germany, the materials for the bonfire werecollected by the young folk from door to door. In many parts of Sweden firearms aredischarged in all directions on Easter Eve, and huge bonfires are lighted on hills andeminences. Some people think that the intention is to keep off the Troll and other evilspirits who are especially active at this season.4. The Beltane FiresIN THE CENTRAL Highlands of Scotland bonfires, known as the Beltane fires, wereformerly kindled with great ceremony on the first of May, and the traces of humansacrifices at them were particularly clear and unequivocal. The custom of lighting thebonfires lasted in various places far into the eighteenth century, and the descriptions of theceremony by writers of that period present such a curious and interesting picture ofancient heathendom surviving in our own country that I will reproduce them in the wordsof their authors. The fullest of the descriptions is the one bequeathed to us by JohnRamsay, laird of Ochtertyre, near Crieff, the patron of Burns and the friend of Sir WalterScott. He says: “But the most considerable of the Druidical festivals is that of Beltane, orMay-day, which was lately observed in some parts of the Highlands with extraordinaryceremonies. ... Like the other public worship of the Druids, the Beltane feast seems to havebeen performed on hills or eminences. They thought it degrading to him whose temple isthe universe, to suppose that he would dwell in any house made with hands. Their sacrificeswere therefore offered in the open air, frequently upon the tops of hills, where they werepresented with the grandest views of nature, and were nearest the seat of warmth andorder. And, according to tradition, such was the manner of celebrating this festival in theHighlands within the last hundred years. But since the decline of superstition, it has beencelebrated by the people of each hamlet on some hill or rising ground around which theircattle were pasturing. Thither the young folks repaired in the morning, and cut a trench,on the summit of which a seat of turf was formed for the company. And in the middle a pileof wood or other fuel was placed, which of old they kindled with tein-eigin—i.e., forced-fireor need-fire. Although, for many years past, they have been contented with common fire,yet we shall now describe the process, because it will hereafter appear that recourse is stillhad to the tein-eigin upon extraordinary emergencies.“The night before, all the fires in the country were carefully extinguished, and nextmorning the materials for exciting this sacred fire were prepared. The most primitive"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"method seems to be that which was used in the islands of Skye, Mull, and Tiree. A well-seasoned plank of oak was procured, in the midst of which a hole was bored. A wimble ofthe same timber was then applied, the end of which they fitted to the hole. But in someparts of the mainland the machinery was different. They used a frame of green wood, of asquare form, in the centre of which was an axle-tree. In some places three times threepersons, in others three times nine, were required for turning round by turns the axle-treeor wimble. If any of them had been guilty of murder, adultery, theft, or other atrociouscrime, it was imagined either that the fire would not kindle, or that it would be devoid of itsusual virtue. So soon as any sparks were emitted by means of the violent friction, theyapplied a species of agaric which grows on old birch-trees, and is very combustible. Thisfire had the appearance of being immediately derived from heaven, and manifold were thevirtues ascribed to it. They esteemed it a preservative against witch-craft, and a sovereignremedy against malignant diseases, both in the human species and in cattle; and by it thestrongest poisons were supposed to have their nature changed.“After kindling the bonfire with the tein-eigin the company prepared their victuals. And assoon as they had finished their meal, they amused themselves a while in singing anddancing round the fire. Towards the close of the entertainment, the person who officiatedas master of the feast produced a large cake baked with eggs and scalloped round the edge,called am bonnach bea-tine—i.e., the Beltane cake. It was divided into a number of pieces,and distributed in great form to the company. There was one particular piece whichwhoever got was called cailleach beal-tine—i.e., the Beltane carline, a term of greatreproach. Upon his being known, part of the company laid hold of him and made a show ofputting him into the fire; but the majority interposing, he was rescued. And in some placesthey laid him flat on the ground, making as if they would quarter him. Afterwards, he waspelted with egg-shells, and retained the odious appellation during the whole year. Andwhile the feast was fresh in people’s memory, they affected to speak of the cailleach beal-tine as dead.”In the parish of Callander, a beautiful district of Western Perthshire, the Beltane customwas still in vogue towards the end of the eighteenth century. It has been described asfollows by the parish minister of the time: “Upon the first day of May, which is calledBeltan, or Baltein day, all the boys in a township or hamlet, meet in the moors. They cut atable in the green sod, of a round figure, by casting a trench in the ground, of suchcircumference as to hold the whole company. They kindle a fire, and dress a repast of eggsand milk in the consistence of a custard. They knead a cake of oatmeal, which is toasted atthe embers against a stone. After the custard is eaten up, they divide the cake into so manyportions, as similar as possible to one another in size and shape, as there are persons in thecompany. They daub one of these portions all over with charcoal, until it be perfectly black.They put all the bits of the cake into a bonnet. Every one, blindfold, draws out a portion.He who holds the bonnet, is entitled to the last bit. Whoever draws the black bit, is thedevoted person who is to be sacrificed to Baal, whose favour they mean to implore, inrendering the year productive of the sustenance of man and beast. There is little doubt ofthese inhuman sacrifices having been once offered in this country, as well as in the east,although they now pass from the act of sacrificing, and only compel the devoted person toleap three times through the flames; with which the ceremonies of this festival are closed.”"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"Thomas Pennant, who travelled in Perthshire in the year 1769, tells us that “on the first ofMay, the herdsmen of every village hold their Bel-tien, a rural sacrifice. They cut a squaretrench on the ground, leaving the turf in the middle; on that they make a fire of wood, onwhich they dress a large caudle of eggs, butter, oatmeal and milk; and bring besides theingredients of the caudle, plenty of beer and whisky; for each of the company mustcontribute something. The rites begin with spilling some of the caudle on the ground, byway of libation: on that every one takes a cake of oatmeal, upon which are raised ninesquare knobs, each dedicated to some particular being, the supposed preserver of theirflocks and herds, or to some particular animal, the real destroyer of them: each personthen turns his face to the fire, breaks off a knob, and flinging it over his shoulders, says,‘This I give to thee, preserve thou my horses; this to thee, preserve thou my sheep; and soon.’ After that, they use the same ceremony to the noxious animals: ‘This I give to thee, Ofox! spare thou my lambs; this to thee, O hooded crow! this to thee, O eagle!’ When theceremony is over, they dine on the caudle; and after the feast is finished, what is left is hidby two persons deputed for that purpose; but on the next Sunday they reassemble, andfinish the reliques of the first entertainment.”Another writer of the eighteenth century has described the Beltane festival as it was held inthe parish of Logierait in Perthshire. He says: “On the first of May, O.S., a festival calledBeltan is annually held here. It is chiefly celebrated by the cow-herds, who assemble byscores in the fields, to dress a dinner for themselves, of boiled milk and eggs. These dishesthey eat with a sort of cakes baked for the occasion, and having small lumps in the form ofnipples, raised all over the surface.” In this last account no mention is made of bonfires, butthey were probably lighted, for a contemporary writer informs us that in the parish ofKirkmichael, which adjoins the parish of Logierait on the east, the custom of lighting a firein the fields and baking a consecrated cake on the first of May was not quite obsolete in histime. We may conjecture that the cake with knobs was formerly used for the purpose ofdetermining who should be the “Beltane carline” or victim doomed to the flames. A trace ofthis custom survived, perhaps, in the custom of baking oatmeal cakes of a special kind androlling them down hill about noon on the first of May; for it was thought that the personwhose cake broke as it rolled would die or be unfortunate within the year. These cakes, orbannocks as we call them in Scotland, were baked in the usual way, but they were washedover with a thin batter composed of whipped egg, milk or cream, and a little oatmeal. Thiscustom appears to have prevailed at or near Kingussie in Inverness-shire.In the north-east of Scotland the Beltane fires were still kindled in the latter half of theeighteenth century; the herdsmen of several farms used to gather dry wood, kindle it, anddance three times “southways” about the burning pile. But in this region, according to alater authority, the Beltane fires were lit not on the first but on the second of May, OldStyle. They were called bone-fires. The people believed that on that evening and night thewitches were abroad and busy casting spells on cattle and stealing cows’ milk. Tocounteract their machinations, pieces of rowan-tree and woodbine, but especially of rowan-tree, were placed over the doors of the cow-houses, and fires were kindled by every farmerand cottar. Old thatch, straw, furze, or broom was piled in a heap and set on fire a littleafter sunset. While some of the bystanders kept tossing the blazing mass, others hoistedportions of it on pitchforks or poles and ran hither and thither, holding them as high asthey could. Meantime the young people danced round the fire or ran through the smoke"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"shouting, “Fire! blaze and burn the witches; fire! fire! burn the witches.” In some districtsa large round cake of oat or barley meal was rolled through the ashes. When all the fuelwas consumed, the people scattered the ashes far and wide, and till the night grew quitedark they continued to run through them, crying, “Fire! burn the witches.”In the Hebrides “the Beltane bannock is smaller than that made at St. Michael’s, but ismade in the same way; it is no longer made in Uist, but Father Allan remembers seeing hisgrandmother make one about twenty-five years ago. There was also a cheese made,generally on the first of May, which was kept to the next Beltane as a sort of charm againstthe bewitching of milk-produce. The Beltane customs seem to have been the same aselsewhere. Every fire was put out and a large one lit on the top of the hill, and the cattledriven round it sunwards (dessil), to keep off murrain all the year. Each man would takehome fire wherewith to kindle his own.”In Wales also the custom of lighting Beltane fires at the beginning of May used to beobserved, but the day on which they were kindled varied from the eve of May Day to thethird of May. The flame was sometimes elicited by the friction of two pieces of oak, asappears from the following description. “The fire was done in this way. Nine men wouldturn their pockets inside out, and see that every piece of money and all metals were offtheir persons. Then the men went into the nearest woods, and collected sticks of ninedifferent kinds of trees. These were carried to the spot where the fire had to be built. Therea circle was cut in the sod, and the sticks were set crosswise. All around the circle thepeople stood and watched the proceedings. One of the men would then take two bits of oak,and rub them together until a flame was kindled. This was applied to the sticks, and soon alarge fire was made. Sometimes two fires were set up side by side. These fires, whether oneor two, were called coelcerth or bonfire. Round cakes of oatmeal and brown meal were splitin four, and placed in a small flour-bag, and everybody present had to pick out a portion.The last bit in the bag fell to the lot of the bag-holder. Each person who chanced to pick upa piece of brown-meal cake was compelled to leap three times over the flames, or to runthrice between the two fires, by which means the people thought they were sure of aplentiful harvest. Shouts and screams of those who had to face the ordeal could be heardever so far, and those who chanced to pick the oatmeal portions sang and danced andclapped their hands in approval, as the holders of the brown bits leaped three times overthe flames, or ran three times between the two fires.”The belief of the people that by leaping thrice over the bonfires or running thrice betweenthem they ensured a plentiful harvest is worthy of note. The mode in which this result wassupposed to be brought about is indicated by another writer on Welsh folk-lore, accordingto whom it used to be held that “the bonfires lighted in May or Midsummer protected thelands from sorcery, so that good crops would follow. The ashes were also consideredvaluable as charms.” Hence it appears that the heat of the fires was thought to fertilise thefields, not directly by quickening the seeds in the ground, but indirectly by counteractingthe baleful influence of witchcraft or perhaps by burning up the persons of the witches.The Beltane fires seem to have been kindled also in Ireland, for Cormac, “or somebody inhis name, says that belltaine, May-day, was so called from the ‘lucky fire,’ or the ‘twofires,’ which the druids of Erin used to make on that day with great incantations; andcattle, he adds, used to be brought to those fires, or to be driven between them, as a"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"safeguard against the diseases of the year.” The custom of driving cattle through orbetween fires on May Day or the eve of May Day persisted in Ireland down to a time withinliving memory.The first of May is a great popular festival in the more midland and southern parts ofSweden. On the eve of the festival huge bonfires, which should be lighted by striking twoflints together, blaze on all the hills and knolls. Every large hamlet has its own fire, roundwhich the young people dance in a ring. The old folk notice whether the flames incline tothe north or to the south. In the former case, the spring will be cold and backward; in thelatter, it will be mild and genial. In Bohemia, on the eve of May Day, young people kindlefires on hills and eminences, at crossways, and in pastures, and dance round them. Theyleap over the glowing embers or even through the flames. The ceremony is called “burningthe witches.” In some places an effigy representing a witch used to be burnt in the bonfire.We have to remember that the eve of May Day is the notorious Walpurgis Night, when thewitches are everywhere speeding unseen through the air on their hellish errands. On thiswitching night children in Voigtland also light bonfires on the heights and leap over them.Moreover, they wave burning brooms or toss them into the air. So far as the light of thebonfire reaches, so far will a blessing rest on the fields. The kindling of the fires onWalpurgis Night is called “driving away the witches.” The custom of kindling fires on theeve of May Day (Walpurgis Night) for the purpose of burning the witches is, or used to be,widespread in the Tyrol, Moravia, Saxony and Silesia.5. The Midsummer FiresBUT THE SEASON at which these firefestivals have been most generally held all overEurope is the summer solstice, that is Midsummer Eve (the twenty-third of June) orMidsummer day (the twenty-fourth of June). A faint tinge of Christianity has been given tothem by naming Midsummer Day after St. John the Baptist, but we cannot doubt that thecelebration dates from a time long before the beginning of our era. The summer solstice, orMidsummer Day, is the great turning-point in the sun’s career, when, after climbing higherand higher day by day in the sky, the luminary stops and thenceforth retraces his stepsdown the heavenly road. Such a moment could not but be regarded with anxiety byprimitive man so soon as he began to observe and ponder the courses of the great lightsacross the celestial vault; and having still to learn his own powerlessness in face of the vastcyclic changes of nature, he may have fancied that he could help the sun in his seemingdecline—could prop his failing steps and rekindle the sinking flame of the red lamp in hisfeeble hand. In some such thoughts as these the midsummer festivals of our Europeanpeasantry may perhaps have taken their rise. Whatever their origin, they have prevailed allover this quarter of the globe, from Ireland on the west to Russia on the east, and fromNorway and Sweden on the north to Spain and Greece on the south. According to amediæval writer, the three great features of the midsummer celebration were the bonfires,the procession with torches round the fields, and the custom of rolling a wheel. He tells usthat boys burned bones and filth of various kinds to make a foul smoke, and that the smokedrove away certain noxious dragons which at this time, excited by the summer heat,copulated in the air and poisoned the wells and rivers by dropping their seed into them;and he explains the custom of trundling a wheel to mean that the sun, having now reached"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"the highest point in the ecliptic, begins thenceforward to descend.The main features of the midsummer fire-festival resemble those which we have found tocharacterise the vernal festivals of fire. The similarity of the two sets of ceremonies willplainly appear from the following examples.A writer of the first half of the sixteenth century informs us that in almost every village andtown of Germany public bonfires were kindled on the Eve of St. John, and young and old,of both sexes, gathered about them and passed the time in dancing and singing. People onthis occasion wore chaplets of mugwort and vervain, and they looked at the fire throughbunches of larkspur which they held in their hands, believing that this would preserve theireyes in a healthy state throughout the year. As each departed, he threw the mugwort andvervain into the fire, saying, “May all my ill-luck depart and be burnt up with these.” AtLower Konz, a village situated on a hillside overlooking the Moselle, the midsummerfestival used to be celebrated as follows. A quantity of straw was collected on the top of thesteep Stromberg Hill. Every inhabitant, or at least every householder, had to contribute hisshare of straw to the pile. At nightfall the whole male population, men and boys, musteredon the top of the hill; the women and girls were not allowed to join them, but had to takeup their position at a certain spring half-way down the slope. On the summit stood a hugewheel completely encased in some of the straw which had been jointly contributed by thevillagers; the rest of the straw was made into torches. From each side of the wheel the axle-tree projected about three feet, thus furnishing handles to the lads who were to guide it inits descent. The mayor of the neighbouring town of Sierck, who always received a basket ofcherries for his services, gave the signal; a lighted torch was applied to the wheel, and as itburst into flame, two young fellows, strong-limbed and swift of foot, seized the handles andbegan running with it down the slope. A great shout went up. Every man and boy waved ablazing torch in the air, and took care to keep it alight so long as the wheel was trundlingdown the hill. The great object of the young men who guided the wheel was to plunge itblazing into the water of the Moselle; but they rarely succeeded in their efforts, for thevineyards which cover the greater part of the declivity impeded their progress, and thewheel was often burned out before it reached the river. As it rolled past the women andgirls at the spring, they raised cries of joy which were answered by the men on the top ofthe mountain; and the shouts were echoed by the inhabitants of neighbouring villages whowatched the spectacle from their hills on the opposite bank of the Moselle. If the fiery wheelwas successfully conveyed to the bank of the river and extinguished in the water, the peoplelooked for an abundant vintage that year, and the inhabitants of Konz had the right toexact a waggon-load of white wine from the surrounding vineyards. On the other hand,they believed that, if they neglected to perform the ceremony, the cattle would be attackedby giddiness and convulsions and would dance in their stalls.Down at least to the middle of the nineteenth century the midsummer fires used to blaze allover Upper Bavaria. They were kindled especially on the mountains, but also far and widein the lowlands, and we are told that in the darkness and stillness of night the movinggroups, lit up by the flickering glow of the flames, presented an impressive spectacle. Cattlewere driven through the fire to cure the sick animals and to guard such as were soundagainst plague and harm of every kind throughout the year. Many a householder on thatday put out the fire on the domestic hearth and rekindled it by means of a brand taken"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"from the midsummer bonfire. The people judged of the height to which the flax wouldgrow in the year by the height to which the flames of the bonfire rose; and whoever leapedover the burning pile was sure not to suffer from backache in reaping the corn at harvest.In many parts of Bavaria it was believed that the flax would grow as high as the youngpeople leaped over the fire. In others the old folk used to plant three charred sticks fromthe bonfire in the fields, believing that this would make the flax grow tall. Elsewhere anextinguished brand was put in the roof of the house to protect it against fire. In the townsabout Würzburg the bonfires used to be kindled in the market-places, and the youngpeople who jumped over them wore garlands of flowers, especially of mugwort andvervain, and carried sprigs of larkspur in their hands. They thought that such as looked atthe fire holding a bit of larkspur before their face would be troubled by no malady of theeyes throughout the year. Further, it was customary at Würzburg, in the sixteenth century,for the bishop’s followers to throw burning discs of wood into the air from a mountainwhich overhangs the town. The discs were discharged by means of flexible rods, and intheir flight through the darkness presented the appearance of fiery dragons.Similarly in Swabia, lads and lasses, hand in hand, leap over the midsummer bonfire,praying that the hemp may grow three ells high, and they set fire to wheels of straw andsend them rolling down the hill. Sometimes, as the people sprang over the midsummerbonfire they cried out, “Flax, flax! may the flax this year grow seven ells high!” AtRottenburg a rude effigy in human form, called the Angelman, used to be enveloped inflowers and then burnt in the midsummer fire by boys, who afterwards leaped over theglowing embers.So in Baden the children collected fuel from house to house for the midsummer bonfire onSt. John’s Day; and lads and lasses leaped over the fire in couples. Here, as elsewhere, aclose connexion was traced between these bonfires and the harvest. In some places it wasthought that those who leaped over the fires would not suffer from backache at reaping.Sometimes, as the young folk sprang over the flames, they cried, “Grow, that the hempmay be three ells high!” This notion that the hemp or the corn would grow as high as theflames blazed or as the people jumped over them, seems to have been widespread in Baden.It was held that the parents of the young people who bounded highest over the fire wouldhave the most abundant harvest; and on the other hand, if a man contributed nothing tothe bonfire, it was imagined that there would be no blessing on his crops, and that his hempin particular would never grow. At Edersleben, near Sangerhausen, a high pole wasplanted in the ground and a tarbarrel was hung from it by a chain which reached to theground. The barrel was then set on fire and swung round the pole amid shouts of joy.In Denmark and Norway also midsummer fires were kindled on St. John’s Eve on roads,open spaces, and hills. People in Norway thought that the fires banished sickness fromamong the cattle. Even yet the fires are said to be lighted all over Norway on MidsummerEve. They are kindled in order to keep off the witches, who are said to be flying from allparts that night to the Blocksberg, where the big witch lives. In Sweden the Eve of St. John(St. Hans) is the most joyous night of the whole year. Throughout some parts of thecountry, especially in the provinces of Bohus and Scania and in districts bordering onNorway, it is celebrated by the frequent discharge of firearms and by huge bonfires,formerly called Balder’s Balefires (Balder’s Bălar), which are kindled at dusk on hills and"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"eminences and throw a glare of light over the surrounding landscape. The people danceround the fires and leap over or through them. In parts of Norrland on St. John’s Eve thebonfires are lit at the cross-roads. The fuel consists of nine different sorts of wood, and thespectators cast into the flames a kind of toad-stool (Bäran) in order to counteract the powerof the Trolls and other evil spirits, who are believed to be abroad that night; for at thatmystic season the mountains open and from their cavernous depths the uncanny crewpours forth to dance and disport themselves for a time. The peasants believe that shouldany of the Trolls be in the vicinity they will show themselves; and if an animal, for examplea he or she goat, happens to be seen near the blazing, crackling pile, the peasants are firmlypersuaded that it is no other than the Evil One in person. Further, it deserves to beremarked that in Sweden St. John’s Eve is a festival of water as well as of fire; for certainholy springs are then supposed to be endowed with wonderful medicinal virtues, and manysick people resort to them for the healing of their infirmities.In Austria the midsummer customs and superstitions resemble those of Germany. Thus insome parts of the Tyrol bonfires are kindled and burning discs hurled into the air. In thelower valley of the Inn a tatterdemalion effigy is carted about the village on MidsummerDay and then burned. He is called the Lotter, which has been corrupted into Luther. AtAmbras, one of the villages where Martin Luther is thus burned in effigy, they say that ifyou go through the village between eleven and twelve on St. John’s Night and washyourself in three wells, you will see all who are to die in the following year. At Gratz on St.John’s Eve (the twenty-third of June) the common people used to make a puppet called theTatermann, which they dragged to the bleaching ground, and pelted with burning besomstill it took fire. At Reutte, in the Tyrol, people believed that the flax would grow as high asthey leaped over the midsummer bonfire, and they took pieces of charred wood from thefire and stuck them in their flax-fields the same night, leaving them there till the flaxharvest had been got in. In Lower Austria bonfires are kindled on the heights, and the boyscaper round them, brandishing lighted torches drenched in pitch. Whoever jumps thriceacross the fire will not suffer from fever within the year. Cart-wheels are often smearedwith pitch, ignited, and sent rolling and blazing down the hillsides.All over Bohemia bonfires still burn on Midsummer Eve. In the afternoon boys go aboutwith handcarts from house to house collecting fuel and threatening with evil consequencesthe curmudgeons who refuse them a dole. Sometimes the young men fell a tall straight firin the woods and set it up on a height, where the girls deck it with nosegays, wreaths ofleaves, and red ribbons. Then brushwood is piled about it, and at nightfall the whole is seton fire. While the flames break out, the young men climb the tree and fetch down thewreaths which the girls had placed on it. After that lads and lasses stand on opposite sidesof the fire and look at one another through the wreaths to see whether they will be true toeach other and marry within the year. Also the girls throw the wreaths across the flames tothe men, and woe to the awkward swain who fails to catch the wreath thrown him by hissweetheart. When the blaze has died down, each couple takes hands and leaps thrice acrossthe fire. He or she who does so will be free from ague throughout the year, and the flax willgrow as high as the young folks leap. A girl who sees nine bonfires on Midsummer Eve willmarry before the year is out. The singed wreaths are carried home and carefully preservedthroughout the year. During thunderstorms a bit of the wreath is burned on the hearthwith a prayer; some of it is given to kine that are sick or calving, and some of it serves to"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"fumigate house and cattle-stall, that man and beast may keep hale and well. Sometimes anold cart-wheel is smeared with resin, ignited, and sent rolling down the hill. Often the boyscollect all the worn-out besoms they can get hold of, dip them in pitch, and having set themon fire wave them about or throw them high into the air. Or they rush down the hillside introops, brandishing the flaming brooms and shouting. The stumps of the brooms andembers from the fire are preserved and stuck in cabbage gardens to protect the cabbagesfrom caterpillars and gnats. Some people insert charred sticks and ashes from themidsummer bonfire in their sown fields and meadows, in their gardens and the roofs oftheir houses, as a talisman against lightning and foul weather; or they fancy that the ashesplaced in the roof will prevent any fire from breaking out in the house. In some districtsthey crown or gird themselves with mugwort while the midsummer fire is burning, for thisis supposed to be a protection against ghosts, witches, and sickness; in particular, a wreathof mugwort is a sure preventive of sore eyes. Sometimes the girls look at the bonfiresthrough garlands of wild flowers, praying the fire to strengthen their eyes and eyelids. Shewho does this thrice will have no sore eyes all that year. In some parts of Bohemia theyused to drive the cows through the midsummer fire to guard them against witchcraft.In Slavonic countries, also, the midsummer festival is celebrated with similar rites. Wehave already seen that in Russia on the Eve of St. John young men and maidens jump overa bonfire in couples carrying a straw effigy of Kupalo in their arms. In some parts ofRussia an image of Kupalo is burnt or thrown into a stream on St. John’s Night. Again, insome districts of Russia the young folk wear garlands of flowers and girdles of holy herbswhen they spring through the smoke or flames; and sometimes they drive the cattle alsothrough the fire in order to protect the animals against wizards and witches, who are thenravenous after milk. In Little Russia a stake is driven into the ground on St. John’s Night,wrapt in straw, and set on fire. As the flames rise the peasant women throw birchen boughsinto them, saying, “May my flax be as tall as this bough!” In Ruthenia the bonfires arelighted by a flame procured by the friction of wood. While the elders of the party areengaged in thus “churning” the fire, the rest maintain a respectful silence; but when theflame bursts from the wood, they break forth into joyous songs. As soon as the bonfires arekindled, the young people take hands and leap in pairs through the smoke, if not throughthe flames; and after that the cattle in their turn are driven through the fire.In many parts of Prussia and Lithuania great fires are kindled on Midsummer Eve. All theheights are ablaze with them, as far as the eye can see. The fires are supposed to be aprotection against witchcraft, thunder, hail, and cattle disease, especially if next morningthe cattle are driven over the places where the fires burned. Above all, the bonfires ensurethe farmer against the arts of witches, who try to steal the milk from his cows by charmsand spells. That is why next morning you may see the young fellows who lit the bonfiregoing from house to house and receiving jugfuls of milk. And for the same reason they stickburs and mugwort on the gate or the hedge through which the cows go to pasture, becausethat is supposed to be a preservative against witchcraft. In Masuren, a district of EasternPrussia inhabited by a branch of the Polish family, it is the custom on the evening ofMidsummer Day to put out all the fires in the village. Then an oaken stake is driven intothe ground and a wheel is fixed on it as on an axle. This wheel the villagers, working byrelays, cause to revolve with great rapidity till fire is produced by friction. Every one takeshome a lighted brand from the new fire and with it rekindles the fire on the domestic"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"hearth. In Serbia on Midsummer Eve herdsmen light torches of birch bark and marchround the sheepfolds and cattle-stalls; then they climb the hills and there allow the torchesto burn out.Among the Magyars in Hungary the midsummer fire-festival is marked by the samefeatures that meet us in so many parts of Europe. On Midsummer Eve in many places it iscustomary to kindle bonfires on heights and to leap over them, and from the manner inwhich the young people leap the bystanders predict whether they will marry soon. On thisday also many Hungarian swineherds make fire by rotating a wheel round a wooden axlewrapt in hemp, and through the fire thus made they drive their pigs to preserve them fromsickness.The Esthonians of Russia, who, like the Magyars, belong to the great Turanian family ofmankind, also celebrate the summer solstice in the usual way. They think that the St.John’s fire keeps witches from the cattle, and they say that he who does not come to it willhave his barley full of thistles and his oats full of weeds. In the Esthonian island of Oesel,while they throw fuel into the midsummer fire, they call out, “Weeds to the fire, flax to thefield,” or they fling three billets into the flames, saying, “Flax grow long!” And they takecharred sticks from the bonfire home with them and keep them to make the cattle thrive.In some parts of the island the bonfire is formed by piling brushwood and othercombustibles round a tree, at the top of which a flag flies. Whoever succeeds in knockingdown the flag with a pole before it begins to burn will have good luck. Formerly thefestivities lasted till daybreak, and ended in scenes of debauchery which looked doublyhideous by the growing light of a summer morning.When we pass from the east to the west of Europe we still find the summer solsticecelebrated with rites of the same general character. Down to about the middle of thenineteenth century the custom of lighting bonfires at midsummer prevailed so commonly inFrance that there was hardly a town or a village, we are told, where they were not kindled.People danced round and leaped over them, and took charred sticks from the bonfire homewith them to protect the houses against lightning, conflagrations, and spells.In Brittany, apparently, the custom of the midsummer bonfires is kept up to this day.When the flames have died down, the whole assembly kneels round about the bonfire andan old man prays aloud. Then they all rise and march thrice round the fire; at the thirdturn they stop and every one picks up a pebble and throws it on the burning pile. After thatthey disperse. In Brittany and Berry it is believed that a girl who dances round ninemidsummer bonfires will marry within the year. In the valley of the Orne the custom wasto kindle the bonfire just at the moment when the sun was about to dip below the horizon;and the peasants drove their cattle through the fires to protect them against witchcraft,especially against the spells of witches and wizards who attempted to steal the milk andbutter. At Jumièges in Normandy, down to the first half of the nineteenth century, themidsummer festival was marked by certain singular features which bore the stamp of avery high antiquity. Every year, on the twenty-third of June, the Eve of St. John, theBrotherhood of the Green Wolf chose a new chief or master, who had always to be takenfrom the hamlet of Conihout. On being elected, the new head of the brotherhood assumedthe title of the Green Wolf, and donned a peculiar costume consisting of a long greenmantle and a very tall green hat of a conical shape and without a brim. Thus arrayed he"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"stalked solemnly at the head of the brothers, chanting the hymn of St. John, the crucifixand holy banner leading the way, to a place called Chouquet. Here the procession was metby the priest, precentors, and choir, who conducted the brotherhood to the parish church.After hearing mass the company adjourned to the house of the Green Wolf, where a simplerepast was served up to them. At night a bonfire was kindled to the sound of hand-bells bya young man and a young woman, both decked with flowers. Then the Green Wolf and hisbrothers, with their hoods down on their shoulders and holding each other by the hand,ran round the fire after the man who had been chosen to be the Green Wolf of thefollowing year. Though only the first and the last man of the chain had a hand free, theirbusiness was to surround and seize thrice the future Green Wolf, who in his efforts toescape belaboured the brothers with a long wand which he carried. When at last theysucceeded in catching him they carried him to the burning pile and made as if they wouldthrow him on it. This ceremony over, they returned to the house of the Green Wolf, wherea supper, still of the most meagre fare, was set before them. Up till midnight a sort ofreligious solemnity prevailed. But at the stroke of twelve all this was changed. Constraintgave way to license; pious hymns were replaced by Bacchanalian ditties, and the shrillquavering notes of the village fiddle hardly rose above the roar of voices that went up fromthe merry brotherhood of the Green Wolf. Next day, the twenty-fourth of June orMidsummer Day, was celebrated by the same personages with the same noisy gaiety. Oneof the ceremonies consisted in parading, to the sound of musketry, an enormous loaf ofconsecrated bread, which, rising in tiers, was surmounted by a pyramid of verdureadorned with ribbons. After that the holy hand-bells, deposited on the step of the altar,were entrusted as insignia of office to the man who was to be the Green Wolf next year.At Château-Thierry, in the department of Aisne, the custom of lighting bonfires anddancing round them at the midsummer festival of St. John lasted down to about 1850; thefires were kindled especially when June had been rainy, and the people thought that thelighting of the bonfires would cause the rain to cease. In the Vosges it is still customary tokindle bonfires upon the hill-tops on Midsummer Eve; the people believe that the fires helpto preserve the fruits of the earth and ensure good crops.Bonfires were lit in almost all the hamlets of Poitou on the Eve of St. John. People marchedround them thrice, carrying a branch of walnut in their hand. Shepherdesses and childrenpassed sprigs of mullein (verbascum) and nuts across the flames; the nuts were supposed tocure toothache, and the mullein to protect the cattle from sickness and sorcery. When thefire died down people took some of the ashes home with them, either to keep them in thehouse as a preservative against thunder or to scatter them on the fields for the purpose ofdestroying corn-cockles and darnel. In Poitou also it used to be customary on the Eve of St.John to trundle a blazing wheel wrapt in straw over the fields to fertilise them.In the mountainous part of Comminges, a province of Southern France, the midsummerfire is made by splitting open the trunk of a tall tree, stuffing the crevice with shavings, andigniting the whole. A garland of flowers is fastened to the top of the tree, and at the momentwhen the fire is lighted the man who was last married has to climb up a ladder and bringthe flowers down. In the flat parts of the same district the materials of the midsummerbonfires consist of fuel piled in the usual way; but they must be put together by men whohave been married since the last midsummer festival, and each of these benedicts is obliged"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"to lay a wreath of flowers on the top of the pile.In Provence the midsummer fires are still popular. Children go from door to door beggingfor fuel, and they are seldom sent empty away. Formerly the priest, the mayor, and thealdermen used to walk in procession to the bonfire, and even deigned to light it; after whichthe assembly marched thrice round the burning pile. At Aix a nominal king, chosen fromamong the youth for his skill in shooting at a popinjay, presided over the midsummerfestival. He selected his own officers, and escorted by a brilliant train marched to thebonfire, kindled it, and was the first to dance round it. Next day he distributed largesse tohis followers. His reign lasted a year, during which he enjoyed certain privileges. He wasallowed to attend the mass celebrated by the commander of the Knights of St. John on St.John’s Day; the right of hunting was accorded to him, and soldiers might not be quarteredin his house. At Marseilles also on this day one of the guilds chose a king of the badache ordouble axe; but it does not appear that he kindled the bonfire, which is said to have beenlighted with great ceremony by the préfet and other authorities.In Belgium the custom of kindling the midsummer bonfires has long disappeared from thegreat cities, but it is still kept up in rural districts and small towns. In that country the Eveof St. Peter’s Day (the twenty-ninth of June) is celebrated by bonfires and dances exactlylike those which commemorate St. John’s Eve. Some people say that the fires of St. Peter,like those of St. John, are lighted in order to drive away dragons. In French Flanders downto 1789 a straw figure representing a man was always burned in the midsummer bonfire,and the figure of a woman was burned on St. Peter’s Day, the twenty-ninth of June. InBelgium people jump over the midsummer bonfires as a preventive of colic, and they keepthe ashes at home to hinder fire from breaking out.The custom of lighting bonfires at midsummer has been observed in many parts of our owncountry, and as usual people danced round and leaped over them. In Wales three or ninedifferent kinds of wood and charred faggots carefully preserved from the last midsummerwere deemed necessary to build the bonfire, which was generally done on rising ground. Inthe Vale of Glamorgan a cart-wheel swathed in straw used to be ignited and sent rollingdown the hill. If it kept alight all the way down and blazed for a long time, an abundantharvest was expected. On Midsummer Eve people in the Isle of Man were wont to lightfires to the windward of every field, so that the smoke might pass over the corn; and theyfolded their cattle and carried blazing furze or gorse round them several times. In Irelandcattle, especially barren cattle, were driven through the midsummer fires, and the asheswere thrown on the fields to fertilise them, or live coals were carried into them to preventblight. In Scotland the traces of midsummer fires are few; but at that season in thehighlands of Perthshire cowherds used to go round their folds thrice, in the direction of thesun, with lighted torches. This they did to purify the flocks and herds and to keep themfrom falling sick.The practice of lighting bonfires on Midsummer Eve and dancing or leaping over them is,or was till recently, common all over Spain and in some parts of Italy and Sicily. In Maltagreat fires are kindled in the streets and squares of the towns and villages on the Eve of St.John (Midsummer Eve); formerly the Grand Master of the Order of St. John used on thatevening to set fire to a heap of pitch barrels placed in front of the sacred Hospital. InGreece, too, the custom of kindling fires on St. John’s Eve and jumping over them is said to"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"be still universal. One reason assigned for it is a wish to escape from the fleas. According toanother account, the women cry out, as they leap over the fire, “I leave my sins behindme.” In Lesbos the fires on St. John’s Eve are usually lighted by threes, and the peoplespring thrice over them, each with a stone on his head, saying, “I jump the hare’s fire, myhead a stone!” In Calymnos the midsummer fire is supposed to ensure abundance in thecoming year as well as deliverance from fleas. The people dance round the fires singing,with stones on their heads, and then jump over the blaze or the glowing embers. When thefire is burning low, they throw the stones into it; and when it is nearly out, they makecrosses on their legs and then go straightway and bathe in the sea.The custom of kindling bonfires on Midsummer Day or on Midsummer Eve is widelyspread among the Mohammedan peoples of North Africa, particularly in Morocco andAlgeria; it is common both to the Berbers and to many of the Arabs or Arabic-speakingtribes. In these countries Midsummer Day (the twenty-fourth of June, Old Style) is calledl’ánsăra. The fires are lit in the courtyards, at cross-roads, in the fields, and sometimes onthe threshing-floors. Plants which in burning give out a thick smoke and an aromatic smellare much sought after for fuel on these occasions; among the plants used for the purposeare giant-fennel, thyme, rue, chervil-seed, camomile, geranium, and penny-royal. Peopleexpose themselves, and especially their children, to the smoke, and drive it towards theorchards and the crops. Also they leap across the fires; in some places everybody ought torepeat the leap seven times. Moreover they take burning brands from the fires and carrythem through the houses in order to fumigate them. They pass things through the fire, andbring the sick into contact with it, while they utter prayers for their recovery. The ashes ofthe bonfires are also reputed to possess beneficial properties; hence in some places peoplerub their hair or their bodies with them. In some places they think that by leaping over thefires they rid themselves of all misfortune, and that childless couples thereby obtainoffspring. Berbers of the Rif province, in Northern Morocco, make great use of fires atmidsummer for the good of themselves, their cattle, and their fruit-trees. They jump overthe bonfires in the belief that this will preserve them in good health, and they light firesunder fruit-trees to keep the fruit from falling untimely. And they imagine that by rubbinga paste of the ashes on their hair they prevent the hair from falling off their heads. In allthese Moroccan customs, we are told, the beneficial effect is attributed wholly to the smoke,which is supposed to be endued with a magical quality that removes misfortune from men,animals, fruit-trees and crops.The celebration of a midsummer festival by Mohammedan peoples is particularlyremarkable, because the Mohammedan calendar, being purely lunar and uncorrected byintercalation, necessarily takes no note of festivals which occupy fixed points in the solaryear; all strictly Mohammedan feasts, being pinned to the moon, slide gradually with thatluminary through the whole period of the earth’s revolution about the sun. This fact ofitself seems to prove that among the Mohammedan peoples of Northern Africa, as amongthe Christian peoples of Europe, the midsummer festival is quite independent of thereligion which the people publicly profess, and is a relic of a far older paganism."},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"6. The Hallowe’en FiresFROM THE FOREGOING survey we may infer that among the heathen forefathers of theEuropean peoples the most popular and widespread fire-festival of the year was the greatcelebration of Midsummer Eve or Midsummer Day. The coincidence of the festival with thesummer solstice can hardly be accidental. Rather we must suppose that our paganancestors purposely timed the ceremony of fire on earth to coincide with the arrival of thesun at the highest point of his course in the sky. If that was so, it follows that the oldfounders of the midsummer rites had observed the solstices or turning-points of the sun’sapparent path in the sky, and that they accordingly regulated their festal calendar to someextent by astronomical considerations.But while this may be regarded as fairly certain for what we may call the aboriginesthroughout a large part of the continent, it appears not to have been true of the Celticpeoples who inhabited the Land’s End of Europe, the islands and promontories that stretchout into the Atlantic Ocean on the North-West. The principal fire-festivals of the Celts,which have survived, though in a restricted area and with diminished pomp, to moderntimes and even to our own day, were seemingly timed without any reference to the positionof the sun in the heaven. They were two in number, and fell at an interval of six months,one being celebrated on the eve of May Day and the other on Allhallow Even orHallowe’en, as it is now commonly called, that is, on the thirty-first of October, the daypreceding All Saints’ or Allhallows’ Day. These dates coincide with none of the four greathinges on which the solar year revolves, to wit, the solstices and the equinoxes. Nor do theyagree with the principal seasons of the agricultural year, the sowing in spring and thereaping in autumn. For when May Day comes, the seed has long been committed to theearth; and when November opens, the harvest has long been reaped and garnered, thefields lie bare, the fruit-trees are stripped, and even the yellow leaves are fast fluttering tothe ground. Yet the first of May and the first of November mark turning-points of the yearin Europe; the one ushers in the genial heat and the rich vegetation of summer, the otherheralds, if it does not share, the cold and barrenness of winter. Now these particular pointsof the year, as has been well pointed out by a learned and ingenious writer, while they areof comparatively little moment to the European husbandman, do deeply concern theEuropean herdsman; for it is on the approach of summer that he drives his cattle out intothe open to crop the fresh grass, and it is on the approach of winter that he leads them backto the safety and shelter of the stall. Accordingly it seems not improbable that the Celticbisection of the year into two halves at the beginning of May and the beginning ofNovember dates from a time when the Celts were mainly a pastoral people, dependent fortheir subsistence on their herds, and when accordingly the great epochs of the year forthem were the days on which the cattle went forth from the homestead in early summerand returned to it again in early winter. Even in Central Europe, remote from the regionnow occupied by the Celts, a similar bisection of the year may be clearly traced in the greatpopularity, on the one hand, of May Day and its Eve (Walpurgis Night), and, on the otherhand, of the Feast of All Souls at the beginning of November, which under a thin Christiancloak conceals an ancient pagan festival of the dead. Hence we may conjecture thateverywhere throughout Europe the celestial division of the year according to the solsticeswas preceded by what we may call a terrestrial division of the year according to thebeginning of summer and the beginning of winter."},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"Be that as it may, the two great Celtic festivals of May Day and the first of November or, tobe more accurate, the Eves of these two days, closely resemble each other in the manner oftheir celebration and in the superstitions associated with them, and alike, by the antiquecharacter impressed upon both, betray a remote and purely pagan origin. The festival ofMay Day or Beltane, as the Celts called it, which ushered in summer, has already beendescribed; it remains to give some account of the corresponding festival of Hallowe’en,which announced the arrival of winter.Of the two feasts Hallowe’en was perhaps of old the more important, since the Celts wouldseem to have dated the beginning of the year from it rather than from Beltane. In the Isleof Man, one of the fortresses in which the Celtic language and lore longest held out againstthe siege of the Saxon invaders, the first of November, Old Style, has been regarded as NewYear’s day down to recent times. Thus Manx mummers used to go round on Hallowe’en(Old Style), singing, in the Manx language, a sort of Hogmanay song which began “To-night is New Year’s Night, Hogunnaa!” In ancient Ireland, a new fire used to be kindledevery year on Hallowe’en or the Eve of Samhain, and from this sacred flame all the fires inIreland were rekindled. Such a custom points strongly to Samhain or All Saints’ Day (thefirst of November) as New Year’s Day; since the annual kindling of a new fire takes placemost naturally at the beginning of the year, in order that the blessed influence of the freshfire may last throughout the whole period of twelve months. Another confirmation of theview that the Celts dated their year from the first of November is furnished by the manifoldmodes of divination which were commonly resorted to by Celtic peoples on Hallowe’en forthe purpose of ascertaining their destiny, especially their fortune in the coming year; forwhen could these devices for prying into the future be more reasonably put in practice thanat the beginning of the year? As a season of omens and auguries Hallowe’en seems to havefar surpassed Beltane in the imagination of the Celts; from which we may with someprobability infer that they reckoned their year from Hallowe’en rather than Beltane.Another circumstance of great moment which points to the same conclusion is theassociation of the dead with Hallowe’en. Not only among the Celts but throughout Europe,Hallowe’en, the night which marks the transition from autumn to winter, seems to havebeen of old the time of year when the souls of the departed were supposed to revisit theirold homes in order to warm themselves by the fire and to comfort themselves with the goodcheer provided for them in the kitchen or the parlour by their affectionate kinsfolk. It was,perhaps, a natural thought that the approach of winter should drive the poor shiveringhungry ghosts from the bare fields and the leafless woodlands to the shelter of the cottagewith its familiar fireside. Did not the lowing kine then troop back from the summerpastures in the forests and on the hills to be fed and cared for in the stalls, while the bleakwinds whistled among the swaying boughs and the snow-drifts deepened in the hollows?and could the good-man and the good-wife deny to the spirits of their dead the welcomewhich they gave to the cows?But it is not only the souls of the departed who are supposed to be hovering unseen on theday “when autumn to winter resigns the pale year.” Witches then speed on their errands ofmischief, some sweeping through the air on besoms, others galloping along the roads ontabby-cats, which for that evening are turned into coal-black steeds. The fairies, too, are alllet loose, and hobgoblins of every sort roam freely about."},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"Yet while a glamour of mystery and awe has always clung to Hallowe’en in the minds of theCeltic peasantry, the popular celebration of the festival has been, at least in modern times,by no means of a prevailing gloomy cast; on the contrary it has been attended bypicturesque features and merry pastimes, which rendered it the gayest night of all the year.Amongst the things which in the Highlands of Scotland contributed to invest the festivalwith a romantic beauty were the bonfires which used to blaze at frequent intervals on theheights. “On the last day of autumn children gathered ferns, tar-barrels, the long thinstalks called gàinisg, and everything suitable for a bonfire. These were placed in a heap onsome eminence near the house, and in the evening set fire to. The fires were calledSamhnagan. There was one for each house, and it was an object of ambition who shouldhave the biggest. Whole districts were brilliant with bonfires, and their glare across aHighland loch, and from many eminences, formed an exceedingly picturesque scene.” Likethe Beltane fires on the first of May, the Hallowe’en bonfires seem to have been kindledmost commonly in the Perthshire Highlands. In the parish of Callander they still blazeddown to near the end of the eighteenth century. When the fire had died down, the asheswere carefully collected in the form of a circle, and a stone was put in, near thecircumference, for every person of the several families interested in the bonfire. Nextmorning, if any of these stones was found to be displaced or injured, the people made surethat the person represented by it was fey or devoted, and that he could not live twelvemonths from that day. At Balquhidder down to the latter part of the nineteenth centuryeach household kindled its bonfire at Hallowe’en, but the custom was chiefly observed bychildren. The fires were lighted on any high knoll near the house; there was no dancinground them. Hallowe’en fires were also lighted in some districts of the north-east ofScotland, such as Buchan. Villagers and farmers alike must have their fire. In the villagesthe boys went from house to house and begged a peat from each householder, usually withthe words, “Ge’s a peat t’ burn the witches.” When they had collected enough peats, theypiled them in a heap, together with straw, furze, and other combustible materials, and setthe whole on fire. Then each of the youths, one after another, laid himself down on theground as near to the fire as he could without being scorched, and thus lying allowed thesmoke to roll over him. The others ran through the smoke and jumped over their prostratecomrade. When the heap was burned down, they scattered the ashes, vying with each otherwho should scatter them most.In the northern part of Wales it used to be customary for every family to make a greatbonfire called Coel Coeth on Hallowe’en. The fire was kindled on the most conspicuous spotnear the house; and when it had nearly gone out every one threw into the ashes a whitestone, which he had first marked. Then having said their prayers round the fire, they wentto bed. Next morning, as soon as they were up, they came to search out the stones, and ifany one of them was found to be missing, they had a notion that the person who threw itwould die before he saw another Hallowe’en. According to Sir John Rhys, the habit ofcelebrating Hallowe’en by lighting bonfires on the hills is perhaps not yet extinct in Wales,and men still living can remember how the people who assisted at the bonfires would waittill the last spark was out and then would suddenly take to their heels, shouting at the topof their voices, “The cropped black sow seize the hindmost!” The saying, as Sir John Rhysjustly remarks, implies that originally one of the company became a victim in dead earnest.Down to the present time the saying is current in Carnarvonshire, where allusions to thecutty black sow are still occasionally made to frighten children. We can now understand"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"why in Lower Brittany every person throws a pebble into the midsummer bonfire.Doubtless there, as in Wales and the Highlands of Scotland, omens of life and death have atone time or other been drawn from the position and state of the pebbles on the morning ofAll Saints’ Day. The custom, thus found among three separate branches of the Celtic stock,probably dates from a period before their dispersion, or at least from a time when alienraces had not yet driven home the wedges of separation between them.In the Isle of Man also, another Celtic country, Hallowe’en was celebrated down to moderntimes by the kindling of fires, accompanied with all the usual ceremonies designed toprevent the baneful influence of fairies and witches.7. The Midwinter FiresIF THE HEATHEN of ancient Europe celebrated, as we have good reason to believe, theseason of Midsummer with a great festival of fire, of which the traces have survived inmany places down to our own time, it is natural to suppose that they should have observedwith similar rites the corresponding season of Midwinter; for Midsummer and Midwinter,or, in more technical language, the summer solstice and the winter solstice, are the twogreat turningpoints in the sun’s apparent course through the sky, and from the standpointof primitive man nothing might seem more appropriate than to kindle fires on earth at thetwo moments when the fire and heat of the great luminary in heaven begin to wane or towax.In modern Christendom the ancient fire-festival of the winter solstice appears to survive, orto have survived down to recent years, in the old custom of the Yule log, clog, or block, as itwas variously called in England. The custom was widespread in Europe, but seems to haveflourished especially in England, France, and among the South Slavs; at least the fullestaccounts of the custom come from these quarters. That the Yule log was only the wintercounterpart of the midsummer bonfire, kindled within doors instead of in the open air onaccount of the cold and inclement weather of the season, was pointed out long ago by ourEnglish antiquary John Brand; and the view is supported by the many quaint superstitionsattaching to the Yule log, superstitions which have no apparent connexion withChristianity but carry their heathen origin plainly stamped upon them. But while the twosolstitial celebrations were both festivals of fire, the necessity or desirability of holding thewinter celebration within doors lent it the character of a private or domestic festivity,which contrasts strongly with the publicity of the summer celebration, at which the peoplegathered on some open space or conspicuous height, kindled a huge bonfire in common,and danced and made merry round it together.Down to about the middle of the nineteenth century the old rite of the Yule log was kept upin some parts of Central Germany. Thus in the valleys of the Sieg and Lahn the Yule log, aheavy block of oak, was fitted into the floor of the hearth, where, though it glowed underthe fire, it was hardly reduced to ashes within a year. When the new log was laid next year,the remains of the old one were ground to powder and strewed over the fields during theTwelve Nights, which was supposed to promote the growth of the crops. In some villages ofWestphalia, the practice was to withdraw the Yule log (Christbrand) from the fire so soon"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"as it was slightly charred; it was then kept carefully to be replaced on the fire whenever athunderstorm broke, because the people believed that lightning would not strike a house inwhich the Yule log was smouldering. In other villages of Westphalia the old custom was totie up the Yule log in the last sheaf cut at harvest.In several provinces of France, and particularly in Provence, the custom of the Yule log ortréfoir, as it was called in many places, was long observed. A French writer of theseventeenth century denounces as superstitious “the belief that a log called the tréfoir orChristmas brand, which you put on the fire for the first time on Christmas Eve andcontinue to put on the fire for a little while every day till Twelfth Night, can, if kept underthe bed, protect the house for a whole year from fire and thunder; that it can prevent theinmates from having chilblains on their heels in winter; that it can cure the cattle of manymaladies; that if a piece of it be steeped in the water which cows drink it helps them tocalve; and lastly that if the ashes of the log be strewn on the fields it can save the wheatfrom mildew.”In some parts of Flanders and France the remains of the Yule log were regularly kept inthe house under a bed as a protection against thunder and lightning; in Berry, whenthunder was heard, a member of the family used to take a piece of the log and throw it onthe fire, which was believed to avert the lightning. Again, in Perigord, the charcoal andashes are carefully collected and kept for healing swollen glands; the part of the trunkwhich has not been burnt in the fire is used by ploughmen to make the wedge for theirplough, because they allege that it causes the seeds to thrive better; and the women keeppieces of it till Twelfth Night for the sake of their chickens. Some people imagine that theywill have as many chickens as there are sparks that fly out of the brands of the log whenthey shake them; and others place the extinct brands under the bed to drive away vermin.In various parts of France the charred log is thought to guard the house against sorcery aswell as against lightning.In England the customs and beliefs concerning the Yule log used to be similar. On the nightof Christmas Eve, says the antiquary John Brand, “our ancestors were wont to light upcandles of an uncommon size, called Christmas Candles, and lay a log of wood upon thefire, called a Yule-clog or Christmas-block, to illuminate the house, and, as it were, to turnnight into day.” The old custom was to light the Yule log with a fragment of its predecessor,which had been kept throughout the year for the purpose; where it was so kept, the fiendcould do no mischief. The remains of the log were also supposed to guard the house againstfire and lightning.To this day the ritual of bringing in the Yule log is observed with much solemnity amongthe Southern Slavs, especially the Serbians. The log is usually a block of oak, but sometimesof olive or beech. They seem to think that they will have as many calves, lambs, pigs, andkids as they strike sparks out of the burning log. Some people carry a piece of the log out tothe fields to protect them against hail. In Albania down to recent years it was a commoncustom to burn a Yule log at Christmas, and the ashes of the fire were scattered on thefields to make them fertile. The Huzuls, a Slavonic people of the Carpathians, kindle fire bythe friction of wood on Christmas Eve (Old Style, the fifth of January) and keep it burningtill Twelfth Night."},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"It is remarkable how common the belief appears to have been that the remains of the Yulelog, if kept throughout the year, had power to protect the house against fire and especiallyagainst lightning. As the Yule log was frequently of oak, it seems possible that this beliefmay be a relic of the old Aryan creed which associated the oak-tree with the god ofthunder. Whether the curative and fertilising virtues ascribed to the ashes of the Yule log,which are supposed to heal cattle as well as men, to enable cows to calve, and to promotethe fruitfulness of the earth, may not be derived from the same ancient source, is a questionwhich deserves to be considered.8. The Need-fireTHE FIRE-FESTIVALS hitherto described are all celebrated periodically at certain statedtimes of the year. But besides these regularly recurring celebrations the peasants in manyparts of Europe have been wont from time immemorial to resort to a ritual of fire atirregular intervals in seasons of distress and calamity, above all when their cattle wereattacked by epidemic disease. No account of the popular European fire-festivals would becomplete without some notice of these remarkable rites, which have all the greater claim onour attention because they may perhaps be regarded as the source and origin of all theother fire-festivals; certainly they must date from a very remote antiquity. The generalname by which they are known among the Teutonic peoples is need-fire. Sometimes theneed-fire was known as “wild fire,” to distinguish it no doubt from the tame fire producedby more ordinary methods. Among Slavonic peoples it is called “living fire.”The history of the custom can be traced from the early Middle Ages, when it wasdenounced by the Church as a heathen superstition, down to the first half of the nineteenthcentury, when it was still occasionally practised in various parts of Germany, England,Scotland, and Ireland. Among Slavonic peoples it appears to have lingered even longer.The usual occasion for performing the rite was an outbreak of plague or cattle-disease, forwhich the need-fire was believed to be an infallible remedy. The animals which weresubjected to it included cows, pigs, horses, and sometimes geese. As a necessarypreliminary to the kindling of the need-fire all other fires and lights in the neighbourhoodwere extinguished, so that not so much as a spark remained alight; for so long as even anight-light burned in a house, it was imagined that the need-fire could not kindle.Sometimes it was deemed enough to put out all the fires in the village; but sometimes theextinction extended to neighbouring villages or to a whole parish. In some parts of theHighlands of Scotland the rule was that all householders who dwelt within the two nearestrunning streams should put out their lights and fires on the day appointed. Usually theneed-fire was made in the open air, but in some parts of Serbia it was kindled in a darkroom; sometimes the place was a cross-way or a hollow in a road. In the Highlands ofScotland the proper places for performing the rite seem to have been knolls or smallislands in rivers.The regular method of producing the need-fire was by the friction of two pieces of wood; itmight not be struck by flint and steel. Very exceptionally among some South Slavs we readof a practice of kindling a need-fire by striking a piece of iron on an anvil. Where the woodto be employed is specified, it is generally said to be oak; but on the Lower Rhine the fire"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"was kindled by the friction of oak-wood or fir-wood. In Slavonic countries we hear ofpoplar, pear, and cornel wood being used for the purpose. Often the material is simplydescribed as two pieces of dry wood. Sometimes nine different kinds of wood were deemednecessary, but rather perhaps to be burned in the bonfire than to be rubbed together forthe production of the need-fire. The particular mode of kindling the need-fire varied indifferent districts; a very common one was this. Two poles were driven into the groundabout a foot and a half from each other. Each pole had in the side facing the other a socketinto which a smooth cross-piece or roller was fitted. The sockets were stuffed with linen,and the two ends of the roller were rammed tightly into the sockets. To make it moreinflammable the roller was often coated with tar. A rope was then wound round the roller,and the free ends at both sides were gripped by two or more persons, who by pulling therope to and fro caused the roller to revolve rapidly, till through the friction the linen in thesockets took fire. The sparks were immediately caught in tow or oakum and waved aboutin a circle until they burst into a bright glow, when straw was applied to it, and the blazingstraw used to kindle the fuel that had been stacked to make the bonfire. Often a wheel,sometimes a cart-wheel or even a spinning-wheel, formed part of the mechanism; inAberdeenshire it was called “the muckle wheel”; in the island of Mull the wheel was turnedfrom east to west over nine spindles of oak-wood. Sometimes we are merely told that twowooden planks were rubbed together. Sometimes it was prescribed that the cart-wheel usedfor fire-making and the axle on which it turned should both be new. Similarly it was saidthat the rope which turned the roller should be new; if possible it should be woven ofstrands taken from a gallows rope with which people had been hanged, but this was acounsel of perfection rather than a strict necessity.Various rules were also laid down as to the kind of persons who might or should make theneed-fire. Sometimes it was said that the two persons who pulled the rope which twirled theroller should always be brothers or at least bear the same baptismal name; sometimes itwas deemed sufficient if they were both chaste young men. In some villages of Brunswickpeople thought that if everybody who lent a hand in kindling the need-fire did not bear thesame Christian name, they would labour in vain. In Silesia the tree employed to producethe need-fire used to be felled by a pair of twin brothers. In the western islands of Scotlandthe fire was kindled by eighty-one married men, who rubbed two great planks against eachother, working in relays of nine; in North Uist the nine times nine who made the fire wereall first-begotten sons, but we are not told whether they were married or single. Among theSerbians the need-fire is sometimes kindled by a boy and girl between eleven and fourteenyears of age, who work stark naked in a dark room; sometimes it is made by an old manand an old woman also in the dark. In Bulgaria, too, the makers of need-fire stripthemselves of their clothes; in Caithness they divested themselves of all kinds of metal. Ifafter long rubbing of the wood no fire was elicited they concluded that some fire must stillbe burning in the village; so a strict search was made from house to house, any fire thatmight be found was put out, and the negligent householder punished or upbraided; indeeda heavy fine might be inflicted on him.When the need-fire was at last kindled, the bonfire was lit from it, and as soon as the blazehad somewhat died down, the sick animals were driven over the glowing embers,sometimes in a regular order of precedence, first the pigs, next the cows, and last of all thehorses. Sometimes they were driven twice or thrice through the smoke and flames, so that"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"occasionally some of them were scorched to death. As soon as all the beasts were through,the young folk would rush wildly at the ashes and cinders, sprinkling and blackening eachother with them; those who were most blackened would march in triumph behind the cattleinto the village and would not wash themselves for a long time. From the bonfire peoplecarried live embers home and used them to rekindle the fires in their houses. These brands,after being extinguished in water, they sometimes put in the managers at which the cattlefed, and kept them there for a while. Ashes from the need-fire were also strewed on thefields to protect the crops against vermin; sometimes they were taken home to be employedas remedies in sickness, being sprinkled on the ailing part or mixed in water and drunk bythe patient. In the western islands of Scotland and on the adjoining mainland, as soon asthe fire on the domestic hearth had been rekindled from the need-fire a pot full of waterwas set on it, and the water thus heated was afterwards sprinkled upon the people infectedwith the plague or upon the cattle that were tainted by the murrain. Special virtue wasattributed to the smoke of the bonfire; in Sweden fruit-trees and nets were fumigated withit, in order that the trees might bear fruit and the nets catch fish. In the Highlands ofScotland the need-fire was accounted a sovereign remedy for witchcraft. In the island ofMull, when the fire was kindled as a cure for the murrain, we hear of the rite beingaccompanied by the sacrifice of a sick heifer, which was cut in pieces and burnt. Slavonianand Bulgarian peasants conceive cattle-plague as a foul fiend or vampyre which can bekept at bay by interposing a barrier of fire between it and the herds. A similar conceptionmay perhaps have originally everywhere underlain the use of the need-fire as a remedy forthe murrain. It appears that in some parts of Germany the people did not wait for anoutbreak of cattleplague, but, taking time by the forelock, kindled a need-fire annually toprevent the calamity. Similarly in Poland the peasants are said to kindle fires in the villagestreets every year on St. Rochus’s day and to drive the cattle thrice through them in orderto protect the beasts against the murrain. We have seen that in the Hebrides the cattle werein like manner driven annually round the Beltane fires for the same purpose. In somecantons of Switzerland children still kindle a need-fire by the friction of wood for the sakeof dispelling a mist.LXIII. The Interpretation of the Fire-Festivals1. On the Fire-festivals in generalTHE FOREGOING survey of the popular fire-festivals of Europe suggests some generalobservations. In the first place we can hardly help being struck by the resemblance whichthe ceremonies bear to each other, at whatever time of the year and in whatever part ofEurope they are celebrated. The custom of kindling great bonfires, leaping over them, anddriving cattle through or round them would seem to have been practically universalthroughout Europe, and the same may be said of the processions or races with blazingtorches round fields, orchards, pastures, or cattle-stalls. Less widespread are the customs ofhurling lighted discs into the air and trundling a burning wheel down hill. The ceremonialof the Yule log is distinguished from that of the other fire-festivals by the privacy anddomesticity which characterise it; but this distinction may well be due simply to the rough"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"weather of midwinter, which is apt not only to render a public assembly in the open airdisagreeable, but also at any moment to defeat the object of the assembly by extinguishingthe all-important fire under a downpour of rain or a fall of snow. Apart from these local orseasonal differences, the general resemblance between the fire-festivals at all times of theyear and in all places is tolerably close. And as the ceremonies themselves resemble eachother, so do the benefits which the people expect to reap from them. Whether applied in theform of bonfires blazing at fixed points, or of torches carried about from place to place, orof embers and ashes taken from the smouldering heap of fuel, the fire is believed topromote the growth of the crops and the welfare of man and beast, either positively bystimulating them, or negatively by averting the dangers and calamities which threatenthem from such causes as thunder and lightning, conflagration, blight, mildew, vermin,sterility, disease, and not least of all witchcraft.But we naturally ask, How did it come about that benefits so great and manifold weresupposed to be attained by means so simple? In what way did people imagine that theycould procure so many goods or avoid so many ills by the application of fire and smoke, ofembers and ashes? Two different explanations of the fire-festivals have been given bymodern enquirers. On the one hand it has been held that they are sun-charms or magicalceremonies intended, on the principle of imitative magic, to ensure a needful supply ofsunshine for men, animals, and plants by kindling fires which mimic on earth the greatsource of light and heat in the sky. This was the view of Wilhelm Mannhardt. It may becalled the solar theory. On the other hand it has been maintained that the ceremonial fireshave no necessary reference to the sun but are simply purificatory in intention, beingdesigned to burn up and destroy all harmful influences, whether these are conceived in apersonal form as witches, demons, and monsters, or in an impersonal form as a sort ofpervading taint or corruption of the air. This is the view of Dr. Edward Westermarck andapparently of Professor Eugen Mogk. It may be called the purificatory theory. Obviouslythe two theories postulate two very different conceptions of the fire which plays theprincipal part in the rites. On the one view, the fire, like sunshine in our latitude, is a genialcreative power which fosters the growth of plants and the development of all that makesfor health and happiness; on the other view, the fire is a fierce destructive power whichblasts and consumes all the noxious elements, whether spiritual or material, that menacethe life of men, of animals, and of plants. According to the one theory the fire is a stimulant,according to the other it is a disinfectant; on the one view its virtue is positive, on the otherit is negative.Yet the two explanations, different as they are in the character which they attribute to thefire, are perhaps not wholly irreconcilable. If we assume that the fires kindled at thesefestivals were primarily intended to imitate the sun’s light and heat, may we not regard thepurificatory and disinfecting qualities, which popular opinion certainly appears to haveascribed to them, as attributes derived directly from the purificatory and disinfectingqualities of sunshine? In this way we might conclude that, while the imitation of sunshine inthese ceremonies was primary and original, the purification attributed to them wassecondary and derivative. Such a conclusion, occupying an intermediate position betweenthe two opposing theories and recognising an element of truth in both of them, was adoptedby me in earlier editions of this work; but in the meantime Dr. Westermarck has arguedpowerfully in favour of the purificatory theory alone, and I am bound to say that his"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"arguments carry great weight, and that on a fuller review of the facts the balance ofevidence seems to me to incline decidedly in his favour. However, the case is not so clear asto justify us in dismissing the solar theory without discussion, and accordingly I propose toadduce the considerations which tell for it before proceeding to notice those which tellagainst it. A theory which had the support of so learned and sagacious an investigator asW. Mannhardt is entitled to a respectful hearing.2. The Solar Theory of the Fire-festivalsIN AN EARLIER part of this work we saw that savages resort to charms for makingsunshine, and it would be no wonder if primitive man in Europe did the same. Indeed,when we consider the cold and cloudy climate of Europe during a great part of the year, weshall find it natural that sun-charms should have played a much more prominent partamong the superstitious practices of European peoples than among those of savages wholive nearer the equator and who consequently are apt to get in the course of nature moresunshine than they want. This view of the festivals may be supported by various argumentsdrawn partly from their dates, partly from the nature of the rites, and partly from theinfluence which they are believed to exert upon the weather and on vegetation.First, in regard to the dates of the festivals it can be no mere accident that two of the mostimportant and widely spread of the festivals are timed to coincide more or less exactly withthe summer and winter solstices, that is, with the two turning-points in the sun’s apparentcourse in the sky when he reaches respectively his highest and his lowest elevation at noon.Indeed with respect to the midwinter celebration of Christmas we are not left toconjecture; we know from the express testimony of the ancients that it was instituted by thechurch to supersede an old heathen festival of the birth of the sun, which was apparentlyconceived to be born again on the shortest day of the year, after which his light and heatwere seen to grow till they attained their full maturity at midsummer. Therefore it is novery far-fetched conjecture to suppose that the Yule log, which figures so prominently inthe popular celebration of Christmas, was originally designed to help the labouring sun ofmidwinter to rekindle his seemingly expiring light.Not only the date of some of the festivals but the manner of their celebration suggests aconscious imitation of the sun. The custom of rolling a burning wheel down a hill, which isoften observed at these ceremonies, might well pass for an imitation of the sun’s course inthe sky, and the imitation would be especially appropriate on Midsummer Day when thesun’s annual declension begins. Indeed the custom has been thus interpreted by some ofthose who have recorded it. Not less graphic, it may be said, is the mimicry of his apparentrevolution by swinging a burning tar-barrel round a pole. Again, the common practice ofthrowing fiery discs, sometimes expressly said to be shaped like suns, into the air at thefestivals may well be a piece of imitative magic. In these, as in so many cases, the magicforce may be supposed to take effect through mimicry or sympathy: by imitating thedesired result you actually produce it: by counterfeiting the sun’s progress through theheavens you really help the luminary to pursue his celestial journey with punctuality anddespatch. The name “fire of heaven,” by which the midsummer fire is sometimes popularlyknown, clearly implies a consciousness of a connexion between the earthly and the heavenly"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"flame.Again, the manner in which the fire appears to have been originally kindled on theseoccasions has been alleged in support of the view that it was intended to be a mock-sun. Assome scholars have perceived, it is highly probable that at the periodic festivals in formertimes fire was universally obtained by the friction of two pieces of wood. It is still soprocured in some places both at the Easter and the Midsummer festivals, and it is expresslysaid to have been formerly so procured at the Beltane celebration both in Scotland andWales. But what makes it nearly certain that this was once the invariable mode of kindlingthe fire at these periodic festivals is the analogy of the needfire, which has almost alwaysbeen produced by the friction of wood, and sometimes by the revolution of a wheel. It is aplausible conjecture that the wheel employed for this purpose represents the sun, and if thefires at the regularly recurring celebrations were formerly produced in the same way, itmight be regarded as a confirmation of the view that they were originally sun-charms. Inpoint of fact there is, as Kuhn has indicated, some evidence to show that the midsummerfire was originally thus produced. We have seen that many Hungarian swine-herds makefire on Midsummer Eve by rotating a wheel round a wooden axle wrapt in hemp, and thatthey drive their pigs through the fire thus made. At Obermedlingen, in Swabia, the “fire ofheaven,” as it was called, was made on St. Vitus’s Day (the fifteenth of June) by igniting acart-wheel, which, smeared with pitch and plaited with straw, was fastened on a poletwelve feet high, the top of the pole being inserted in the nave of the wheel. This fire wasmade on the summit of a mountain, and as the flame ascended, the people uttered a setform of words, with eyes and arms directed heavenward. Here the fixing of a wheel on apole and igniting it suggests that originally the fire was produced, as in the case of the need-fire, by the revolution of a wheel. The day on which the ceremony takes place (the fifteenthof June) is near midsummer; and we have seen that in Masuren fire is, or used to be,actually made on Midsummer Day by turning a wheel rapidly about an oaken pole, thoughit is not said that the new fire so obtained is used to light a bonfire. However, we must bearin mind that in all such cases the use of a wheel may be merely a mechanical device tofacilitate the operation of fire-making by increasing the friction; it need not have anysymbolical significance.Further, the influence which these fires, whether periodic or occasional, are supposed toexert on the weather and vegetation may be cited in support of the view that they are sun-charms, since the effects ascribed to them resemble those of sunshine. Thus, the Frenchbelief that in a rainy June the lighting of the midsummer bonfires will cause the rain tocease appears to assume that they can disperse the dark clouds and make the sun to breakout in radiant glory, drying the wet earth and dripping trees. Similarly the use of the need-fire by Swiss children on foggy days for the purpose of clearing away the mist may verynaturally be interpreted as a sun-charm. In the Vosges Mountains the people believe thatthe midsummer fires help to preserve the fruits of the earth and ensure good crops. InSweden the warmth or cold of the coming season is inferred from the direction in which theflames of the May Day bonfire are blown; if they blow to the south, it will be warm, if to thenorth, cold. No doubt at present the direction of the flames is regarded merely as an auguryof the weather, not as a mode of influencing it. But we may be pretty sure that this is one ofthe cases in which magic has dwindled into divination. So in the Eifel Mountains, when thesmoke blows towards the corn-fields, this is an omen that the harvest will be abundant. But"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"the older view may have been not merely that the smoke and flames prognosticated, butthat they actually produced an abundant harvest, the heat of the flames acting likesunshine on the corn. Perhaps it was with this view that people in the Isle of Man lit fires towindward of their fields in order that the smoke might blow over them. So in South Africa,about the month of April, the Matabeles light huge fires to the windward of their gardens,“their idea being that the smoke, by passing over the crops, will assist the ripening ofthem.” Among the Zulus also “medicine is burned on a fire placed to windward of thegarden, the fumigation which the plants in consequence receive being held to improve thecrop.” Again, the idea of our European peasants that the corn will grow well as far as theblaze of the bonfire is visible, may be interpreted as a remnant of the belief in thequickening and fertilising power of the bonfires. The same belief, it may be argued,reappears in the notion that embers taken from the bonfires and inserted in the fields willpromote the growth of the crops, and it may be thought to underlie the customs of sowingflax-seed in the direction in which the flames blow, of mixing the ashes of the bonfire withthe seed-corn at sowing, of scattering the ashes by themselves over the field to fertilise it,and of incorporating a piece of the Yule log in the plough to make the seeds thrive. Theopinion that the flax or hemp will grow as high as the flames rise or the people leap overthem belongs clearly to the same class of ideas. Again, at Konz, on the banks of the Moselle,if the blazing wheel which was trundled down the hillside reached the river without beingextinguished, this was hailed as a proof that the vintage would be abundant. So firmly wasthis belief held that the successful performance of the ceremony entitled the villagers tolevy a tax upon the owners of the neighbouring vineyards. Here the unextinguished wheelmight be taken to represent an unclouded sun, which in turn would portend an abundantvintage. So the waggon-load of white wine which the villagers received from the vineyardsround about might pass for a payment for the sunshine which they had procured for thegrapes. Similarly in the Vale of Glamorgan a blazing wheel used to be trundled down hillon Midsummer Day, and if the fire were extinguished before the wheel reached the foot ofthe hill, the people expected a bad harvest; whereas if the wheel kept alight all the waydown and continued to blaze for a long time, the farmers looked forward to heavy cropsthat summer. Here, again, it is natural to suppose that the rustic mind traced a directconnexion between the fire of the wheel and the fire of the sun, on which the crops aredependent.But in popular belief the quickening and fertilising influence of the bonfires is not limitedto the vegetable world; it extends also to animals. This plainly appears from the Irishcustom of driving barren cattle through the midsummer fires, from the French belief thatthe Yule log steeped in water helps cows to calve, from the French and Serbian notion thatthere will be as many chickens, calves, lambs, and kids as there are sparks struck out of theYule log, from the French custom of putting the ashes of the bonfires in the fowls’ nests tomake the hens lay eggs, and from the German practice of mixing the ashes of the bonfireswith the drink of cattle in order to make the animals thrive. Further, there are clearindications that even human fecundity is supposed to be promoted by the genial heat of thefires. In Morocco the people think that childless couples can obtain offspring by leapingover the midsummer bonfire. It is an Irish belief that a girl who jumps thrice over themidsummer bonfire will soon marry and become the mother of many children; in Flanderswomen leap over the midsummer fires to ensure an easy delivery; in various parts ofFrance they think that if a girl dances round nine fires she will be sure to marry within the"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"year, and in Bohemia they fancy that she will do so if she merely sees nine of the bonfires.On the other hand, in Lechrain people say that if a young man and woman, leaping overthe midsummer fire together, escape unsmirched, the young woman will not become amother within twelve months; the flames have not touched and fertilised her. In parts ofSwitzerland and France the lighting of the Yule log is accompanied by a prayer that thewomen may bear children, the she-goats bring forth kids, and the ewes drop lambs. Therule observed in some places that the bonfires should be kindled by the person who was lastmarried seems to belong to the same class of ideas, whether it be that such a person issupposed to receive from, or to impart to, the fire a generative and fertilising influence. Thecommon practice of lovers leaping over the fires hand in hand may very well haveoriginated in a notion that thereby their marriage would be blessed with offspring; and thelike motive would explain the custom which obliges couples married within the year todance to the light of torches. And the scenes of profligacy which appear to have marked themidsummer celebration among the Esthonians, as they once marked the celebration ofMay Day among ourselves, may have sprung, not from the mere licence of holiday-makers,but from a crude notion that such orgies were justified, if not required, by some mysteriousbond which linked the life of man to the courses of the heavens at this turning-point of theyear.At the festivals which we are considering the custom of kindling bonfires is commonlyassociated with a custom of carrying lighted torches about the fields, the orchards, thepastures, the flocks and the herds; and we can hardly doubt that the two customs are onlytwo different ways of attaining the same object, namely, the benefits which are believed toflow from the fire, whether it be stationary or portable. Accordingly if we accept the solartheory of the bonfires, we seem bound to apply it also to the torches; we must suppose thatthe practice of marching or running with blazing torches about the country is simply ameans of diffusing far and wide the genial influence of the sunshine of which theseflickering flames are a feeble imitation. In favour of this view it may be said that sometimesthe torches are carried about the fields for the express purpose of fertilising them, and withthe same intention live coals from the bonfires are sometimes placed in the fields to preventblight. On the eve of Twelfth Day in Normandy men, women, and children run wildlythrough the fields and orchards with lighted torches, which they wave about the branchesand dash against the trunks of the fruit-trees for the sake of burning the moss and drivingaway the moles and field-mice. “They believe that the ceremony fulfills the double object ofexorcising the vermin whose multiplication would be a real calamity, and of impartingfecundity to the trees, the fields, and even the cattle”; and they imagine that the more theceremony is prolonged, the greater will be the crop of fruit next autumn. In Bohemia theysay that the corn will grow as high as they fling the blazing besoms into the air. Nor aresuch notions confined to Europe. In Corea, a few days before the New Year festival, theeunuchs of the palace swing burning torches, chanting invocations the while, and this issupposed to ensure bountiful crops for the next season. The custom of trundling a burningwheel over the fields, which used to be observed in Poitou for the express purpose offertilising them, may be thought to embody the same idea in a still more graphic form;since in this way the mock-sun itself, not merely its light and heat represented by torches, ismade actually to pass over the ground which is to receive its quickening and kindlyinfluence. Once more, the custom of carrying lighted brands round cattle is plainlyequivalent to driving the animals through the bonfire; and if the bonfire is a suncharm, the"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"torches must be so also.3. The Purificatory Theory of the Fire-festivalsTHUS far we have considered what may be said for the theory that at the European fire-festivals the fire is kindled as a charm to ensure an abundant supply of sunshine for manand beast, for corn and fruits. It remains to consider what may be said against this theoryand in favour of the view that in these rites fire is employed not as a creative but as acleansing agent, which purifies men, animals, and plants by burning up and consuming thenoxious elements, whether material or spiritual, which menace all living things with diseaseand death.First, then, it is to be observed that the people who practise the fire-customs appear neverto allege the solar theory in explanation of them, while on the contrary they do frequentlyand emphatically put forward the purificatory theory. This is a strong argument in favourof the purificatory and against the solar theory; for the popular explanation of a popularcustom is never to be rejected except for grave cause. And in the present case there seemsto be no adequate reason for rejecting it. The conception of fire as a destructive agent,which can be turned to account for the consumption of evil things, is so simple and obviousthat it could hardly escape the minds even of the rude peasantry with whom these festivalsoriginated. On the other hand the conception of fire as an emanation of the sun, or at allevents as linked to it by a bond of physical sympathy, is far less simple and obvious; andthough the use of fire as a charm to produce sunshine appears to be undeniable,nevertheless in attempting to explain popular customs we should never have recourse to amore recondite idea when a simpler one lies to hand and is supported by the explicittestimony of the people themselves. Now in the case of the fire-festivals the destructiveaspect of fire is one upon which the people dwell again and again; and it is highlysignificant that the great evil against which the fire is directed appears to be witchcraft.Again and again we are told that the fires are intended to burn or repel the witches; andthe intention is sometimes graphically expressed by burning an effigy of a witch in the fire.Hence, when we remember the great hold which the dread of witchcraft has had on thepopular European mind in all ages, we may suspect that the primary intention of all thesefire-festivals was simply to destroy or at all events get rid of the witches, who wereregarded as the causes of nearly all the misfortunes and calamities that befall men, theircattle, and their crops.This suspicion is confirmed when we examine the evils for which the bonfires and torcheswere supposed to provide a remedy. Foremost, perhaps, among these evils we may reckonthe diseases of cattle; and of all the ills that witches are believed to work there is probablynone which is so constantly insisted on as the harm they do to the herds, particularly bystealing the milk from the cows. Now it is significant that the need-fire, which may perhapsbe regarded as the parent of the periodic fire-festivals, is kindled above all as a remedy fora murrain or other disease of cattle; and the circumstance suggests, what on generalgrounds seems probable, that the custom of kindling the need-fire goes back to a time whenthe ancestors of the European peoples subsisted chiefly on the products of their herds, andwhen agriculture as yet played a subordinate part in their lives. Witches and wolves are the"},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"two great foes still dreaded by the herdsman in many parts of Europe; and we need notwonder that he should resort to fire as a powerful means of banning them both. AmongSlavonic peoples it appears that the foes whom the need-fire is designed to combat are notso much living witches as vampyres and other evil spirits, and the ceremony aims rather atrepelling these baleful beings than at actually consuming them in the flames. But for ourpresent purpose these distinctions are immaterial. The important thing to observe is thatamong the Slavs the need-fire, which is probably the original of all the ceremonial fires nowunder consideration, is not a sun-charm, but clearly and unmistakably nothing but a meansof protecting man and beast against the attacks of maleficent creatures, whom the peasantthinks to burn or scare by the heat of the fire, just as he might burn or scare wild animals.Again, the bonfires are often supposed to protect the fields against hail and the homesteadagainst thunder and lightning. But both hail and thunderstorms are frequently thought tobe caused by witches; hence the fire which bans the witches necessarily serves at the sametime as a talisman against hail, thunder, and lightning. Further, brands taken from thebonfires are commonly kept in the houses to guard them against conflagration; and thoughthis may perhaps be done on the principle of homoeopathic magic, one fire being thoughtto act as a preventive of another, it is also possible that the intention may be to keep witch-incendiaries at bay. Again, people leap over the bonfires as a preventive of colic, and lookat the flames steadily in order to preserve their eyes in good health; and both colic and soreeyes are in Germany, and probably elsewhere, set down to the machinations of witches.Once more, to leap over the midsummer fires or to circumambulate them is thought toprevent a person from feeling pains in his back at reaping; and in Germany such pains arecalled “witch-shots” and ascribed to witchcraft.But if the bonfires and torches of the fire-festivals are to be regarded primarily as weaponsdirected against witches and wizards, it becomes probable that the same explanationapplies not only to the flaming discs which are hurled into the air, but also to the burningwheels which are rolled down hill on these occasions; discs and wheels, we may suppose,are alike intended to burn the witches who hover invisible in the air or haunt unseen thefields, the orchards, and the vineyards on the hillside. Certainly witches are constantlythought to ride through the air on broomsticks or other equally convenient vehicles; and ifthey do so, how can you get at them so effectually as by hurling lighted missiles, whetherdiscs, torches, or besoms, after them as they flit past overhead in the gloom? The SouthSlavonian peasant believes that witches ride in the dark hail-clouds; so he shoots at theclouds to bring down the hags, while he curses them, saying, “Curse, curse Herodias, thymother is a heathen, damned of God and fettered through the Redeemer’s blood.” Also hebrings out a pot of glowing charcoal on which he has thrown holy oil, laurel leaves, andwormwood to make a smoke. The fumes are supposed to ascend to the clouds and stupefythe witches, so that they tumble down to earth. And in order that they may not fall soft, butmay hurt themselves very much, the yokel hastily brings out a chair and tilts it bottom upso that the witch in falling may break her legs on the legs of the chair. Worse than that, hecruelly lays scythes, bill-hooks, and other formidable weapons edge upwards so as to cutand mangle the poor wretches when they drop plump upon them from the clouds.On this view the fertility supposed to follow the application of fire in the form of bonfires,torches, discs, rolling wheels, and so forth, is not conceived as resulting directly from an"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"increase of solar heat which the fire has magically generated; it is merely an indirect resultobtained by freeing the reproductive powers of plants and animals from the fatalobstruction of witchcraft. And what is true of the reproduction of plants and animals mayhold good also of the fertility of the human sexes. The bonfires are supposed to promotemarriage and to procure offspring for childless couples. This happy effect need not flowdirectly from any quickening or fertilising energy in the fire; it may follow indirectly fromthe power of the fire to remove those obstacles which the spells of witches and wizardsnotoriously present to the union of man and wife.On the whole, then, the theory of the purificatory virtue of the ceremonial fires appearsmore probable and more in accordance with the evidence than the opposing theory of theirconnexion with the sun.LXIV. The Burning of Human Beings in the Fires1. The Burning of Effigies in the FiresWE have still to ask, What is the meaning of burning effigies in the fire at these festivals?After the preceding investigation the answer to the question seems obvious. As the fires areoften alleged to be kindled for the purpose of burning the witches, and as the effigy burntin them is sometimes called “the Witch,” we might naturally be disposed to conclude thatall the effigies consumed in the flames on these occasions represent witches or warlocks,and that the custom of burning them is merely a substitute for burning the wicked men andwomen themselves, since on the principle of homoeopathic or imitative magic youpractically destroy the witch herself in destroying her effigy. On the whole this explanationof the burning of straw figures in human shape at the festivals is perhaps the mostprobable.Yet it may be that this explanation does not apply to all the cases, and that certain of themmay admit and even require another interpretation. For the effigies so burned, as I havealready remarked, can hardly be separated from the effigies of Death which are burned orotherwise destroyed in spring; and grounds have been already given for regarding the so-called effigies of Death as really representatives of the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation. Arethe other effigies, which are burned in the spring and midsummer bonfires, susceptible ofthe same explanation? It would seem so. For just as the fragments of the so-called Deathare stuck in the fields to make the crops grow, so the charred embers of the figure burnedin the spring bonfires are sometimes laid on the fields in the belief that they will keepvermin from the crop. Again, the rule that the last married bride must leap over the fire inwhich the straw-man is burned on Shrove Tuesday, is probably intended to make herfruitful. But, as we have seen, the power of blessing women with offspring is a specialattribute of tree-spirits; it is therefore a fair presumption that the burning effigy overwhich the bride must leap is a representative of the fertilising tree-spirit or spirit ofvegetation. This character of the effigy, as representative of the spirit of vegetation, isalmost unmistakable when the figure is composed of an unthreshed sheaf of corn or is"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"covered from head to foot with flowers. Again, it is to be noted that, instead of a puppet,trees, either living or felled, are sometimes burned both in the spring and midsummerbonfires. Now, considering the frequency with which the tree-spirit is represented inhuman shape, it is hardly rash to suppose that when sometimes a tree and sometimes aneffigy is burned in these fires, the effigy and the tree are regarded as equivalent to eachother, each being a representative of the tree-spirit. This, again, is confirmed by observing,first, that sometimes the effigy which is to be burned is carried about simultaneously with aMay-tree, the former being carried by the boys, the latter by the girls; and, second, that theeffigy is sometimes tied to a living tree and burned with it. In these cases, we can scarcelydoubt, the tree-spirit is represented, as we have found it represented before, in duplicate,both by the tree and by the effigy. That the true character of the effigy as a representativeof the beneficent spirit of vegetation should sometimes be forgotten, is natural. The customof burning a beneficent god is too foreign to later modes of thought to escapemisinterpretation. Naturally enough the people who continued to burn his image came intime to identify it as the effigy of persons, whom, on various grounds, they regarded withaversion, such as Judas Iscariot, Luther, and a witch.The general reasons for killing a god or his representative have been examined in apreceding chapter. But when the god happens to be a deity of vegetation, there are specialreasons why he should die by fire. For light and heat are necessary to vegetable growth;and, on the principle of sympathetic magic, by subjecting the personal representative ofvegetation to their influence, you secure a supply of these necessaries for trees and crops. Inother words, by burning the spirit of vegetation in a fire which represents the sun, youmake sure that, for a time at least, vegetation shall have plenty of sun. It may be objectedthat, if the intention is simply to secure enough sunshine for vegetation, this end would bebetter attained, on the principles of sympathetic magic, by merely passing therepresentative of vegetation through the fire instead of burning him. In point of fact this issometimes done. In Russia, as we have seen, the straw figure of Kupalo is not burned in themidsummer fire, but merely carried backwards and forwards across it. But, for the reasonsalready given, it is necessary that the god should die; so next day Kupalo is stripped of herornaments and thrown into a stream. In this Russian custom the passage of the imagethrough the fire, if it is not simply a purification, may possibly be a sun-charm; the killingof the god is a separate act, and the mode of killing him—by drowning—is probably a rain-charm. But usually people have not thought it necessary to draw this fine distinction; forthe various reasons already assigned, it is advantageous, they think, to expose the god ofvegetation to a considerable degree of heat, and it is also advantageous to kill him, and theycombine these advantages in a rough-and-ready way by burning him.2. The Burning of Men and Animals in the FiresIN THE POPULAR customs connected with the fire-festivals of Europe there are certainfeatures which appear to point to a former practice of human sacrifice. We have seenreasons for believing that in Europe living persons have often acted as representatives ofthe tree-spirit and corn-spirit and have suffered death as such. There is no reason,therefore, why they should not have been burned, if any special advantages were likely tobe attained by putting them to death in that way. The consideration of human suffering is"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"not one which enters into the calculations of primitive man. Now, in the fire-festivals whichwe are discussing, the pretence of burning people is sometimes carried so far that it seemsreasonable to regard it as a mitigated survival of an older custom of actually burning them.Thus in Aachen, as we saw, the man clad in peas-straw acts so cleverly that the childrenreally believe he is being burned. At Jumièges in Normandy the man clad all in green, whobore the title of the Green Wolf, was pursued by his comrades, and when they caught himthey feigned to fling him upon the midsummer bonfire. Similarly at the Beltane fires inScotland the pretended victim was seized, and a show made of throwing him into theflames, and for some time afterwards people affected to speak of him as dead. Again, in theHallowe’en bonfires of Northeastern Scotland we may perhaps detect a similar pretence inthe custom observed by a lad of lying down as close to the fire as possible and allowing theother lads to leap over him. The titular king at Aix, who reigned for a year and danced thefirst dance round the midsummer bonfire, may perhaps in days of old have discharged theless agreeable duty of serving as fuel for that fire which in later times he only kindled. Inthe following customs Mannhardt is probably right in recognising traces of an old customof burning a leaf-clad representative of the spirit of vegetation. At Wolfeck, in Austria, onMidsummer Day, a boy completely clad in green fir branches goes from house to house,accompanied by a noisy crew, collecting wood for the bonfire. As he gets the wood he sings:“Forest trees I want,No sour milk for me,But beer and wine,So can the wood-man be jolly and gay.”In some parts of Bavaria, also, the boys who go from house to house collecting fuel for themidsummer bonfire envelop one of their number from head to foot in green branches offirs, and lead him by a rope through the whole village. At Moosheim, in Wurtemberg, thefestival of St. John’s Fire usually lasted for fourteen days, ending on the second Sundayafter Midsummer Day. On this last day the bonfire was left in charge of the children, whilethe older people retired to a wood. Here they encased a young fellow in leaves and twigs,who, thus disguised, went to the fire, scattered it, and trod it out. All the people present fledat the sight of him.But it seems possible to go farther than this. Of human sacrifices offered on these occasionsthe most unequivocal traces, as we have seen, are those which, about a hundred years ago,still lingered at the Beltane fires in the Highlands of Scotland, that is, among a Celtic peoplewho, situated in a remote corner of Europe and almost completely isolated from foreigninfluence, had till then conserved their old heathenism better perhaps than any otherpeople in the West of Europe. It is significant, therefore, that human sacrifices by fire areknown, on unquestionable evidence, to have been systematically practised by the Celts. Theearliest description of these sacrifices has been bequeathed to us by Julius Caesar. Asconqueror of the hitherto independent Celts of Gaul, Caesar had ample opportunity ofobserving the national Celtic religion and manners, while these were still fresh and crispfrom the native mint and had not yet been fused in the melting-pot of Roman civilisation."},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"With his own notes Caesar appears to have incorporated the observations of a Greekexplorer, by name Posidonius, who travelled in Gaul about fifty years before Caesarcarried the Roman arms to the English Channel. The Greek geographer Strabo and thehistorian Diodorus seem also to have derived their descriptions of the Celtic sacrifices fromthe work of Posidonius, but independently of each other, and of Caesar, for each of thethree derivative accounts contain some details which are not to be found in either of theothers. By combining them, therefore, we can restore the original account of Posidoniuswith some probability, and thus obtain a picture of the sacrifices offered by the Celts ofGaul at the close of the second century before our era. The following seem to have been themain outlines of the custom. Condemned criminals were reserved by the Celts in order tobe sacrificed to the gods at a great festival which took place once in every five years. Themore there were of such victims, the greater was believed to be the fertility of the land. Ifthere were not enough criminals to furnish victims, captives taken in war were immolatedto supply the deficiency. When the time came the victims were sacrificed by the Druids orpriests. Some they shot down with arrows, some they impaled, and some they burned alivein the following manner. Colossal images of wicker-work or of wood and grass wereconstructed; these were filled with live men, cattle, and animals of other kinds; fire wasthen applied to the images, and they were burned with their living contents.Such were the great festivals held once every five years. But besides these quinquennialfestivals, celebrated on so grand a scale, and with, apparently, so large an expenditure ofhuman life, it seems reasonable to suppose that festivals of the same sort, only on a lesserscale, were held annually, and that from these annual festivals are lineally descended someat least of the fire-festivals which, with their traces of human sacrifices, are still celebratedyear by year in many parts of Europe. The gigantic images constructed of osiers or coveredwith grass in which the Druids enclosed their victims remind us of the leafy framework inwhich the human representative of the tree-spirit is still so often encased. Hence, seeingthat the fertility of the land was apparently supposed to depend upon the due performanceof these sacrifices, Mannhardt interpreted the Celtic victims, cased in osiers and grass, asrepresentatives of the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation.These wicker giants of the Druids seem to have had till lately, if not down to the presenttime, their representatives at the spring and midsummer festivals of modern Europe. AtDouay, down at least to the early part of the nineteenth century, a procession took placeannually on the Sunday nearest to the seventh of July. The great feature of the processionwas a colossal figure, some twenty or thirty feet high, made of osiers, and called “thegiant,” which was moved through the streets by means of rollers and ropes worked by menwho were enclosed within the effigy. The figure was armed as a knight with lance andsword, helmet and shield. Behind him marched his wife and his three children, allconstructed of osiers on the same principle, but on a smaller scale. At Dunkirk theprocession of the giants took place on Midsummer Day, the twenty-fourth of June. Thefestival, which was known as the Follies of Dunkirk, attracted multitudes of spectators. Thegiant was a huge figure of wicker-work, occasionally as much as forty-five feet high,dressed in a long blue robe with gold stripes, which reached to his feet, concealing thedozen or more men who made it dance and bob its head to the spectators. This colossaleffigy went by the name of Papa Reuss, and carried in its pocket a bouncing infant ofBrobdingnagian proportions. The rear was brought up by the daughter of the giant,"},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"constructed, like her sire, of wicker-work, and little, if at all, inferior to him in size. Mosttowns and even villages of Brabant and Flanders have, or used to have, similar wickergiants which were annually led about to the delight of the populace, who loved thesegrotesque figures, spoke of them with patriotic enthusiasm, and never wearied of gazing atthem. At Antwerp the giant was so big that no gate in the city was large enough to let himgo through; hence he could not visit his brother giants in neighbouring towns, as the otherBelgian giants used to do on solemn occasions.In England artificial giants seem to have been a standing feature of the midsummerfestival. A writer of the sixteenth century speaks of “Midsommer pageants in London,where to make the people wonder, are set forth great and uglie gyants marching as if theywere alive, and armed at all points, but within they are stuffed full of browne paper andtow, which the shrewd boyes, underpeering, do guilefully discover, and turne to a greatederision.” At Chester the annual pageant on Midsummer Eve included the effigies of fourgiants, with animals, hobby-horses, and other figures. At Coventry it appears that thegiant’s wife figured beside the giant. At Burford, in Oxfordshire, Midsummer Eve used tobe celebrated with great jollity by the carrying of a giant and a dragon up and down thetown. The last survivor of these perambulating English giants lingered at Salisbury, wherean antiquary found him mouldering to decay in the neglected hall of the Tailors’ Companyabout the year 1844. His bodily framework was a lath and hoop, like the one which used tobe worn by Jack-in-the-Green on May Day.In these cases the giants merely figured in the processions. But sometimes they wereburned in the summer bonfires. Thus the people of the Rue aux Ours in Paris usedannually to make a great wicker-work figure, dressed as a soldier, which they promenadedup and down the streets for several days, and solemnly burned on the third of July, thecrowd of spectators singing Salve Regina. A personage who bore the title of king presidedover the ceremony with a lighted torch in his hand. The burning fragments of the imagewere scattered among the people, who eagerly scrambled for them. The custom wasabolished in 1743. In Brie, Isle de France, a wicker-work giant, eighteen feet high, wasannually burned on Midsummer Eve.Again, the Druidical custom of burning live animals, enclosed in wicker-work, has itscounterpart at the spring and midsummer festivals. At Luchon in the Pyrenees onMidsummer Eve “a hollow column, composed of strong wicker-work, is raised to the heightof about sixty feet in the centre of the principal suburb, and interlaced with green foliageup to the very top; while the most beautiful flowers and shrubs procurable are artisticallyarranged in groups below, so as to form a sort of background to the scene. The column isthen filled with combustible materials, ready for ignition. At an appointed hour—about 8P.M.—a grand procession, composed of the clergy, followed by young men and maidens inholiday attire, pour forth from the town chanting hymns, and take up their position aroundthe column. Meanwhile, bonfires are lit, with beautiful effect, in the surrounding hills. Asmany living serpents as could be collected are now thrown into the column, which is set onfire at the base by means of torches, armed with which about fifty boys and men dancearound with frantic gestures. The serpents, to avoid the flames, wriggle their way to thetop, whence they are seen lashing out laterally until finally obliged to drop, their strugglesfor life giving rise to enthusiastic delight among the surrounding spectators. This is a"},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"favourite annual ceremony for the inhabitants of Luchon and its neighbourhood, and localtradition assigns it to a heathen origin.” In the midsummer fires formerly kindled on thePlace de Grève at Paris it was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats,which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a fox was burned.The people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing thatthey brought good luck. The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit thebonfire with their own hands. In 1648 Louis the Fourteenth, crowned with a wreath ofroses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partookof the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last occasion when a monarchpresided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris. At Metz midsummer fires were lighted withgreat pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in wicker cages, were burned alivein them, to the amusement of the people. Similarly at Gap, in the department of the HighAlps, cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire. In Russia a white cock wassometimes burned in the midsummer bonfire; in Meissen or Thuringia a horse’s head usedto be thrown into it. Sometimes animals are burned in the spring bonfires. In the Vosgescats were burned on Shrove Tuesday; in Alsace they were thrown into the Easter bonfire.In the department of the Ardennes cats were flung into the bonfires kindled on the firstSunday in Lent; sometimes, by a refinement of cruelty, they were hung over the fire fromthe end of a pole and roasted alive. “The cat, which represented the devil, could neversuffer enough.” While the creatures were perishing in the flames, the shepherds guardedtheir flocks and forced them to leap over the fire, esteeming this an infallible means ofpreserving them from disease and witchcraft. We have seen that squirrels were sometimesburned in the Easter fire.Thus it appears that the sacrificial rites of the Celts of ancient Gaul can be traced in thepopular festivals of modern Europe. Naturally it is in France, or rather in the wider areacomprised within the limits of ancient Gaul, that these rites have left the clearest traces inthe customs of burning giants of wicker-work and animals enclosed in wicker-work orbaskets. These customs, it will have been remarked, are generally observed at or aboutmidsummer. From this we may infer that the original rites of which these are thedegenerate successors were solemnised at midsummer. This inference harmonises with theconclusion suggested by a general survey of European folk-custom, that the midsummerfestival must on the whole have been the most widely diffused and the most solemn of allthe yearly festivals celebrated by the primitive Aryans in Europe. At the same time wemust bear in mind that among the British Celts the chief fire-festivals of the year appearcertainly to have been those of Beltane (May Day) and Hallowe’en (the last day ofOctober); and this suggests a doubt whether the Celts of Gaul also may not have celebratedtheir principal rites of fire, including their burnt sacrifices of men and animals, at thebeginning of May or the beginning of November rather than at Midsummer.We have still to ask, What is the meaning of such sacrifices? Why were men and animalsburnt to death at these festivals? If we are right in interpreting the modern European fire-festivals as attempts to break the power of witchcraft by burning or banning the witchesand warlocks, it seems to follow that we must explain the human sacrifices of the Celts inthe same manner; that is, we must suppose that the men whom the Druids burnt in wicker-work images were condemned to death on the ground that they were witches or wizards,and that the mode of execution by fire was chosen because burning alive is deemed the"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"surest mode of getting rid of these noxious and dangerous beings. The same explanationwould apply to the cattle and wild animals of many kinds which the Celts burned alongwith the men. They, too, we may conjecture, were supposed to be either under the spell ofwitchcraft or actually to be the witches and wizards, who had transformed themselves intoanimals for the purpose of prosecuting their infernal plots against the welfare of theirfellow-creatures. This conjecture is confirmed by the observation that the victims mostcommonly burned in modern bonfires have been cats, and that cats are precisely theanimals into which, with the possible exception of hares, witches were most usuallysupposed to transform themselves. Again, we have seen that serpents and foxes usedsometimes to be burnt in the midsummer fires; and Welsh and German witches arereported to have assumed the form both of foxes and serpents. In short, when weremember the great variety of animals whose forms witches can assume at pleasure, itseems easy on this hypothesis to account for the variety of living creatures that have beenburnt at festivals both in ancient Gaul and modern Europe; all these victims, we maysurmise, were doomed to the flames, not because they were animals, but because they werebelieved to be witches who had taken the shape of animals for their nefarious purposes.One advantage of explaining the ancient Celtic sacrifices in this way is that it introduces, asit were, a harmony and consistency into the treatment which Europe has meted out towitches from the earliest times down to about two centuries ago, when the growinginfluence of rationalism discredited the belief in witchcraft and put a stop to the custom ofburning witches. Be that as it may, we can now perhaps understand why the Druidsbelieved that the more persons they sentenced to death, the greater would be the fertility ofthe land. To a modern reader the connexion at first sight may not be obvious between theactivity of the hangman and the productivity of the earth. But a little reflection may satisfyhim that when the criminals who perish at the stake or on the gallows are witches, whosedelight it is to blight the crops of the farmer or to lay them low under storms of hail, theexecution of these wretches is really calculated to ensure an abundant harvest by removingone of the principal causes which paralyse the efforts and blast the hopes of thehusbandman.The Druidical sacrifices which we are considering were explained in a different way by W.Mannhardt. He supposed that the men whom the Druids burned in wicker-work imagesrepresented the spirits of vegetation, and accordingly that the custom of burning them wasa magical ceremony intended to secure the necessary sunshine for the crops. Similarly, heseems to have inclined to the view that the animals which used to be burnt in the bonfiresrepresented the cornspirit, which, as we saw in an earlier part of this work, is oftensupposed to assume the shape of an animal. This theory is no doubt tenable, and the greatauthority of W. Mannhardt entitles it to careful consideration. I adopted it in formereditions of this book; but on reconsideration it seems to me on the whole to be less probablethan the theory that the men and animals burnt in the fires perished in the character ofwitches. This latter view is strongly supported by the testimony of the people who celebratethe fire-festivals, since a popular name for the custom of kindling the fires is “burning thewitches,” effigies of witches are sometimes consumed in the flames, and the fires, theirembers, or their ashes are supposed to furnish protection against witchcraft. On the otherhand there is little to show that the effigies or the animals burnt in the fires are regarded bythe people as representatives of the vegetation-spirit, and that the bonfires are sun-charms.With regard to serpents in particular, which used to be burnt in the midsummer fire at"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"Luchon, I am not aware of any certain evidence that in Europe snakes have been regardedas embodiments of the tree-spirit or corn-spirit, though in other parts of the world theconception appears to be not unknown. Whereas the popular faith in the transformation ofwitches into animals is so general and deeply rooted, and the fear of these uncanny beingsis so strong, that it seems safer to suppose that the cats and other animals which were burntin the fire suffered death as embodiments of witches than that they perished asrepresentatives of vegetation-spirits.LXV. Balder and the MistletoeTHE READER may remember that the preceding account of the popular fire-festivals ofEurope was suggested by the myth of the Norse god Balder, who is said to have been slainby a branch of mistletoe and burnt in a great fire. We have now to enquire how far thecustoms which have been passed in review help to shed light on the myth. In this enquiry itmay be convenient to begin with the mistletoe, the instrument of Balder’s death.From time immemorial the mistletoe has been the object of superstitious veneration inEurope. It was worshipped by the Druids, as we learn from a famous passage of Pliny.After enumerating the different kinds of mistletoe, he proceeds: “In treating of this subject,the admiration in which the mistletoe is held throughout Gaul ought not to pass unnoticed.The Druids, for so they call their wizards, esteem nothing more sacred than the mistletoeand the tree on which it grows, provided only that the tree is an oak. But apart from thisthey choose oak-woods for their sacred groves and perform no sacred rites without oak-leaves; so that the very name of Druids may be regarded as a Greek appellation derivedfrom their worship of the oak. For they believe that whatever grows on these trees is sentfrom heaven, and is a sign that the tree has been chosen by the god himself. The mistletoe isvery rarely to be met with; but when it is found, they gather it with solemn ceremony. Thisthey do above all on the sixth day of the moon, from whence they date the beginnings oftheir months, of their years, and of their thirty years’ cycle, because by the sixth day themoon has plenty of vigour and has not run half its course. After due preparations havebeen made for a sacrifice and a feast under the tree, they hail it as the universal healer andbring to the spot two white bulls, whose horns have never been bound before. A priest cladin a white robe climbs the tree and with a golden sickle cuts the mistletoe, which is caughtin a white cloth. Then they sacrifice the victims, praying that God may make his own gift toprosper with those upon whom he has bestowed it. They believe that a potion preparedfrom mistletoe will make barren animals to bring forth, and that the plant is a remedyagainst all poison.”In another passage Pliny tells us that in medicine the mistletoe which grows on an oak wasesteemed the most efficacious, and that its efficacy was by some superstitious peoplesupposed to be increased if the plant was gathered on the first day of the moon without theuse of iron, and if when gathered it was not allowed to touch the earth; oak-mistletoe thusobtained was deemed a cure for epilepsy; carried about by women it assisted them toconceive; and it healed ulcers most effectually, if only the sufferer chewed a piece of theplant and laid another piece on the sore. Yet, again, he says that mistletoe was supposed,like vinegar and an egg, to be an excellent means of extinguishing a fire."},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"If in these latter passages Pliny refers, as he apparently does, to the beliefs current amonghis contemporaries in Italy, it will follow that the Druids and the Italians were to someextent agreed as to the valuable properties possessed by mistletoe which grows on an oak;both of them deemed it an effectual remedy for a number of ailments, and both of themascribed to it a quickening virtue, the Druids believing that a potion prepared frommistletoe would fertilise barren cattle, and the Italians holding that a piece of mistletoecarried about by a woman would help her to conceive a child. Further, both peoplesthought that if the plant were to exert its medicinal properties it must be gathered in acertain way and at a certain time. It might not be cut with iron, hence the Druids cut it withgold; and it might not touch the earth, hence the Druids caught it in a white cloth. Inchoosing the time for gathering the plant, both peoples were determined by observation ofthe moon; only they differed as to the particular day of the moon, the Italians preferringthe first, and the Druids the sixth.With these beliefs of the ancient Gauls and Italians as to the wonderful medicinalproperties of mistletoe we may compare the similar beliefs of the modern Aino of Japan.We read that they, “like many nations of the Northern origin, hold the mistletoe in peculiarveneration. They look upon it as a medicine, good in almost every disease, and it issometimes taken in food and at others separately as a decoction. The leaves are used inpreference to the berries, the latter being of too sticky a nature for general purposes... .But many, too, suppose this plant to have the power of making the gardens bear plentifully.When used for this purpose, the leaves are cut up into fine pieces, and, after having beenprayed over, are sown with the millet and other seeds, a little also being eaten with thefood. Barren women have also been known to eat the mistletoe, in order to be made to bearchildren. That mistletoe which grows upon the willow is supposed to have the greatestefficacy. This is because the willow is looked upon by them as being an especially sacredtree.”Thus the Aino agree with the Druids in regarding mistletoe as a cure for almost everydisease, and they agree with the ancient Italians that applied to women it helps them tobear children. Again, the Druidical notion that the mistletoe was an “all-healer” or panaceamay be compared with a notion entertained by the Walos of Senegambia. These people“have much veneration for a sort of mistletoe, which they call tob; they carry leaves of it ontheir persons when they go to war as a preservative against wounds, just as if the leaveswere real talismans (gris-gris).” The French writer who records this practice adds: “Is itnot very curious that the mistletoe should be in this part of Africa what it was in thesuperstitions of the Gauls? This prejudice, common to the two countries, may have thesame origin; blacks and whites will doubtless have seen, each of them for themselves,something supernatural in a plant which grows and flourishes without having roots in theearth. May they not have believed, in fact, that it was a plant fallen from the sky, a gift ofthe divinity?”This suggestion as to the origin of the superstition is strongly confirmed by the Druidicalbelief, reported by Pliny, that whatever grew on an oak was sent from heaven and was asign that the tree had been chosen by the god himself. Such a belief explains why theDruids cut the mistletoe, not with a common knife, but with a golden sickle, and why, whencut, it was not suffered to touch the earth; probably they thought that the celestial plant"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"would have been profaned and its marvellous virtue lost by contact with the ground. Withthe ritual observed by the Druids in cutting the mistletoe we may compare the ritual whichin Cambodia is prescribed in a similar case. They say that when you see an orchid growingas a parasite on a tamarind tree, you should dress in white, take a new earthenware pot,then climb the tree at noon, break off the plant, put it in the pot and let the pot fall to theground. After that you make in the pot a decoction which confers the gift of invulnerability.Thus just as in Africa the leaves of one parasitic plant are supposed to render the wearerinvulnerable, so in Cambodia a decoction made from another parasitic plant is consideredto render the same service to such as make use of it, whether by drinking or washing. Wemay conjecture that in both places the notion of invulnerability is suggested by the positionof the plant, which, occupying a place of comparative security above the ground, appears topromise to its fortunate possessor a similar security from some of the ills that beset the lifeof man on earth. We have already met with examples of the store which the primitive mindsets on such vantage grounds.Whatever may be the origin of these beliefs and practices concerning the mistletoe, certainit is that some of them have their analogies in the folk-lore of modern European peasants.For example, it is laid down as a rule in various parts of Europe that mistletoe may not becut in the ordinary way but must be shot or knocked down with stones from the tree onwhich it is growing. Thus, in the Swiss canton of Aargau “all parasitic plants are esteemedin a certain sense holy by the country folk, but most particularly so the mistletoe growingon an oak. They ascribe great powers to it, but shrink from cutting it off in the usualmanner. Instead of that they procure it in the following manner. When the sun is inSagittarius and the moon is on the wane, on the first, third, or fourth day before the newmoon, one ought to shoot down with an arrow the mistletoe of an oak and to catch it withthe left hand as it falls. Such mistletoe is a remedy for every ailment of children.” Hereamong the Swiss peasants, as among the Druids of old, special virtue is ascribed tomistletoe which grows on an oak: it may not be cut in the usual way: it must be caught as itfalls to the ground; and it is esteemed a panacea for all diseases, at least of children. InSweden, also, it is a popular superstition that if mistletoe is to possess its peculiar virtue, itmust either be shot down out of the oak or knocked down with stones. Similarly, “so late asthe early part of the nineteenth century, people in Wales believed that for the mistletoe tohave any power, it must be shot or struck down with stones off the tree where it grew.”Again, in respect of the healing virtues of mistletoe the opinion of modern peasants, andeven of the learned, has to some extent agreed with that of the ancients. The Druids appearto have called the plant, or perhaps the oak on which it grew, the “all-healer”; and “all-healer” is said to be still a name of the mistletoe in the modern Celtic speech of Brittany,Wales, Ireland, and Scotland. On St. John’s morning (Midsummer morning) peasants ofPiedmont and Lombardy go out to search the oak-leaves for the “oil of St. John,” which issupposed to heal all wounds made with cutting instruments. Originally, perhaps, the “oil ofSt. John” was simply the mistletoe, or a decoction made from it. For in Holstein themistletoe, especially oak-mistletoe, is still regarded as a panacea for green wounds and as asure charm to secure success in hunting; and at Lacaune, in the south of France, the oldDruidical belief in the mistletoe as an antidote to all poisons still survives among thepeasantry; they apply the plant to the stomach of the sufferer or give him a decoction of itto drink. Again, the ancient belief that mistletoe is a cure for epilepsy has survived in"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"modern times not only among the ignorant but among the learned. Thus in Sweden personsafflicted with the falling sickness think they can ward off attacks of the malady by carryingabout with them a knife which has a handle of oak mistletoe; and in Germany for a similarpurpose pieces of mistletoe used to be hung round the necks of children. In the Frenchprovince of Bourbonnais a popular remedy for epilepsy is a decoction of mistletoe whichhas been gathered on an oak on St. John’s Day and boiled with rye-flour. So at Bottesfordin Lincolnshire a decoction of mistletoe is supposed to be a palliative for this terribledisease. Indeed mistletoe was recommended as a remedy for the falling sickness by highmedical authorities in England and Holland down to the eighteenth century.However, the opinion of the medical profession as to the curative virtues of mistletoe hasundergone a radical alteration. Whereas the Druids thought that mistletoe curedeverything, modern doctors appear to think that it cures nothing. If they are right, we mustconclude that the ancient and widespread faith in the medicinal virtue of mistletoe is a puresuperstition based on nothing better than the fanciful inferences which ignorance hasdrawn from the parasitic nature of the plant, its position high up on the branch of a treeseeming to protect it from the dangers to which plants and animals are subject on thesurface of the ground. From this point of view we can perhaps understand why mistletoehas so long and so persistently been prescribed as a cure for the falling sickness. Asmistletoe cannot fall to the ground because it is rooted on the branch of a tree high abovethe earth, it seems to follow as a necessary consequence that an epileptic patient cannotpossibly fall down in a fit so long as he carries a piece of mistletoe in his pocket or adecoction of mistletoe in his stomach. Such a train of reasoning would probably beregarded even now as cogent by a large portion of the human species.Again the ancient Italian opinion that mistletoe extinguishes fire appears to be shared bySwedish peasants, who hang up bunches of oak-mistletoe on the ceilings of their rooms as aprotection against harm in general and conflagration in particular. A hint as to the way inwhich mistletoe comes to be possessed of this property is furnished by the epithet “thunder-bosom,” which people of the Aargau canton in Switzerland apply to the plant. For athunder-besom is a shaggy, bushy excrescence on branches of trees, which is popularlybelieved to be produced by a flash of lightning; hence in Bohemia a thunder-besom burntin the fire protects the house against being struck by a thunder-bolt. Being itself a productof lightning it naturally serves, on homoeopathic principles, as a protection againstlightning, in fact as a kind of lightning-conductor. Hence the fire which mistletoe in Swedenis designed especially to avert from houses may be fire kindled by lightning; though nodoubt the plant is equally effective against conflagration in general.Again, mistletoe acts as a master-key as well as a lightning-conductor; for it is said to openall locks. But perhaps the most precious of all the virtues of mistletoe is that it affordsefficient protection against sorcery and witchcraft. That, no doubt, is the reason why inAustria a twig of mistletoe is laid on the threshold as a preventive of nightmare; and it maybe the reason why in the north of England they say that if you wish your dairy to thrive youshould give your bunch of mistletoe to the first cow that calves after New Year’s Day, for itis well known that nothing is so fatal to milk and butter as witchcraft. Similarly in Wales,for the sake of ensuring good luck to the dairy, people used to give a branch of mistletoe tothe first cow that gave birth to a calf after the first hour of the New Year; and in rural"},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"districts of Wales, where mistletoe abounded, there was always a profusion of it in thefarmhouses. When mistletoe was scarce, Welsh farmers used to say, “No mistletoe, noluck”; but if there was a fine crop of mistletoe, they expected a fine crop of corn. In Swedenmistletoe is diligently sought after on St. John’s Eve, the people “believing it to be, in a highdegree, possessed of mystic qualities; and that if a sprig of it be attached to the ceiling ofthe dwelling-house, the horse’s stall, or the cow’s crib, the Troll will then be powerless toinjure either man or beast.”With regard to the time when the mistletoe should be gathered opinions have varied. TheDruids gathered it above all on the sixth day of the moon, the ancient Italians apparentlyon the first day of the moon. In modern times some have preferred the full moon of Marchand others the waning moon of winter when the sun is in Sagittarius. But the favourite timewould seem to be Midsummer Eve or Midsummer Day. We have seen that both in Franceand Sweden special virtues are ascribed to mistletoe gathered at Midsummer. The rule inSweden is that “mistletoe must be cut on the night of Midsummer Eve when sun and moonstand in the sign of their might.” Again, in Wales it was believed that a sprig of mistletoegathered on St. John’s Eve (Midsummer Eve), or at any time before the berries appeared,would induce dreams of omen, both good and bad, if it were placed under the pillow of thesleeper. Thus mistletoe is one of the many plants whose magical or medicinal virtues arebelieved to culminate with the culmination of the sun on the longest day of the year. Henceit seems reasonable to conjecture that in the eyes of the Druids, also, who revered the plantso highly, the sacred mistletoe may have acquired a double portion of its mystic qualities atthe solstice in June, and that accordingly they may have regularly cut it with solemnceremony on Midsummer Eve.Be that as it may, certain it is that the mistletoe, the instrument of Balder’s death, has beenregularly gathered for the sake of its mystic qualities on Midsummer Eve in Scandinavia,Balder’s home. The plant is found commonly growing on pear-trees, oaks, and other treesin thick damp woods throughout the more temperate parts of Sweden. Thus one of the twomain incidents of Balder’s myth is reproduced in the great midsummer festival ofScandinavia. But the other main incident of the myth, the burning of Balder’s body on apyre, has also its counterpart in the bonfires which still blaze, or blazed till lately, inDenmark, Norway, and Sweden on Midsummer Eve. It does not appear, indeed, that anyeffigy is burned in these bonfires; but the burning of an effigy is a feature which mighteasily drop out after its meaning was forgotten. And the name of Balder’s balefires(Balder’s Bălar), by which these midsummer fires were formerly known in Sweden, putstheir connexion with Balder beyond the reach of doubt, and makes it probable that informer times either a living representative or an effigy of Balder was annually burned inthem. Midsummer was the season sacred to Balder, and the Swedish poet Tegner, inplacing the burning of Balder at midsummer, may very well have followed an old traditionthat the summer solstice was the time when the good god came to his untimely end.Thus it has been shown that the leading incidents of the Balder myth have theircounterparts in those fire-festivals of our European peasantry which undoubtedly datefrom a time long prior to the introduction of Christianity. The pretence of throwing thevictim chosen by lot into the Beltane fire, and the similar treatment of the man, the futureGreen Wolf, at the midsummer bonfire in Normandy, may naturally be interpreted as"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"traces of an older custom of actually burning human beings on these occasions; and thegreen dress of the Green Wolf, coupled with the leafy envelope of the young fellow whotrod out the midsummer fire at Moosheim, seems to hint that the persons who perished atthese festivals did so in the character of tree-spirits or deities of vegetation. From all this wemay reasonably infer that in the Balder myth on the one hand, and the fire-festivals andcustom of gathering mistletoe on the other hand, we have, as it were, the two broken anddissevered halves of an original whole. In other words, we may assume with some degree ofprobability that the myth of Balder’s death was not merely a myth, that is, a description ofphysical phenomena in imagery borrowed from human life, but that it was at the same timethe story which people told to explain why they annually burned a human representative ofthe god and cut the mistletoe with solemn ceremony. If I am right, the story of Balder’stragic end formed, so to say, the text of the sacred drama which was acted year by year as amagical rite to cause the sun to shine, trees to grow, crops to thrive, and to guard man andbeast from the baleful arts of fairies and trolls, of witches and warlocks. The tale belonged,in short, to that class of nature myths which are meant to be supplemented by ritual; here,as so often, myth stood to magic in the relation of theory to practice.But if the victims—the human Balders—who died by fire, whether in spring or atmidsummer, were put to death as living embodiments of tree-spirits or deities ofvegetation, it would seem that Balder himself must have been a tree-spirit or deity ofvegetation. It becomes desirable, therefore, to determine, if we can, the particular kind oftree or trees, of which a personal representative was burned at the fire-festivals. For wemay be quite sure that it was not as a representative of vegetation in general that the victimsuffered death. The idea of vegetation in general is too abstract to be primitive. Mostprobably the victim at first represented a particular kind of sacred tree. But of allEuropean trees none has such claims as the oak to be considered as pre-eminently thesacred tree of the Aryans. We have seen that its worship is attested for all the greatbranches of the Aryan stock in Europe; hence we may certainly conclude that the tree wasvenerated by the Aryans in common before the dispersion, and that their primitive homemust have lain in a land which was clothed with forests of oak.Now, considering the primitive character and remarkable similarity of the fire-festivalsobserved by all the branches of the Aryan race in Europe, we may infer that these festivalsform part of the common stock of religious observances which the various peoples carriedwith them in their wanderings from their old home. But, if I am right, an essential featureof those primitive fire-festivals was the burning of a man who represented the tree-spirit.In view, then, of the place occupied by the oak in the religion of the Aryans, thepresumption is that the tree so represented at the fire-festivals must originally have beenthe oak. So far as the Celts and Lithuanians are concerned, this conclusion will perhapshardly be contested. But both for them and for the Germans it is confirmed by aremarkable piece of religious conservatism. The most primitive method known to man ofproducing fire is by rubbing two pieces of wood against each other till they ignite; and wehave seen that this method is still used in Europe for kindling sacred fires such as the need-fire, and that most probably it was formerly resorted to at all the fire-festivals underdiscussion. Now it is sometimes required that the need-fire, or other sacred fire, should bemade by the friction of a particular kind of wood; and when the kind of wood is prescribed,whether among Celts, Germans, or Slavs, that wood appears to be generally the oak. But if"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"the sacred fire was regularly kindled by the friction of oak-wood, we may infer thatoriginally the fire was also fed with the same material. In point of fact, it appears that theperpetual fire of Vesta at Rome was fed with oak-wood, and that oak-wood was the fuelconsumed in the perpetual fire which burned under the sacred oak at the great Lithuaniansanctuary of Romove. Further, that oak-wood was formerly the fuel burned in themidsummer fires may perhaps be inferred from the custom, said to be still observed bypeasants in many mountain districts of Germany, of making up the cottage fire onMidsummer Day with a heavy block of oak-wood. The block is so arranged that itsmoulders slowly and is not finally reduced to charcoal till the expiry of a year. Then uponnext Midsummer Day the charred embers of the old log are removed to make room for thenew one, and are mixed with the seed-corn or scattered about the garden. This is believedto guard the food cooked on the hearth from witchcraft, to preserve the luck of the house,to promote the growth of the crops, and to keep them from blight and vermin. Thus thecustom is almost exactly parallel to that of the Yule-log, which in parts of Germany,France, England, Serbia, and other Slavonic lands was commonly of oak-wood. Thegeneral conclusion is, that at those periodic or occasional ceremonies the ancient Aryansboth kindled and fed the fire with the sacred oak-wood.But if at these solemn rites the fire was regularly made of oakwood, it follows that any manwho was burned in it as a personification of the tree-spirit could have represented no treebut the oak. The sacred oak was thus burned in duplicate; the wood of the tree wasconsumed in the fire, and along with it was consumed a living man as a personification ofthe oak-spirit. The conclusion thus drawn for the European Aryans in general is confirmedin its special application to the Scandinavians by the relation in which amongst them themistletoe appears to have stood to the burning of the victim in the midsummer fire. Wehave seen that among Scandinavians it has been customary to gather the mistletoe atmidsummer. But so far as appears on the face of this custom, there is nothing to connect itwith the midsummer fires in which human victims or effigies of them were burned. Even ifthe fire, as seems probable, was originally always made with oak-wood, why should it havebeen necessary to pull the mistletoe? The last link between the midsummer customs ofgathering the mistletoe and lighting the bonfires is supplied by Balder’s myth, which canhardly be disjoined from the customs in question. The myth suggests that a vital connexionmay once have been believed to subsist between the mistletoe and the human representativeof the oak who was burned in the fire. According to the myth, Balder could be killed bynothing in heaven or earth except the mistletoe; and so long as the mistletoe remained onthe oak, he was not only immortal but invulnerable. Now, if we suppose that Balder was theoak, the origin of the myth becomes intelligible. The mistletoe was viewed as the seat of lifeof the oak, and so long as it was uninjured nothing could kill or even wound the oak. Theconception of the mistletoe as the seat of life of the oak would naturally be suggested toprimitive people by the observation that while the oak is deciduous, the mistletoe whichgrows on it is evergreen. In winter the sight of its fresh foliage among the bare branchesmust have been hailed by the worshippers of the tree as a sign that the divine life whichhad ceased to animate the branches yet survived in the mistletoe, as the heart of a sleeperstill beats when his body is motionless. Hence when the god had to be killed—when thesacred tree had to be burnt—it was necessary to begin by breaking off the mistletoe. For solong as the mistletoe remained intact, the oak (so people might think) was invulnerable; allthe blows of their knives and axes would glance harmless from its surface. But once tear"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"from the oak its sacred heart—the mistletoe—and the tree nodded to its fall. And when inlater times the spirit of the oak came to be represented by a living man, it was logicallynecessary to suppose that, like the tree he personated, he could neither be killed norwounded so long as the mistletoe remained uninjured. The pulling of the mistletoe was thusat once the signal and the cause of his death.On this view the invulnerable Balder is neither more nor less than a personification of amistletoe-bearing oak. The interpretation is confirmed by what seems to have been anancient Italian belief, that the mistletoe can be destroyed neither by fire nor water; for ifthe parasite is thus deemed indestructible, it might easily be supposed to communicate itsown indestructibility to the tree on which it grows, so long as the two remain inconjunction. Or, to put the same idea in mythical form, we might tell how the kindly god ofthe oak had his life securely deposited in the imperishable mistletoe which grew among thebranches; how accordingly so long as the mistletoe kept its place there, the deity himselfremained invulnerable; and how at last a cunning foe, let into the secret of the god’sinvulnerability, tore the mistletoe from the oak, thereby killing the oak-god and afterwardsburning his body in a fire which could have made no impression on him so long as theincombustible parasite retained its seat among the boughs.But since the idea of a being whose life is thus, in a sense, outside himself, must be strangeto many readers, and has, indeed, not yet been recognised in its full bearing on primitivesuperstition, it will be worth while to illustrate it by examples drawn both from story andcustom. The result will be to show that, in assuming this idea as the explanation of Balder’srelation to the mistletoe, I assume a principle which is deeply engraved on the mind ofprimitive man.LXVI. The External Soul in Folk-TalesIN A FORMER part of this work we saw that, in the opinion of primitive people, the soulmay temporarily absent itself from the body without causing death. Such temporaryabsences of the soul are often believed to involve considerable risk, since the wanderingsoul is liable to a variety of mishaps at the hands of enemies, and so forth. But there isanother aspect to this power of disengaging the soul from the body. If only the safety of thesoul can be ensured during its absence, there is no reason why the soul should not continueabsent for an indefinite time; indeed a man may, on a pure calculation of personal safety,desire that his soul should never return to his body. Unable to conceive of life abstractly asa “permanent possibility of sensation” or a “continuous adjustment of internalarrangements to external relations,” the savage thinks of it as a concrete material thing of adefinite bulk, capable of being seen and handled, kept in a box or jar, and liable to bebruised, fractured, or smashed in pieces. It is not needful that the life, so conceived, shouldbe in the man; it may be absent from his body and still continue to animate him by virtueof a sort of sympathy or action at a distance. So long as this object which he calls his life orsoul remains unharmed, the man is well; if it is injured, he suffers; if it is destroyed, hedies. Or, to put it otherwise, when a man is ill or dies, the fact is explained by saying thatthe material object called his life or soul, whether it be in his body or out of it, has eithersustained injury or been destroyed. But there may be circumstances in which, if the life or"},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"soul remains in the man, it stands a greater chance of sustaining injury than if it werestowed away in some safe and secret place. Accordingly, in such circumstances, primitiveman takes his soul out of his body and deposits it for security in some snug spot, intendingto replace it in his body when the danger is past. Or if he should discover some place ofabsolute security, he may be content to leave his soul there permanently. The advantage ofthis is that, so long as the soul remains unharmed in the place where he has deposited it, theman himself is immortal; nothing can kill his body, since his life is not in it.Evidence of this primitive belief is furnished by a class of folk-tales of which the Norsestory of “The giant who had no heart in his body” is perhaps the best-known example.Stories of this kind are widely diffused over the world, and from their number and thevariety of incident and of details in which the leading idea is embodied, we may infer thatthe conception of an external soul is one which has had a powerful hold on the minds ofmen at an early stage of history. For folk-tales are a faithful reflection of the world as itappeared to the primitive mind; and we may be sure that any idea which commonly occursin them, however absurd it may seem to us, must once have been an ordinary article ofbelief. This assurance, so far as it concerns the supposed power of disengaging the soulfrom the body for a longer or shorter time, is amply corroborated by a comparison of thefolk-tales in question with the actual beliefs and practices of savages. To this we shallreturn after some specimens of the tales have been given. The specimens will be selectedwith a view of illustrating both the characteristic features and the wide diffusion of thisclass of tales.In the first place, the story of the external soul is told, in various forms, by all Aryanpeoples from Hindoostan to the Hebrides. A very common form of it is this: A warlock,giant, or other fairyland being is invulnerable and immortal because he keeps his soulhidden far away in some secret place; but a fair princess, whom he holds enthralled in hisenchanted castle, wiles his secret from him and reveals it to the hero, who seeks out thewarlock’s soul, heart, life, or death (as it is variously called), and by destroying it,simultaneously kills the warlock. Thus a Hindoo story tells how a magician called Punchkinheld a queen captive for twelve years, and would fain marry her, but she would not havehim. At last the queen’s son came to rescue her, and the two plotted together to killPunchkin. So the queen spoke the magician fair, and pretended that she had at last madeup her mind to marry him. “And do tell me,” she said, “are you quite immortal? Can deathnever touch you? And are you too great an enchanter ever to feel human suffering?” “It istrue,” he said, “that I am not as others. Far, far away, hundreds of thousands of miles fromthis, there lies a desolate country covered with thick jungle. In the midst of the junglegrows a circle of palm trees, and in the centre of the circle stand six chattees full of water,piled one above another: below the sixth chattee is a small cage, which contains a littlegreen parrot;—on the life of the parrot depends my life;—and if the parrot is killed I mustdie. It is, however,” he added, “impossible that the parrot should sustain any injury, bothon account of the inaccessibility of the country, and because, by my appointment, manythousand genii surround the palm trees, and kill all who approach the place.” But thequeen’s young son overcame all difficulties, and got possession of the parrot. He brought itto the door of the magician’s palace, and began playing with it. Punchkin, the magician,saw him, and, coming out, tried to persuade the boy to give him the parrot. “Give me myparrot!” cried Punchkin. Then the boy took hold of the parrot and tore off one of his"},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"wings; and as he did so the magician’s right arm fell off. Punchkin then stretched out hisleft arm, crying, “Give me my parrot!” The prince pulled off the parrot’s second wing, andthe magician’s left arm tumbled off. “Give me my parrot!” cried he, and fell on his knees.The prince pulled off the parrot’s right leg, the magician’s right leg fell off; the princepulled off the parrot’s left leg, down fell the magician’s left. Nothing remained of himexcept the trunk and the head; but still he rolled his eyes, and cried, “Give me my parrot!”“Take your parrot, then,” cried the boy; and with that he wrung the bird’s neck, and threwit at the magician; and, as he did so, Punchkin’s head twisted round, and, with a fearfulgroan, he died! In another Hindoo tale an ogre is asked by his daughter, “Papa, where doyou keep your soul?” “Sixteen miles away from this place,” he said, “is a tree. Round thetree are tigers, and bears, and scorpions, and snakes; on the top of the tree is a very greatfat snake; on his head is a little cage; in the cage is a bird; and my soul is in that bird.” Theend of the ogre is like that of the magician in the previous tale. As the bird’s wings and legsare torn off, the ogre’s arms and legs drop off; and when its neck is wrung he falls downdead. In a Bengalee story it is said that all the ogres dwell in Ceylon, and that all their livesare in a single lemon. A boy cuts the lemon in pieces, and all the ogres die.In a Siamese or Cambodian story, probably derived from India, we are told thatThossakan or Ravana, the King of Ceylon, was able by magic art to take his soul out of hisbody and leave it in a box at home, while he went to the wars. Thus he was invulnerable inbattle. When he was about to give battle to Rama, he deposited his soul with a hermit calledFire-eye, who was to keep it safe for him. So in the fight Rama was astounded to see thathis arrows struck the king without wounding him. But one of Rama’s allies, knowing thesecret of the king’s invulnerability, transformed himself by magic into the likeness of theking, and going to the hermit asked back his soul. On receiving it he soared up into the airand flew to Rama, brandishing the box and squeezing it so hard that all the breath left theKing of Ceylon’s body, and he died. In a Bengalee story a prince going into a far countryplanted with his own hands a tree in the courtyard of his father’s palace, and said to hisparents, “This tree is my life. When you see the tree green and fresh, then know that it iswell with me; when you see the tree fade in some parts, then know that I am in an ill case;and when you see the whole tree fade, then know that I am dead and gone.” In anotherIndian tale a prince, setting forth on his travels, left behind him a barley plant, withinstructions that it should be carefully tended and watched; for if it flourished, he would bealive and well, but if it drooped, then some mischance was about to happen to him. And soit fell out. For the prince was beheaded, and as his head rolled off, the barley plant snappedin two and the ear of barley fell to the ground.In Greek tales, ancient and modern, the idea of an external soul is not uncommon. WhenMeleager was seven days old, the Fates appeared to his mother and told her that Meleagerwould die when the brand which was blazing on the hearth had burnt down. So his mothersnatched the brand from the fire and kept it in a box. But in after-years, being enraged ather son for slaying her brothers, she burnt the brand in the fire and Meleager expired inagonies, as if flames were preying on his vitals. Again, Nisus King of Megara had a purpleor golden hair on the middle of his head, and it was fated that whenever the hair was pulledout the king should die. When Megara was besieged by the Cretans, the king’s daughterScylla fell in love with Minos, their king, and pulled out the fatal hair from her father’shead. So he died. In a modern Greek folk-tale a man’s strength lies in three golden hairs on"},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"his head. When his mother pulls them out, he grows weak and timid and is slain by hisenemies. In another modern Greek story the life of an enchanter is bound up with threedoves which are in the belly of a wild boar. When the first dove is killed, the magiciangrows sick; when the second is killed, he grows very sick; and when the third is killed, hedies. In another Greek story of the same sort an ogre’s strength is in three singing birdswhich are in a wild boar. The hero kills two of the birds, and then coming to the ogre’shouse finds him lying on the ground in great pain. He shows the third bird to the ogre, whobegs that the hero will either let it fly away or give it to him to eat. But the hero wrings thebird’s neck, and the ogre dies on the spot.In a modern Roman version of “Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp,” the magician tells theprincess, whom he holds captive in a floating rock in mid-ocean, that he will never die. Theprincess reports this to the prince her husband, who has come to rescue her. The princereplies, “It is impossible but that there should be some one thing or other that is fatal tohim; ask him what that one fatal thing is.” So the princess asked the magician, and he toldher that in the wood was a hydra with seven heads; in the middle head of the hydra was aleveret, in the head of the leveret was a bird, in the bird’s head was a precious stone, and ifthis stone were put under his pillow he would die. The prince procured the stone, and theprincess laid it under the magician’s pillow. No sooner did the enchanter lay his head onthe pillow than he gave three terrible yells, turned himself round and round three times,and died.Stories of the same sort are current among Slavonic peoples. Thus a Russian story tells howa warlock called Koshchei the Deathless carried off a princess and kept her prisoner in hisgolden castle. However, a prince made up to her one day as she was walking alone anddisconsolate in the castle garden, and cheered by the prospect of escaping with him shewent to the warlock and coaxed him with false and flattering words, saying, “My dearestfriend, tell me, I pray you, will you never die?” “Certainly not,” says he. “Well,” says she,“and where is your death? is it in your dwelling?” “To be sure it is,” says he, “it is in thebroom under the threshold.” Thereupon the princess seized the broom and threw it on thefire, but although the broom burned, the deathless Koshchei remained alive; indeed not somuch as a hair of him was singed. Balked in her first attempt, the artful hussy pouted andsaid, “You do not love me true, for you have not told me where your death is; yet I am notangry, but love you with all my heart.” With these fawning words she besought the warlockto tell her truly where his death was. So he laughed and said, “Why do you wish to know?Well then, out of love I will tell you where it lies. In a certain field there stand three greenoaks, and under the roots of the largest oak is a worm, and if ever this worm is found andcrushed, that instant I shall die.” When the princess heard these words, she went straightto her lover and told him all; and he searched till he found the oaks and dug up the wormand crushed it. Then he hurried to the warlock’s castle, but only to learn from the princessthat the warlock was still alive. Then she fell to wheedling and coaxing Koshchei oncemore, and this time, overcome by her wiles, he opened his heart to her and told her thetruth. “My death,” said he, “is far from here and hard to find, on the wide ocean. In thatsea is an island, and on the island there grows a green oak, and beneath the oak is an ironchest, and in the chest is a small basket, and in the basket is a hare, and in the hare is aduck, and in the duck is an egg; and he who finds the egg and breaks it, kills me at thesame time.” The prince naturally procured the fateful egg and with it in his hands he"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"confronted the deathless warlock. The monster would have killed him, but the prince beganto squeeze the egg. At that the warlock shrieked with pain, and turning to the falseprincess, who stood by smirking and smiling, “Was it not out of love for you,” said he,“that I told you where my death was? And is this the return you make to me?” With thathe grabbed at his sword, which hung from a peg on the wall; but before he could reach it,the prince had crushed the egg, and sure enough the deathless warlock found his death atthe same moment. “In one of the descriptions of Koshchei’s death, he is said to be killed bya blow on the forehead inflicted by the mysterious egg—that last link in the magic chain bywhich his life is darkly bound. In another version of the same story, but told of a snake, thefatal blow is struck by a small stone found in the yolk of an egg, which is inside a duck,which is inside a hare, which is inside a stone, which is on an island.”Amongst peoples of the Teutonic stock stories of the external soul are not wanting. In a taletold by the Saxons of Transylvania it is said that a young man shot at a witch again andagain. The bullets went clean through her but did her no harm, and she only laughed andmocked at him. “Silly earthworm,” she cried, “shoot as much as you like. It does me noharm. For know that my life resides not in me but far, far away. In a mountain is a pond,on the pond swims a duck, in the duck is an egg, in the egg burns a light, that light is mylife. If you could put out that light, my life would be at an end. But that can never, neverbe.” However, the young man got hold of the egg, smashed it, and put out the light, andwith it the witch’s life went out also. In a German story a cannibal called Body withoutSoul or Soulless keeps his soul in a box, which stands on a rock in the middle of the RedSea. A soldier gets possession of the box and goes with it to Soulless, who begs the soldier togive him back his soul. But the soldier opens the box, takes out the soul, and flings itbackward over his head. At the same moment the cannibal drops dead to the ground.In another German story and old warlock lives with a damsel all alone in the midst of avast and gloomy wood. She fears that being old he may die and leave her alone in the forest.But he reassures her. “Dear child,” he said, “I cannot die, and I have no heart in mybreast.” But she importuned him to tell her where his heart was. So he said, “Far, far fromhere in an unknown and lonesome land stands a great church. The church is well securedwith iron doors, and round about it flows a broad deep moat. In the church flies a bird andin the bird is my heart. So long as the bird lives, I live. It cannot die of itself, and no one cancatch it; therefore I cannot die, and you need have no anxiety.” However the young man,whose bride the damsel was to have been before the warlock spirited her away, contrived toreach the church and catch the bird. He brought it to the damsel, who stowed him and itaway under the warlock’s bed. Soon the old warlock came home. He was ailing, and saidso. The girl wept and said, “Alas, daddy is dying; he has a heart in his breast after all.”“Child,” replied the warlock, “hold your tongue. I can’t die. It will soon pass over.” At thatthe young man under the bed gave the bird a gentle squeeze; and as he did so, the oldwarlock felt very unwell and sat down. Then the young man gripped the bird tighter, andthe warlock fell senseless from his chair. “Now squeeze him dead,” cried the damsel. Herlover obeyed, and when the bird was dead, the old warlock also lay dead on the floor.In the Norse tale of “the giant who had no heart in his body,” the giant tells the captiveprincess, “Far, far away in a lake lies an island, on that island stands a church, in thatchurch is a well, in that well swims a duck, in that duck there is an egg, and in that egg"},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"there lies my heart.” The hero of the tale, with the help of some animals to whom he hadbeen kind, obtains the egg and squeezes it, at which the giant screams piteously and begsfor his life. But the hero breaks the egg in pieces and the giant at once bursts. In anotherNorse story a hill-ogre tells the captive princess that she will never be able to return homeunless she finds the grain of sand which lies under the ninth tongue of the ninth head of acertain dragon; but if that grain of sand were to come over the rock in which the ogres live,they would all burst “and the rock itself would become a gilded palace, and the lake greenmeadows.” The hero finds the grain of sand and takes it to the top of the high rock inwhich the ogres live. So all the ogres burst and the rest falls out as one of the ogres hadforetold.In a Celtic tale, recorded in the West Highlands of Scotland, a giant is questioned by acaptive queen as to where he keeps his soul. At last, after deceiving her several times, heconfides to her the fatal secret: “There is a great flagstone under the threshold. There is awether under the flag. There is a duck in the wether’s belly, and an egg in the belly of theduck, and it is in the egg that my soul is.” On the morrow when the giant was gone, thequeen contrived to get possession of the egg and crushed it in her hands, and at that verymoment the giant, who was coming home in the dusk, fell down dead. In another Celtictale, a sea beast has carried off a king’s daughter, and an old smith declares that there is noway of killing the beast but one. “In the island that is in the midst of the loch is EillidChaisfhion—the white-footed hind, of the slenderest legs, and the swiftest step, and thoughshe should be caught, there would spring a hoodie out of her, and though the hoodie shouldbe caught, there would spring a trout out of her, but there is an egg in the mouth of thetrout, and the soul of the beast is in the egg, and if the egg breaks, the beast is dead.” Asusual the egg is broken and the beast dies.In an Irish story we read how a giant kept a beautiful damsel a prisoner in his castle on thetop of a hill, which was white with the bones of the champions who had tried in vain torescue the fair captive. At last the hero, after hewing and slashing at the giant all to nopurpose, discovered that the only way to kill him was to rub a mole on the giant’s rightbreast with a certain egg, which was in a duck, which was in a chest, which lay locked andbound at the bottom of the sea. With the help of some obliging animals, the hero madehimself master of the precious egg and slew the giant by merely striking it against the moleon his right breast. Similarly in a Breton story there figures a giant whom neither fire norwater nor steel can harm. He tells his seventh wife, whom he has just married aftermurdering all her predecessors, “I am immortal, and no one can hurt me unless he crusheson my breast an egg, which is in a pigeon, which is in the belly of a hare; this hare is in thebelly of a wolf, and this wolf is in the belly of my brother, who dwells a thousand leaguesfrom here. So I am quite easy on that score.” A soldier contrived to obtain the egg andcrush it on the breast of the giant, who immediately expired. In another Breton tale the lifeof a giant resides in an old box-tree which grows in his castle garden; and to kill him it isnecessary to sever the tap-root of the tree at a single blow of an axe without injuring any ofthe lesser roots. This task the hero, as usual, successfully accomplishes, and at the samemoment the giant drops dead.The notion of an external soul has now been traced in folk-tales told by Aryan peoples fromIndia to Ireland. We have still to show that the same idea occurs commonly in the popular"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"stories of peoples who do not belong to the Aryan stock. In the ancient Egyptian tale of“The Two Brothers,” which was written down in the reign of Rameses II., about 1300 B.C.,we read how one of the brothers enchanted his heart and placed it in the flower of anacacia tree, and how, when the flower was cut at the instigation of his wife, he immediatelyfell down dead, but revived when his brother found the lost heart in the berry of the acaciaand threw it into a cup of fresh water.In the story of Seyf el-Mulook in the Arabian Nights the jinnee tells the captive daughter ofthe King of India, “When I was born, the astrologers declared that the destruction of mysoul would be effected by the hand of one of the sons of the human kings. I therefore tookmy soul, and put it into the crop of a sparrow, and I imprisoned the sparrow in a little box,and put this into another small box, and this I put within seven other small boxes, and I putthese within seven chests, and the chests I put into a coffer of marble within the verge ofthis circumambient ocean; for this part is remote from the countries of mankind, and noneof mankind can gain access to it.” But Seyf el-Mulook got possession of the sparrow andstrangled it, and the jinnee fell upon the ground a heap of black ashes. In a Kabyle story anogre declares that his fate is far away in an egg, which is in a pigeon, which is in a camel,which is in the sea. The hero procures the egg and crushes it between his hands, and theogre dies. In a Magyar folk-tale, an old witch detains a young prince called Ambrose in thebowels of the earth. At last she confided to him that she kept a wild boar in a silkenmeadow, and if it were killed, they would find a hare inside, and inside the hare a pigeon,and inside the pigeon a small box, and inside the box one black and one shining beetle: theshining beetle held her life, and the black one held her power; if these two beetles died, thenher life would come to an end also. When the old hag went out, Ambrose killed the wildboar, and took out the hare; from the hare he took the pigeon, from the pigeon the box, andfrom the box the two beetles; he killed the black beetle, but kept the shining one alive. Sothe witch’s power left her immediately, and when she came home, she had to take to herbed. Having learned from her how to escape from his prison to the upper air, Ambrosekilled the shining beetle, and the old hag’s spirit left her at once. In a Kalmuck tale we readhow a certain khan challenged a wise man to show his skill by stealing a precious stone onwhich the khan’s life depended. The sage contrived to purloin the talisman while the khanand his guards slept; but not content with this he gave a further proof of his dexterity bybonneting the slumbering potentate with a bladder. This was too much for the khan. Nextmorning he informed the sage that he could overlook everything else, but that the indignityof being bonneted with a bladder was more than he could bear; and he ordered hisfacetious friend to instant execution. Pained at this exhibition of royal ingratitude, the sagedashed to the ground the talisman which he still held in his hand; and at the same instantblood flowed from the nostrils of the khan, and he gave up the ghost.In a Tartar poem two heroes named Ak Molot and Bulat engage in mortal combat. AkMolot pierces his foe through and through with an arrow, grapples with him, and dasheshim to the ground, but all in vain, Bulat could not die. At last when the combat has lastedthree years, a friend of Ak Molot sees a golden casket hanging by a white thread from thesky, and bethinks him that perhaps this casket contains Bulat’s soul. So he shot through thewhite thread with an arrow, and down fell the casket. He opened it, and in the casket satten white birds, and one of the birds was Bulat’s soul. Bulat wept when he saw that his soulwas found in the casket. But one after the other the birds were killed, and then Ak Molot"},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"easily slew his foe. In another Tartar poem, two brothers going to fight two other brotherstake out their souls and hide them in the form of a white herb with six stalks in a deep pit.But one of their foes sees them doing so and digs up their souls, which he puts into a goldenram’s horn, and then sticks the ram’s horn in his quiver. The two warriors whose soulshave thus been stolen know that they have no chance of victory, and accordingly makepeace with their enemies. In another Tartar poem a terrible demon sets all the gods andheroes at defiance. At last a valiant youth fights the demon, binds him hand and foot, andslices him with his sword. But still the demon is not slain. So the youth asked him, “Tell me,where is your soul hidden? For if your soul had been hidden in your body, you must havebeen dead long ago.” The demon replied, “On the saddle of my horse is a bag. In the bag isa serpent with twelve heads. In the serpent is my soul. When you have killed the serpent,you have killed me also.” So the youth took the saddle-bag from the horse and killed thetwelve-headed serpent, whereupon the demon expired. In another Tartar poem a herocalled Kök Chan deposits with a maiden a golden ring, in which is half his strength.Afterwards when Kök Chan is wrestling long with a hero and cannot kill him, a womandrops into his mouth the ring which contains half his strength. Thus inspired with freshforce he slays his enemy.In a Mongolian story the hero Joro gets the better of his enemy the lama Tschoridong inthe following way. The lama, who is an enchanter, sends out his soul in the form of a waspto sting Joro’s eyes. But Joro catches the wasp in his hand, and by alternately shutting andopening his hand he causes the lama alternately to lose and recover consciousness. In aTartar poem two youths cut open the body of an old witch and tear out her bowels, but allto no purpose, she still lives. On being asked where her soul is, she answers that it is in themiddle of her shoe-sole in the form of a seven-headed speckled snake. So one of the youthsslices her shoe-sole with his sword, takes out the speckled snake, and cuts off its sevenheads. Then the witch dies. Another Tartar poem describes how the hero Kartaga grappledwith the Swan-woman. Long they wrestled. Moons waxed and waned and still theywrestled; years came and went, and still the struggle went on. But the piebald horse and theblack horse knew that the Swan-woman’s soul was not in her. Under the black earth flownine seas; where the seas meet and form one, the sea comes to the surface of the earth. Atthe mouth of the nine seas rises a rock of copper; it rises to the surface of the ground, itrises up between heaven and earth, this rock of copper. At the foot of the copper rock is ablack chest, in the black chest is a golden casket, and in the golden casket is the soul of theSwan-woman. Seven little birds are the soul of the Swan-woman; if the birds are killed theSwan-woman will die straightway. So the horses ran to the foot of the copper rock, openedthe black chest, and brought back the golden casket. Then the piebald horse turned himselfinto a bald-headed man, opened the golden casket, and cut off the heads of the seven birds.So the Swan-woman died. In another Tartar poem the hero, pursuing his sister who hasdriven away his cattle, is warned to desist from the pursuit because his sister has carriedaway his soul in a golden sword and a golden arrow, and if he pursues her she will kill himby throwing the golden sword or shooting the golden arrow at him.A Malay poem relates how once upon a time in the city of Indrapoora there was a certainmerchant who was rich and prosperous, but he had no children. One day as he walked withhis wife by the river they found a baby girl, fair as an angel. So they adopted the child andcalled her Bidasari. The merchant caused a golden fish to be made, and into this fish he"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"transferred the soul of his adopted daughter. Then he put the golden fish in a golden boxfull of water, and hid it in a pond in the midst of his garden. In time the girl grew to be alovely woman. Now the King of Indrapoora had a fair young queen, who lived in fear thatthe king might take to himself a second wife. So, hearing of the charms of Bidasari, thequeen resolved to put her out of the way. She lured the girl to the palace and tortured hercruelly; but Bidasari could not die, because her soul was not in her. At last she could standthe torture no longer and said to the queen, “If you wish me to die, you must bring the boxwhich is in the pond in my father’s garden.” So the box was brought and opened, and therewas the golden fish in the water. The girl said, “My soul is in that fish. In the morning youmust take the fish out of the water, and in the evening you must put it back into the water.Do not let the fish lie about, but bind it round your neck. If you do this, I shall soon die.” Sothe queen took the fish out of the box and fastened it round her neck; and no sooner hadshe done so than Bidasari fell into a swoon. But in the evening, when the fish was put backinto the water, Bidasari came to herself again. Seeing that she thus had the girl in herpower, the queen sent her home to her adopted parents. To save her from furtherpersecution her parents resolved to remove their daughter from the city. So in a lonely anddesolate spot they built a house and brought Bidasari thither. There she dwelt alone,undergoing vicissitudes that corresponded with the vicissitudes of the golden fish in whichwas her soul. All day long, while the fish was out of the water, she remained unconscious;but in the evening, when the fish was put into the water, she revived. One day the king wasout hunting, and coming to the house where Bidasari lay unconscious, was smitten with herbeauty. He tried to waken her, but in vain. Next day, towards evening, he repeated his visit,but still found her unconscious. However, when darkness fell, she came to herself and toldthe king the secret of her life. So the king returned to the palace, took the fish from thequeen, and put it in water. Immediately Bidasari revived, and the king took her to wife.Another story of an external soul comes from Nias, an island to the west of Sumatra. Onceon a time a chief was captured by his enemies, who tried to put him to death but failed.Water would not drown him nor fire burn him nor steel pierce him. At last his wiferevealed the secret. On his head he had a hair as hard as a copper wire; and with this wirehis life was bound up. So the hair was plucked out, and with it his spirit fled.A West African story from Southern Nigeria relates how a king kept his soul in a littlebrown bird, which perched on a tall tree beside the gate of the palace. The king’s life was sobound up with that of the bird that whoever should kill the bird would simultaneously killthe king and succeed to the kingdom. The secret was betrayed by the queen to her lover,who shot the bird with an arrow and thereby slew the king and ascended the vacant throne.A tale told by the Ba-Ronga of South Africa sets forth how the lives of a whole family werecontained in one cat. When a girl of the family, named Titishan, married a husband, shebegged her parents to let her take the precious cat with her to her new home. But theyrefused, saying, “You know that our life is attached to it”; and they offered to give her anantelope or even an elephant instead of it. But nothing would satisfy her but the cat. So atlast she carried it off with her and shut it up in a place where nobody saw it; even herhusband knew nothing about it. One day, when she went to work in the fields, the catescaped from its place of concealment, entered the hut, put on the warlike trappings of thehusband, and danced and sang. Some children, attracted by the noise, discovered the cat atits antics, and when they expressed their astonishment, the animal only capered the more"},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"and insulted them besides. So they went to the owner and said, “There is somebody dancingin your house, and he insulted us.” “Hold your tongues,” said he, “I’ll soon put a stop toyour lies.” So he went and hid behind the door and peeped in, and there sure enough wasthe cat prancing about and singing. He fired at it, and the animal dropped down dead. Atthe same moment his wife fell to the ground in the field where she was at work; said she, “Ihave been killed at home.” But she had strength enough left to ask her husband to go withher to her parents’ village, taking with him the dead cat wrapt up in a mat. All her relativesassembled, and bitterly they reproached her for having insisted on taking the animal withher to her husband’s village. As soon as the mat was unrolled and they saw the dead cat,they all fell down lifeless one after the other. So the Clan of the Cat was destroyed; and thebereaved husband closed the gate of the village with a branch, and returned home, and toldhis friends how in killing the cat he had killed the whole clan, because their lives dependedon the life of the cat.Ideas of the same sort meet us in stories told by the North American Indians. Thus theNavajoes tell of a certain mythical being called “the Maiden that becomes a Bear,” wholearned the art of turning herself into a bear from the prairie wolf. She was a great warriorand quite invulnerable; for when she went to war she took out her vital organs and hidthem, so that no one could kill her; and when the battle was over she put the organs back intheir places again. The Kwakiutl Indians of British Columbia tell of an ogress, who couldnot be killed because her life was in a hemlock branch. A brave boy met her in the woods,smashed her head with a stone, scattered her brains, broke her bones, and threw them intothe water. Then, thinking he had disposed of the ogress, he went into her house. There hesaw a woman rooted to the floor, who warned him, saying, “Now do not stay long. I knowthat you have tried to kill the ogress. It is the fourth time that somebody has tried to killher. She never dies; she has nearly come to life. There in that covered hemlock branch isher life. Go there, and as soon as you see her enter, shoot her life. Then she will be dead.”Hardly had she finished speaking when sure enough in came the ogress, singing as shewalked. But the boy shot at her life, and she fell dead to the floor.LXVII. The External Soul in Folk-Custom1. The External Soul in Inanimate ThingsTHUS the idea that the soul may be deposited for a longer or shorter time in some place ofsecurity outside the body, or at all events in the hair, is found in the popular tales of manyraces. It remains to show that the idea is not a mere figment devised to adorn a tale, but is areal article of primitive faith, which has given rise to a corresponding set of customs.We have seen that in the tales the hero, as a preparation for battle, sometimes removes hissoul from his body, in order that his body may be invulnerable and immortal in thecombat. With a like intention the savage removes his soul from his body on variousoccasions of real or imaginary peril. Thus among the people of Minahassa in Celebes, whena family moves into a new house, a priest collects the souls of the whole family in a bag, and"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"afterwards restores them to their owners, because the moment of entering a new house issupposed to be fraught with supernatural danger. In Southern Celebes, when a woman isbrought to bed, the messenger who fetches the doctor or the midwife always carries withhim something made of iron, such as a chopping-knife, which he delivers to the doctor. Thedoctor must keep the thing in his house till the confinement is over, when he gives it back,receiving a fixed sum of money for doing so. The chopping-knife, or whatever it is,represents the woman’s soul, which at this critical time is believed to be safer out of herbody than in it. Hence the doctor must take great care of the object; for were it lost, thewoman’s soul would assuredly, they think, be lost with it.Among the Dyaks of Pinoeh, a district of South-eastern Borneo, when a child is born, amedicine-man is sent for, who conjures the soul of the infant into half a coco-nut, which hethereupon covers with a cloth and places on a square platter or charger suspended bycords from the roof. This ceremony he repeats at every new moon for a year. The intentionof the ceremony is not explained by the writer who describes it, but we may conjecture thatit is to place the soul of the child in a safer place than its own frail little body. Thisconjecture is confirmed by the reason assigned for a similar custom observed elsewhere inthe Indian Archipelago. In the Kei Islands, when there is a newly-born child in a house, anempty coco-nut, split and spliced together again, may sometimes be seen hanging beside arough wooden image of an ancestor. The soul of the infant is believed to be temporarilydeposited in the coco-nut in order that it may be safe from the attacks of evil spirits; butwhen the child grows bigger and stronger, the soul will take up its permanent abode in itsown body. Similarly among the Esquimaux of Alaska, when a child is sick, the medicine-man will sometimes extract its soul from its body and place it for safe-keeping in an amulet,which for further security he deposits in his own medicine-bag. It seems probable thatmany amulets have been similarly regarded as soul-boxes, that is, as safes in which thesouls of the owners are kept for greater security. An old Mang’anje woman in the WestShire district of British Central Africa used to wear round her neck an ivory ornament,hollow, and about three inches long, which she called her life or soul. Naturally, she wouldnot part with it; a planter tried to buy it of her, but in vain. When Mr. James Macdonaldwas one day sitting in the house of a Hlubi chief, awaiting the appearance of that greatman, who was busy decorating his person, a native pointed to a pair of magnificent ox-horns, and said, “Ntame has his soul in these horns.” The horns were those of an animalwhich had been sacrificed, and they were held sacred. A magician had fastened them to theroof to protect the house and its inmates from the thunder-bolt. “The idea,” adds Mr.Macdonald, “is in no way foreign to South African thought. A man’s soul there may dwellin the roof of his house, in a tree, by a spring of water, or on some mountain scaur.” Amongthe natives of the Gazelle Peninsula in New Britain there is a secret society which goes bythe name of Ingniet or Ingiet. On his entrance into it every man receives a stone in theshape either of a human being or of an animal, and henceforth his soul is believed to beknit up in a manner with the stone. If it breaks, it is an evil omen for him; they say that thethunder has struck the stone and that he who owns it will soon die. If nevertheless the mansurvives the breaking of his soul-stone, they say that it was not a proper soul-stone and hegets a new one instead. The emperor Romanus Lecapenus was once informed by anastronomer that the life of Simeon, prince of Bulgaria, was bound up with a certain columnin Constantinople, so that if the capital of the column were removed, Simeon wouldimmediately die. The emperor took the hint and removed the capital, and at the same hour,"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"as the emperor learned by enquiry, Simeon died of heart disease in Bulgaria.Again, we have seen that in folk-tales a man’s soul or strength is sometimes represented asbound up with his hair, and that when his hair is cut off he dies or grows weak. So thenatives of Amboyna used to think that their strength was in their hair and would desertthem if it were shorn. A criminal under torture in a Dutch Court of that island persisted indenying his guilt till his hair was cut off, when he immediately confessed. One man, whowas tried for murder, endured without flinching the utmost ingenuity of his torturers till hesaw the surgeon standing with a pair of shears. On asking what this was for, and being toldthat it was to cut his hair, he begged they would not do it, and made a clean breast. Insubsequent cases, when torture failed to wring a confession from a prisoner, the Dutchauthorities made a practice of cutting off his hair.Here in Europe it used to be thought that the maleficent powers of witches and wizardsresided in their hair, and that nothing could make any impression on the miscreants solong as they kept their hair on. Hence in France it was customary to shave the whole bodiesof persons charged with sorcery before handing them over to the torturer. Millaeuswitnessed the torture of some persons at Toulouse, from whom no confession could bewrung until they were stripped and completely shaven, when they readily acknowledgedthe truth of the charge. A woman also, who apparently led a pious life, was put to thetorture on suspicion of witchcraft, and bore her agonies with incredible constancy, untilcomplete depilation drove her to admit her guilt. The noted inquisitor Sprenger contentedhimself with shaving the head of the suspected witch or wizard; but his morethoroughgoing colleague Cumanus shaved the whole bodies of forty-seven women beforecommitting them all to the flames. He had high authority for this rigorous scrutiny, sinceSatan himself, in a sermon preached from the pulpit of North Berwick church, comfortedhis many servants by assuring them that no harm could befall them “sa lang as their hairwes on, and sould newir latt ane teir fall fra thair ene.” Similarly in Bastar, a province ofIndia, “if a man is adjudged guilty of witchcraft, he is beaten by the crowd, his hair isshaved, the hair being supposed to constitute his power of mischief, his front teeth areknocked out, in order, it is said, to prevent him from muttering incantations... . Womensuspected of sorcery have to undergo the same ordeal; if found guilty, the same punishmentis awarded, and after being shaved, their hair is attached to a tree in some public place.” Soamong the Bhils of India, when a woman was convicted of witchcraft and had beensubjected to various forms of persuasion, such as hanging head downwards from a tree andhaving pepper put into her eyes, a lock of hair was cut from her head and buried in theground, “that the last link between her and her former powers of mischief might bebroken.” In like manner among the Aztecs of Mexico, when wizards and witches “had donetheir evil deeds, and the time came to put an end to their detestable life, some one laid holdof them and cropped the hair on the crown of their heads, which took from them all theirpower of sorcery and enchantment, and then it was that by death they put an end to theirodious existence.”2. The External Soul in PlantsFURTHER it has been shown that in folk-tales the life of a person is sometimes so bound"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"up with the life of a plant that the withering of the plant will immediately follow or befollowed by the death of the person. Among the M’Bengas in Western Africa, about theGaboon, when two children are born on the same day, the people plant two trees of thesame kind and dance round them. The life of each of the children is believed to be boundup with the life of one of the trees; and if the tree dies or is thrown down, they are sure thatthe child will soon die. In the Cameroons, also, the life of a person is believed to besympathetically bound up with that of a tree. The chief of Old Town in Calabar kept hissoul in a sacred grove near a spring of water. When some Europeans, in frolic orignorance, cut down part of the grove, the spirit was most indignant and threatened theperpetrators of the deed, according to the king, with all manner of evil.Some of the Papuans unite the life of a new-born babe sympathetically with that of a treeby driving a pebble into the bark of the tree. This is supposed to give them completemastery over the child’s life; if the tree is cut down, the child will die. After a birth theMaoris used to bury the navel-string in a sacred place and plant a young sapling over it. Asthe tree grew, it was a tohu oranga or sign of life for the child; if it flourished, the childwould prosper; if it withered and died, the parents augured the worst for the little one. Insome parts of Fiji the navel-string of a male infant is planted together with a coco-nut orthe slip of a breadfruit-tree, and the child’s life is supposed to be intimately connected withthat of the tree. Amongst the Dyaks of Landak and Tajan, districts of Dutch Borneo, it iscustomary to plant a fruit-tree for a baby, and henceforth in the popular belief the fate ofthe child is bound up with that of the tree. If the tree shoots up rapidly, it will go well withthe child; but if the tree is dwarfed or shrivelled, nothing but misfortune can be expectedfor its human counterpart.It is said that there are still families in Russia, Germany, England, France, and Italy whoare accustomed to plant a tree at the birth of a child. The tree, it is hoped, will grow withthe child, and it is tended with special care. The custom is still pretty general in the cantonof Aargau in Switzerland; an apple-tree is planted for a boy and a pear-tree for a girl, andthe people think that the child will flourish or dwindle with the tree. In Mecklenburg theafterbirth is thrown out at the foot of a young tree, and the child is then believed to growwith the tree. Near the Castle of Dalhousie, not far from Edinburgh, there grows an oak-tree, called the Edgewell Tree, which is popularly believed to be linked to the fate of thefamily by a mysterious tie; for they say that when one of the family dies, or is about to die,a branch falls from the Edgewell Tree. Thus, on seeing a great bough drop from the tree ona quiet, still day in July 1874, an old forester exclaimed, “The laird’s deid noo!” and soonafter news came that Fox Maule, eleventh Earl of Dalhousie, was dead.In England children are sometimes passed through a cleft ash-tree as a cure for rupture orrickets, and thenceforward a sympathetic connexion is supposed to exist between them andthe tree. An ash-tree which had been used for this purpose grew at the edge of ShirleyHeath, on the road from Hockly House to Birmingham. “Thomas Chillingworth, son of theowner of an adjoining farm, now about thirty-four, was, when an infant of a year old,passed through a similar tree, now perfectly sound, which he preserves with so much carethat he will not suffer a single branch to be touched, for it is believed the life of the patientdepends on the life of the tree, and the moment that is cut down, be the patient ever sodistant, the rupture returns, and a mortification ensues, and terminates in death, as was the"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"case in a man driving a waggon on the very road in question.” “It is not uncommon,however,” adds the writer, “for persons to survive for a time the felling of the tree.” Theordinary mode of effecting the cure is to split a young ash-sapling longitudinally for a fewfeet and pass the child, naked, either three times or three times three through the fissure atsunrise. In the West of England it is said that the passage should be “against the sun.” Assoon as the ceremony has been performed, the tree is bound tightly up and the fissureplastered over with mud or clay. The belief is that just as the cleft in the tree closes up, sothe rupture in the child’s body will be healed; but that if the rift in the tree remains open,the rupture in the child will remain too, and if the tree were to die, the death of the childwould surely follow.A similar cure for various diseases, but especially for rupture and rickets, has beencommonly practised in other parts of Europe, as Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden;but in these countries the tree employed for the purpose is usually not an ash but an oak;sometimes a willow-tree is allowed or even prescribed instead. In Mecklenburg, as inEngland, the sympathetic relation thus established between the tree and the child isbelieved to be so close that if the tree is cut down the child will die.3. The External Soul in AnimalsBUT in practice, as in folk-tales, it is not merely with inanimate objects and plants that aperson is occasionally believed to be united by a bond of physical sympathy. The samebond, it is supposed, may exist between a man and an animal, so that the welfare of the onedepends on the welfare of the other, and when the animal dies the man dies also. Theanalogy between the custom and the tales is all the closer because in both of them thepower of thus removing the soul from the body and stowing it away in an animal is often aspecial privilege of wizards and witches. Thus the Yakuts of Siberia believe that everyshaman or wizard keeps his soul, or one of his souls, incarnate in an animal which iscarefully concealed from all the world. “Nobody can find my external soul,” said onefamous wizard, “it lies hidden far away in the stony mountains of Edzhigansk.” Only oncea year, when the last snows melt and the earth turns black, do these external souls ofwizards appear in the shape of animals among the dwellings of men. They wandereverywhere, yet none but wizards can see them. The strong ones sweep roaring and noisilyalong, the weak steal about quietly and furtively. Often they fight, and then the wizardwhose external soul is beaten, falls ill or dies. The weakest and most cowardly wizards arethey whose souls are incarnate in the shape of dogs, for the dog gives his human double nopeace, but gnaws his heart and tears his body. The most powerful wizards are they whoseexternal souls have the shape of stallions, elks, black bears, eagles, or boars. Again, theSamoyeds of the Turukhinsk region hold that every shaman has a familiar spirit in theshape of a boar, which he leads about by a magic belt. On the death of the boar the shamanhimself dies; and stories are told of battles between wizards, who send their spirits to fightbefore they encounter each other in person. The Malays believe that “the soul of a personmay pass into another person or into an animal, or rather that such a mysterious relationcan arise between the two that the fate of the one is wholly dependent on that of the other.”Among the Melanesians of Mota, one of the New Hebrides islands, the conception of an"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"external soul is carried out in the practice of daily life. In the Mota language the wordtamaniu signifies “something animate or inanimate which a man has come to believe tohave an existence intimately connected with his own... . It was not every one in Mota whohad his tamaniu; only some men fancied that they had this relation to a lizard, a snake, or itmight be a stone; sometimes the thing was sought for and found by drinking the infusion ofcertain leaves and heaping together the dregs; then whatever living thing was first seen inor upon the heap was the tamaniu. It was watched but not fed or worshipped; the nativesbelieved that it came at call, and that the life of the man was bound up with the life of histamaniu, if a living thing, or with its safety; should it die, or if not living get broken or belost, the man would die. Hence in case of sickness they would send to see if the tamaniu wassafe and well.”The theory of an external soul deposited in an animal appears to be very prevalent in WestAfrica, particularly in Nigeria, the Cameroons, and the Gaboon. Among the Fans of theGaboon every wizard is believed at initiation to unite his life with that of some particularwild animal by a rite of blood-brotherhood; he draws blood from the ear of the animal andfrom his own arm, and inoculates the animal with his own blood, and himself with theblood of the beast. Henceforth such an intimate union is established between the two thatthe death of the one entails the death of the other. The alliance is thought to bring to thewizard or sorcerer a great accession of power, which he can turn to his advantage invarious ways. In the first place, like the warlock in the fairy tales who has deposited his lifeoutside of himself in some safe place, the Fan wizard now deems himself invulnerable.Moreover, the animal with which he has exchanged blood has become his familiar, and willobey any orders he may choose to give it; so he makes use of it to injure and kill hisenemies. For that reason the creature with whom he establishes the relation of blood-brotherhood is never a tame or domestic animal, but always a ferocious and dangerouswild beast, such as a leopard, a black serpent, a crocodile, a hippopotamus, a wild boar, ora vulture. Of all these creatures the leopard is by far the commonest familiar of Fanwizards, and next to it comes the black serpent; the vulture is the rarest. Witches as well aswizards have their familiars; but the animals with which the lives of women are thus boundup generally differ from those to which men commit their external souls. A witch never hasa panther for her familiar, but often a venomous species of serpent, sometimes a hornedviper, sometimes a black serpent, sometimes a green one that lives in banana-trees; or itmay be a vulture, an owl, or other bird of night. In every case the beast or bird with whichthe witch or wizard has contracted this mystic alliance is an individual, never a species; andwhen the individual animal dies the alliance is naturally at an end, since the death of theanimal is supposed to entail the death of the man.Similar beliefs are held by the natives of the Cross River valley within the provinces of theCameroons. Groups of people, generally the inhabitants of a village, have chosen variousanimals, with which they believe themselves to stand on a footing of intimate friendship orrelationship. Amongst such animals are hippopotamuses, elephants, leopards, crocodiles,gorillas, fish, and serpents, all of them creatures which are either very strong or can easilyhide themselves in the water or a thicket. This power of concealing themselves is said to bean indispensable condition of the choice of animal familiars, since the animal friend orhelper is expected to injure his owner’s enemy by stealth; for example, if he is ahippopotamus, he will bob up suddenly out of the water and capsize the enemy’s canoe."},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"Between the animals and their human friends or kinsfolk such a sympathetic relation issupposed to exist that the moment the animal dies the man dies also, and similarly theinstant the man perishes so does the beast. From this it follows that the animal kinsfolkmay never be shot at or molested for fear of injuring or killing the persons whose lives areknit up with the lives of the brutes. This does not, however, prevent the people of a village,who have elephants for their animal friends, from hunting elephants. For they do notrespect the whole species but merely certain individuals of it, which stand in an intimaterelation to certain individual men and women; and they imagine that they can alwaysdistinguish these brother elephants from the common herd of elephants which are mereelephants and nothing more. The recognition indeed is said to be mutual. When a hunter,who has an elephant for his friend, meets a human elephant, as we may call it, the nobleanimal lifts up a paw and holds it before his face, as much as to say, “Don’t shoot.” Werethe hunter so inhuman as to fire on and wound such an elephant, the person whose life wasbound up with the elephant would fall ill.The Balong of the Cameroons think that every man has several souls, of which one is in hisbody and another in an animal, such as an elephant, a wild pig, a leopard, and so forth.When a man comes home, feeling ill, and says, “I shall soon die,” and dies accordingly, thepeople aver that one of his souls has been killed in a wild pig or a leopard and that thedeath of the external soul has caused the death of the soul in his body. A similar belief inthe external souls of living people is entertained by the Ibos, an important tribe of the Nigerdelta. They think that a man’s spirit can quit his body for a time during life and take up itsabode in an animal. A man who wishes to acquire this power procures a certain drug froma wise man and mixes it with his food. After that his soul goes out and enters into ananimal. If it should happen that the animal is killed while the man’s soul is lodged in it, theman dies; and if the animal be wounded, the man’s body will presently be covered withboils. This belief instigates to many deeds of darkness; for a sly rogue will sometimessurreptitiously administer the magical drug to his enemy in his food, and having thussmuggled the other’s soul into an animal will destroy the creature, and with it the manwhose soul is lodged in it.The negroes of Calabar, at the mouth of the Niger, believe that every person has four souls,one of which always lives outside of his or her body in the form of a wild beast in the forest.This external soul, or bush soul, as Miss Kingsley calls it, may be almost any animal, forexample, a leopard, a fish, or a tortoise; but it is never a domestic animal and never a plant.Unless he is gifted with second sight, a man cannot see his own bush soul, but a diviner willoften tell him what sort of creature his bush soul is, and after that the man will be carefulnot to kill any animal of that species, and will strongly object to any one else doing so. Aman and his sons have usually the same sort of animals for their bush souls, and so with amother and her daughters. But sometimes all the children of a family take after the bushsoul of their father; for example, if his external soul is a leopard, all his sons and daughterswill have leopards for their external souls. And on the other hand, sometimes they all takeafter their mother; for instance, if her external soul is a tortoise, all the external souls ofher sons and daughters will be tortoises too. So intimately bound up is the life of the manwith that of the animal which he regards as his external or bush soul, that the death orinjury of the animal necessarily entails the death or injury of the man. And, conversely,when the man dies, his bush soul can no longer find a place of rest, but goes mad and"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"rushes into the fire or charges people and is knocked on the head, and that is an end of it.Near Eket in North Calabar there is a sacred lake, the fish of which are carefully preservedbecause the people believe that their own souls are lodged in the fish, and that with everyfish killed a human life would be simultaneously extinguished. In the Calabar River notvery many years ago there used to be a huge old crocodile, popularly supposed to containthe external soul of a chief who resided in the flesh at Duke Town. Sporting vice-consulsused from time to time to hunt the animal, and once an officer contrived to hit it. Forthwiththe chief was laid up with a wound in his leg. He gave out that a dog had bitten him, but nodoubt the wise shook their heads and refused to be put off with so flimsy a pretext. Again,among several tribes on the banks of the Niger between Lokoja and the delta there prevails“a belief in the possibility of a man possessing an alter ego in the form of some animal suchas a crocodile or a hippopotamus. It is believed that such a person’s life is bound up withthat of the animal to such an extent that, whatever affects the one produces acorresponding impression upon the other, and that if one dies the other must speedily do sotoo. It happened not very long ago that an Englishman shot a hippopotamus close to anative village; the friends of a woman who died the same night in the village demanded andeventually obtained five pounds as compensation for the murder of the woman.”Amongst the Zapotecs of Central America, when a woman was about to be confined, herrelations assembled in the hut, and began to draw on the floor figures of different animals,rubbing each one out as soon as it was completed. This went on till the moment of birth,and the figure that then remained sketched upon the ground was called the child’s tona orsecond self. “When the child grew old enough, he procured the animal that representedhim and took care of it, as it was believed that health and existence were bound up withthat of the animal’s, in fact that the death of both would occur simultaneously,” or ratherthat when the animal died the man would die too. Among the Indians of Guatemala andHonduras the nagual or naual is “that animate or inanimate object, generally an animal,which stands in a parallel relation to a particular man, so that the weal and woe of the mandepend on the fate of the nagual.” According to an old writer, many Indians of Guatemala“are deluded by the devil to believe that their life dependeth upon the life of such and sucha beast (which they take unto them as their familiar spirit), and think that when that beastdieth they must die; when he is chased, their hearts pant; when he is faint, they are faint;nay, it happeneth that by the devil’s delusion they appear in the shape of that beast (whichcommonly by their choice is a buck, or doe, a lion, or tigre, or dog, or eagle) and in thatshape have been shot at and wounded.” The Indians were persuaded that the death of theirnagual would entail their own. Legend affirms that in the first battles with the Spaniardson the plateau of Quetzaltenango the naguals of the Indian chiefs fought in the form ofserpents. The nagual of the highest chief was especially conspicuous, because it had theform of a great bird, resplendent in green plumage. The Spanish general Pedro deAlvarado killed the bird with his lance, and at the same moment the Indian chief fell deadto the ground.In many tribes of South-Eastern Australia each sex used to regard a particular species ofanimals in the same way that a Central American Indian regarded his nagual, but with thisdifference, that whereas the Indian apparently knew the individual animal with which hislife was bound up, the Australians only knew that each of their lives was bound up with"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"some one animal of the species, but they could not say with which. The result naturally wasthat every man spared and protected all the animals of the species with which the lives ofthe men were bound up; and every woman spared and protected all the animals of thespecies with which the lives of the women were bound up; because no one knew but that thedeath of any animal of the respective species might entail his or her own; just as the killingof the green bird was immediately followed by the death of the Indian chief, and the killingof the parrot by the death of Punchkin in the fairy tale. Thus, for example, the Wotjobaluktribe of South-Eastern Australia “held that ‘the life of Ngǔnǔngǔnǔt (the Bat) is the life ofa man, and the life of Yártatgǔrk (the Nightjar) is the life of a woman,’ and that wheneither of these creatures is killed the life of some man or of some woman is shortened. Insuch a case every man or every woman in the camp feared that he or she might be thevictim, and from this cause great fights arose in this tribe. I learn that in these fights, menon one side and women on the other, it was not at all certain which would be victorious, forat times the women gave the men a severe drubbing with their yamsticks, while oftenwomen were injured or killed by spears.” The Wotjobaluk said that the bat was the man’s“brother” and that the nightjar was his “wife.” The particular species of animals withwhich the lives of the sexes were believed to be respectively bound up varied somewhatfrom tribe to tribe. Thus whereas among the Wotjobaluk the bat was the animal of themen, at Gunbower Creek on the Lower Murray the bat seems to have been the animal ofthe women, for the natives would not kill it for the reason that “if it was killed, one of theirlubras [women] would be sure to die in consequence.” But whatever the particular sorts ofcreature with which the lives of men and women were believed to be bound up, the beliefitself and the fights to which it gave rise are known to have prevailed over a large part ofSouth-Eastern Australia, and probably they extended much farther. The belief was a veryserious one, and so consequently were the fights which sprang from it. Thus among sometribes of Victoria “the common bat belongs to the men, who protect it against injury, evento the half-killing of their wives for its sake. The fern owl, or large goatsucker, belongs tothe women, and, although a bird of evil omen, creating terror at night by its cry, it isjealously protected by them. If a man kills one, they are as much enraged as if it was one oftheir children, and will strike him with their long poles.”The jealous protection thus afforded by Australian men and women to bats and owlsrespectively (for bats and owls seem to be the creatures usually allotted to the two sexes) isnot based upon purely selfish considerations. For each man believes that not only his ownlife but the lives of his father, brothers, sons, and so on are bound up with the lives ofparticular bats, and that therefore in protecting the bat species he is protecting the lives ofall his male relations as well as his own. Similarly, each woman believes that the lives of hermother, sisters, daughters, and so forth, equally with her own, are bound up with the livesof particular owls, and that in guarding the owl species she is guarding the lives of all herfemale relations besides her own. Now, when men’s lives are thus supposed to be containedin certain animals, it is obvious that the animals can hardly be distinguished from the men,or the men from the animals. If my brother John’s life is in a bat, then, on the one hand,the bat is my brother as well as John; and, on the other hand, John is in a sense a bat, sincehis life is in a bat. Similarly, if my sister Mary’s life is in an owl, then the owl is my sisterand Mary is an owl. This is a natural enough conclusion, and the Australians have notfailed to draw it. When the bat is the man’s animal, it is called his brother; and when theowl is the woman’s animal, it is called her sister. And conversely a man addresses a woman"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"as an owl, and she addresses him as a bat. So with the other animals allotted to the sexesrespectively in other tribes. For example, among the Kurnai all emu-wrens were“brothers” of the men, and all the men were emu-wrens; all superb warblers were “sisters”of the women, and all the women were superb warblers.But when a savage names himself after an animal, calls it his brother, and refuses to kill it,the animal is said to be his totem. Accordingly in the tribes of South-Eastern Australiawhich we have been considering the bat and the owl, the emu-wren and the superbwarbler, may properly be described as totems of the sexes. But the assignation of a totem toa sex is comparatively rare, and has hitherto been discovered nowhere but in Australia. Farmore commonly the totem is appropriated not to a sex, but to a clan, and is hereditaryeither in the male or female line. The relation of an individual to the clan totem does notdiffer in kind from his relation to the sex totem; he will not kill it, he speaks of it as hisbrother, and he calls himself by its name. Now if the relations are similar, the explanationwhich holds good of the one ought equally to hold good of the other. Therefore, the reasonwhy a clan revere a particular species of animals or plants (for the clan totem may be aplant) and call themselves after it, would seem to be a belief that the life of each individualof the clan is bound up with some one animal or plant of the species, and that his or herdeath would be the consequence of killing that particular animal, or destroying thatparticular plant. This explanation of totemism squares very well with Sir George Grey’sdefinition of a totem or kobong in Western Australia. He says: “A certain mysteriousconnexion exists between a family and its kobong, so that a member of the family will neverkill an animal of the species to which his kobong belongs, should he find it asleep; indeed healways kills it reluctantly, and never without affording it a chance to escape. This arisesfrom the family belief that some one individual of the species is their nearest friend, to killwhom would be a great crime, and to be carefully avoided. Similarly, a native who has avegetable for his kobong may not gather it under certain circumstances, and at a particularperiod of the year.” Here it will be observed that though each man spares all the animals orplants of the species, they are not all equally precious to him; far from it, out of the wholespecies there is only one which is specially dear to him; but as he does not know which thedear one is, he is obliged to spare them all from fear of injuring the one. Again, thisexplanation of the clan totem harmonises with the supposed effect of killing one of thetotem species. “One day one of the blacks killed a crow. Three or four days afterwards aBoortwa (crow) [i.e. a man of the Crow clan] named Larry died. He had been ailing forsome days, but the killing of his wingong [totem] hastened his death.” Here the killing ofthe crow caused the death of a man of the Crow clan, exactly as, in the case of the sex-totems, the killing of a bat causes the death of a Bat-man or the killing of an owl causes thedeath of an Owl-woman. Similarly, the killing of his nagual causes the death of a CentralAmerican Indian, the killing of his bush soul causes the death of a Calabar negro, thekilling of his tamaniu causes the death of a Banks Islander, and the killing of the animal inwhich his life is stowed away causes the death of the giant or warlock in the fairy tale.Thus it appears that the story of “The giant who had no heart in his body” may perhapsfurnish the key to the relation which is supposed to subsist between a man and his totem.The totem, on this theory, is simply the receptacle in which a man keeps his life, asPunchkin kept his life in a parrot, and Bidasari kept her soul in a golden fish. It is no validobjection to this view that when a savage has both a sex totem and a clan totem his life"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"must be bound up with two different animals, the death of either of which would entail hisown. If a man has more vital places than one in his body, why, the savage may think,should he not have more vital places than one outside it? Why, since he can put his lifeoutside himself, should he not transfer one portion of it to one animal and another toanother? The divisibility of life, or, to put it otherwise, the plurality of souls, is an ideasuggested by many familiar facts, and has commended itself to philosophers like Plato, aswell as to savages. It is only when the notion of a soul, from being a quasi-scientifichypothesis, becomes a theological dogma that its unity and indivisibility are insisted uponas essential. The savage, unshackled by dogma, is free to explain the facts of life by theassumption of as many souls as he thinks necessary. Hence, for example, the Caribssupposed that there was one soul in the head, another in the heart, and other souls at all theplaces where an artery is felt pulsating. Some of the Hidatsa Indians explain thephenomena of gradual death, when the extremities appear dead first, by supposing thatman has four souls, and that they quit the body, not simultaneously, but one after theother, dissolution being only complete when all four have departed. Some of the Dyaks ofBorneo and the Malays of the Peninsula believe that every man has seven souls. TheAlfoors of Poso in Celebes are of opinion that he has three. The natives of Laos supposethat the body is the seat of thirty spirits, which reside in the hands, the feet, the mouth, theeyes, and so on. Hence, from the primitive point of view, it is perfectly possible that asavage should have one soul in his sex totem and another in his clan totem. However, as Ihave observed, sex totems have been found nowhere but in Australia; so that as a rule thesavage who practises totemism need not have more than one soul out of his body at a time.If this explanation of the totem as a receptacle in which a man keeps his soul or one of hissouls is correct, we should expect to find some totemic people of whom it is expressly saidthat every man amongst them is believed to keep at least one soul permanently out of hisbody, and that the destruction of this external soul is supposed to entail the death of itsowner. Such a people are the Bataks of Sumatra. The Bataks are divided into exogamousclans (margas) with descent in the male line; and each clan is forbidden to eat the flesh of aparticular animal. One clan may not eat the tiger, another the ape, another the crocodile,another the dog, another the cat, another the dove, another the white buffalo, and anotherthe locust. The reason given by members of a clan for abstaining from the flesh of theparticular animal is either that they are descended from animals of that species, and thattheir souls after death may transmigrate into the animals, or that they or their forefathershave been under certain obligations to the creatures. Sometimes, but not always, the clanbears the name of the animal. Thus the Bataks have totemism in full. But, further, eachBatak believes that he has seven or, on a more moderate computation, three souls. One ofthese souls is always outside the body, but nevertheless whenever it dies, however far awayit may be at the time, that same moment the man dies also. The writer who mentions thisbelief says nothing about the Batak totems; but on the analogy of the Australian, CentralAmerican, and African evidence we may conjecture that the external soul, whose deathentails the death of the man, is housed in the totemic animal or plant.Against this view it can hardly be thought to militate that the Batak does not in set termsaffirm his external soul to be in his totem, but alleges other grounds for respecting thesacred animal or plant of his clan. For if a savage seriously believes that his life is bound upwith an external object, it is in the last degree unlikely that he will let any stranger into the"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"secret. In all that touches his inmost life and beliefs the savage is exceedingly suspicious andreserved; Europeans have resided among savages for years without discovering some oftheir capital articles of faith, and in the end the discovery has often been the result ofaccident. Above all, the savage lives in an intense and perpetual dread of assassination bysorcery; the most trifling relics of his person—the clippings of his hair and nails, his spittle,the remnants of his food, his very name—all these may, he fancies, be turned by thesorcerer to his destruction, and he is therefore anxiously careful to conceal or destroy them.But if in matters such as these, which are but the outposts and outworks of his life, he is soshy and secretive, how close must be the concealment, how impenetrable the reserve inwhich he enshrouds the inner keep and citadel of his being! When the princess in the fairytale asks the giant where he keeps his soul, he often gives false or evasive answers, and it isonly after much coaxing and wheedling that the secret is at last wrung from him. In hisjealous reticence the giant resembles the timid and furtive savage; but whereas theexigencies of the story demand that the giant should at last reveal his secret, no suchobligation is laid on the savage; and no inducement that can be offered is likely to tempthim to imperil his soul by revealing its hiding-place to a stranger. It is therefore no matterfor surprise that the central mystery of the savage’s life should so long have remained asecret, and that we should be left to piece it together from scattered hints and fragmentsand from the recollections of it which linger in fairy tales.4. The Ritual of Death and ResurrectionTHIS view of totemism throws light on a class of religious rites of which no adequateexplanation, so far as I am aware, has yet been offered. Amongst many savage tribes,especially such as are known to practice totemism, it is customary for lads at puberty toundergo certain initiatory rites, of which one of the commonest is a pretence of killing thelad and bringing him to life again. Such rites become intelligible if we suppose that theirsubstance consists in extracting the youth’s soul in order to transfer it to his totem. For theextraction of his soul would naturally be supposed to kill the youth or at least to throw himinto a death-like trance, which the savage hardly distinguishes from death. His recoverywould then be attributed either to the gradual recovery of his system from the violentshock which it had received, or, more probably, to the infusion into him of fresh life drawnfrom the totem. Thus the essence of these initiatory rites, so far as they consist in asimulation of death and resurrection, would be an exchange of life or souls between theman and his totem. The primitive belief in the possibility of such an exchange of soulscomes clearly out in a story of a Basque hunter who affirmed that he had been killed by abear, but that the bear had, after killing him, breathed its own soul into him, so that thebear’s body was now dead, but he himself was a bear, being animated by the bear’s soul.This revival of the dead hunter as a bear is exactly analogous to what, on the theory heresuggested, is supposed to take place in the ceremony of killing a lad at puberty andbringing him to life again. The lad dies as a man and comes to life again as an animal; theanimal’s soul is now in him, and his human soul is in the animal. With good right,therefore, does he call himself a Bear or a Wolf, etc., according to his totem; and with goodright does he treat the bears or the wolves, etc., as his brethren, since in these animals arelodged the souls of himself and his kindred."},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"Examples of this supposed death and resurrection at initiation are as follows. In theWonghi or Wonghibon tribe of New South Wales the youths on approaching manhood areinitiated at a secret ceremony, which none but initiated men may witness. Part of theproceedings consists in knocking out a tooth and giving a new name to the novice,indicative of the change from youth to manhood. While the teeth are being knocked out aninstrument known as a bull-roarer, which consists of a flat piece of wood with serratededges tied to the end of a string, is swung round so as to produce a loud humming noise.The uninitiated are not allowed to see this instrument. Women are forbidden to witness theceremonies under pain of death. It is given out that the youths are each met in turn by amythical being, called Thuremlin (more commonly known as Daramulun) who takes theyouth to a distance, kills him, and in some instances cuts him up, after which he restoreshim to life and knocks out a tooth. Their belief in the power of Thuremlin is said to beundoubted.The Ualaroi of the Upper Darling River said that at initiation the boy met a ghost, whokilled him and brought him to life again as a young man. Among the natives on the LowerLachlan and Murray Rivers it was Thrumalun (Daramulun) who was thought to slay andresuscitate the novices. In the Unmatjera tribe of Central Australia women and childrenbelieve that a spirit called Twanyirika kills the youth and afterwards brings him to lifeagain during the period of initiation. The rites of initiation in this tribe, as in the otherCentral tribes, comprise the operations of circumcision and subincision; and as soon as thesecond of these has been performed on him, the young man receives from his father asacred stick (churinga), with which, he is told, his spirit was associated in the remotest past.While he is out in the bush recovering from his wounds, he must swing the bull-roarer, or abeing who lives up in the sky will swoop down and carry him off. In the Binbinga tribe, onthe western coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria, the women and children believe that the noiseof the bull-roarer at initiation is made by a spirit named Katajalina, who lives in an ant-hilland comes out and eats up the boy, afterwards restoring him to life. Similarly among theirneighbours the Anula the women imagine that the droning sound of the bull-roarer isproduced by a spirit called Gnabaia, who swallows the lads at initiation and afterwardsdisgorges them in the form of initiated men.Among the tribes settled on the southern coast of New South Wales, of which the CoastMurring tribe may be regarded as typical, the drama of resurrection from the dead wasexhibited in a graphic form to the novices at initiation. The ceremony has been describedfor us by an eye-witness. A man, disguised with stringy bark fibre, lay down in a grave andwas lightly covered up with sticks and earth. In his hand he held a small bush, whichappeared to be growing in the soil, and other bushes were stuck in the ground to heightenthe effect. Then the novices were brought and placed beside the grave. Next, a procession ofmen, disguised in stringy bark fibre, drew near. They represented a party of medicine-men,guided by two reverend seniors, who had come on pilgrimage to the grave of a brothermedicine-man, who lay buried there. When the little procession, chanting an invocation toDaramulun, had defiled from among the rocks and trees into the open, it drew up on theside of the grave opposite to the novices, the two old men taking up a position in the rear ofthe dancers. For some time the dance and song went on till the tree that seemed to growfrom the grave began to quiver. “Look there!” cried the men to the novices, pointing to thetrembling leaves. As they looked, the tree quivered more and more, then was violently"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"agitated and fell to the ground, while amid the excited dancing of the dancers and thechanting of the choir the supposed dead man spurned from him the superincumbent massof sticks and leaves, and springing to his feet danced his magic dance in the grave itself, andexhibited in his mouth the magic substances which he was supposed to have received fromDaramulun in person.Some tribes of Northern New Guinea—the Yabim, Bukaua, Kai, and Tami—like manyAustralian tribes, require every male member of the tribe to be circumcised before heranks as a full-grown man; and the tribal initiation, of which circumcision is the centralfeature, is conceived by them, as by some Australian tribes, as a process of being swallowedand disgorged by a mythical monster, whose voice is heard in the humming sound of thebull-roarer. Indeed the New Guinea tribes not only impress this belief on the minds ofwomen and children, but enact it in a dramatic form at the actual rites of initiation, atwhich no woman or uninitiated person may be present. For this purpose a hut about ahundred feet long is erected either in the village or in a lonely part of the forest. It ismodelled in the shape of the mythical monster; at the end which represents his head it ishigh, and it tapers away at the other end. A betel-palm, grubbed up with the roots, standsfor the backbone of the great being and its clustering fibres for his hair; and to completethe resemblance the butt end of the building is adorned by a native artist with a pair ofgoggle eyes and a gaping mouth. When after a tearful parting from their mothers andwomen folk, who believe or pretend to believe in the monster that swallows their dear ones,the awe-struck novices are brought face to face with this imposing structure, the hugecreature emits a sullen growl, which is in fact no other than the humming note of bull-roarers swung by men concealed in the monster’s belly. The actual process of deglutition isvariously enacted. Among the Tami it is represented by causing the candidates to defilepast a row of men who hold bull-roarers over their heads; among the Kai it is moregraphically set forth by making them pass under a scaffold on which stands a man, whomakes a gesture of swallowing and takes in fact a gulp of water as each trembling novicepasses beneath him. But the present of a pig, opportunely offered for the redemption of theyouth, induces the monster to relent and disgorge his victim; the man who represents themonster accepts the gift vicariously, a gurgling sound is heard, and the water which hadjust been swallowed descends in a jet on the novice. This signifies that the young man hasbeen released from the monster’s belly. However, he has now to undergo the more painfuland dangerous operation of circumcision. It follows immediately, and the cut made by theknife of the operator is explained to be a bite or scratch which the monster inflicted on thenovice in spewing him out of his capacious maw. While the operation is proceeding, aprodigious noise is made by the swinging of bull-roarers to represent the roar of thedreadful being who is in the act of swallowing the young man.When, as sometimes happens, a lad dies from the effect of the operation, he is buriedsecretly in the forest, and his sorrowing mother is told that the monster has a pig’s stomachas well as a human stomach, and that unfortunately her son slipped into the wrongstomach, from which it was impossible to extricate him. After they have been circumcisedthe lads must remain for some months in seclusion, shunning all contact with women andeven the sight of them. They live in the long hut which represents the monster’s belly.When at last the lads, now ranking as initiated men, are brought back with great pomp andceremony to the village, they are received with sobs and tears of joy by the women, as if the"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"grave had given up its dead. At first the young men keep their eyes rigidly closed or evensealed with a plaster of chalk, and they appear not to understand the words of commandwhich are given them by an elder. Gradually, however, they come to themselves as ifawakening from a stupor, and next day they bathe and wash off the crust of white chalkwith which their bodies had been coated.It is highly significant that all these tribes of New Guinea apply the same word to the bull-roarer and to the monster, who is supposed to swallow the novices at circumcision, andwhose fearful roar is represented by the hum of the harmless wooden instruments. Further,it deserves to be noted that in three languages out of the four the same word which isapplied to the bull-roarer and to the monster means also a ghost or spirit of the dead, whilein the fourth language (the Kai) it signifies “grandfather.” From this it seems to follow thatthe being who swallows and disgorges the novices at initiation is believed to be a powerfulghost or ancestral spirit, and that the bull-roarer, which bears his name, is his materialrepresentative. That would explain the jealous secrecy with which the sacred implement iskept from the sight of women. While they are not in use, the bull-roarers are stowed awayin the men’s club-houses, which no woman may enter; indeed no woman or uninitiatedperson may set eyes on a bull-roarer under pain of death. Similarly among the Tugeri orKaya-Kaya, a large Papuan tribe on the south coast of Dutch New Guinea, the name of thebull-roarer, which they call sosom, is given to a mythical giant, who is supposed to appearevery year with the south-east monsoon. When he comes, a festival is held in his honourand bull-roarers are swung. Boys are presented to the giant, and he kills them, butconsiderately brings them to life again.In certain districts of Viti Levu, the largest of the Fijian Islands, the drama of death andresurrection used to be acted with much solemnity before the eyes of young men atinitiation. In a sacred enclosure they were shown a row of dead or seemingly dead menlying on the ground, their bodies cut open and covered with blood, their entrailsprotruding. But at a yell from the high priest the counterfeit dead men started to their feetand ran down to the river to cleanse themselves from the blood and guts of pigs with whichthey were beslobbered. Soon they marched back to the sacred enclosure as if come to life,clean, fresh, and garlanded, swaying their bodies in time to the music of a solemn hymn,and took their places in front of the novices. Such was the drama of death and resurrection.The people of Rook, an island between New Guinea and New Britain, hold festivals atwhich one or two disguised men, their heads covered with wooden masks, go dancingthrough the village, followed by all the other men. They demand that the circumcised boyswho have not yet been swallowed by Marsaba (the devil) shall be given up to them. Theboys, trembling and shrieking, are delivered to them, and must creep between the legs ofthe disguised men. Then the procession moves through the village again, and announcesthat Marsaba has eaten up the boys, and will not disgorge them till he receives a present ofpigs, taro, and so forth. So all the villagers, according to their means, contribute provisions,which are then consumed in the name of Marsaba.In the west of Ceram boys at puberty are admitted to the Kakian association. Modernwriters have commonly regarded this association as primarily a political league institutedto resist foreign domination. In reality its objects are purely religious and social, though itis possible that the priests may have occasionally used their powerful influence for political"},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"ends. The society is in fact merely one of those widely-diffused primitive institutions, ofwhich a chief object is the initiation of young men. In recent years the true nature of theassociation has been duly recognised by the distinguished Dutch ethnologist, J. G. F.Riedel. The Kakian house is an oblong wooden shed, situated under the darkest trees in thedepth of the forest, and is built to admit so little light that it is impossible to see what goeson in it. Every village has such a house. Thither the boys who are to be initiated areconducted blindfold, followed by their parents and relations. Each boy is led by the hand oftwo men, who act as his sponsors or guardians, looking after him during the period ofinitiation. When all are assembled before the shed, the high priest calls aloud upon thedevils. Immediately a hideous uproar is heard to proceed from the shed. It is made by menwith bamboo trumpets, who have been secretly introduced into the building by a backdoor, but the women and children think it is made by the devils, and are much terrified.Then the priests enter the shed, followed by the boys, one at a time. As soon as each boy hasdisappeared within the precincts, a dull chopping sound is heard, a fearful cry rings out,and a sword or spear, dripping with blood, is thrust through the roof of the shed. This is atoken that the boy’s head has been cut off, and that the devil has carried him away to theother world, there to regenerate and transform him. So at sight of the bloody sword themothers weep and wail, crying that the devil has murdered their children. In some places,it would seem, the boys are pushed through an opening made in the shape of a crocodile’sjaws or a cassowary’s beak, and it is then said that the devil has swallowed them. The boysremain in the shed for five or nine days. Sitting in the dark, they hear the blast of thebamboo trumpets, and from time to time the sound of musket shots and the clash ofswords. Every day they bathe, and their faces and bodies are smeared with a yellow dye, togive them the appearance of having been swallowed by the devil. During his stay in theKakian house each boy has one or two crosses tattooed with thorns on his breast or arm.When they are not sleeping, the lads must sit in a crouching posture without moving amuscle. As they sit in a row cross-legged, with their hands stretched out, the chief takes histrumpet, and placing the mouth of it on the hands of each lad, speaks through it in strangetones, imitating the voice of the spirits. He warns the lads, under pain of death, to observethe rules of the Kakian society, and never to reveal what has passed in the Kakian house.The novices are also told by the priests to behave well to their blood relations, and aretaught the traditions and secrets of the tribe.Meantime the mothers and sisters of the lads have gone home to weep and mourn. But in aday or two the men who acted as guardians or sponsors to the novices return to the villagewith the glad tidings that the devil, at the intercession of the priests, has restored the lads tolife. The men who bring this news come in a fainting state and daubed with mud, likemessengers freshly arrived from the nether world. Before leaving the Kakian house, eachlad receives from the priest a stick adorned at both ends with a cock’s or cassowary’sfeathers. The sticks are supposed to have been given to the lads by the devil at the timewhen he restored them to life, and they serve as a token that the youths have been in thespirit land. When they return to their homes they totter in their walk, and enter the housebackward, as if they had forgotten how to walk properly; or they enter the house by theback door. If a plate of food is given to them, they hold it upside down. They remain dumb,indicating their wants by signs only. All this is to show that they are still under theinfluence of the devil or the spirits. Their sponsors have to teach them all the common actsof life, as if they were newborn children. Further, upon leaving the Kakian house the boys"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"are strictly forbidden to eat of certain fruits until the next celebration of the rites has takenplace. And for twenty or thirty days their hair may not be combed by their mothers orsisters. At the end of that time the high priest takes them to a lonely place in the forest, andcuts off a lock of hair from the crown of each of their heads. After these initiatory rites thelads are deemed men, and may marry; it would be a scandal if they married before.In the region of the Lower Congo a simulation of death and resurrection is, or rather usedto be, practised by the members of a guild or secret society called ndembo. “In the practiceof Ndembo the initiating doctors get some one to fall down in a pretended fit, and in thatstate he is carried away to an enclosed place outside the town. This is called ‘dyingNdembo.’ Others follow suit, generally boys and girls, but often young men and women... .They are supposed to have died. But the parents and friends supply food, and after aperiod varying, according to custom, from three months to three years, it is arranged thatthe doctor shall bring them to life again... . When the doctor’s fee has been paid, andmoney (goods) saved for a feast, the Ndembo people are brought to life. At first theypretend to know no one and nothing; they do not even know how to masticate food, andfriends have to perform that office for them. They want everything nice that any oneuninitiated may have, and beat them if it is not granted, or even strangle and kill people.They do not get into trouble for this, because it is thought that they do not know better.Sometimes they carry on the pretence of talking gibberish, and behaving as if they hadreturned from the spirit-world. After this they are known by another name, peculiar tothose who have ‘died Ndembo.’ ... We hear of the custom far along on the upper river, aswell as in the cataract region.”Among some of the Indian tribes of North America there exist certain religious associationswhich are only open to candidates who have gone through a pretence of being killed andbrought to life again. In 1766 or 1767 Captain Jonathan Carver witnessed the admission ofa candidate to an association called “the friendly society of the Spirit” (Wakon-Kitchewah)among the Naudowessies, a Siouan or Dacotan tribe in the region of the great lakes. Thecandidate knelt before the chief, who told him that “he himself was now agitated by thesame spirit which he should in a few moments communicate to him; that it would strikehim dead, but that he would instantly be restored again to life; to this he added, that thecommunication, however terrifying, was a necessary introduction to the advantagesenjoyed by the community into which he was on the point of being admitted. As he spokethis, he appeared to be greatly agitated; till at last his emotions became so violent, that hiscountenance was distorted, and his whole frame convulsed. At this juncture he threwsomething that appeared both in shape and colour like a small bean, at the young man,which seemed to enter his mouth, and he instantly fell as motionless as if he had been shot.”For a time the man lay like dead, but under a shower of blows he showed signs ofconsciousness, and finally, discharging from his mouth the bean, or whatever it was thatthe chief had thrown at him, he came to life. In other tribes, for example, the Ojebways,Winnebagoes, and Dacotas or Sioux, the instrument by which the candidate is apparentlyslain is the medicine-bag. The bag is made of the skin of an animal (such as the otter, wildcat, serpent, bear, raccoon, wolf, owl, weasel), of which it roughly preserves the shape.Each member of the society has one of these bags, in which he keeps the odds and ends thatmake up his “medicine” or charms. “They believe that from the miscellaneous contents inthe belly of the skin bag or animal there issues a spirit or breath, which has the power, not"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"only to knock down and kill a man, but also to set him up and restore him to life.” Themode of killing a man with one of these medicine-bags is to thrust it at him; he falls likedead, but a second thrust of the bag restores him to life.A ceremony witnessed by the castaway John R. Jewitt during his captivity among theIndians of Nootka Sound doubtless belongs to this class of customs. The Indian king orchief “discharged a pistol close to his son’s ear, who immediately fell down as if killed,upon which all the women of the house set up a most lamentable cry, tearing handfuls ofhair from their heads, and exclaiming that the prince was dead; at the same time a greatnumber of the inhabitants rushed into the house armed with their daggers, muskets, etc.,enquiring the cause of their outcry. These were immediately followed by two others dressedin wolf-skins, with masks over their faces representing the head of that animal. The lattercame in on their hands and feet in the manner of a beast, and taking up the prince, carriedhim off upon their backs, retiring in the same manner they entered.” In another placeJewitt mentions that the young prince—a lad of about eleven years of age—wore a mask inimitation of a wolf’s head. Now, as the Indians of this part of America are divided intototem clans, of which the Wolf clan is one of the principal, and as the members of each clanare in the habit of wearing some portion of the totem animal about their person, it isprobable that the prince belonged to the Wolf clan, and that the ceremony described byJewitt represented the killing of the lad in order that he might be born anew as a wolf,much in the same way that the Basque hunter supposed himself to have been killed and tohave come to life again as a bear.This conjectural explanation of the ceremony has, since it was first put forward, been tosome extent confirmed by the researches of Dr. Franz Boas among these Indians; though itwould seem that the community to which the chief’s son thus obtained admission was notso much a totem clan as a secret society called Tlokoala, whose members imitated wolves.Every new member of the society must be initiated by the wolves. At night a pack ofwolves, personated by Indians dressed in wolf-skins and wearing wolf-masks, make theirappearance, seize the novice, and carry him into the woods. When the wolves are heardoutside the village, coming to fetch away the novice, all the members of the society blackentheir faces and sing, “Among all the tribes is great excitement, because I am Tlokoala.”Next day the wolves bring back the novice dead, and the members of the society have torevive him. The wolves are supposed to have put a magic stone into his body, which mustbe removed before he can come to life. Till this is done the pretended corpse is left lyingoutside the house. Two wizards go and remove the stone, which appears to be quartz, andthen the novice is resuscitated. Among the Niska Indians of British Columbia, who aredivided into four principal clans with the raven, the wolf, the eagle, and the bear for theirrespective totems, the novice at initiation is always brought back by an artificial totemanimal. Thus when a man was about to be initiated into a secret society called Olala, hisfriends drew their knives and pretended to kill him. In reality they let him slip away, whilethey cut off the head of a dummy which had been adroitly substituted for him. Then theylaid the decapitated dummy down and covered it over, and the women began to mourn andwail. His relations gave a funeral banquet and solemnly burnt the effigy. In short, they helda regular funeral. For a whole year the novice remained absent and was seen by none butmembers of the secret society. But at the end of that time he came back alive, carried by anartificial animal which represented his totem."},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"In these ceremonies the essence of the rite appears to be the killing of the novice in hischaracter of a man and his restoration to life in the form of the animal which isthenceforward to be, if not his guardian spirit, at least linked to him in a peculiarlyintimate relation. It is to be remembered that the Indians of Guatemala, whose life wasbound up with an animal, were supposed to have the power of appearing in the shape ofthe particular creature with which they were thus sympathetically united. Hence it seemsnot unreasonable to conjecture that in like manner the Indians of British Columbia mayimagine that their life depends on the life of some one of that species of creature to whichthey assimilate themselves by their costume. At least if that is not an article of belief withthe Columbian Indians of the present day, it may very well have been so with theirancestors in the past, and thus may have helped to mould the rites and ceremonies both ofthe totem clans and of the secret societies. For though these two sorts of communities differin respect of the mode in which membership of them is obtained—a man being born intohis totem clan but admitted into a secret society later in life—we can hardly doubt that theyare near akin and have their root in the same mode of thought. That thought, if I am right,is the possibility of establishing a sympathetic relation with an animal, a spirit, or othermighty being, with whom a man deposits for safe-keeping his soul or some part of it, andfrom whom he receives in return a gift of magical powers.Thus, on the theory here suggested, wherever totemism is found, and wherever a pretenceis made of killing and bringing to life again the novice at initiation, there may exist or haveexisted not only a belief in the possibility of permanently depositing the soul in someexternal object—animal, plant, or what not—but an actual intention of so doing. If thequestion is put, why do men desire to deposit their life outside their bodies? the answer canonly be that, like the giant in the fairy tale, they think it safer to do so than to carry it aboutwith them, just as people deposit their money with a banker rather than carry it on theirpersons. We have seen that at critical periods the life or soul is sometimes temporarilystowed away in a safe place till the danger is past. But institutions like totemism are notresorted to merely on special occasions of danger; they are systems into which every one, orat least every male, is obliged to be initiated at a certain period of life. Now the period oflife at which initiation takes place is regularly puberty; and this fact suggests that thespecial danger which totemism and systems like it are intended to obviate is supposed notto arise till sexual maturity has been attained, in fact, that the danger apprehended isbelieved to attend the relation of the sexes to each other. It would be easy to prove by a longarray of facts that the sexual relation is associated in the primitive mind with many seriousperils; but the exact nature of the danger apprehended is still obscure. We may hope that amore exact acquaintance with savage modes of thought will in time disclose this centralmystery of primitive society, and will thereby furnish the clue, not only to totemism, but tothe origin of the marriage system.LXVIII. The Golden BoughTHUS the view that Balder’s life was in the mistletoe is entirely in harmony with primitivemodes of thought. It may indeed sound like a contradiction that, if his life was in themistletoe, he should nevertheless have been killed by a blow from the plant. But when a"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"person’s life is conceived as embodied in a particular object, with the existence of which hisown existence is inseparably bound up, and the destruction of which involves his own, theobject in question may be regarded and spoken of indifferently as his life or his death, ashappens in the fairy tales. Hence if a man’s death is in an object, it is perfectly natural thathe should be killed by a blow from it. In the fairy tales Koshchei the Deathless is killed by ablow from the egg or the stone in which his life or death is secreted; the ogres burst when acertain grain of sand—doubtless containing their life or death—is carried over their heads;the magician dies when the stone in which his life or death is contained is put under hispillow; and the Tartar hero is warned that he may be killed by the golden arrow or goldensword in which his soul has been stowed away.The idea that the life of the oak was in the mistletoe was probably suggested, as I have said,by the observation that in winter the mistletoe growing on the oak remains green while theoak itself is leafless. But the position of the plant—growing not from the ground but fromthe trunk or branches of the tree—might confirm this idea. Primitive man might thinkthat, like himself, the oak-spirit had sought to deposit his life in some safe place, and forthis purpose had pitched on the mistletoe, which, being in a sense neither on earth nor inheaven, might be supposed to be fairly out of harm’s way. In a former chapter we saw thatprimitive man seeks to preserve the life of his human divinities by keeping them poisedbetween earth and heaven, as the place where they are least likely to be assailed by thedangers that encompass the life of man on earth. We can therefore understand why it hasbeen a rule both of ancient and of modern folk-medicine that the mistletoe should not beallowed to touch the ground; were it to touch the ground, its healing virtue would be gone.This may be a survival of the old superstition that the plant in which the life of the sacredtree was concentrated should not be exposed to the risk incurred by contact with the earth.In an Indian legend, which offers a parallel to the Balder myth, Indra swore to the demonNamuci that he would slay him neither by day nor by night, neither with staff nor withbow, neither with the palm of the hand nor with the fist, neither with the wet nor with thedry. But he killed him in the morning twilight by sprinkling over him the foam of the sea.The foam of the sea is just such an object as a savage might choose to put his life in,because it occupies that sort of intermediate or nondescript position between earth and skyor sea and sky in which primitive man sees safety. It is therefore not surprising that thefoam of the river should be the totem of a clan in India.Again, the view that the mistletoe owes its mystic character partly to its not growing on theground is confirmed by a parallel superstition about the mountain-ash or rowan-tree. InJutland a rowan that is found growing out of the top of another tree is esteemed“exceedingly effective against witchcraft: since it does not grow on the ground witches haveno power over it; if it is to have its full effect it must be cut on Ascension Day.” Hence it isplaced over doors to prevent the ingress of witches. In Sweden and Norway, also, magicalproperties are ascribed to a “flying-rowan” (flögrönn), that is to a rowan which is foundgrowing not in the ordinary fashion on the ground but on another tree, or on a roof, or in acleft of the rock, where it has sprouted from seed scattered by birds. They say that a manwho is out in the dark should have a bit of “flying-rowan” with him to chew; else he runs arisk of being bewitched and of being unable to stir from the spot. Just as in Scandinavia theparasitic rowan is deemed a countercharm to sorcery, so in Germany the parasiticmistletoe is still commonly considered a protection against witch-craft, and in Sweden, as"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"we saw, the mistletoe which is gathered on Midsummer Eve is attached to the ceiling of thehouse, the horse’s stall or the cow’s crib, in the belief that this renders the Troll powerlessto injure man or beast.The view that the mistletoe was not merely the instrument of Balder’s death, but that itcontained his life, is countenanced by the analogy of a Scottish superstition. Tradition ranthat the fate of the Hays of Errol, an estate in Perthshire, near the Firth of Tay, was boundup with the mistletoe that grew on a certain great oak. A member of the Hay family hasrecorded the old belief as follows: “Among the low country families the badges are nowalmost generally forgotten; but it appears by an ancient MS., and the tradition of a few oldpeople in Perthshire, that the badge of the Hays was the mistletoe. There was formerly inthe neighbourhood of Errol, and not far from the Falcon stone, a vast oak of an unknownage, and upon which grew a profusion of the plant: many charms and legends wereconsidered to be connected with the tree, and the duration of the family of Hay was said tobe united with its existence. It was believed that a sprig of the mistletoe cut by a Hay onAllhallowmas eve, with a new dirk, and after surrounding the tree three times sunwise, andpronouncing a certain spell, was a sure charm against all glamour or witchery, and aninfallible guard in the day of battle. A spray gathered in the same manner was placed in thecradle of infants, and thought to defend them from being changed for elfbairns by thefairies. Finally, it was affirmed, that when the root of the oak had perished, ‘the grassshould grow in the hearth of Errol, and a raven should sit in the falcon’s nest.’ The twomost unlucky deeds which could be done by one of the name of Hay was, to kill a whitefalcon, and to cut down a limb from the oak of Errol. When the old tree was destroyed Icould never learn. The estate has been sold out of the family of Hay, and of course it is saidthat the fatal oak was cut down a short time before.” The old superstition is recorded inverses which are traditionally ascribed to Thomas the Rhymer:While the mistletoe bats on Errol’s aik,And that aik stands fast,The Hays shall flourish, and their good grey hawkShall nocht flinch before the blast.But when the root of the aik decays,And the mistletoe dwines on its withered breast,The grass shall grow on Errol’s hearthstane,And the corbie roup in the falcon’s nest.It is not a new opinion that the Golden Bough was the mistletoe. True, Virgil does notidentify but only compares it with mistletoe. But this may be only a poetical device to cast amystic glamour over the humble plant. Or, more probably, his description was based on apopular superstition that at certain times the mistletoe blazed out into a supernaturalgolden glory. The poet tells how two doves, guiding Aeneas to the gloomy vale in whosedepth grew the Golden Bough, alighted upon a tree, “whence shone a flickering gleam ofgold. As in the woods in winter cold the mistletoe—a plant not native to its tree—is green"},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"with fresh leaves and twines its yellow berries about the boles; such seemed upon the shadyholm-oak the leafy gold, so rustled in the gentle breeze the golden leaf.” Here Virgildefinitely describes the Golden Bough as growing on a holm-oak, and compares it with themistletoe. The inference is almost inevitable that the Golden Bough was nothing but themistletoe seen through the haze of poetry or of popular superstition.Now grounds have been shown for believing that the priest of the Arician grove—the Kingof the Wood—personified the tree on which grew the Golden Bough. Hence if that tree wasthe oak, the King of the Wood must have been a personification of the oakspirit. It is,therefore, easy to understand why, before he could be slain, it was necessary to break theGolden Bough. As an oak-spirit, his life or death was in the mistletoe on the oak, and solong as the mistletoe remained intact, he, like Balder, could not die. To slay him, therefore,it was necessary to break the mistletoe, and probably, as in the case of Balder, to throw it athim. And to complete the parallel, it is only necessary to suppose that the King of the Woodwas formerly burned, dead or alive, at the midsummer fire festival which, as we have seen,was annually celebrated in the Arician grove. The perpetual fire which burned in thegrove, like the perpetual fire which burned in the temple of Vesta at Rome and under theoak at Romove, was probably fed with the sacred oak-wood; and thus it would be in a greatfire of oak that the King of the Wood formerly met his end. At a later time, as I havesuggested, his annual tenure of office was lengthened or shortened, as the case might be, bythe rule which allowed him to live so long as he could prove his divine right by the stronghand. But he only escaped the fire to fall by the sword.Thus it seems that at a remote age in the heart of Italy, beside the sweet Lake of Nemi, thesame fiery tragedy was annually enacted which Italian merchants and soldiers wereafterwards to witness among their rude kindred, the Celts of Gaul, and which, if theRoman eagles had ever swooped on Norway, might have been found repeated with littledifference among the barbarous Aryans of the North. The rite was probably an essentialfeature in the ancient Aryan worship of the oak.It only remains to ask, Why was the mistletoe called the Golden Bough? The whitish-yellowof the mistletoe berries is hardly enough to account for the name, for Virgil says that thebough was altogether golden, stems as well as leaves. Perhaps the name may be derivedfrom the rich golden yellow which a bough of mistletoe assumes when it has been cut andkept for some months; the bright tint is not confined to the leaves, but spreads to the stalksas well, so that the whole branch appears to be indeed a Golden Bough. Breton peasantshang up great bunches of mistletoe in front of their cottages, and in the month of Junethese bunches are conspicuous for the bright golden tinge of their foliage. In some parts ofBrittany, especially about Morbihan, branches of mistletoe are hung over the doors ofstables and byres to protect the horses and cattle, probably against witchcraft.The yellow colour of the withered bough may partly explain why the mistletoe has beensometimes supposed to possess the property of disclosing treasures in the earth; for on theprinciples of homoeopathic magic there is a natural affinity between a yellow bough andyellow gold. This suggestion is confirmed by the analogy of the marvellous propertiespopularly ascribed to the mythical fern-seed, which is popularly supposed to bloom likegold or fire on Midsummer Eve. Thus in Bohemia it is said that “on St. John’s Day fern-seed blooms with golden blossoms that gleam like fire.” Now it is a property of this"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"mythical fern-seed that whoever has it, or will ascend a mountain holding it in his hand onMidsummer Eve, will discover a vein of gold or will see the treasures of the earth shiningwith a bluish flame. In Russia they say that if you succeed in catching the wondrous bloomof the fern at midnight on Midsummer Eve, you have only to throw it up into the air, and itwill fall like a star on the very spot where a treasure lies hidden. In Brittany treasure-seekers gather fern-seed at midnight on Midsummer Eve, and keep it till Palm Sunday ofthe following year; then they strew the seed on the ground where they think a treasure isconcealed. Tyrolese peasants imagine that hidden treasures can be seen glowing like flameon Midsummer Eve, and that fern-seed, gathered at this mystic season, with the usualprecautions, will help to bring the buried gold to the surface. In the Swiss canton ofFreiburg people used to watch beside a fern on St. John’s night in the hope of winning atreasure, which the devil himself sometimes brought to them. In Bohemia they say that hewho procures the golden bloom of the fern at this season has thereby the key to all hiddentreasures; and that if maidens will spread a cloth under the fast-fading bloom, red gold willdrop into it. And in the Tryol and Bohemia if you place fern-seed among money, the moneywill never decrease, however much of it you spend. Sometimes the fern-seed is supposed tobloom on Christmas night, and whoever catches it will become very rich. In Styria they saythat by gathering fern-seed on Christmas night you can force the devil to bring you a bagof money.Thus, on the principle of like by like, fern-seed is supposed to discover gold because it isitself golden; and for a similar reason it enriches its possessor with an unfailing supply ofgold. But while the fern-seed is described as golden, it is equally described as glowing andfiery. Hence, when we consider that two great days for gathering the fabulous seed areMidsummer Eve and Christmas—that is, the two solstices (for Christmas is nothing but anold heathen celebration of the winter solstice)—we are led to regard the fiery aspect of thefern-seed as primary, and its golden aspect as secondary and derivative. Fern-seed, in fact,would seem to be an emanation of the sun’s fire at the two turning-points of its course, thesummer and winter solstices. This view is confirmed by a German story in which a hunteris said to have procured fern-seed by shooting at the sun on Midsummer Day at noon; threedrops of blood fell down, which he caught in a white cloth, and these blood-drops were thefern-seed. Here the blood is clearly the blood of the sun, from which the fern-seed is thusdirectly derived. Thus it may be taken as probable that fern-seed is golden, because it isbelieved to be an emanation of the sun’s golden fire.Now, like fern-seed, the mistletoe is gathered either at Midsummer or at Christmas—thatis, either at the summer or at the winter solstice—and, like fern-seed, it is supposed topossess the power of revealing treasures in the earth. On Midsummer Eve people inSweden make divining-rods of mistletoe, or of four different kinds of wood one of whichmust be mistletoe. The treasure-seeker places the rod on the ground after sundown, andwhen it rests directly over treasure, the rod begins to move as if it were alive. Now, if themistletoe discovers gold, it must be in its character of the Golden Bough; and if it isgathered at the solstices, must not the Golden Bough, like the golden fern-seed, be anemanation of the sun’s fire? The question cannot be answered with a simple affirmative.We have seen that the old Aryans perhaps kindled the solstitial and other ceremonial firesin part as sun-charms, that is, with the intention of supplying the sun with fresh fire; and asthese fires were usually made by the friction or combustion of oak-wood, it may have"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"appeared to the ancient Aryan that the sun was periodically recruited from the fire whichresided in the sacred oak. In other words, the oak may have seemed to him the originalstorehouse or reservoir of the fire which was from time to time drawn out to feed the sun.But if the life of the oak was conceived to be in the mistletoe, the mistletoe must on thatview have contained the seed or germ of the fire which was elicited by friction from thewood of the oak. Thus, instead of saying that the mistletoe was an emanation of the sun’sfire, it might be more correct to say that the sun’s fire was regarded as an emanation of themistletoe. No wonder, then, that the mistletoe shone with a golden splendour, and wascalled the Golden Bough. Probably, however, like fern-seed, it was thought to assume itsgolden aspect only at those stated times, especially midsummer, when fire was drawn fromthe oak to light up the sun. At Pulverbatch, in Shropshire, it was believed within livingmemory that the oak-tree blooms on Midsummer Eve and the blossom withers beforedaylight. A maiden who wishes to know her lot in marriage should spread a white clothunder the tree at night, and in the morning she will find a little dust, which is all thatremains of the flower. She should place the pinch of dust under her pillow, and then herfuture husband will appear to her in her dreams. This fleeting bloom of the oak, if I amright, was probably the mistletoe in its character of the Golden Bough. The conjecture isconfirmed by the observation that in Wales a real sprig of mistletoe gathered onMidsummer Eve is similarly placed under the pillow to induce prophetic dreams; andfurther the mode of catching the imaginary bloom of the oak in a white cloth is exactly thatwhich was employed by the Druids to catch the real mistletoe when it dropped from thebough of the oak, severed by the golden sickle. As Shropshire borders on Wales, the beliefthat the oak blooms on Midsummer Eve may be Welsh in its immediate origin, thoughprobably the belief is a fragment of the primitive Aryan creed. In some parts of Italy, as wesaw, peasants still go out on Midsummer morning to search the oak-trees for the “oil of St.John,” which, like the mistletoe, heals all wounds, and is, perhaps, the mistletoe itself in itsglorified aspect. Thus it is easy to understand how a title like the Golden Bough, so littledescriptive of its usual appearance on the tree, should have been applied to the seeminglyinsignificant parasite. Further, we can perhaps see why in antiquity mistletoe was believedto possess the remarkable property of extinguishing fire, and why in Sweden it is still keptin houses as a safeguard against conflagration. Its fiery nature marks it out, onhomoeopathic principles, as the best possible cure or preventive of injury by fire.These considerations may partially explain why Virgil makes Aeneas carry a glorifiedbough of mistletoe with him on his descent into the gloomy subterranean world. The poetdescribes how at the very gates of hell there stretched a vast and gloomy wood, and how thehero, following the flight of two doves that lured him on, wandered into the depths of theimmemorial forest till he saw afar off through the shadows of the trees the flickering lightof the Golden Bough illuminating the matted boughs overhead. If the mistletoe, as a yellowwithered bough in the sad autumn woods, was conceived to contain the seed of fire, whatbetter companion could a forlorn wanderer in the nether shades take with him than abough that would be a lamp to his feet as well as a rod and staff to his hands? Armed withit he might boldly confront the dreadful spectres that would cross his path on hisadventurous journey. Hence when Aeneas, emerging from the forest, comes to the banks ofStyx, winding slow with sluggish stream through the infernal marsh, and the surlyferryman refuses him passage in his boat, he has but to draw the Golden Bough from hisbosom and hold it up, and straightway the blusterer quails at the sight and meekly receives"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"the hero into his crazy bark, which sinks deep in the water under the unusual weight of theliving man. Even in recent times, as we have seen, mistletoe has been deemed a protectionagainst witches and trolls, and the ancients may well have credited it with the same magicalvirtue. And if the parasite can, as some of our peasants believe, open all locks, why shouldit not have served as an “open Sesame” in the hands of Aeneas to unlock the gates ofdeath?Now, too, we can conjecture why Virbius at Nemi came to be confounded with the sun. IfVirbius was, as I have tried to show, a tree-spirit, he must have been the spirit of the oak onwhich grew the Golden Bough; for tradition represented him as the first of the Kings of theWood. As an oak-spirit he must have been supposed periodically to rekindle the sun’s fire,and might therefore easily be confounded with the sun itself. Similarly we can explain whyBalder, an oak-spirit, was described as “so fair of face and so shining that a light went forthfrom him,” and why he should have been so often taken to be the sun. And in general wemay say that in primitive society, when the only known way of making fire is by the frictionof wood, the savage must necessarily conceive of fire as a property stored away, like sap orjuice, in trees, from which he has laboriously to extract it. The Senal Indians of California“profess to believe that the whole world was once a globe of fire, whence that elementpassed up into the trees, and now comes out whenever two pieces of wood are rubbedtogether.” Similarly the Maidu Indians of California hold that “the earth was primarily aglobe of molten matter, and from that the principle of fire ascended through the roots intothe trunk and branches of trees, whence the Indians can extract it by means of their drill.”In Namoluk, one of the Caroline Islands, they say that the art of making fire was taughtmen by the gods. Olofaet, the cunning master of flames, gave fire to the bird mwi and badehim carry it to earth in his bill. So the bird flew from tree to tree and stored away theslumbering force of the fire in the wood, from which men can elicit it by friction. In theancient Vedic hymns of India the fire-god Agni “is spoken of as born in wood, as theembryo of plants, or as distributed in plants. He is also said to have entered into all plantsor to strive after them. When he is called the embryo of trees or of trees as well as plants,there may be a side-glance at the fire produced in forests by the friction of the boughs oftrees.”A tree which has been struck by lightning is naturally regarded by the savage as chargedwith a double or triple portion of fire; for has he not seen the mighty flash enter into thetrunk with his own eyes? Hence perhaps we may explain some of the many superstitiousbeliefs concerning trees that have been struck by lightning. When the Thompson Indians ofBritish Columbia wished to set fire to the houses of their enemies, they shot at them arrowswhich were either made from a tree that had been struck by lightning or had splinters ofsuch wood attached to them. Wendish peasants of Saxony refuse to burn in their stoves thewood of trees that have been struck by lightning; they say that with such fuel the housewould be burnt down. In like manner the Thonga of South Africa will not use such wood asfuel nor warm themselves at a fire which has been kindled with it. On the contrary, whenlightning sets fire to a tree, the Winamwanga of Northern Rhodesia put out all the fires inthe village and plaster the fireplaces afresh, while the head men convey the lightning-kindled fire to the chief, who prays over it. The chief then sends out the new fire to all hisvillages, and the villagers reward his messengers for the boon. This shows that they lookupon fire kindled by lightning with reverence, and the reverence is intelligible, for they"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"speak of thunder and lightning as God himself coming down to earth. Similarly the MaiduIndians of California believe that a Great Man created the world and all its inhabitants,and that lightning is nothing but the Great Man himself descending swiftly out of heavenand rending the trees with his flaming arms.It is a plausible theory that the reverence which the ancient peoples of Europe paid to theoak, and the connexion which they traced between the tree and their sky-god, were derivedfrom the much greater frequency with which the oak appears to be struck by lightningthan any other tree of our European forests. This peculiarity of the tree has seemingly beenestablished by a series of observations instituted within recent years by scientific enquirerswho have no mythological theory to maintain. However we may explain it, whether by theeasier passage of electricity through oak-wood than through any other timber, or in someother way, the fact itself may well have attracted the notice of our rude forefathers, whodwelt in the vast forests which then covered a large part of Europe; and they mightnaturally account for it in their simple religious way by supposing that the great sky-god,whom they worshipped and whose awful voice they heard in the roll of thunder, loved theoak above all the trees of the wood and often descended into it from the murky cloud in aflash of lightning, leaving a token of his presence or of his passage in the riven andblackened trunk and the blasted foliage. Such trees would thenceforth be encircled by animbus of glory as the visible seats of the thundering sky-god. Certain it is that, like somesavages, both Greeks and Romans identified their great god of the sky and of the oak withthe lightning flash which struck the ground; and they regularly enclosed such a strickenspot and treated it thereafter as sacred. It is not rash to suppose that the ancestors of theCelts and Germans in the forests of Central Europe paid a like respect for like reasons to ablasted oak.This explanation of the Aryan reverence for the oak and of the association of the tree withthe great god of the thunder and the sky, was suggested or implied long ago by JacobGrimm, and has been in recent years powerfully reinforced by Mr. W. Warde Fowler. Itappears to be simpler and more probable than the explanation which I formerly adopted,namely, that the oak was worshipped primarily for the many benefits which our rudeforefathers derived from the tree, particularly for the fire which they drew by friction fromits wood; and that the connexion of the oak with the sky was an after-thought based on thebelief that the flash of lightning was nothing but the spark which the sky-god up aloftelicited by rubbing two pieces of oak-wood against each other, just as his savageworshipper kindled fire in the forest on earth. On that theory the god of the thunder andthe sky was derived from the original god of the oak; on the present theory, which I nowprefer, the god of the sky and the thunder was the great original deity of our Aryanancestors, and his association with the oak was merely an inference based on the frequencywith which the oak was seen to be struck by lightning. If the Aryans, as some think,roamed the wide steppes of Russia or Central Asia with their flocks and herds before theyplunged into the gloom of the European forests, they may have worshipped the god of theblue or cloudy firmament and the flashing thunderbolt long before they thought ofassociating him with the blasted oaks in their new home.Perhaps the new theory has the further advantage of throwing light on the special sanctityascribed to mistletoe which grows on an oak. The mere rarity of such a growth on an oak"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"hardly suffices to explain the extent and the persistence of the superstition. A hint of its realorigin is possibly furnished by the statement of Pliny that the Druids worshipped the plantbecause they believed it to have fallen from heaven and to be a token that the tree on whichit grew was chosen by the god himself. Can they have thought that the mistletoe droppedon the oak in a flash of lightning? The conjecture is confirmed by the name thunder-besomwhich is applied to mistletoe in the Swiss canton of Aargau, for the epithet clearly implies aclose connexion between the parasite and the thunder; indeed “thunder-besom” is apopular name in Germany for any bushy nest-like excrescence growing on a branch,because such a parasitic growth is actually believed by the ignorant to be a product oflightning. If there is any truth in this conjecture, the real reason why the Druidsworshipped a mistletoe-bearing oak above all other trees of the forest was a belief thatevery such oak had not only been struck by lightning but bore among its branches a visibleemanation of the celestial fire; so that in cutting the mistletoe with mystic rites they weresecuring for themselves all the magical properties of a thunder-bolt. If that was so, we mustapparently conclude that the mistletoe was deemed an emanation of the lightning ratherthan, as I have thus far argued, of the midsummer sun. Perhaps, indeed, we might combinethe two seemingly divergent views by supposing that in the old Aryan creed the mistletoedescended from the sun on Midsummer Day in a flash of lightning. But such a combinationis artificial and unsupported, so far as I know, by any positive evidence. Whether onmythical principles the two interpretations can really be reconciled with each other or not,I will not presume to say; but even should they prove to be discrepant, the inconsistencyneed not have prevented our rude forefathers from embracing both of them at the sametime with an equal fervour of conviction; for like the great majority of mankind the savageis above being hidebound by the trammels of a pedantic logic. In attempting to track hisdevious thought through the jungle of crass ignorance and blind fear, we must alwaysremember that we are treading enchanted ground, and must beware of taking for solidrealities the cloudy shapes that cross our path or hover and gibber at us through the gloom.We can never completely replace ourselves at the standpoint of primitive man, see thingswith his eyes, and feel our hearts beat with the emotions that stirred his. All our theoriesconcerning him and his ways must therefore fall far short of certainty; the utmost we canaspire to in such matters is a reasonable degree of probability.To conclude these enquiries we may say that if Balder was indeed, as I have conjectured, apersonification of a mistletoe-bearing oak, his death by a blow of the mistletoe might on thenew theory be explained as a death by a stroke of lightning. So long as the mistletoe, inwhich the flame of the lightning smouldered, was suffered to remain among the boughs, solong no harm could befall the good and kindly god of the oak, who kept his life stowedaway for safety between earth and heaven in the mysterious parasite; but when once thatseat of his life, or of his death, was torn from the branch and hurled at the trunk, the treefell—the god died—smitten by a thunderbolt.And what we have said of Balder in the oak forests of Scandinavia may perhaps, with alldue diffidence in a question so obscure and uncertain, be applied to the priest of Diana, theKing of the Wood, at Aricia in the oak forests of Italy. He may have personated in flesh andblood the great Italian god of the sky, Jupiter, who had kindly come down from heaven inthe lightning flash to dwell among men in the mistletoe—the thunder-besom—the GoldenBough—growing on the sacred oak in the dells of Nemi. If that was so, we need not wonder"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"that the priest guarded with drawn sword the mystic bough which contained the god’s lifeand his own. The goddess whom he served and married was herself, if I am right, no otherthan the Queen of Heaven, the true wife of the sky-god. For she, too, loved the solitude ofthe woods and the lonely hills, and sailing overhead on clear nights in the likeness of thesilver moon looked down with pleasure on her own fair image reflected on the calm, theburnished surface of the lake, Diana’s Mirror.LXIX. Farewell to NemiWE are at the end of our enquiry, but as often happens in the search after truth, if we haveanswered one question, we have raised many more; if we have followed one track home, wehave had to pass by others that opened off it and led, or seemed to lead, to far other goalsthan the sacred grove at Nemi. Some of these paths we have followed a little way; others, iffortune should be kind, the writer and the reader may one day pursue together. For thepresent we have journeyed far enough together, and it is time to part. Yet before we do so,we may well ask ourselves whether there is not some more general conclusion, some lesson,if possible, of hope and encouragement, to be drawn from the melancholy record of humanerror and folly which has engaged our attention in this book.If then we consider, on the one hand, the essential similarity of man’s chief wantseverywhere and at all times, and on the other hand, the wide difference between the meanshe has adopted to satisfy them in different ages, we shall perhaps be disposed to concludethat the movement of the higher thought, so far as we can trace it, has on the whole beenfrom magic through religion to science. In magic man depends on his own strength to meetthe difficulties and dangers that beset him on every side. He believes in a certainestablished order of nature on which he can surely count, and which he can manipulate forhis own ends. When he discovers his mistake, when he recognises sadly that both the orderof nature which he had assumed and the control which he had believed himself to exerciseover it were purely imaginary, he ceases to rely on his own intelligence and his ownunaided efforts, and throws himself humbly on the mercy of certain great invisible beingsbehind the veil of nature, to whom he now ascribes all those far-reaching powers which heonce arrogated to himself. Thus in the acuter minds magic is gradually superseded byreligion, which explains the succession of natural phenomena as regulated by the will, thepassion, or the caprice of spiritual beings like man in kind, though vastly superior to him inpower.But as time goes on this explanation in its turn proves to be unsatisfactory. For it assumesthat the succession of natural events is not determined by immutable laws, but is to someextent variable and irregular, and this assumption is not borne out by closer observation.On the contrary, the more we scrutinise that succession the more we are struck by the rigiduniformity, the punctual precision with which, wherever we can follow them, theoperations of nature are carried on. Every great advance in knowledge has extended thesphere of order and correspondingly restricted the sphere of apparent disorder in theworld, till now we are ready to anticipate that even in regions where chance and confusionappear still to reign, a fuller knowledge would everywhere reduce the seeming chaos tocosmos. Thus the keener minds, still pressing forward to a deeper solution of the mysteries"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"of the universe, come to reject the religious theory of nature as inadequate, and to revert ina measure to the older standpoint of magic by postulating explicitly, what in magic hadonly been implicitly assumed, to wit, an inflexible regularity in the order of natural events,which, if carefully observed, enables us to foresee their course with certainty and to actaccordingly. In short, religion, regarded as an explanation of nature, is displaced byscience.But while science has this much in common with magic that both rest on a faith in order asthe underlying principle of all things, readers of this work will hardly need to be remindedthat the order presupposed by magic differs widely from that which forms the basis ofscience. The difference flows naturally from the different modes in which the two ordershave been reached. For whereas the order on which magic reckons is merely an extension,by false analogy, of the order in which ideas present themselves to our minds, the order laiddown by science is derived from patient and exact observation of the phenomenathemselves. The abundance, the solidity, and the splendour of the results already achievedby science are well fitted to inspire us with a cheerful confidence in the soundness of itsmethod. Here at last, after groping about in the dark for countless ages, man has hit upon aclue to the labyrinth, a golden key that opens many locks in the treasury of nature. It isprobably not too much to say that the hope of progress—moral and intellectual as well asmaterial—in the future is bound up with the fortunes of science, and that every obstacleplaced in the way of scientific discovery is a wrong to humanity.Yet the history of thought should warn us against concluding that because the scientifictheory of the world is the best that has yet been formulated, it is necessarily complete andfinal. We must remember that at bottom the generalisations of science or, in commonparlance, the laws of nature are merely hypotheses devised to explain that ever-shiftingphantasmagoria of thought which we dignify with the high-sounding names of the worldand the universe. In the last analysis magic, religion, and science are nothing but theoriesof thought; and as science has supplanted its predecessors, so it may hereafter be itselfsuperseded by some more perfect hypothesis, perhaps by some totally different way oflooking at the phenomena—of registering the shadows on the screen—of which we in thisgeneration can form no idea. The advance of knowledge is an infinite progression towardsa goal that for ever recedes. We need not murmur at the endless pursuit:Fatti non foste a viver come brutiMa per seguir virtute e conoscenza.Great things will come of that pursuit, though we may not enjoy them. Brighter stars willrise on some voyager of the future—some great Ulysses of the realms of thought—thanshine on us. The dreams of magic may one day be the waking realities of science. But adark shadow lies athwart the far end of this fair prospect. For however vast the increase ofknowledge and of power which the future may have in store for man, he can scarcely hopeto stay the sweep of those great forces which seem to be making silently but relentlessly forthe destruction of all this starry universe in which our earth swims as a speck or mote. In"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"the ages to come man may be able to predict, perhaps even to control, the wayward coursesof the winds and clouds, but hardly will his puny hands have strength to speed afresh ourslackening planet in its orbit or rekindle the dying fire of the sun. Yet the philosopher whotrembles at the idea of such distant catastrophes may console himself by reflecting thatthese gloomy apprehensions, like the earth and the sun themselves, are only parts of thatunsubstantial world which thought has conjured up out of the void, and that the phantomswhich the subtle enchantress has evoked to-day she may ban to-morrow. They too, like somuch that to common eyes seems solid, may melt into air, into thin air.Without dipping so far into the future, we may illustrate the course which thought hashitherto run by likening it to a web woven of three different threads—the black thread ofmagic, the red thread of religion, and the white thread of science, if under science we mayinclude those simple truths, drawn from observation of nature, of which men in all ageshave possessed a store. Could we then survey the web of thought from the beginning, weshould probably perceive it to be at first a chequer of black and white, a patchwork of trueand false notions, hardly tinged as yet by the red thread of religion. But carry your eyefarther along the fabric and you will remark that, while the black and white chequer stillruns through it, there rests on the middle portion of the web, where religion has enteredmost deeply into its texture, a dark crimson stain, which shades off insensibly into a lightertint as the white thread of science is woven more and more into the tissue. To a web thuschequered and stained, thus shot with threads of diverse hues, but gradually changingcolour the farther it is unrolled, the state of modern thought, with all its divergent aims andconflicting tendencies, may be compared. Will the great movement which for centuries hasbeen slowly altering the complexion of thought be continued in the near future? or will areaction set in which may arrest progress and even undo much that has been done? Tokeep up our parable, what will be the colour of the web which the Fates are now weavingon the humming loom of time? will it be white or red? We cannot tell. A faint glimmeringlight illumines the backward portion of the web. Clouds and thick darkness hide the otherend.Our long voyage of discovery is over and our bark has drooped her weary sails in port atlast. Once more we take the road to Nemi. It is evening, and as we climb the long slope ofthe Appian Way up to the Alban Hills, we look back and see the sky aflame with sunset, itsgolden glory resting like the aureole of a dying saint over Rome and touching with a crestof fire the dome of St. Peter’s. The sight once seen can never be forgotten, but we turn fromit and pursue our way darkling along the mountain side, till we come to Nemi and lookdown on the lake in its deep hollow, now fast disappearing in the evening shadows. Theplace has changed but little since Diana received the homage of her worshippers in thesacred grove. The temple of the sylvan goddess, indeed, has vanished and the King of theWood no longer stands sentinel over the Golden Bough. But Nemi’s woods are still green,and as the sunset fades above them in the west, there comes to us, borne on the swell of thewind, the sound of the church bells of Aricia ringing the Angelus. Ave Maria! Sweet andsolemn they chime out from the distant town and die lingeringly away across the wideCampagnan marshes. Le roi est mort, vive le roi!
