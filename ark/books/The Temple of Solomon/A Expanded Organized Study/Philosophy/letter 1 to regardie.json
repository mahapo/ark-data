[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"2380 Monterey RoadSan Marino, Cal.January 15, 1933Care Frater:Thank you for putting me in touch with Miss Hughes. She has sent me avery interesting and understanding letter, to which I have answered at somelength.I concede the value of your testimony that no harm has come toyourself, or to members of the English Temples you are familiar with, throughthe use of the Enochian material. Yet I might say that I still believe theEnochian stuff perhaps more subtly harmful than appears even from suchexperiments. If the Order's method of evoking the elementals were purelyEnochian, then I should have nothing to say. But since it is a mixture of theEnochian language and tablets with other, and probably older, materials, itseems not unlikely to me that such success as attends the use of the ritualsis due rather to the real effectiveness of the various pentagrams, etc., thanto anything else.At any rate, I have found by experiments carried out now for more thanseven years, that the elementals can be invoked precisely as well without theEnochian tablets or names. Instead of the latter, we have used Hebrew divineand angelic names, with unusually good results.You may be very sure that my objections are not to ceremonial. It isonly that I have had so much experience of the subtle dangers of corruptceremonial, that I prefer to be what seems to me on the safe side byeliminating from the rituals something that is certainly suspect as comingfrom a dubious source, by no means clearly connected with \"Rosicrucianism.\"Evidently Miss Hughes has some doubts similar to mine, for she writes me thatshe would be glad to have some assurance that the \"Enochian language\" isreally a language at all!Of course, too, I know that one does not swallow the Qabalah whole. MyWarsaw edition of the Sepher Yetzirah, with coment by Saadia Gayon andothers, is sufficiently full of grotesqueries. Yet it has a kernel of realvalue, as have even some parts of the works you mention. If I could findanything beyond the subconscious and complex elaboration of a dubious, if notfalse, premise in the Enochian magical methods, perhaps I would use them too.But after about thirty-three years of research and experiment, I begin to besomewhat wary.As to Tattvas, it is true enough that the Order work with them is notfrom \"Nature's Finer Forces.\" I don't know who worked out that scheme, whichis rather less effective than some of the Tantrik practices it closelyresembles. But what has it to do with Qabalah, or with anything announced inthe \"Fama\" or \"Confession\" as Rosicrucian philosophy or practice? Again, likethe Enochian system, it seems to me to have been lugged in by the heels. AndI have had enough experience of the inventiveness of charlatans to find iteasier to believe that Mathers invented the Tattva technique, or adapted itfrom some obscure Hindu treatise, than to suppose it to be somethingtransmitted from the Third Order. Even Spencer Lewis has managed to work outsome surprisingly plausible formulas; but the presence of those formulas in"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"his system does not convince me he is the \"only true channel\" of Rosicrucianinstruction in America.The Scottish Rite Library in Washington has some interesting earlyRosicruciana written by Kenneth Mackenzie. Some years ago, in searchingthrough the material, I got on the track of the hints that led me to believethat our Order rituals must be in some sense an adaptation or expansion ofrituals used by some society in the days of Lytton, Levi, Hockley andSpedalieri. More recently, in the library of the Massachusetts Grand Lodge, Icame upon a French ritual of the 33 degree, which contains not a littlematerial closely resembling some of the magical work studied by Z.A.M.members.Roughly, what I think of the G.D., as it developed in the hands ofWoodman, Westcott and Mathers, is that it was based on earlier rituals (oroutlines of rituals) which were probably dug up somewhere by thatindefatigable library-hound, Mathers. I fully believe that the \"Tree of Life\"outline is workable, and that the Grade scheme must adhere to it. I know thatthe 0=0 and Vault rituals are magically effective. So are the opening andclosing ceremonies of the Grades from 1=10 to 4=7, inclusive (with or withoutthe Enochian additions.)It has been my experience that whatever the Third Order may be, itsometimes operates in what to us may seem to be very devious ways -- usingwhat tools present themselves, whether or not those tools be ideal. Thus myfeeling about the Order as it stands is that it is certainly in the line ofthe ancient tradition, but that it also is cluttered up with a lot ofmaterial which may, some of it, be well enough, but which does not reallybelong in the Order system.As for the Knowledge Lectures, they are of various worth. Those onastrology are probably the worst presentation of that abused art that I haveever encountered. I have never yet known anyone to make even respectableprogress in astrology from studying the Order lectures. Invariable they havehad to use supplementary work; and in more than one place the lectures arepositively confusing.The text on Geomancy is good, but is almost a word for word crib of onein my possession, written about 1830. This never was printed, so far as Iknow; but I learned all my geomancy from it, years before I heard of theOrder.Yet I concede your point that one who enters the Order prepared to workwill find there a lot of material that is not easily found outside. The Orderdoes teach a coherent system in the main, and deserves to be perpetuated onthat account. But it does not teach a system which has been restricted tocircles of obligated initiates, and in the variant of the G.D. which wasactive in America under the direction of S.R.M.D. and V.N.R. precisely thatclaim was not only implied, but was also directly stated. Thus I am glad tofind in Miss Hughesâ€™ letter not a little evidence that she and her fellowChiefs put the emphasis rather on the work itself than upon any notion of\"apostolic succession\" from the \"original\" Rosicrucian Fraternity.A special interest in the very things that are the backbone of theOrder system had made me unusually familiar with most of the material long"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"before I entered it. Circumstances enabled me to make a good livelihood byworking about three hours daily; and most of my spare time was spent in theexcellent libraries of New York and Chicago, where there is a wealth ofmaterial for the research worker in this field. Perhaps the fact that I wasactually born in a public library (or, at least, in the house where it waslocated) helped me to get on the track of the essential materialcomparatively early in life. I am sure, too, that I had direct help from theThird Order, though when that help was received I did not identify where itcame from.At all events, with the exception of some more or less speculativematerial in the Flying Rolls, the technique of the Tattvas, and the actualceremonials of consecration of implements, together with the ritual of thePentagram and Hexagram, I found nothing in the Order texts that had not beenlong in print. Which is, of course, no criticism of the value of the Order'scurriculum, but merely an evidence that in obligating its members, those whowere responsible for the obligation permitted it to be assumed that the bulkof the Order's knowledge could be gained nowhere else. And I contend that nogood can come of any sort of trading in the probable ignorance of another.Much better would be the frank admission that the curriculum of the Order isan eclectic combination of knowledge and practices which have been found tobe valuable. And precisely that admission is what our present variant of theold pattern does make to all its new members.Believing, then, that the present European form of the G.D., as youknow it, is undoubtedly preserving much that is worth while, and that in itshigher grades there are those who have established, as we have in America,real contact with the Third Order, I am as strong for \"orthodoxy\" as any one.But I submit that \"orthodoxy\" simply means \"correct teaching\" and that theburden of my criticism is that MacGregor (and nobody else) introduced alienelements into the stream which seems to have come to us through Mackenzie,Levi and their contemporaries. In eliminating the Enochian elements, we inAmerica have lost nothing of practical effectiveness. And from what MissHughes says, I believe it likely that there have been some reforms in thegrade rituals below 5=6, as you work them.At any rate, it is good to know that on both sides of the Atlanticthere are serious workers who are following out the pattern of the Tree ofLife. And I certainly hope we can work out some way in which to co-ordinateour efforts.Yours fraternally,Perseverantia"}]
