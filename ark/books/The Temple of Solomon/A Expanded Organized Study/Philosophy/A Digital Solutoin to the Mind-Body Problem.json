IntroductionDualist-interconnectionist models for consciousness, from Ancient Greece toDescartes, have disjoint parts connected by a mysterious communication process.Usually no explanation is proposed for this communication process, although theresonance metaphor is sometimes mentioned. In this paper we consider thisproblem in the context of the mind/body model of Descartes. The intractability ofthis mind/body problem has been discussed by everyone from Plato on. We aregoing to apply to it an atomistic mechanism deriving from the theory of thequantum vacuum in modern physics.We thus bring together the mind/body problem of Descartes and the digitalphilosophy of Fredkin and others (Hey, 1999) into a joint picture first described byDemocritus (Popper, 1998). Our starting point is a cellular dynamical model of thequantum vacuum due to Requardt and Roy (2001) and extended by Abraham andRoy (2007). This is a process, the RRA process, by which the illusion of analogspacetime self-organizes from a digital substructure -- a submicroscopic,corpuscular, cellular dynamical system -- a sort of finite point set on steroids. Inthis paper we further extend the RRA process from space to spacetime in thedomain of terrestrial physics, and then jump up to the mental and spiritual realms,where the constraints of physics no longer apply.We apply the process twice, once to the mind, and again to the body, to obtain ourresolution of the mind/body problem. In our final, composite picture, there is oneenormous point set, its size estimated by Wheeler as 10 to the power 88 (Hey,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"1999), operating beneath the perceived realities of macroscopic mind, body, andalso quantum reality. We are grateful to Dr. Paul A. Lee for his guidance regardingthe Ancient Greek tradition.2. The Mind/Body ProblemThe mind/body problem is a perennial thread in philosophy, East and West, sothere are many illustrious names on its chronology. We will concentrate on just afew of these, to establish the main milestones of our story, and briefly describetheir contributions. For the earliest history, beginning with Homer, see Jaspers(1998, Essay 8).2.1. Plato, 370 BC.Plato expanded the teaching of Socrates on the perfection of the soul into acomplete system. In this system, morals and justice were based on absolute ideas.Wisdom consists of knowledge of these ideas, and philosophy is the search forwisdom. In fourteen more dialogues, Plato elaborated this unified system.Plato's theory of soul is set out primarily in six of the dialogues: Phaedo, RepublicII, and Phaedrus, of the middle group of dialogues, 387-367 BCE, Timaeus, around365 BCE, which divides the middle, and last groups, and Philebus and Laws, of thelast group, 365-347 BCE. The development of the individual soul is given in thethree middle dialogues.The Phaedo is a long and detailed examination of the individual soul, itsimmortality, and reincarnation, given by Socrates on the day of his death sentence.The Republic describes Plato’s mathematical curriculum for the Academy:arithmetic, plane geometry, solid geometry, astronomy, and music. At the end[10.614b] is the Tale of Er, which details the reincarnation process of theindividual soul, as told by an eye witness. (The numbers in brackets are pagenumbers of the Stevens translation.) In the Phaedrus, Socrates and Phaedrusdiscourse on love, and on rhetoric. To understand divine madness, one must learnthe nature of the soul. [245c] Soul is always in motion, and is self-moving, andtherefore is deathless. [245c,d,e] Then begins the important metaphor of thechariot: two winged horses and a charioteer. [246a -- 248a] This metaphor of thesoul is then used to explain divine madness, and the dynamics of reincarnation.The world soul is developed in the later three dialogues. Regarding the individualsoul, the Timeaus explains that as a person becomes a rational creature througheducation, his human soul moves in a circle in the head (a sphere) of his mortalbody. [44] In the Philebus, Socrates introduces the world soul as the source ofindividual souls. [30a]In sum, we have from Plato a four-level, hierarchical cosmology, including (fromthe top):"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"1. The Good, an integral principle with no spatial extent,2. The Intellect, or nous, including the Ideas or Forms (pl. eide, sing. eidos),3. The World Soul (including individual human souls), and 4. The Terrestial Sphere of matter and energy.Forms exist in the Intellect, and are outside of space and time. Terrestrial objectsare instances, or particulars, of Forms. Individual souls are pieces of the WorldSoul which have instantiated, or incarnated, a Form. When people die, theirindividual souls reunite with their Forms.To this Theory of Forms, Plato himself raised an objection, in his dialogue,Parmenides. This problem, later called the third man argument, or TMA, has beenthe subject of much discussion over the past fifty years. It is somewhat like theRussell paradox of mathematical set theory. That is, if a Form (a class of objects)contains itself as a member, then an unwelcome infinite regress is set up, towardlarger and larger collections.Some have interpreted this objection another way, which we shall call TMA2. Thisapplies when we have two categories which are disjoint -- such as two paralleluniverses -- and yet which exchange information. A matrix between the twocategories -- such as the air between two resonant guitar strings -- must beinterpolated, to carry the resonance or intercommunication. For example, in Plato'scosmology, the World Soul intervenes between the Intellect and the TerrestrialSphere. Or on the individual level, Ficino's Spirit intervenes between the individualsoul and the body.2.2. Kashmiri Shaivism, 1000 CE.The Indian tradition provides a number of different schemes for levels ofconsciousness, including five koshas, seven chakras, 36 tattvas, and so on. The fivekoshas are, from the top down: the bliss body (anandamaya kosha), astral body(vijnanamaya kosha), mental body (manomaya kosha) pranic body (pranamayakosha), and the food body (annamaya kosha). The bliss body is described as anexperience of total transcendence, where only the fundamental vibration of theunconscious system remains. (Saraswati, 1998; p. 54)The TMA2 problem may be the ultimate cause of the profusion of levels in theSanskrit literature on consciousness. No matter how many levels, the mystery ofthe communication between adjacent levels in the hierarchy remains. The vibrationmetaphor addresses this mystery, but still begs an encompassing matrix or mediumto carry information from level to level. The vibration metaphor entered the Indianliterature in the Spanda (vibration), Urmi (wave), and Prana (life-force) concepts ofthe Trika philosophy (Kashmiri Shaivism) due to Vasugupta, his disciple, Kallata,and his student in turn, Abhinava Gupta, tenth century CE. (Probhananda, 2003,2004; Dyczkowski, 1992; Singh, 1980.)"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"We may regard the mind/body problem as just the bottom level of a stack ofsimilar problems. We intend that our attack on the M/B problem should eventuallybe applied throughout the koshas, chakras, or tattwas of a full model of collectiveconsciousness and unconsciousness.2.3. Descartes, 1632.Descartes was a dualist, to whom the world consisted of two original substances --body and mind – between which there was an enormous gulf. Man consists of bodyand mind, which interact through the pineal gland. His dualist theory, and hismechanical view of nature, dominated philosophy for centuries. His method ofthought and his theories have been subjected to devastating criticism, for example,Jaspers (1964). For many historians, the mind/body problem in Western philosophybegan with Descartes.3. AtomismLike the mind/body problem, atomism is a perennial thread in philosophy, East andWest, with many illustrious names on its chronology. Again, we will concentrateon just a few of them.3.2. Parmenides, 450 BC.According to Popper (1998), Parmenides -- an important if little known presocraticphilosopher of early 5th century BC Greece -- was the creator of atomism (Atomos,Greek for indivisible). First of all, he is know for his Two Ways – the Way of TrueKnowledge (aletheia) and the Way of Human Conjecture (doxa) – revealed to himby a goddess and described in his only work, On nature. The Way of TrueKnowledge includes the idea that behind the false and illusory world of changeperceived by the senses there is an absolute reality that is totally static, a darksphere of continuous dense matter, called the Being. In our sensory perceptions, weexperience a dual world of atoms moving in the void, hence the Way of HumanConjecture.3.2. Democritus, 400 BC.Democritus, a student of Parmenides, is widely regarded as the founder of theatomism thread. And it is said that Democritus' ideas were formed to contradictParmenides. Democritus wrote on math, astronomy, and ethics, and had a greatinfluence on later Greek philosophy, especially Aristotle, and hence, on the wholeof the Western Tradition.Regarding atoms, he believed that material bodies were formed as temporarycomposites of eternal atoms, like flocks of birds. Atoms are variously shaped andsized. The primary qualities of a material body – its shape, size, and weight -- andits secondary aspects -- smell, taste, etc -- all derive from the size and shape of its"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"atoms. Atoms move in a \"void\", which is empty, and yet is not nothing. The soul ismade of soul-atoms, which are very small and spherical, and can pass through solidmaterial bodies, like neutrinos.3.3. Dharmakirti, 650 AD.It is always a pleasure to follow a thread from Ancient Greece, through trade routesto India, then circuitously to Early Islam, and thence to Europe. In this case we arejust guessing. There is a long history of atomism in India. One of the ancient Hinduphilosophers, Kanad, discussed the existence of atoms. In fact, the word Kanad isderived from the word Kana, which means atom. Among Buddhist traditions,Vasubandhu and Dharmakirti particularly discussed the existence of atom.Dharmakirti was a student of Dignaga, a Buddhist logician, and then professor atthe famed Nalanda University. He introduced in the thread a wondrous novelty,namely, that atoms are not eternal, but rather, flash into and out of existence aspoints of energy. This seemed somewhat outre until very recently, when thequantum vacuum emerged into physics, as we discuss in this paper.3.4. Galileo, 1623.Galileo was famously condemned by the Vatican in 1633, overtly because ofsupporting Copernicus (that the earth moves) in his book, Dialogues concerningthe two chief world systems, published in 1632. However, there is a competing (andcontroversial) theory according to which his real offense was his earlier book, TheAssayer, of 1623. (Redondi, 1987). This work advocated an atomic theory,according to which (rather like Democritus) the secondary qualities of matter (taste,smell, etc) were determined by the primary qualities (the shapes of atomscomprising the matter). This was of huge concern to the Vatican in thatTransubstantiation -- the official dogma of the Church since the Council of Trent(1545-1563) regarding the consecration in the Mass of the Sacraments (turning thebread and wine into the body and blood) -- depended on secondary qualities beingindependent of primary qualities. (Shea, 1991; p. 181)3.5. Quantum theoryShortly following the early death of Descartes, Newton's universal theory ofgravitation laid atomism to rest, where it remained for two hundred years. Then itrose from the ashes in a sequence of developments, collectively known as thequantum revolution. Here is a chronology of some of these developments.1808, John Dalton posed a unique atom for each element.1897, J. J. Thompson discovered the electron (Nobel prize in 1906).1900, Max Planck proposed energy quanta, founded quantum theory.1905, Albert Einstein introduced the photon asa corpuscle.1927, Dirac, Pauli, Weisskopf, Jordan, Quantum field theory.1940s, Feynman, Schwinger, Tomonaga, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"1966, H. Yukawa, Non-local Field Theory and Quantum Vacuum (QV).At this point, following QED, we have the theories of QV and the zero-pointfluctuation (ZPF) which are basic to the RR model of Requardt and Roy, (2001)l.This view of nature has the vacuum full of activity, in which particles jump outfrom, and then back into, the vacuum in pairs. In QED, as one calculates thetransition amplitudes with respect to the vacuum state, the vacuum as such does notcontribute in the calculations. However, Yukawa proposed the concept of non-localfield theory where the seat of particles is considered as an extended region ordomain in contrast to QED. Now if we take these domains to be quantumtheoretical objects, then they are probabilistically connected, and there is nodistinction between empty and occupied seats. Effectively, Yukawa introduced anew version of quantum theory of the aether with globular structure.3.6. Fredkin, 2000.The cellular automaton (CA) ideas of Stan Ulam and John von Neumann in the1950s rested in obscurity until the appearance of John Conway‘s Game of Life inthe 1970s. Then CA models of nature became a fad, and many successful modelsfor macroscopic physical systems were made, especially in the circle aroundFeynman in the 1980s (Hey, 1999). However, computer science models of theindividual soul, such as we seek, are rare. In this connection we must mention thework of Ed Fredkin. one of the pioneers of the digital philosophy, and the mainstayof the website www.digitalphilosophy.org which explains:Digital Philosophy (DP) is a new way of thinking about thefundamental workings of processes in nature. DP is an atomic theorycarried to a logical extreme where all quantities in nature are finiteand discrete. This means that, theoretically, any quantity can berepresented exactly by an integer. Further, DP implies that natureharbors no infinities, infinitesimals, continuities, or locally determinedrandom variables.In \"On the Soul\" (2000 Draft Paper) Fredkin proposed a computer sciencedefinition of the soul, concluding: \"The soul is an informational entity, whichis constructed out of the states and the arrangements of material things.\"All these recent developments, which we subsume under the classical headingatomism, support the idea that underlying our illusion of continuous space, time,matter, energy, etc (the analog part of the analog/digital dichotomy, and the wavepart of the wave/particle duality) is a fundamental layer that is finite, discrete, andintelligent (that is, law-abiding). Sometimes all this is called the finite natureassumption. (Fredkin, 1992) This is close to the view of Parmenides describedabove."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"4. The RRA modelIn this section we recall the RRA process, as defined in (Abrahan and Roy, toappear). In the next section, we extend it from space to spacetime, and finally, weapply the process to the mind/body problem.The RRA model is a two-level system. The microscopic level, QX, is a dynamicalcellular network of nodes and bonds. Inspired by the cellular automata of Ulamand von Neumann, a dynamical cellular network is a directed graph withconnections (directed links) which appear, disappear, and change direction,according to dynamical rules.The macroscopic level, ST, that self-organizes from QX is an another dynamicalcellular network, in which the nodes are the cliques (that is, maximal fullyconnected subgraphs) of a graph, G, of the QX level, bound in a network bysuperbonds.The system of RR ends with a metric space. But in a sequel paper (Abraham andRoy, 2006) we have developed a neural network approach which imbeds the STlevel into Euclidean spacetime, EST. Thus the ambient space of nature, accordingto consensual reality, is actually an epiphenomenon of the atomistic and finite QXnetwork, according to the scheme: QX --> ST --> EST. This is the full RA process,which we call condensation. More details may be found in the Appendix.5. The time dimensionsThe discrete, microscopic time parameter, t, used above does not representmacroscopic time. Rather, we propose to obtain macroscopic spacetime throughour process of condensation. Macroscopic time, T, exists locally as a function onspacetime, but may pretend that there is a cosmic time function, to simplify theexposition. We propose now to obtain macroscopic spacetime from thecondensation process applied repeatedly to the entire, t-dependent QX object.The condessnation process is regarded as being accomplished in a single instant,and it determines instantaneous states for the macrocosmic system in which spaceappears to be a continuum. Even so, the network, QX, is changing rapidly by atime-discrete process, with time t. We are going to regard the stepwise increasingnetwork time as an internal process variable, microscopic time, that is distinct fromthe continuous physical time aspect of the spacetime of general relativity, cosmictime. Thus, we envision two dimensions of time.We adopt the Cauchy perspective of general relativity, in which the Einsteinequation is regarded as a system of quasi-linear, second-order partial differentialequations. The Cauchy initial value problem for this system regards the past andpresent as known, and the future to be determined by integration the system alongcharacteristic directions. The topology of spacetime, along with the geometry"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"(metric tensor) and the physical parameters (energy, mass, electromagnetic fields,etc.) must evolve according to this Einstein equation. Wormholes and black holesmay evolve as caustics of the characteristics of he Einstein equation.Alternatively, for a mathematically less-challenging exposition, we may suppose,like Einstein, that spacetime is created as a finished system, a complete pseudo-Riemannian geometrical object.So this is our proposal for the emergence of cosmic time. Constrained by theEinstein equation, cosmic time advances in discrete intervals, that might bemultiple steps of microcosmic time, giant steps. With each giant step, yet anothercondensation occurs, as follows.We consider a memory device, controlled by the cosmic-time function, T. Betweencosmic times T1 (corresponding to network time t1) and T2 (with its t2) thememory device records all of the finite states of QX between network-time t1 andnetwork-time t2, and condenses this finite set of QX states into a spacelikecontinuum corresponding to the discrete cosmic time T2. One method for thecondensation of a finite set of QX states is the sum algorithm. That is, we form aQX sum-state by adding the internal node states of all nodes, and all the bond statesof all the bonds, of the set of QX states. In other words, fix a node of QX. Sum upthe node-states of that one node for all the QX stats with network time in theinterval, (t1, t2], that is an integer. Do likewise for each bond of QX, but rounddown if this sum is greater than one, and round up if less than minus one.Thus, spacetime is squeezed from the dynamical cellular network, QX, astoothpaste from a tube. As giant steps are still very small compared with theresolving power of macroscopic science, cosmic time appears to be continuous.The macroscopic system, QX, sparkles with activity on the scale of Planck spaceand time, while macroscopic spacetime unrolls essentially continuously. The pastand present become known, while the future remains yet a mystery.In summary, our scheme, QX \u0002 ST \u0002 3ST is extended to the scheme QX \u0002 ST\u0002 4ST, all in the context of the body, that is, the physical world. We now wish toapply this new scheme to the mind/body problem.6. The mind/body problem resolvedWe now consider two QX networks: QX1 (the body level), QX2 (the mind level).Each of them might be the basis for an RRA process, one condensing to the body,or the physical world as we have considered up to this point, the other to a separateworld of the mind.However, we may prefer alternatively to join QX1 and QX2 into a single entwinednetwork, QX*, on which two condensation processes operate. We might comparethis approach to John Whitney’s concept of digital harmony, in which a single"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"mathematical algorithm is employed to compose a piece of music, and an abstractanimated image, which then seem — when played together – to harmonize, due toderiving from a common archetypal process. But we will proceed now with QX1and QX2.After all this preparation, our approach to the perennial conundrum is now simple:we apply the idea of condensation from a QX network twice: once to the bodylevel, as in the RRA model, and again by analogy to the mind level, as in Fredkin(2000). This results in the four-part scheme:QX2 --> MindQX1 --> BodyThe mystery connection between the disjoint mind and body systems now becomesan epiphenomenon of the connection between QX1 and QX2 which is notmysterious at all. For the nature of the QX model of RRA is that of a dynamicalcellular network, and we may regard QX1 and QX2 as a single, entangled network,as directed links between the two systems will be allowed by our dynamical rules.7. ConclusionIn sum, then, the mind/body connections are completed in a circuit outside ordinaryconsensual reality in a submicroscopic atomic realm beyond our senses, butrevealed by the progress of modern physics. This realm or matrix, an extension ofthe quantum vacuum into the realm of consciousness, is a finite, discrete, digital,cosmos, which condenses -- in the human perceptual and cognitive process -- intoepiphenomena, the continuum illusion of mind/body, hypostases, koshas, cakras,tattwas, and so on, of the perennial traditions of consciousness studies.Note that the QX level is a static point set with a dynamic network structure,changing in microscopic time, t. Meanwhile, the macroscopic body and mind havebeen constructed as complete spacetime worlds, with locally defined macroscopictimes, T. This provides a background for psi phenomena such as telepathy andclairvoyance, but also leaves a window of opportunity for free will. Like a zipperclosing, the past is zipped (or firmed) up, while the microscopic future is subject tointeraction with the macroscopic body and mind, until the zipper closure arrives,and condensation (or collapse) occurs.The end of our construction is an echo ofa the Two Ways of Parmenides, theatomic QX*, and the ST4 continua of body and mind, playing out in digitalharmony.Appendix. Summary of the RRA process.The RRA process, of Abraham and Roy (to appear) is not a description of physicalreality, but just a mathematical model that captures some aspects of our experience"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"of physical reality. We will summarize this process in three stages. Full details,examples, and graphics, may be seen in Abraham and Roy.(A) We begin with a description of our microscopic system, QX.(B) Then we will go on to extract from it our macroscopic system, ST.(C) Finally, we describe in summary the embedding of ST into an Euclideanspace.A1. There is a finite, but huge, point set, which is static throughout the process. LetS denote this finite set. Enumerate this set by fixing a bijection from S to N, thecardinality of S. Thus, S is a set of points, {n_0, n_1. ..., n_(N-1)}. These points arecalled nodes.A2. At each node and each moment of time there is an internal node-state, which issome number of quanta of information. Thus, we have a set of time-dependentnode-states, {s_0, s_1, ..., s_(N-1)}.A3. There are no bilateral connections. That is, for each pair of nodes, n_i and n_j,there may be a directed link from n_i to n_j, or none. We agree there cannot be adirected link from n_i to n_j if there is one from n_j to n_i. That is,.A4. There is a global time clock for the system. The time variable, t, is a naturalnumber, and increases by one at regular intervals, called clicks.A5. The directed links may appear, disappear, or change direction, with each click.They change according to a fixed dynamical rule.A6. With each click, each node n_i sends one quantum of information to the noden_j if there is a directed link from n_i to n_j.A7. At each time there is digraph, a directed graph on S, defined by the directedlinks. Let D(t) denote the state of this digraph at clock time t, an integer. Associatedwith D(t) is a graph G(t), in which the directions of D(t) are ignored.This is our microscopic system, QX, exactly as described by Requardt and Roy(2001).Next we will describe the emergence of the macroscopic ST system fromQX, QX \u0002 ST, following Abraham and Roy (to appear).B1. For each node, n_i, of D(t) let w_i denote its node-weight, that is, the numberof directed links of D(t) that either arrive at, or depart from, n_i. Thus, we have afinite sequence of node-weights, {w_0, w_1, ..., w_(N-1)}.B2. Next, at each time, t, we may construct, from the digraph D(t), a permutation ofthe set S of nodes, as follows. We reorder the nodes of S according to their node-weights, in decreasing order. If several nodes have the same node-weight, we retaintheir original order. Let P(t) denote the permutation of N obtained in this way."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"B3. A clique of a permutation is a maximal inverse sequence. Compute the cliquesof P(t). This may be done by inspection if N is not too large. Let K(t) denote the setof all cliques of P(t). These cliques, which are simply subsets of {0, 1, ..., n-1} indecreasing order, will be considered the supernodes of our macroscopic system,ST.B4. If K is a finite set of natural numbers, let the span of K denote the filled-ininterval, span(K) = [min(K), max(K)]. We define a superbond between twosupernodes, or cliques, if and only if their spans are disjoint. Thus we have a graphST(t) defined by these supernodes and superbonds.This is our macroscopic system, ST. Finally we will describe the pseudo-isometricembedding of ST into a Euclidean space, ST \u0003 EST, again following Abrahamand Roy (to appear).C1. For every pair of disjoint cliques of K(t), we define their overlap, a measure ofthe entanglement of the two cliques, by counting points in the intersection andunion of the sets spanned by the two cliques. Details and examples may be found inAbraham and Roy (2008). These overlap measurements may be used to definedistances: more entanglement corresponding to a smaller distance.C2. Embed K(t) in a Euclidean space, and relax the embedding to approximate asclosely as possible an isometry. That is, the distance between the images of twocliques represents their entanglement.The process QX \u0002 ST \u0002 EST may be called condensation.ReferencesAbraham, Ralph (2006), Vibrations and Forms.
