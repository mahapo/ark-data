He acted as scientist, as occultist, as political dissi-dent and often as a simple damned eejit (just lik e you and me).Scientists, aware of his tr emendous contributions to space science ,generally call him John Parsons, and they’ve even named a crater on themoon after him. Those occultists who know of his work in their very spe-cialized arts call him Jack P arsons, the name he himself pr eferred; insome magick lodges they consider him second only to Aleister Cr owleyas a progenitor of the Ne w Aeon.

She also taught him to hate hisabsent father, a pr oven “adulterer.” (Horrors!) Developing an earlyinterest in psychology, Marvel diagnosed himself as having a classicOedipus complex, a compulsiv e antipathy to “Patriarchy” (he usedthe word before the Feminists made it trendy) and an equally intenseloathing for an y and all A uthority s ymbols, especially “God theFather.”But let us look at 19 14, the year of Parsons’ birth, more closely.Whatever you think of astrology, with its extraterrestrial bias, a “sec-ular horoscope” limited to Earthly portents always provides amusinginsights. The terrestrial world that shaped Marvel Parsons looked likethis:The First World War had started on July 28 that year; before 1914ended the fir st aerial bombing of civilian populations occurr ed(Germany did it to F rance), and the bloody battles of the Marne ,Tannerberg, Ghent and especially Ypres demonstrated that “civilized”modern humans could act even more inhumanely and insanely thanany barbarians of the past.

Accordingto the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Illuminati managed to influencemany masonic lodges and gained “ a commanding position” in themovement of anti-r oyalist, anti-Papist and pr o-democratic “secularhumanism.” They attracted such literary men as Goethe and Her derbut the whole movement came to an end when the Bavarian govern-ment banned the Illuminati in 1785.

The ter ror,agony and despair that accompany this process cannot be minimized.”—John Whiteside Parsons4Two recent books that shed some light on all these murky mattersdeserve some attention at this point—The Hiram Key and The SecondMessiah.5The author s of both books , Knight and Lomas , bothFreemasons themselves, claim that they have received “support andcongratulations” from “hundreds” of other masons—athough the yadmit that their research has been greeted with hostile silence by theUnited Gr and Lodge of England, one of the mor e conserv ativemasonic bodies.Basically, Knight and Lomas try to pr ove that masonry not onlydates back to ancient Egypt—as only the most R omantic masonshave hitherto claimed—but that it also served as a major influence on“Jerusalem Christianity,” the earliest form of the Christian faith,which St. Paul and other se x-maniacs persecuted and drove under-ground. When the official Romish Christianity became dominant, pri-mordial or “Jerusalem” Christianity surviv ed b y hiding withinvarious Gnostic “her esies,” Knight and Lomas sa y, and became amajor force again only when rediscovered and accepted as their ownsecret inner doctrine b y the Knights T emplar. When the T emplarswere condemned by the Inquisition (1308) the surivivors used vari-ous other names until emerging again as “Freemasons” in the 17th or18th Centuries.Parts of this thesis ha ve appear ed in other books—the under-ground survival of primordial Christianity, for instance, underlies theentire argument of the famous Holy Blood, Holy Gr ailby Baigent,xvisex and rockets4.Freedom, op. cit., p. 56.5.The Hiram Keyby Christopher Knight and Rober t Lomas, Centur y, 1996; The SecondMessiah, by Christopher Knight and Rober t Lomas, Element Books, 1997."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Lincoln and Leigh—but Knight and Lomas ha ve put the puzzletogether in a more convincing way an any of their precursors.But what about the original Egyptian “mystery” out of which thisunderground tradition emerged?

Only after this other-worldly journey could the pharoah be accepted by the priests, and byhimself, as one fit to fulfill the divine , as well as political, functionsof kingship, as conceiv ed in those da ys. This voyage to the higheststars, where the gods live, involved a magick ritual employing whatKnight and Lomas call a “nar cotic.” When the last phar aoh of thenative dynasty refused to reveal the secrets of this ritual to the ne wHyskos dynasty, they killed him in the manner of the wido w’s son.The lost “word” = the details of the Ritual of Illumination and thename of the “narcotic” used.It seems to me that Knight and Lomas have this last detail wrong,due to their ignor ance of ps ycho-pharmacology.

They kill pain, they numb anxiety, they knock youunconscious; and the y usually get y ou addicted: that’ s all the y do.Almost certainly, the magick potion used in the ritual did not belongto the narcotic family but to the entheogens—the type of drugs alsocalled psychedelics.

Magick works faster, especiallywhen united with the ancient shamanic ecstasies of full se xualrelease and the proper en-theo-gens. Crowley said, and Parsons liked to quote him on this, “THERE IS NOGOD BUT MAN.” (That sounds “se xist” these days, but you all knowwhat he meant. He also said “EVERY MAN AND EVER Y WOMAN IS ASTAR.”) To confuse this with atheism seems to me as wildly off themark as confusing it with “Satanism.” It quite simply means that allideas/perceptions/experiences of the divine or the immortal r eferdirectly back to the latent powers of the mind that contains them.

Marveldoes not appear in the Boston city dir ectories for the y ears 1910through 1913, so he was either living at home with his parents or hewas from a small town just outside of Boston. When Marvel reachedthe age when men have to make a living for themselves, he realizedthere was no w ay he could do it selling eggs with his father . SoMarvel decided to head west—to California, the land of sunshine andopportunity.Marvel arrived in Los Angeles in 19 13, a fact known because hisname shows up in the 1914 city directory as residing at 2375 Scarrf,where he was a tenant. He w as employed by the English Motor CarCompany of 1 132 S. Gr and Ave., which w as not an imported cardealer but named for its president, P.A. English. On a 1914 document,Marvel listed his occupation as “auto accessories,” so he was proba-bly employed in sales.Par sons met Ruth Virginia Whiteside when he arrived in Californiaand married her soon after . Ruth was from Ohio, but w as born inChicago, Illinois, in late 1893 or early 1894. Ruth had lived in severalcities around the country and had also tr aveled to Europe with herparents on different occasions. I was unable to find her in any of theLos Angeles or Pasadena city directories prior to her marriage. Marveland Ruth Parsons gave birth to a son on October 2, 1914 and namedhim Marvel Whiteside Parsons. He was their second child, the fir sthaving died at birth or in infanc y. The younger Marvel was born atGood Samaritan Hospital, 1225 Wilshir e Blv d., Los Angeles ,California, at 8:45 p.m. The attending physician was Julian Coffey.About this time the senior Marv el did something that w as lesscommon in 1914 than it is toda y. It was certainly less talk ed aboutthen, and not condoned at all. Marv el had an affair with anotherwoman. Ruth responded to his affair b y doing something equallyshocking: she divorced her new husband.

As the boy grew, close friends and family w ouldcome to call him “Jack,” which is how he is often remembered today.Because of these name changes , it is possible to tell at a glancewhether a biographical account of Parsons originates from the scien-tific community or the occult community, as the latter uniformly callshim “Jack.” Members of the scientific community call him “John,”which is how he will be referred to throughout this book.Curiously, Ruth Parsons kept her ex-husband’s surname for herselfand the boy, for she is consistently r eferred to as Mrs. Ruth Parsonsfor the rest of her life. It may be that there was no legal divorce at all,as one of her son’ s later documents mak es reference to a “separ a-tion,” which ma y mean that his mother ma y have merely kickedMarvel out.In an ominous coincidence , Charles T aze R ussell, whose“Russellites” now call themselves the Jehovah’s Witnesses, predictedthe end of the world would happen on October 2, 1914, the day of JohnParsons’ birth, and just a couple months after the start of World War I.When Russell announced to his congr egation in Brooklyn, New York,that the end had begun, he meant the finale was not an instantaneousend to all things, but rather the beginning of the end as outlined in theBook of Revelation—the appearance of the Antichrist and the harlot,Babylon the Great, being two of the k ey events. It is ir onic that JohnPar sons, who would later attempt to incarnate Babylon and who wouldalso sign an oath stating that he was the Antichrist, was born the veryday of Russell’s eschatological event.Of his o wn birth, the m ystical Parsons wrote in Analysis By AMaster of the Temple34 years later, “I chose this constellation [Libra]in order that you might have an innate sense of balance and ultimatejustice, responsive and attractive nature, a bountiful envir onment &sense of royalty and largesse, strength, courage & power combinedwith cunning and intelligence .

Ruth’s obituary lists Walter’s occupation as presi-dent of both Ste vens Duryea and the Allis Chalmer s ManufacturingCompany. Ruth and her par ents, along with y oung John, sta yed at537 S.

It has been saidthat Marvel worked for Woodrow Wilson (President, 1913–1921) orWarren G.

Parsons in the VA records was retired fromactive duty in October 1939 and didn’t die until Ma y 12, 1947,although he is evidently not buried in any of the VA’s national ceme-teries.

Such atrip would be affordable for a well-to-do man like Walter. Ruth’s obit-uary said she traveled to Europe on several occasions with her par-ents. At least one of these trips must have included her son.Of his teenage years, Parsons wrote in Analysis By A Master of theTemple, “Early adolescence continued the development of the neces-sary combinations.

GALCITstarted as an aerodynamicsresearch laboratory funded by a member of the famous Guggenheimfamily and administered by Caltech. In 1926, GALCITcame under thedirection of the w ell-known Hungarian pr ofessor Theodor e v onKármán (1881–1963).Born in Budapest on Ma y 11, 1881, von Kármán was descendedfrom Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel of Prague, and he often boastedof his ancestor’s reputation for having created a golem, “an artificialhuman being in Hebrew folklore endowed with life.”2Unmentionedin his autobiography, The Wind and Beyond, the golem appear s inseveral secondary sources. Though not relevant to our discussion ofGALCIT, the cr eation of the golem is a topic w e will r eturn to laterwhen we discuss “magical children.”After graduating Göttingen Univ ersity in German y, von Kármánwas awarded a fellowship there, and began to conduct r esearch onaerodynamic drag in one of Eur ope’s first wind tunnels , which hebuilt for this purpose .

At a party at the big house at 1003 S.

Malina took his pr oject down the Caltech hall to v on Kármán,who immediately appr oved of it and pr ovided his support. V onKármán was well known for considering what other s thought to betoo kooky; after all, rockets were still viewed as science fiction by thepublic. The mer e mention of r ockets had people thinking of suchimpossible things as trips to the moon and r arely anything else. VonKármán’s allo wed Parsons and F orman to use the lab at GALCITdespite their lack of affiliation with the school.Malina later wr ote of being influenced b y reading Jules V erne’sFrom the Earth to the Moonat the age of 12, as had P arsons andForman. (Malina actually read it in Czech, when he lived in that coun-try with his parents for a few years.) All three enjoyed the excitementof trial-and-error experimentation, though Malina also understood theimportance of theor etical w ork, upon which v on Kármán alw aysinsisted. Since P arsons and F orman were anxious to test r ockets toprove brash theories, Malina best served his role by inducing them towork out their theoretical work. When experiments seemed to reacha dead end, Parsons would go to von Kármán, who’d perform a fe wquick calculations and say something like, “Yes, John, it is possible toachieve success in the dir ection you are heading, but fir st you mustwork out se veral dependant v ariables in the field.” Fieldw ork wasPar sons’ specialty; and for this v ery reason one is tempted to thinkvon Kármán should ha ve found him mor e important than Malina inhis 1958 list of the most important people in aer ospace. Malina corresponded heavily with his par ents in Texas when hewas de veloping r ocketry with P arsons, Forman and v on Kármán.Significant portions of these letters are preserved in the JPLarchivesunder the file, “Excerpts from Letters Written Home.” Taken togetherwith the memoirs Malina later wrote, these missives provide valuableinsight and a complete picture into the early development of rocketsin the United States.The first mention of Parsons and Forman in Malina’s documentscomes on February 14, 1936. By March 30, Malina referred to the pairand himself as the “gr oup.” After r eviewing the scant liter ature onthe subject of rockets, the group decided that their first goal would beto develop a working motor. Stationary tests of motor s, rather than10sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"launching test r ockets, was the fir st priority. Other e xperimentersbypassed this important step, failing as a r esult. Von Kármán per-suaded GALCITto lease three acres of land from the city of Pasadenain the area known as the Arroyo Seco, which exists in the shadow ofthe San Gabriel Mountains , just above the dam called De vil’s Gate.The acreage was the site of the ne w group’s experiments. Today,NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is situated there.The great experiment started slowly. Malina writes on April 5 thatPar sons and F orman take jobs at a po wder company. Presumablythey returned to Halifax. Ev en though r ockets were their passion,there was no mone y in it—y et. On April 13, Malina wr ote that hehadn’t seen either of them for at least se veral days; Parsons finallyphoned Malina on Ma y 24, telling him that he almost had a r ocketmotor completed.A month later, on June 18, Malina writes of P arsons testing withpowder, a reference to a solid fuel called “ballistite ,” which is madeby inserting a compressed black powder into the r ocket motor so itwill burn more slowly and evenly. The compression is accomplishedby heating smokeless powder at first, then extruding it under pr es-sure into long thin rods. Smokeless powder is a “double-base propel-lant” consisting of nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose, a formula knownsince the time of Alfr ed Nobel, the inv entor of dynamite. This pro-pellant was the fuel that e ventually powered bazooka rockets andwas not much different from the wax and aluminum used by Parsonsand Forman in 1932. Ballistite w as used in some of their tests priorto their work with GALCIT.The work took off r apidly once the testing started. On June 29,Malina wrote, “Parsons and I drove all over Los Angeles—looking forhigh pressure tanks and meter s. Didn’t ha ve any luck. Two instru-ments we need costs $60 a piece and we are trying to find them sec-ond hand. I am convinced it is a hopeless task. Will have to approachKármán.” The group’s lack of funds reflects that GALCITwasn’t anx-ious to bankr oll a pr oject the y felt w as far-fetched. Malinaapproached Professor Irving P. Krick, who made a lot of money fore-casting weather for movie studios. Though intrigued by the possibil-ities, Krick did not contribute . Parsons, Forman, and Malina w ererequired to fund the project on their own.On July 18, Malina wr ote, “The early part of this w eek JackPar sons and I covered much of Los Angeles looking for equipment.Our next lead points to Long Beach.

I have found in Parsons and his wife [Helen] apair of good intelligent friends.” “Hope they make a go of it” almostsounds defeatist, but Malina persisted.In the summer of 1936, Malina took the tr ouble to visit R obertGoddard (1882–1945) in R oswell, Ne w Me xico. Goddar d leftConnecticut for Roswell years earlier to work on his own rocket pro-ject, about which he was very secretive. Goddard actually worked inPasadena for a while during W orld War I, in the v ery Arroyo Secowhere Parsons, Malina, and F orman were laboring. Malina visitedGoddard to get ideas for his own research and to perhaps find a newposition working for Goddard—who had funding—rather than at thecheap domain of Caltech.At the invitation of Harry Guggenheim and v on Kármán, whowere interested in recruiting him, Goddard visited Caltech. Unwillingto leave Roswell, Goddard requested that Caltech send Malina toRoswell to visit his facility, which Malina did in September.During Malina’s visit, Goddard was polite on the surface, but dis-played obvious tension. As Goddar d showed him ar ound, Malinarealized his host didn’t sho w anything of value. Malina knew rightaway that Goddard wanted another hand to do the hard work ratherthan a co-r esearcher. Malina r eturned to California disappointed.Goddard later refused a position at Caltech offered by Clark Millikan,probably understanding he would just be another scientist on a largecampus, rather than the head of his o wn program. In his memoir s,von Kármán made some rather negative comments about Goddard’sresearch suffering from self-imposed isolation.Back at Caltech, “the gr oup” was joined by three others: ApolloM.O. Smith (called “ Amo” b y his friends), Carlos C. W ood, andRudolph Schott, bringing the total to six. Smith was a Caltech studentlike Malina, and r egarded an eccentric since he constantly w ore apith helmet he modified by placing a small cooling fan on top. Woodand Schott were just a couple of guys from town who walked out tothe test site and offer ed their assistance . Schott’s red pickup truckbecame the gr oup’s standard means of tr ansporting test appar atus.There was also associated with the gr oup for a while an individualnamed Rockefeller (“Rocky”), but little mention of him e xists in therecords. Someone operated a motion picture camera during some ofthe tests; Rocky may well have been the camera operator.In September , 1936, Malina got a ne w r oommate: MartinSummerfield (1916–1996), a gr aduate student inter ested in r ockets12sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"who arriv ed at Caltech fr om Br ooklyn College in Ne w Y ork.Summerfield went on and made great advances in the field of liquidpropellants; the Summerfield Burning R ate Law is named after him.Summerfield became fast friends with Malina, as the tw o had manythings in common that Malina did not shar e with P arsons.

Aweek after Summerfield mo ved in, Malina learned that he shar edbirthdays with Parsons, one of the last discoveries they would enjoytogether as friends.13The Early Years: 1914–1936"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"14sex and rocketsParsons at left, and Ed Forman."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"twoParsons at Caltech: 1936–1939Halloween of 1936 pr oduced theevent which JPLstill refers to as its birth.

Even if the day signified fail-ure to F rank Malina, a photogr apher was present to get shots ofRudolph Schott, Amo Smith, Malina, Ed F orman, and John Parsonsposing with testing apparatus. Though the photo is referred to by JPLstaff as “the Nativity Scene ,” Carlos Wood, one of the r esearchers,failed to attend the apparently momentous gathering.Once a y ear, on JPL’s Open House for the public , the NativityScene is r ecreated with mannequins just behind the JPLVisitors’Center. For the 5 0th anniversary in 1986, JPLcontemplated hiringlive actors to portray the five founders. This event never material-ized, but the P arsons mannequin and four other s are stored at JPLtoday, stored for the ne xt Open House when the y’ll be put on dis-play. It seems ir onic that this Nativity Scene took place onHalloween in 1936, containing the likeness of a man who signed anoath stating he w as “the Antichrist.” Photogr aphs of the originalscene and the JPLrecreation are reproduced in the photo section ofthis volume. (It should be pointed out that the Nativity Scene cele-brates the test of liquid fuel, though the gr oup worked with bothsolid and liquid fuel at this time.)The day after the Nativity Scene, an incident occurred that Malinathought significant to r eport: One of the fuel hoses pulled fr ee, andthe fuel spilling out the end ignited. The hose started twisting andturning, a flaming serpent fr om which the y all r an for their liv es.After they composed themselv es, the gr oup regretted not capturingthe moment on film. Later tests fared somewhat better, but the groupstill measured success in ho w many secondsthe rocket fired. ByJanuary 16, 1937, they were up to 44 seconds.The test apparatus at Arroyo Seco was built with borrowed tanksand hoses, Forman later r ecalled. He machined the casing for thechamber himself and stated, “It w as a hand-to-mouth oper ationwhere you rented machine time for $2 an hour and did the w ork15Parso ns at Caltech: 1936–1939"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"yourself, in a day when wages were 25 cents an hour.” That’s half aday’s wages for one hour of shop time. Forman’s skill in this precisefield is what gave him his excellent reputation as a mechanic. He con-tinued to head the GALCIT/JPLmechanics department for as long ashe stayed with the group.The original schematic for the Nativity Scene test, is dr awn ontracing paper by Malina, who signed both his and Parsons’ names atthe bottom.

All three trials on thatsecond test day ended in failure. In his notes, Parsons remarked thathe should switch from rubber tubing to copper tubing to prevent thetubing from burning up during future tests.A third test, on November 28, yielded four burns of various dura-tion, the best of which w as 20 seconds. Parsons’ notes outline thevarious materials used in these tests , as w ell as their pr ocurementsources, as w ell as a r ecord of the test tak en January 16, 1937.Obviously these field notes are incomplete. The long periods of timebetween each test are due to von Kármán’s insistence that the groupanalyze each burn before they start another.While waiting, Parsons and Forman launched their o wn powderrockets. Malina wrote, “[T]heir attitude is symptomatic of the anxietyof pioneers of ne w technological de velopments. In or der to obtainsupport for their dr eams, they are under pr essure to demonstr atethem before they can be technically accomplished.”Par sons is mentioned in Malina’ s letters a couple of times duringthis period and the months follo wing. For the record, Malina wroteon November 21, 1936 that P arsons had the flu the pr evious week.Though the first successful test of a solid-fuel rocket motor took placein January 1937, Malina didn’t think much of it at the time , as it isnot even mentioned.The gr oup left the arroyonext April and mo ved on-campus atCaltech, located right in P asadena, where they worked out of one ofthe GALCITlab buildings. Only von Kármán would have been daringenough to let these unsophisticated r esearchers work on-campus. InMay, Hsue-shen Tsien, who had come fr om China on a scholar shipfunded by Boxer Rebellion reparations, began working with the group,sharing an office with Amo Smith. W eld Arnold, a meteor ology stu-dent, contributed b y presenting the gr oup with $1000 in small billswrapped in a ne wspaper. No one dar ed ask wher e he got them. Asmall fund w as opened at Caltech, and the mone y deposited.Curiously, at the end of the war there was still $300 left in the account.Arnold became the group’s unofficial photographer for a while, ridinghis bicycle at least 20 miles from Los Angeles every day.Campus residents soon resented the group’s presence. Testing wasloud and violent. Immediately after their arriv al on campus , thegroup met with their fir st disaster. In the lab the y had mounted arocket motor to a 50-foot pendulum. They measured the swing of the17Parso ns at Caltech: 1936–1939"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"pendulum to calculate the thrust pr oduced. The fir st motor testedexploded, filling the building with a cloud of meth yl alcohol andnitrogen dioxide. A thin layer of rust formed on many pieces of valu-able equipment thr oughout the lab . The other campus r esidentsstarted referring to the group as “the Suicide Squad.” Parsons wouldremember this event four years later, when he finally figur ed out away to put the volatility of red fuming nitric acid (RFNA) to good use.Von Kármán moved the group outside, adjacent to the lab, and hadthem rebuild the pendulum, this time making it fiv e times strongerthan thought necessary. Two years later the pendulum was destroyedagain during an explosion, when a piece of steel was hurled into thewall wher e Malina had been standing just minutes earlier.Fortunately, he had been called a way by von Kármán’s secretary onsome mundane matter concerning a typewriter. After this dangerousincident, back to the arroyothe group went.On March 22 there is another brief mention of Parsons in Malina’sletters, and on April 24 Malina r elated that Parsons was writing apaper “on the chemistry end of it.” This paper w as entitled “ AConsideration of the Practicality of Various Substances as Fuels forJet Propulsion.” The finished paper is dated June 19, 1937, and issigned “J. Parsons, Halifax Explosives Company.” Despite its origin,it was later classified by the government but has long been declassi-fied and is on file at the JPLarchives, the only paper in the archivesbearing Parsons’ name as the sole author. He was co-author on sev-eral other papers, but this one was his alone.The paper begins:In considering the practicality of various fuels and oxidizers forrockets, cer tain criteria apply which ar e not met with in or dinaryinternal combustion motor problems.Since rocket per formance is influenced by the ratio of fuelweight to total weight, and since the r ocket must car ry all theoxidizer necessar y for combustion, the ratio of total weight offuel and oxidizer to the available ener gy is of utmost impor-tance. Since mass per unit flow is also impor tant, a high spe-cific gravity is preferred.In addition, or dinary considerations of safety , availability, costand convenient physical state should not be neglected.Par sons was saying that the fuel must be dense to pack a r ealpunch, and be powerful enough to lift its own weight as well as that18sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"of the rocket and the cargo it may be carrying. This seemingly obvi-ous statement is one that ne vertheless must be made at the start ofanalysis. In the paper , Parsons presents five tables of v arious fuelswith some algebraic calculations and chemical equations determiningvarious pr operties of each. These calculations mak e it clear thatPar sons was no amateur r ocket hobbyist. He was, as everyone said,the theoretician of the group, even if he was an impatient theoretician.Par sons had obvious mathematical and scientific kno wledge to backup his assertions . Malina specialized in differ ential calculus, whichdoes not appear in the work of Parsons.Par sons’ first table looks at the explosive gases acetylene, butane,butyne, hydrogen, and methane. He dismisses acetylene as inherentlydangerous, without carrying out the calculations of combustive prop-erties. He further mentions potential pr oblems with h ydrogen andmethane. Liquid o xygen is not e ven in the table , as Parsons elimi-nates it from calculations altogether as being too dangerous. He wasright about this for decades . Only when the safe handling of liquidoxygen was finally perfected did it r eplace the liquid fuel combina-tions that Parsons himself would help perfect.Table IIcontains the liquid h ydrocarbons methyl alcohol, eth ylalcohol, propargyl, benzol, eth yl ether, and heptane . All had gr eatavailability, were cheap and easy to handle, but all had a low energycontent.Table IIIcontains self-combustibles (explosives) such as gunpow-der, etc., the energy content of which was low compared to gases andliquids, and which were difficult to handle. With a few precautions,Par sons added, the y might be r endered useful. P arsons even men-tioned that the y might be “moulded or pr essed into sticks ,” whichwas the seed of an idea that would later lead to success.Table IVaddresses metal organics and hybrids. Little was knownabout them, Parsons said, and the y were costly to handle and diffi-cult to prepare. One of them, trimeth yl aluminum, is spontaneouslyinflammable in air . Parsons believed they were worthy of furtherinvestigation, though nothing seems to have come of it.Table Vis labeled “Various Elements” and contains figures for alu-minum, boron, carbon, lithium, and magnesium. P arsons thoughtthey may have some value when blended with other substances, forwhich aluminum was already being used in the field of e xplosives.Par sons further thought the energy obtained from such blends couldbe used indirectly to heat another substance, such as water.There is also a sixth table, which lists not fuels but oxidizers, sub-19Parso ns at Caltech: 1936–1939"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The cover of Astronauticsuses a schematic diagram of Parsons’,Forman’s and Malina’s GALCITliquid fuel research set-up."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"stances introduced into a chemical pr ocess to speed combustion.Much experimentation remained to be done with o xidizers, Parsonsconcluded. The 13-page paper contains six appendices sho wing val-ues for different materials obtained thr ough actual experimentationby Par sons and others. These appendices represent the real-world fol-low-up to the theoretical calculations showed in the first part of thereport. The appendices reflects not only the up-front calculations butalso actual tests of fuel mixtur es at Halifax. Documenting each steprepresents a lengthy but necessary pr ocess. No definite conclusionswere reached, but Parsons always saw in each experiment the begin-ning of another. Each test led to ne w ideas for him, and he ne verstopped thinking.Malina credits Parsons’ paper with the development of red fumingnitric acid as a storable oxidizer. He also pointed out that Parsons firstanticipated the use of bor on hydride as a fuel in this paper , puttinghim ahead of his time. The key, as von Kármán said, was to make thefuel burn slowly. In armaments applications the fuel w as burned asquickly as possible . Parsons and F orman had to unlearn this tech-nique and find a new one.When the term ended the next month, Malina paid Parsons a visit.On May 22—before the paper w as actually finished, Malina wr ote,“Antelope Valley, near New Hall—This weekend I accepted an invi-tation of Jack Parsons to spend at the house he has r ented near thepowder company for which he w orks. Jack’s wife [Helen] is her ewhich ensures good meals. We are about 40 miles from Pasadena inthe foothills.”Antelope Valley is the curr ent site of Edw ards Air Force Base—alarge valley—and it is uncertain if the po wder company Halifax, forwhich Parsons labored, was anywhere near the base. Several explo-sives companies came from Antelope Valley, all conveniently remotefrom the city. John and Helen Parsons must not have lived there verylong, for the P asadena city dir ectories show them living at 168 S.Terrace Drive from 1937 to 1940. Perhaps they retained the house atS. Terrace, which they owned, and rented the house intermittently inAntelope Valley until Parsons finished his paper in June.While writing the paper, Parsons commuted back to P asadena todo additional testing with GALCIT. That group achieved its best resultsyet in May, running a motor for longer than a minute . However, thegraduate students finished their term and summer arrived and driftedaway. Malina and Tsien focused on doctorate programs. Weld went toNew York. Those who stayed behind collected their papers on rocketry21Parso ns at Caltech: 1936–1939"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"into what the y called “the Bible ,” copies of which e xist in the JPLarchives. Parsons’ paper was among the half-dozen or so in the volume.Around this time , Parsons and Malina started to write “ a novelwith an anti-war plot” that w as also supposed to serv e as a mo vietreatment. The manuscript is fr amed in anti-capitalist beliefs , withMalina documenting his own struggles with corporate culture and thecoming war in Eur ope. Some writer s have claimed the manuscriptwas some sort of sci-fi story about a flight to the moon, or about evilrocket scientists. This is not the case.The original script is in the possession of Marjorie Malina, Frank’swidow. It is untitled and bear s no author’s name, and is entir ely inMalina’s handwriting. Malina’s memoirs make it clear that P arsonswas a collabor ator and that Malina w orked on the manuscript atPar sons’ house. Indeed, Malina expressed being nervous about beingaround the tetr anitromethane in P arsons’ kitchen—a chemical thatPar sons was collecting though the army decided it was too dangerousto use due to its connection to se veral deaths. Because of its r arity,Par sons was stockpiling the stuff rather than disposing of it, and alsohad enough gunpo wder hoarded “to blo w up a city block”—thisaccording to Ed Forman’s first wife, who probably was not exagger-ating. The gunpowder was in an open barrel on the back porch. AfterPar sons’ death, Malina wr ote that “Parsons’ familiarity with e xplo-sives led to contempt.”The 38-page handwritten synopsis of the script is full of cr ossed-out passages and other editing marks , indicating that the tw o menbrainstormed together as Malina set it all to paper. The story is abouta group of rocket scientists—obviously based on themselves and theirassociates at Caltech—who are struggling to carry out pur e researchwhile other factions have more selfish aims for their work—anti-cap-italist at almost every turn. The character based on Forman is a unionorganizer. The intellectual characters (and even their mechanics) areall philosophical heavies. The “bad guys” are all big industrial typesand those who cater to them. The story is full of side stories involv-ing love interests and the like. It is also eerily prophetic.The character based on Parsons is named “Theophile Belvedere,”whose description sho ws insight (and possibly a little humor) onPar sons’ part. Belvedere is “a mystic who speaks for religion and theorganized church.” He is “extremely fanatical and is to used to add asinister effect to the plot.” His description is worth quoting verbatim,but it should be k ept in mind that the manuscript w as an obviousfirst draft never taken beyond this stage.22sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Theophile Belvedere is a tall slightly stooped, r osy cheeked manwith a face whose lines continuously change fr om those of joy tothose of miser y.

Thefamily is on r elief. Belvedere, having an M.S. degr ee in science,applies for a public school teaching position in the Rock HighSchool. He is accepted and becomes a teacher of general science.Near the end of the story, Belvedere accidentally blows himself uptrying to stop one of his e xperiments—it should be noted that thisstory was written 15 years before Parsons died the same way, an eerieprophecy. Further, the char acter based on T sien gets sent back toChina under suspicion of communism and dr ops out of touch withthe others, an incident that also later occurr ed. Many of those whoremain are investigated for their anti-capitalistic political beliefs, andMalina’s greatest fear—that their w ork would be used for w artimeapplications—also came true. In the story it is a rich inv estor whoactually sells their secrets to the Nazis and Fascists.Included with the manuscript is another movie treatment, some ofwhich is typed on MGMletterhead. Further handwritten technicaldescriptions (and illustrations) were composed in Malina’s hand. Thetyped portion is dated June 17, 1937 and entitled “Shado w of theWing,” bearing Malina’s name as author. The treatment appears to bea different movie project entirely, one that an “M. Balcon” at MGMwas evidently considering. “Shado w of the Wing” is the story of a23Parso ns at Caltech: 1936–1939"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"mock bomber mission from Australia to London that goes awry.

Both storiesnever went beyond a pr eliminary stage, the fir st due to a suddeninflux of funding for the r ocket pr oject, the second for r easonsunknown. Lack of interest on MGM’s part, perhaps?On July 4, 1937, Malina wrote, “For our ‘fourth,’ Parsons and I aregoing to make some tests with a powder rocket motor,” which soundslike a suitable way to celebrate both the Fourth of July and the com-pletion of Parsons’ paper just a few days earlier. On the 26th Malinawrote, “Parsons and I y esterday discussed the possibility of seeingGoddard again. Perhaps he and wife and I would drive to Roswell inhis car, he to return while I go on to Texas . . .” They did not makethe trip. The wording suggests that Parsons had visited Goddard pre-viously, but such a trip is not recorded elsewhere.As the months proceeded, Malina focused on his doctor al thesis,which he had been postponing for some time . Work on the thesismoved him closer to Summerfield and further fr om Parsons. Malinanext refers to the rocket project a full five months later, on December18. “Parsons wants to mak e some tests this w eekend” was all thatMalina wrote, causing one to w onder why he e ven mentioned it.Later that December Malina lectur ed the local Sigma Xi chapter on“Facts and Fancies of Rockets.” And the group made the newspaperson January 26, 1938, when Malina and Smith tr aveled to New Yorkto present a paper to the Institute of A eronautical Sciences. ClarkMillikan had convinced the school to put up $2 00 for the trip—Caltech’s first direct financial support of the pr oject. That da y inJanuary, articles appear ed in the New York Timesand the HoustonChronicle, as w ell as in the Los Angeles Times, New York Herald-Tribune, and Timemagazine.The story begins, “A scheme for shooting an exploratory rocket toa height of 967 miles abo ve the earth w as unfolded today before aconvention of aer onautical engineers.” Malina and Smith told theconvention “the idea works in theory . . . whether it will work in factdepends on the efficiency of the rocket.” They proposed a three-stagerocket with a maximum velocity of 11,000 miles per hour. As a resultof the publicity , a Ne w York stuntman w anted to ride a r ocket up1000 feet and par achute down at county fair s, and one Hollyw oodradio station wanted to broadcast the sound of a rocket motor firing.On February 2, 1938, the Caltech student paper California Techprinted an article on rockets written by Malina with the help of Smithand Tsien. In April of 1938, the Associated Pr ess released an item24sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"about the group’s work that is worth quoting verbatim, as it is con-tains valuable information unrecorded in Malina’s letters.

A gyro-scope may help meet this dif ficulty.“Our aim is to devise a r ocket which will carry scientific instru-ments to heights of about 500,000 feet, far above those r eachedby sounding balloons. The record for a sounding balloon, I believe,is 110,000 feet.

The APitem spawned several more newspaper articles aboutthe group’s work, but Malina lamented all the fuss, as is evidenced bythe conspicuous absence of rocket travel from the above quote.

On October 24, 1938, Malina wrote, “A ‘big shot’ fromthe Army Ordnance division was here today.

I silently r ejoiced, ho weverPar sons, who is about broke, was not so happy about it, as he hopedto get some funds for research from the army.”This sour ce of funding became another contentious point, asMalina was against all military applications of his w ork. He w asinterested in civilian inno vations only—namely, scientific applica-tions that would benefit mankind, as well as possibly (eventually) animproved means of travel. Parsons was interested in the end result—working rockets—and wasn’t concerned about how he got there. Asit turned out, both Malina and the “big shot” were wrong—there weremilitary applications for rockets just around the corner.At one point Malina was invited to visit Ruben Fleet, President ofthe Consolidated Aircraft Company in San Diego, who gave Malina atour and asked him about the possibility of rocket-assisted takeoffs of“big, heavy planes.” Malina left, intrigued, but nothing came of themeeting until thr ee years later, after Parsons had spent some mor etime experimenting. In fact, seaplanes were not fitted with JATOs until1943 and they were liquid-fueled.Malina also prepared a scientific paper for a contest in France thatwas sponsored by André Louis Hirsch, a banker with an above-aver-age interest in rocketry. The contest was to award a cash prize to thebest paper on current issues in the field. Malina won, but because ofthe war he did not learn of his prize until 1946—far too late for thewinnings to help the pr oject. Tsien appears to ha ve helped Malinawith the award-winning paper, though it bor e Malina’s name solelyas author.At this time, an interesting reversal of responsibility is recorded inMalina’s letters home, in which he had written that P arsons andForman “disappear for weeks or months sometimes with me tryingto keep the project alive. They were working for the powder compa-nies and testing their own rockets during these times.” Malina tookother time-consuming jobs, including wind-tunnel studies and a soilconservation project. Such outside endea vors increased tension inthe group. Four months later, in a letter dated F ebruary 19, 1939,Malina wrote, “Parsons is doing some experiments with powder andis disgusted with me for not putting mor e time in to the r esearch.”The results of the powder experiments were written up by Parsons,29Parso ns at Caltech: 1936–1939"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"who shar ed a b yline with F orman in issue 43 of Astronautics.Certainly this b yline was merely a courtes y, as the article is obvi-ously Parsons’ work.The title of the article is “Experiments with P owder Motors forRocket Propulsion by Successive Impulses.” Like Parsons’ previouspaper, it w as classified during the w ar, though the article w as pre-sumably still in circulation. The article begins with an editorial com-ment from the publisher to the effect that “the American R ocketSociety belie ves the liquid fuel r ocket motor has v ery definitelyproven its superiority over powder motors . . .” This assertion wouldbe proven wrong in two years’ time.The article, the technical analysis of which leaves little doubt thatPar sons was the author, starts with a discussion of Goddar d’s workfrom 1919 forward and includes Goddard’s early results with rocketsusing black po wder as a fuel, a method b y which he w as able toachieve altitudes of 8000 feet, i.e., a mile-and-a-half up. Parsons thengoes into a detailed explanation of his own test apparatus, includingvery e xact specifications used to construct his r ocket motor s.Hercules black powder alone was used in the first series of tests, anddifferent results were obtained for differ ent degrees of compression(i.e., how densely the po wder was packed into the r ocket). Otherpowders were used in the r emaining experiments, including smoke-less varieties, and different types of wads were used at the bottom tohold the fuel in. Most char ges were ignited by an electric wir e runthrough this wadding and into the fuel source.Par sons concludes the article with the assertion that po wder wasindeed efficient enough to pursue further. Indeed, he and Forman gotrockets to r each velocities of 7150 feet per second (4875 miles perhour) in this series of tests , which appr oached what Goddar d hadachieved 20 years earlier. Parsons said they were working on an ero-sion-resistant insert of special steel as w ell as a satisfactory methodof measuring chamber pressures. Erosion was often a problem withthe throat nozzle—the part of the rocket from which the burning fuelleaves the r ocket and pushes it up. In the article , Parsons thankedMalina, Tsien, a Mr. Spade of the Ludlum Steel Compan y, and a Mr.Henry N. Mar sh of the Her cules P owder Compan y, which w asPar sons’ original emplo yer from 1932. A t the time the article w aswritten, Parsons was employed by Halifax Explosives.Around this time some mone y finally came thr ough, and theschool received a $10,000 grant to work on solid-fuel rockets, basedon the gr oup’s progress. About this time , Fritz Zwicky, who had30sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"taken graduate courses under Einstein, scolded Malina for thinkingthat a rocket could ever fly in space, asking how the exhaust couldpush against a v acuum. What Zwicky didn’t r ealize was that dis-placement of mass w as all that w as needed. On Mar ch 13 Malinawrote, “Parsons and Forman are to work full time and earn enoughmoney to affor d smoking r eady-rolled cigar ettes. P arsons’ wife[Helen] will be happ y that she is not the only br eadwinner in thefamily.” Parsons’ good friend Rypinski related much the same thing,that Helen would “cry on his shoulder” that Parsons would only savehis money for rockets, and not spend it on her.This stroke of financial luck was the result of a visit by H.H. “Hap”Arnold, commanding general of the Arm y Air Corps. Arnold was asharp individual who would work with von Kármán for many yearsafter the w ar, and alw ays on the look out for some ne w scientificdevelopment to be used for military applications . Unlik e theprevious military “big shot” who visited, Arnold w as intrigued b ythe possible uses for r ockets. Ed F orman, for instance , r ecalledArnold’s suggestion that rockets might help airplanes tak e off whilebeing as much as 50% over payload.Arnold had w orked with v on Kármán befor e. Though Arm yOrdnance was against exploring the possibilities of rockets, Hap wasless conv entional, and had tak en Malina and v on Kármán toWashington the year previously on an unrelated matter. He knew tal-ent when he saw it and convinced the National Academy of Sciences’Committee on Air Corps Research to fund the grant. Von Kármán andRobert Millikan were both members of the committee , which madeArnold’s job much easier . There were actually se veral aeronauticsprojects being funded at this time, but the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology (MIT) avoided the rocket project, opting to w orking onthe problem of deicing air craft windshields. “Kármán can tak e theBuck Rogers job” said the head of their aer onautics department.Kármán was glad he did and later called the project “one of the mostfascinating periods of my career.”On April 18, 1939, a pr oposal w as submitted to the Boar d ofDirectors at Caltech entitled, “Pr oposal for a Jet Pr opulsionExperimental Station at the Guggenheim A eronautical Laboratory ofthe California Institute of Technology.” The draft I have seen has thetitle “Chairman, Subcommittee for Jet Pr opulsion Research” belowthe signature block. Presumably this “Chairman” w as von Kármán,though the work is probably Malina’s.

The group itself fabricated the buildings from tim-bers and other items found in the arroyo, a “complex” that was a farcry from the 6000-employee facility JPLof today. In his memoir, vonKármán says he originally obtained the land, countering F orman’ssimilar, and perhaps exaggerated, claim.In the follo wing months, Parsons and F orman are mentioned inpassing in several Malina letters, and both earn a longer mention inhis letter of A ugust 21 when a lar ge explosion hit the building the ywere working in on campus . The explosion occurred at 8:20 in themorning, “too early for Parsons and Forman to be at work,” causing$10,000 in damage to the building—the entire value of the grant. Theexplosion caused an unr ecognizable film to deposit itself on e very-thing in the building, and when Parsons and Forman finally arrived,the Caltech staff were waiting for them with cleaning rags, expectingthe two to clean it up. As had happened after the e xplosion of 1937,the group was soon working back in the arroyo.On October 21, Parsons and Forman received invitations to a staffdinner at the Athenaeum, but old, social prejudices arose when theypresented themselv es at the door . “You tw o ar en’t Caltech staff.You’re from town,” they were told by the overzealous doorman, whowouldn’t let them in despite their invitations. About this time Malinaarrived and convinced the man the pair should be let in just thisonce, to save face for Caltech, claiming he would ensure that the mis-take of inviting them w ould not be made again. The doorman w asswayed, and the two were finally allowed to enter.On No vember 26, 1939, the magazine supplement to the LosAngeles Sunday Timesran an article on Parsons, Forman and Malinafeaturing a photogr aph of the fir st two, stating that the thr ee “aretired of explaining they are not trying to build a rocket ship for initi-ation of the fir st airline tour s to the moon.” Their goal, the articlesaid, was the exploration of the properties of near space. No mentionof Hap Arnold’ s project was made, but other scientists’ ideas onaccomplishing this exploratory feat were also discussed.

When P arsons rummaged thr oughRypinski’s library he found a cop y of Aleister Cr owley’s Konx OmPax, published in 1907, which Rypinski had bought years earlier. Thediscovery, Rypinski said, was to Parsons “like real water to a thirstyman.” Rypinksi himself never had figured out the rather dense book,so he gave it to Parsons, who soon told him he had entered into cor-respondence with its author.Although recorded in se veral places, including Nat F reedland’sThe Occult Explosionand Sybil Leek’s Diary of a Witch, the story isuntrue that Crowley had once been in Pasadena long enough to starta lodge for his mystical order, the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO). In real-ity, Crowley did make a brief stopover in Los Angeles in 19 15—andcouldn’t wait to leave. Not until 20 years later would there be an offi-cial representative of the OTOin the ar ea, namely Wilfr ed TalbotSmith, at whose home P arsons was to present himself shortly afterhis discovery of Cr owley. It seems mor e than coincidental that theonly lodge of the OTOwas located within a fe w miles of P arsons’home. Some familiarity with the magus Cr owley (1875–1947) will beassumed throughout the remainder of this book, though I will elabo-rate on the elements of his work that have a direct bearing upon thework of John P arsons. Readers wishing to learn about Cr owley arereferred to the works listed in the bibliogr aphy; however, a satisfac-tory biography of the powerful and enigmatic Crowley remains to bepublished.Crowley’s Los Angeles representative, Smith, was from Tonbridge,Kent, about 2 0 miles southeast of London. He started his magicalcareer as a member of the original Agape Lodge in Vancouver, BritishColumbia—the fir st North American lodge of the OTO—of which“Frater A chad” (Charles Stansfeld Jones , 1885–195 0) w as thefounder. Smith had met Crowley at the Agape Lodge in 1915, duringthe latter’s second American tour, and had soon risen to a position ofgreater authority in the Lodge , as A chad (Hebrew for “Unity”) fellinto disfavor with Crowley and was eventually expelled for a variety33Parso ns at Caltech: 1936–1939"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"of heresies. Smith mo ved to Los Angeles in 193 0, and, upon hisarrival, began w orking on r eopening the A gape Lodge, sometimesreferred to as Agape Lodge #2.Smith’s colleague was Regina Kahl, who served as his High Priestessof the Gnostic Mass. The two are said to have run the Agape Lodge verystrictly, almost tyr annically. Separ ate photos of K ahl and Smith ar ereproduced in Crowley’s OTOpublication, The Equinox, vol. III, no. 10.The Gnostic Mass was Crowley’s replacement for the “corrupted”mass celebr ated b y the R oman Catholic and Eastern Orthodo xchurches. The text of the Mass, referred to as Liber XV, was writtenin Moscow in 1913. Partly inspired by the Russian Orthodox Mass, itis surprisingly Christian in its s ymbology, and ther e is nothingobscene about it despite what certain detractors may say. In fact, it isreminiscent of W agner’s Par sifalwith its r epeated r eferences to“lance” and “Grail,” which are its most suggestiv e elements. As inthe Christian Mass, the Holy Spirit is invoked often. The most openlyerotic element in the mass occurs when the priestess disrobes for partof the ceremony.The Gnostic Mass is too long to reproduce here but may be foundin its entirety in Crowley’s book, Magick. It is also r eprinted in sec-tion IVof Gems from the Equinox, edited by Israel Regardie, and TheEquinoxvol. III, no. 10, as well as various locations on the internet.It would have been inter esting to see what Cr owley and the OTOwould ha ve done with the Gnostic Libr ary disco vered at NagHammadi by Egyptian Bedouins in 1945, two years before Crowley’sdeath. However, the library was not published until 1978; thus , theMass was not influenced by any of its previously unknown texts.Originally intended by Crowley as the central ceremony of the OTO,both public and priv ate, the Gnostic Mass is a rite conducted toda yby the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica(“ECG”—the Gnostic CatholicChurch) and celebr ated regularly in major cities ar ound the w orld.Evidently, visitors are usually welcome, provided they are willing topartake of the gnostic eucharist. The EGCis a religious body whosehistory and structure overlap that of the OTO.Par sons became involved with the OTOwhen an unknown scien-tific colleague took the r ocketeer to a meeting at Smith’ s house inHollywood, after which Parsons and his wife, Helen, began attendingthe various meetings of the lodge, as well as the weekly performanceof the Gnostic Mass .

These claims are very helpful, for they aidin placing the OTOwithin a proper historical context, as we can guessmuch about it fr om its spiritual for ebears. However, it is also desir-able to learn about the secular origins of the OTOas well.The Order traces its modern origins to tw o men: Carl K ellner andTheodor Reuss (pronounced “Royce”). Kellner, born September 1, 1851,was a wealthy Austrian industrialist who had made a good bit of mone yas a paper chemist. Reuss was born June 28, 1855 in Augsburg, Germany,about 15 miles northwest of Munich. Both men were born not long afterthe German Revolution of 1848, and thus lived in a world of Prussian mil-itary expansion. Borders changed often during their lifetimes. At variouspoints throughout the men’s lives, Austria and Germany were intermit-tently a part of Prussia, then a major w estern power.Reuss became a Mason in 1876, and w as also a singer, journalistand possible sp y for the Prussian police . It is alleged that he infil-trated the Socialist League founded by Karl Marx’s daughter and herhusband. It is inter esting to note ho w many famous occultists ar esaid to have had connections with intelligence organizations, the mil-itary, and the police , such as R euss, Crowley, Parsons, John Dee ,Grady McMurtry, Anton LaVey, Michael Aquino, to name a few.Reuss was also w orking on a r evival of the Ba varian Illuminati,dispersed nearly 1 00 years earlier, and w as at the same time theGrand Master of the S wedenborgian Rite in German y, as w ell as aMagus of the Societas Rosicruciana (“Rosicrucian Society”).37A Short History of the OTO"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Kellner was an initiate of the influential Hermetic Br otherhood ofLight (HBL), founded by P.B.

Thereader desiring mor e information on the Hermetic Br otherhood ofLight is directed to Allen Greenfield’s published history of the order,listed in the bibliography herein.Kellner was also a high-r anking Freemason and a student of theEastern mysteries. In the 1890s , Kellner claimed to ha ve met thr eeadepts from the East. One was a Sufi, Soliman ben Aifa, and the othertwo were Hindu tantrik as, Bhima Sena Pr atapa of Lahor e, and SriMahatma Agamya Paramahamsa. After their meeting, Kellner allegedhe had found a “K ey” (German: Schlüssel) to “the My steries,” theheart of esoteric rites.The word KEYturns up so many times in the telling of this tale thatit reminds one of the pulp publisher Ray Palmer, who always said hehad a FACTwhich proved the validity of Richard Shaver’s wild Derotales. It’s as if the word itself has a hidden meaning. Kellner’s Key, ofcourse, was sex magic; perhaps the implication was key-in-lock sex-ual symbolism.In 1895, Kellner proposed to Reuss that they disseminate this new-found Key thr ough an or ganized masonic rite . Kellner planned areformation of the Hermetic Br otherhood of Light in German y, aseries of three degrees that would be open only to the highest-r ank-ing masons. Reuss used his masonic connections to acquire the 90thand 96th degrees of the Ancient and Primitiv e Rite of Memphis andMizraim, and the 33r d degree of the Ancient and A ccepted ScottishRite, from John Yarker, a masonic historian in England.

In reading some of the other chapter s (15, e.g.) in TheBook of Lies, it is difficult to believe that Crowley did not at least sus-pect the Key before his meeting with Reuss.Regardless, Crowley was given the IX° in 1912, and the entire writ-ten corpus of the Or der was at his disposal. He w ould soon r ewritealmost everything within it to bring it into line with his o wn magicaldiscoveries. On April 21, 1912, Crowley was given the X° and authorityover the entire British Isles. His own magical record says he learned theKey in June of that year, in actuality a reference to when he translatedthe documents from German into English. In 19 16, Crowley appointedCharles Stansfeld Jones, whom we have already met as Frater Achad, tobe his Viceroy to North America. Jones’ X° name was Parzival. On May10, 1921, Reuss chartered Jones as Head of the OTOfor North America,but Crowley overturned this action after succeeding Reuss.Too many other charters and degrees were granted by the OTOtorelate here. One of interest, although not part of our story, was to H.Spencer Lewis, founder of the Ancient and Mystical Order of the RosyCross (A.M.O.R.C.), i.e., “the Rosicrucians.” Lewis was given a docu-ment referred to as a “Gage of Amity” in 192 1, and his mail-or dermystery school San Jose , California, still thriv es toda y, e videntlywithout possessing the Key.In 1917, Crowley rewrote the OTOdegrees again, especially thelower ones, removing most of the masonic material and r eplacing itwith thelema(explained below). Reuss was in agreement, but otherlodges would not be . In 192 0, Reuss translated Crowley’s GnosticMass into German and began to tr anslate Liber ALas well, until hehad a stroke in the spring of that year. Crowley then assumed an act-ing role as head of the OTOuntil November 27, 1921, at which time40sex and rockets3. Some sources say it was 1913, which means there is a discrepancy in Crowley’s account.Perhaps Reuss saw the book while it was still in manuscript for m."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"he proclaimed himself “Outer Head of the Order.” Jones and anotherX° initiate, Heinrich Tranker of the German Pansophiagroup, con-firmed his position. Reuss died on October 28, 1923.There were other orders that, although not a part of the OTO, wereofficially associated with it, man y of which w ere not pr epared toaccept thelemawhen it was finally revealed to them by Crowley at aGerman conference in 1925. Readers interested in the histories of thevarious orders and br eakaway groups are referred to The Equinox,vol. III, no. 10, and the various online histories of the Order.As noted, in 19 14 the A gape Lodge had been founded inVancouver by Jones, AKAAchad/Parzival, under Crowley’s authority.Crowley visited the lodge in 19 15, at which time he met Wilfr edSmith, who had been a charter member of the Agape Lodge. The twogot along well at that point.Fifteen years later, in 1930, Crowley sent Smith to Los Angeles withthe express intent of opening another lodge , also to be called A gapeLodge. The lodge was incorporated April 4, 1934, and its first meetingwas held on September 21, 1935 in Hollywood. Smith was appointedas “Head” for the United States, for which office he bore the X° name“Ramaka.”In 1941, Grady McMurtry (October 18, 1918–July 12, 1985) was firstinitiated into the OTOby Wilfred Smith at Agape Lodge No. 2. In 1943,Crowley gr anted McMurtry the IX° and the magical motto of“Hymenaeus Alpha,” in England, wher e the latter was stationed dur-ing the war. McMurtry worked with Army Ordnance during World WarII, served in Korea and retired a major. Today he is better rememberedas the second Caliph of the OTO, while Karl Germer was the first Caliph,though he never used that term. The thir d Caliph, Hymenaeus Beta,has been Outer Head of the Order since McMurtry’s death in 1985.The gr ades of the Or do Templi Orientis ha ve r ather inv olvednames and echo the grades of various masonic rites, as well as thoseof the Bavarian Illuminati.

The fiv elower grades correspond to the “ chakras,” i.e., yogic/tantric energycenters, as well as to the “naked-eye” planets. Higher degrees are byinvitation only. Most people are surprised to learn the VII°requires avow of chastity. There is also an XI° that is not part of the formalstructure but was developed by Crowley.As noted, Crowley rewrote the OTOdegrees, replacing the masonicmaterial with what he called “thelema.” Thelema is the Gr eek for“will,” a word important in the work of Aleister Crowley for severalreasons. In 1904, Cr owley “received” The Book of the La w, techni-cally called Liber ALvel Legis, through the mediumship of his fir stwife, Rose Kelly, while the couple was in Cairo celebrating their hon-eymoon. The book was allegedly dictated by a discarnate entity call-ing himself Aiwass, also spelled Aiwaz before Crowley changed it fornumerological reasons.One of the precepts contained in The Book of the Law(abbreviated“AL”) is, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the la w” (see ALIII:13). Its oft-cited complement is, “Love is the law, love under will.”These two precepts are standard salutations for members of the OTOeven toda y. The w ords for “will” and “lo ve” in Gr eek—thelema(θελημα) and agape(αγαπη), respectively—each have numerical val-ues of 93, a number important in Crowley’s system of magick.These phrases carry with them a great duty to live deliberately, tofind one’s True Will and then do itand nothing else. Outsiders ofteninterpret them as invitations to “free love,” but that definition is notnecessarily so. Ho wever, the w ord agapeis a r eference not only to“charitable love” but also to the “lo ve feasts” of the second-centuryChristians, especially as interpreted by the Christian Gnostics, whichdid include a se xual meaning. The A gape Lodge w as not called“Agape” for nothing.A Rosicrucian or der, the Golden Da wn—used as the basis forCrowley’s “Astrum ×Argenteum” magick al gr ading s ystem—wasmodeled more after the mystery schools of the ancients, with the pur-pose of taking the candidate for initiation thr ough a series of m ysti-cal exercises and ritual ceremonies.42sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Around 1887, a manuscript in cipher was found in a bookstore bya Dr. Woodman and/or Woodford.

The English were on their own for now, but they felt assuredthat they had already received sufficient information to place them incontact with the mysterious “Secret Chiefs” of the Order.Subsequently W oodman died, and in 1897 W estcott steppeddown. Mathers began claiming to ha ve made contact with thr ee ofthe Secret Chiefs, a doubtful assertion. Mather s also soon started towork on his greatest achievement, the translation of The Book of theSacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, which he had found in manu-script in a P aris library, the Bibliotheque l’Arsenal. This documentexplains how one may attain to the “Knowledge and Conversation ofthe Holy Guardian Angel.”Crowley w as initiated into the Or der of the Golden Da wn onNovember 18, 1898, at the age of 23. This was his first initiation, andhe took it with all seriousness. Many famous writers were also mem-bers of the Golden Dawn: Arthur Edward Waite, William Butler Yeats,and Arthur Machen, to name a fe w.

A broad, religious order modeled after theRosicrucians, the Golden Dawn, and subsequently Crowley’s A∴A∴,are designed to bring the student to full spiritual potential in all areas.The OTO, on the other hand, was conceived as a specialized rite toconvey the Key that Kellner had discovered in the East.

For example, the Secretaryof the Smithsonian Institution, Dr. C.G. Abbot, stated:A few hundr ed thousand dollars invested today in the scientificdevelopment of rockets would pay the nation dividends amountingto hundreds of millions of dollars in the next two decades.World-renowned pilot Charles Lindbergh opined:The rocket offers the only known possibility of sending instrumentsto altitudes above those r eached by sounding balloons.Observations taken outside of the ear th’s atmosphere or even inthe higher levels of the atmosphere, would be of immense value inthe study of such subjects as astr onomy, meteorology and terres-trial magnetism.And Dr. John O . Ste wart, Associate Pr ofessor of Astr onomicalPhysics, Princeton University, declared:With rockets speeds of 1000 miles per hour are possible by 1950.By 2050 a rocket trip to the moon at 25,000 miles per hour is notimpossible.Despite such open-mindedness in the w orld at lar ge, within theGALCITgroup, all was not well, and Malina found reason to complainabout Parsons and Forman again in a letter of April 7, 1940. The com-plaint had nothing to do with P arsons’ ne wfound inter est in theoccult, which Forman seems to have shared to a lesser degree. Malinahad his o wn unorthodoxies, including communism.

The break between the two was complete, althoughPar sons may not have realized it. Parsons remained with Forman, butMalina was with Summerfield, who joined the group that July. Later,Forman’s widow would relate that her husband and Parsons thoughtMalina was unnecessarily “cold and arrogant” toward them.In August 1940, Popular Mechanicsdevoted six pages to the workof Parsons and F orman in an article entitled, “Seeking P ower forSpace Rockets,” which is informativ e and well-illustrated. Malina isalso mentioned but not pictured.

Only P arsons andForman are featured, which speaks well to their level of involvementat this time. While Malina was head of the project in name by virtueof his status at Caltech, Parsons and Forman were the ones doing thedirty work.Also in 1940, the United States started sending ammunition andsupplies to England, embar going Japan. Pr esident Franklin DelanoRoosevelt and his Congress increased defense spending 800%, fr om$1.9 billion to $17 billion. Von Kármán began making frequent tripsto Washington, D.C, trips that w ould continue throughout the war.The city of Pasadena had 13,300 people working in the aircraft indus-try that year, a figure that may sound like a lot, but by the next year—after the United States entered the war—it had increased to 113,000.In order to recruit so many workers, Boy Scouts were hired to dis-tribute job applications door-to-door.In that year, von Kármán and Malina demonstrated on paper thefeasibility of long-dur ation burns in a confined space such as arocket motor casing, a procedure that von Kármán later listed as thefirst critical step in the development of rockets in the United States.As a result, the National Academy of Sciences immediately doubledthe GALCITgroup’s budget for 194 1, to $22,000. This action infuri-ated Goddard, working alone in Roswell, as he didn’t appreciate theyoung upstarts getting all the funding and attention.

One of the peo-ple in P arsons’ new esoteric cir cle of friends w as the actr ess JaneWolfe, who had appeared in the silent films, The Woman Next Door(1919), Men, Women and Money(1919), and Behold My Wife(1920).Wolfe, who had chosen the magical name Soror Estai, had been withCrowley at Cefalu (his “ Abbey of Thelema” in Italy) befor e comingback to California and the A gape Lodge, when Mussolini closed theAbbey. After her return she does not appear in any of the film guides.Adding to the Parsons’ legend, Wolfe recorded her first impression ofhim in her “magical record” for December 1940:Unknown to me, John Whiteside Parsons, a newcomer , beganastral travels. This knowledge decided Regina [Kahl] to under takesimilar work. All of which I lear ned after making my own decision.So the time must be propitious.Incidentally, I take Jack Parsons to be the child who “shallbehold them all” [i.e., the Mysteries of The Book of the Law. SeeAL I:54-56, below].26 years of age, 6′2′′, vital, potentially bisexual at the very least,University of the State of Califor nia and Cal Tech., now engaged inCal Tech chemical laboratories developing “bigger and better” explo-sives for Uncle Sam. Travels under sealed orders from the govern-ment. Writes poetr y—”sensuous only,” he says. Lover of music,which he seems to know thor oughly. I see him as the r eal succes-sor of Therion [Crowley]. Passionate; and has made the vilest analy-ses r esult in a species of exaltation after the event. Has hadmystical experiences which gave him a sense of equality all r ound,although he is hierarchical in feeling and in the established or der.The passage in Cr owley’s The Book of the Lawto which W olferefers (AL I:54-56) reads, “Change not as much as the style of a let-ter; for behold! Thou, o prophet, shalt not behold all these mysterieshidden therein. The child of thy bowels, he shall behold them. Expecthim not from the East, nor from the West; for from no expected housecometh that child.” At 26, Parsons was still a “child” in the eyes ofthe older members, at least in the spiritual sense, regarded by Wolfeas this “chosen one,” so to speak.55Parso ns’ Double Life: 1940–1942"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Par sons’ “mystical experiences,” if they were recorded then, havesince been lost and are unknown. For sake of comparison to Wolfe’sportrayal, Parsons’ FBIfile describes him as 6′1′′, 185 pounds , withbrown hair and brown eyes, medium build, and fair complexion. Theremark “potentially bisexual at the very least” may refer to his admit-ted attraction to Smith, as well as to another unique characteristic: atleast two former work associates have said that Parsons sweated pro-fusely, which caused str ong body odor that he tried to mask withheavy cologne. A man who wore a lot of cologne at the same time thathe displayed an above-average interest in another man may have inad-vertently given the impr ession of bise xuality. Parsons himself onceexpressed a latent homosexuality, and Aleister Crowley, Parsons’ newidol, was well known for his bisexuality.Like many other A gape Lodge member s, Wolfe was also in theA∴A∴. Crowley had initiated her at Cefalu as a Probationer 0°=0 onJune 11, 1921, and had further recognized her as a Neophyte 1°=10in May 1940, after she had written him to lament her long term as aProbationer.Wolfe was not the last to identify P arsons’ potential. After mor ethan a y ear of attending meetings and the Gnostic Mass , John andHelen Parsons joined the A gape Lodge on F ebruary 15, 1941, whenthey simultaneously joined the A∴A∴. Just a fe w weeks after the yjoined, in March 1941, Smith wrote to Crowley, “I think I have at longlast a really excellent man, John Parsons. And starting ne xt Tuesdayhe begins a course of talks with a view to enlarging our scope. He hasan excellent mind and much better intellect than m yself . . . JohnPar sons is going to be valuable.”Par sons became “F rater T.O.P.A.N.” and w as known as “F rater210” for short. His wife became “Sor or Grimaud.” The initials inPar sons’ magical motto stood for Thelemum Obtentum Pr ocederoAmoris Nuptiae ,Latin for “the obtainment of thelema—Will—through the nuptials of love.” The initials T.O.P.A.N. were also a dec-laration of Parsons’ dedication: To Pan. In Hebrew the enumerationfor T.O.P.A.N. is 400+7 0+80+1+50=601. Parsons counted it asI.O.P.A.N., giving the mor e desirable sum 210, with “Io P an” beingGreek for “Hail P an.” Indeed, Cr owley’s “Hymn to P an,” whichPar sons had memorized and often recited, begins, “Io Pan! Io Pan Pan!”The numbers 1 through 20 add to 210. In the book 777 Cr owleyalso speaks of certain number s important to each of the sephiroth(spheres) of the k abbalistic Tree of Life. The first has the v alue 1,the second 1+2 =3, the third 1+2+3=6, and so on; there are 1056sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"altogether. Although Cr owley does not sa y so, a little quick mathwill show these 10 values add to 210. In 777 Crowley calls the mean-ing of 210 “too holy” to divulge, an allusion to the “N.O.X.formula.”N.O.X., Latin for “night,” is akin to “L.V.X.” or “Lux”—light. Both areportrayed during simple rituals of Cr owley’s that came fr om theGolden Dawn.Coincidentally, the interstate highway running through Pasadenawhich makes a 90-degree turn due north of the beginning of SouthOrange Grove Ave., heading str aight to JPL,is numbered 210, as ifsome cosmic force numbered the highway in Parsons’ honor.Helen’s chosen name, Grimaud, is a F rench name that may referto a character in one of Lord Bulwer-Lytton’s novels who acted as a“magical servitor.” Bulwer-Lytton is probably most famous for ha v-ing started a novel with the phrase, “It was a dark and stormy night.”Eventually, Parsons came to vie w Smith as the father he alw ayswanted, and the two stayed in touch throughout their lives, despitethe many problems between them and with other member s of thelodge. While man y member s of the A gape Lodge drifted apart,Par sons and Smith continually came back to each other, and,although Parsons called Crowley “Father” in his many letters to him,the immediate presence of Smith was much more powerful.In addition, P arsons’ inter est in science fiction continued intoadulthood, and he attended many of the weekly meetings of the LosAngeles Science F antasy Society (LASFS), which met Thur sdayevenings. LASFSstarted as chapter 4 of the Science Fiction League ,one of many fan clubs begun in 1934 when Hugo Gernsback’ s mag-azine Wonder Storiesannounced the ne w program. All closed butchapter 4, which r emained a vital concern due to the w ork of oneman—Forrest J. A ckerman. Ackerman has said that he r emembersmeeting Parsons once, though others insist he must have met him onmany occasions. Helen Parsons Smith remembers at least one meeting.In 1940, Ackerman’s group became the independent LASFS, which,as home base for Los Angeles-area fans and writers, was quite active.JPLarchivist John Bluth hear d that many science fiction people fr e-quented Parsons’ house, but it was less common for Parsons to go tothe LASFS. He was thus probably not a member, just an attendee.At one of the Thursday meetings in 1941, Parsons met one of hisfavorite author s, Jack Williamson, who r ecords this meeting inWonder’s Child, his autobiogr aphy. Williamson had written DarkerThan You Think, which first appeared in the magazine Unknownin1940, and was expanded considerably in 1948 for the book edition.57Parso ns’ Double Life: 1940–1942"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"In Wonder’s Child, Williamson wr ote, “He [P arsons] had r ead mynovel Darker Than You Think, which deals with the supernatur al.

He recorded the event in Wonder’s Child:I met John Parsons. An odd enigma to me, he was a r ocket engi-neer with unexpected leanings towar d the occult. He wanted tomeet me because I’d written Darker Than You Think—a good manypeople have taken it mor e seriously than I ever did; witches nowand then have taken me for a fellow Wiccan.Parsons belonged to the OTO, an underground order founded, Ithink, by the satanist Aleister Crowley. One night Cleve Cartmill andI were allowed to climb after him into an attic to attend a secr etmeeting. The ritual was disappointingly tame. Ther e was no nudevirgin on the altar. Satan was not invoked.Yet the priest impressed me. He was a lean, dynamic little manwith bright, light blue eyes, driven by a vir ulent hatr ed of God.Talking to him after the ceremony, I found that he was the son of aBritish clergyman who must have been the r eal target of that sav-age animosity.From the above description it sounds as if Williamson got to meetWilfred Smith.Darker Than You Thinkis the story of her editary werewolves whohave discovered their true bestial nature and seek to revive the old waysand the old gods. They accomplish this revival under the leadership ofthe “Child of Night,” who is the r esult of a magical pr odigious birth,finding him in the char acter of Will Barbee. Williamson’s first sciencefiction treatment of werewolves (a novel approach at the time) had beenin 1932, when he wrote the short story, “Wolves of Darkness.”The connection to Wicca and neo-paganism is obvious , as is theparallel to Parsons’ magical “Babalon Working,” which will be thesubject of chapters 7 and 8.

[They] were certainly seen there together.” In afootnote he related that Marjorie Cameron, Parsons’ second wife, wasthe source of this information: “Heinlein was the first person Parsonsever introduced her to. She didn’t care for Heinlein too much; he was‘too slick, too Hollywood. But Jack and he were good friends.’” AdamRostoker is the same “Adam Walks-Between-Worlds” of the Church ofAll Worlds which w as inspired by Heinlein’s Stranger in a Str angeLand. He may have published a similar article in that or ganization’sGreen Eggmagazine.Williamson documents science writer and member of the GermanRocket Society Willy Le y’s occasional pr esence at meetings of theMañana Literary Society, an informal science fiction discussion groupwhich met at Heinlein’s house, so Parsons may have met his old cor-respondent there—assuming he was in fact a part of Heinlein’s circle.Meanwhile, in P arsons’ other life , the GALCITgroup realized itsfirst big success in August 1941. Parsons had come to realize that therocket motors, now called jet-assisted tak e-offs (JATOs) to avoid thecharged term “rocket,” had to be used almost immediately , as theycould not be stor ed for long periods of time or in e xtremes of tem-perature. He and F orman would get up v ery early and pr epare theJATOs, nap a little, then meet the others at March Field. Von Kármánwrote, “He [P arsons] used a paper-lined c ylinder into which hepressed a black-po wder propellant of his o wn composition in one-inch layers.” In August, the group was ready to test Parsons’ JATOs onactual aircraft, the first time this type of rocket had ever been used.The fuel used was called GALCIT-27, implying 26 failures before it.The airplane chosen was a hobby plane called the “Ercoupe,” chosenbecause it was small, light and har d to stall. The pilot w as CaptainHomer A. Boushey, Jr. of the Army Air Corps, a graduate student ofvon Kármán’s. Also pr esent was another gr aduate student, HomerJoe Stewart, to whom was addressed a signed copy of Frank Malina’smemoirs in the possession of the JPLarchives.The GALCIT-27 event was recorded on color film, a copy of whichresides in the Libr ary of Congr ess. The silent original, along withsome outtakes, is in the JPLarchives.

If the Army Air Corps were in some remote locale withrough terrain or lots of tr ees, a short run way would save the laborand expense of a lot of men. The second use was for quick getawaysin the air. If an enemy plane came up behind a pilot who had JATOs,the latter could ignite the r ockets and get out of the enem y’s line offire.

There are apocryphal storiesconcerning the inspir ation for his idea, but P arsons seems to ha vetaken the truth with him to the grave. 40 years later Homer Bousheytold an International Association of A eronautics and Astr onautics(IAAA) group in Oslo that the idea had come to Parsons while watch-ing some roofers apply hot asphalt. F rank Malina said that P arsonsknew of “Greek Fire,” a mixture of pitch and other elements whichthe ancient Greeks used as flaming projectiles, hurling them at enemyships during w ars. However, Helen Parsons told an intervie wer theidea had originated with her.As early as 1928, Parsons and Forman had used glue as a binderto hold their black powder and aluminum oxide in their little rocketmotors. In 1942 Parsons had the idea to use liquid asphalt for thispurpose. The asphalt w as heated, then the fuel and the o xidizerwere mixed in, and the mixture was poured directly into the casingrather than an intermediate molding and allo wed to cool. DubbedGALCIT-53, the mixture did not shrink and crack as had earlier mix-tures.4The new JATOs could be stored indefinitely, at either extremeof temperature, without the threat of explosion during use—and theycould now be mass-produced. After Parsons left Aerojet, it was dis-covered that a hollow could be created in the center of the hardenedfuel to provide increased surface area and thus an increased burningrate. At first they used a simple c ylindrical shape, then later a starshape to further increase the surface area. This method was used inthe Minuteman and Polaris missiles.Mark M. Mills and F red S. Miller assisted P arsons with his w orkon the GALCIT-53 JATOs, which delivered 200 pounds of thrust foreight seconds—a 476% impr ovement o ver GALCIT-27. P arsonsinvented the method of pouring the heated, liquefied pr opellant,which involved priming the empty casing first with a little bit of theliquefied solution, letting it cool just enough to start to har den, andthen pouring the r emainder of the fuel inside . This method is stillused today on the solid fuel boosters used on the Space Shuttle.Par sons also had the equally monumental idea to start usingpotassium perchlorate as an oxidizer, instead of aluminum and oth-ers. Successful v ariations on this idea included use of ammoniumperchlorate for the same purpose. Potassium perchlorate was actuallylisted in the paper P arsons wrote at Antelope V alley for Halifax in72sex and rockets4.

Parsons and Forman had the idea to get a sponsor or form acorporation; Malina w as the one who pr oposed the idea to v onKármán. Each put in $200, though Haley actually loaned all but vonKármán their share. Haley ended up putting in $2500, with the under-standing that the others would pay him back later. The five assignedall future patents to the compan y, and Malina and Hale y came upwith the name Aerojet. Parsons and Forman immediately left GALCITfor Aerojet. The group still worked on projects together, with Aerojetemployees selling their services as consultants to GALCIT. The com-pany grew quickly.Haley seems to have been a hands-on kind of guy, as his interest-ing book, Rocketry and Space Exploration, contains several photos ofhim working directly with various manufacturing efforts at A erojet.Often he worked in the office by day and in the plant by night. The group’s next big success was with liquid JATOs. Par sons wasstill trying to find a w ay to use r ed fuming nitric acid (RFNA) as anoxidizer with fuels such as gasoline and benzene . RFNAwas thechemical that had caused the lar ge explosion—and the big mess—when the Suicide Squad w as just getting started at Caltech. Curr enttests resulted in motor s that burned but pr oduced uneven burningwhich led to thr obbing, caused b y late ignition: The fuel did notbegin burning immediately on contact with RFNA. MartinSummerfield’s “instability of burning” la w is still used to describethis phenomenon.On a trip east, an acquaintance of Malina’ s suggested using ani-line to help control the burn rate of the mixture and reduce the throb-bing. On the tr ain ride home, Malina suddenly r ealized that RFNAand aniline ought to be self-igniting without the gasoline or benzene.He wired Summerfield back in P asadena, who arranged a test withengineer Walter Powell and others. The event was recorded on film:a small crucible sits on the ground, while a hand reaches in, holdinga long pole at the end of which is another small crucible . When thecontents of one w ere poured into the other, the mixture did indeedignite into a huge flame, and the group was on their way to the per-fection of liquid-fuel rockets.73Parso ns’ Double Life: 1940–1942"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"With the help of attorne y D.

[In an odd “ coincidence,” theGreat Beast Aleister Crowley referred to himself as “Teitan,” which isthe original Greek spelling of “Titan,” because it adds to 666 in Greekgematria, a form of numerology.]The flight test of the new liquid fuel occurred on April 15, 1942 atMuroc Field in Antelope Valley, site of today’s Edwards Air Force Base.Liquid JATOs were the first Aerojet project. A Douglas A-20Awas flownfirst to the Burbank airport for pr eparations, then to the test field forthe liquid JATOtests. The plane weighed 20,000 pounds, as much as sev-eral Ercoupes combined. Major Paul H. Dane of the Arm y Air Corpswas the test pilot. Be verly Forman, Ed’s cousin, sat in back of theplane. His job was to release the fuel mixture at the appropriate time.Two 1000-pound thrust JATOs were mounted under the A-20A’s wings, eachwith a 25-second burn time. They were designed by Summerfield withthe assistance of Walter B. Powell and Edward G. Croft, and had fivetimes the power of GALCIT-53, although solid fuel maintained its value.A long, silent color film (thr ee reels) exists of this e vent as well,located in the Library of Congress, as well as in the JPLarchives.

However, it was only one area into which the military waschanneling lar ge amounts of mone y in pr eparation for the w ar.Designated XLR-1-AJ-1, over 100 slightly modified liquid JATOunitswere sold by Aerojet for use on Boeing B36bombers during the war.Smaller units were also used to help launch Corsairs from aircraft car-riers; it is unclear whether they used liquid or solid fuel.Observing the tests w as Alfred Loedding, sent b y the Arm y AirCorps from Wright Field. Loedding’s later claim to fame w as as themilitary’s first UFOinvestigator in 1947: he started Project Sign, whichsought to explain away all UFOreports and was the precursor to theAir Force’s better-known Project Blue Book.At Aer ojet Parsons mostly w orked in solid fuels and w as theProject Engineer in charge of the Solid Fuels Department, although hewasn’t actually a degreed engineer. Forman supervised the mechanics’shop and often went to the arroyoat GALCITto perform static tests ofhis improved motors. Malina was working mostly with liquids at thistime, which was his friend Summerfield’s specialty. When he wouldvisit the arroyofor tests, he would work out of his car.Aer ojet’s first contract was for a solid JATOfor the Navy Bureau ofAer onautics, and their second w as a liquid JATOfor the Air craftLaboratory at Wright Field that was used on the Douglas Havoc AttackBomber.

Project No. 1, however,the official rocket project at Caltech, had a top priority; thus, its menwere exempt. The project in the arroyorated further down the scale.Aer ojet had the same pr oblem, at the same time it w as trying toexpand to meet the new demand for its product. Hap Arnold himselfhad to intervene when Andrew Haley was drafted. Haley was back toAer ojet within a w eek, where he replaced von Kármán as the com-pany’s president, and w orked hard, demanding that his emplo yeeswork even harder. They often took pa y cuts when he felt the com-pany couldn’t afford the payroll. Haley went on to become presidentof the International Aeronautical Federation. He traveled widely, andhis book is full of pictures of himself with dignitaries like the Pope.Newcomers to Aerojet were often shocked by the uneducated andinexperienced staff the company had to hire just to have some bod-ies around to do the work. A company photo taken when Aerojet wasonly one year old shows well over 100 people. Experienced engineerswere not interested in rockets, so they had to rely on young inexpe-rienced engineers fresh out of college . Von Kármán later said thisarrangement worked out to their adv antage, as the y didn’t ha ve tountrain anybody.

Malina and Summerfield had r eceived a militarycontract to test the “Hy drobomb,” which w as a euphemistically-named torpedo. In or der to test the h ydrodynamic properties of theHydrobomb, the gr oup constructed a 5 00-foot long “to wing chan-nel”—basically a long, shallow pit of water. The rocket car was builton a track above the pit, and the Hy drobomb was mounted on theunderside of the rocket car, with liquid JATOs used to propel it 500 feetat 40 mph, a speed compar able to what it w ould experience under-water. Pressure gauges were mounted to the Hydrobomb to measurethe effects of its motion thr ough the w ater.

The dr amatic demise of the r ocket car wascaptured on color film. In 1942, author William A.H. White , who79Parso ns’ Double Life: 1940–1942"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"wrote science fiction as Anthon y Boucher and m ysteries as H.H.Holmes (the name of an infamous Chicago mur derer), penned andhad published a cr ossover mur der m ystery/science fiction no velabout the rocket car called Rocket to the Morgue. It was written andpublished in 1942, and later reprinted under White’s “Boucher” pseu-donym. The novel clearly portrays John Parsons as one of the maincharacters. White later founded and edited The Magazine of ScienceFiction and Fantasy, as well as writing several stories and novels inboth genres. He was popular science fiction writer Philip K. Dick’ seditor for years.In Rocket to the Morgue, Parsons is the character Hugo Chantrelle,to whom White often simply refers as “the goatee.” Ed Forman is hisassistant “Gribble,” and Robert Heinlein is “ Austin Carter.” Sciencefiction writer and future founder of the Church of Scientology L. RonHubbard is “D. V ance Wimple,” while John W . Campbell is “DonStewart,” and Jack Williamson is “Joe Hender son.” In the“Afterword” of the 1951 edition, White says that Heinlein’s MañanaLiterary Society “existed in fact precisely as it is depicted in this book. . . I’v e managed to captur e a moment that has some inter est as ahistorical footnote to popular cultur e. This is the w ay it w as inSouthern California just befor e the w ar, when science fiction w asbeing given its present form.” Because of this assertion, we must payclose attention to the fact that A ustin Carter (Heinlein) and HugoChantrelle (Parsons) spend a lot of time together in the book, includ-ing some meetings at the former’s house. And it should also be notedthat the book was written a few years before Parsons actually met L.Ron Hubbard.White described Chantrelle as: [A]n eccentric scientist. In working hours at the Califor nia Instituteof Technology he was an uninspired routine laboratory man; but onhis own time he devoted himself to those peripheral aspects of sci-ence which the scientific purist damns as mumbo-jumbo, thosenew alchemies and astr ologies out of which the race may in timeconstruct unsurmised wonders of chemistry and astronomy.The rocketry of Pendray, the time-dreams of Dunne, the extra sen-sory perception of Rhine, the sea serpents of Gould, all these heldhis interests far more than any research conducted by the Institute.He was inevitably a member of the For tean Society of America, andhad his own file of unbelievable incidents eventually to be publishedas a supplement to the works of Charles For t.

His file was car efully authenticated,and often embellished with first-hand reports.The entire book is worth reading for nothing else than the charac-terization of P arsons as Chantr elle. While it is obviously a liter aryportrayal rather than a biographical sketch, Rocket to the Morguecer-tainly depicts the author’s impression of Parsons. White’s statementabout Parsons being a member of the F ortean Society, for instance,may not be factual, but certainly P arsons w as inter ested in“Forteana,” the bizarre scientific anomalies found ar ound the globefor millennia and chronicled by the indefatigable Fort.White’s reference to “the time-dreams of Dunne” was repeated else-where in the book and concerns J.W . Dunne’s An Experiment WithTime, an odd little v olume first published in 1927. Dunne’ s hypothe-sis, which he supports with lengthy descriptions of his own dreams, isthat dreams may often foretell future events.

During these meetings Rogers soon fell inlove with a young artist who roomed there, and visited whenever hecould, prior to mo ving in. In a 1962 fanzine article entitled“Darkhouse,” Rogers wrote:In the ads placed in the local paper Jack specified that onlybohemians, ar tists, musicians, atheists, anar chists, or otherexotic types need apply for r ooms—any mundane soul would beunceremoniously rejected.

I always foundJack’s insistence that he believed in and practiced magic har d toreconcile with his educational and cultural backgr ound. At first Ithought it was all fun and games, a kick he was on for its shockvalue to his r espectable friends; but after seeing his cor respon-dence with Crowley, and the evidence of the fr equent remittancesto Crowley, I had to give him the benefit of the doubt.The association becomes easier to r econcile when one consider sCrowley’s own view of magic , presented in Liber O vel Manus etSagittae: “In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth, and the Paths, ofSpirits and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many otherthings which may or may not exist.“It is immaterial whether the y exist or not. By doing certainthings certain r esults follow; students ar e most earnestly w arnedagainst attributing objective reality or philosophic validity to any ofthem.”Despite Parsons’ outward appearance, he was the subject of regu-lar public attention and rumor s that he w as the leader of a “blackmagic cult,” rumor s denied b y his scientific associates , man y ofwhom were regulars at the house, if not members of one or the otherorders. As early as 194 1, Parsons was investigated (at his pr eviousresidence), but no arrests were made. Rather than any occult activi-ties, this investigation concerned some explosives he was storing atthe house, either the tetr anitromethane Malina mentioned, or thegunpowder Forman’s first wife talked about, or both.In 1942, local police came to 1 003 S.

Germer had arrived in the United States from a Germanconcentration camp and settled in Ne w York. His stated goal was towork on building up the OTOin his new country; in actuality he didthe opposite. Germer took a par anoid dislike to Wilfred Smith, per-haps because he saw him as a competitor for the lead position, andbegan a smear campaign, constantly writing Cr owley about Smith’sactivities in the worst possible light.Wilfred Smith had a r eputation as a w omanizer which equaledthat of Crowley, who viewed his own succession of “Scarlet Women”as a necessary magical aid. Smith’s affairs, however, seemed to be anopportunity for Germer to deride him. Ov er 200 letters exchangedbetween Crowley and Smith during this period have been preserved,letters that evidently document the slo w but steady deterior ation ofthe relationship between Crowley and Smith.Like Parsons, Lodge Master Wilfr ed Smith w as a good-lookingman with a charming per sonality and a strong love of women.

In fact, he himselfhad had a number of children by different women. This “black magi-cian,” as he came to be considered in his native England, eventuallycommitted many blasphemies against Christianity , which, after hiswretched childhood, he set out to destr oy and r eplace with“Crowleyanity” and his “La w of Thelema,” which he truly hopedwould sweep the world. Married to Rose Kelley, whose brother Gerald would become theKnighted Pr esident of London’ s R oyal A cademy, Cr owley liv ed aleisurely life because of a large sum of money his father left him. Hewas an imposing figur e and the beneficiary of numer ous unusualadventures. One night of his and R ose’s honeymoon, for e xample,was spent in the so-called King’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid, dur-ing which Crowley worked ceremonial magic.Crowley was not content to be monogamous, however, and he hada voracious sexual appetite for both w omen and men. In fact, the“Key” to the OTOwas sex magick. Crowley’s sex rites, however, werenot to be tak en lightly or casually, as he himself thought them to bevery serious and powerful magic. Crowley’s ritual sex partners were often prostitutes and men he’dpicked up in Turkish bath houses. Even with the women the GreatBeast often insisted on ha ving anal intercourse, so convinced w ashe of its magical qualities. One of his sexual partners and first dis-ciples w as Victor Neubur g, an orthodo x Je w who had becomeagnostic and with whom Cr owley pla yed the passiv e r ecipient.Neuburg, who was in love with the Great Beast, was also the vic-tim of Cr owley’s sadism, enduring beatings , including one acr ossthe butt with nettles. In his pr actices he also used his “Scarlet W omen,” including ayoung girl named Leah Hir sig, to whom Crowley had taken a fancyin the spring of 1918. Leah did not serve as the Scarlet Woman, how-ever, until 192 0, at Cr owley’s Abbey of Thelema at Cefalu, Sicily ,which he and Leah called the “College of the Holy Ghost” and which89The Return to South Orange Grove Ave.: 1942–1945"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"was “sexually free.” At one point at the Abbey, a male goat was sup-posed to copulate with Leah, but he “failed to perform” and was sac-rificed, splattering Leah with his blood.One scandal that nearly torpedoed Cr owley was the death of ayoung acolyte who had engaged in a ritual of drug-taking and drink-ing the blood of a sacrificed cat. The incident was the source of sen-sational headlines in London: “Ne w Sinister Revelations of AleisterCrowley. Varsity Lad’s Death. Enticed to ‘Abbey’. Dreadful Ordeal ofA Young Wife. Crowley’s Plans,” as well as “Young Wife’s Story ofCrowley’s Abbey. Scenes of Horror. Drugs Magic and Vile Practices.”Crowley was accused not only of sexual deviation but also of canni-balism. Because of such bad publicity, Crowley ironically riled Italy’sfascist dictator, Mussolini, no angel himself, and w as subsequentlytossed out of that country and his abbey.The German br anches of the OTOwere closed because of theNazis, who also arrested and tortured Crowley’s main advocate andmoney-supplier, Karl Germer, one of whose friends, Martha Küntzel,became an ar dent admir er of Hitler and “r egularly bombar dedCrowley with letters loaded with praises of Hitler.”Adding to his scandals, at one point Crowley tried to make moneyselling “Elixir of Life Pills” that w ere supposed to enhance virility .Those who took them pr obably never realized they were composedof a “neutral base combined with Crowley’s own semen.” They wereprobably energized by some sort of sex magick.Thus, it is clear that Crowley’s excoriation of Smith was based noton any so-called morals but was merely an excuse for him to blastSmith. In reality, when Crowley heard that Smith had legally incor-porated the Church of Thelema, he mistak enly took it to mean thatSmith intended to r aise his ne w son to r eplace Cr owley. Germerplayed no little part in this deception.Crowley removed Smith thr ough an ingenious means . First, hedrew up a horoscope for Smith based on the unusual cir cumstanceof his birth. Smith’ s hor oscope had a comple x of eight planets ,which one could easily interpret as if Smith were an avatar of somegod. This complex was something Crowley had found in only oneother instance, that of Shak espeare. He called it “one of the mostastonishingly fortunate figures that Frater 666 [Crowley] has ever setup in his whole life!” and printed the hor oscope, intended only forSmith, under the title, “Is Smith A God?” The 12-page document wasalso titled Liber Apotheosis orLiber 132.Crowley wrote:90sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The simple, the astounding tr uth, flooded the mind of Frater 666with light.

McMurtry often sent P arsonspoems he had written, usually of a m ystical nature. Parsons encour-aged McMurtry to contact Cr owley while he was in England, an actthat led to Crowley initiating McMurtry all the w ay to the X° of theOTO. To Parsons’ surprise, McMurtry returned to the United States afew short years later as his superior in the Order. With Smith havingleft, Parsons was Acting Head of the Lodge at this time.Smith’s retirement took place at a turkey farm outside of Pasadenabelonging to a member of the lodge named R oy Leffingwell. In hisquest to find the god within himself, Smith had to build a small altarfrom rocks he found the site. He also had to tattoo the “Mark of theBeast” on his forehead or right palm and (if desir ed) over his heartand his mons veneris(sic). Everything that happened to him duringthe retreat was to be carefully recorded and forwarded to Germer, the“Outer Head” of the OTO. Eventually, Smith was told by Leffingwellto leave the farm.While Smith thus floundered, Parsons had plenty of money for hisoccult activities , as , b y the summer of 1943, A erojet w as doing$650,000 in business. In June of that y ear, Parsons and von Kármánwere invited to Norfolk, Virginia, where they turned their attention toaircraft carriers because JATOs were unable to keep up with the big-ger bombers and the ease with which runways were now being con-structed. Two of von Kármán’s former students were now a captainand an admir al in the Na vy, and the Hungarian and P arsons wereinvited to demonstrate their JATOs for the Secretary of the Navy andhis admirals. This test took place on the USSCharger, which w asdocked at Norfolk. Parsons outfitted a Grumman airplane with solid-fuel JATOs, but when the plane took off it co vered the Secretary andhis admirals with a cloud of yellow smoke that left a nasty residue. Afew of the officers got mad, but the Secretary merely told them to finda way to get rid of the smok e and they would have a contract.

Like Helen before her, Betty actedas Parsons’ priestess at the Gnostic Mass, the pair fulfilling the rolesleft vacant by Smith and Kahl. Parsons’ devotion was such that theMass was held every single day. Betty was also Parsons’ partner inthe performance of se x magick—the “magic” of inducing alter edstates through prolonged sexual ecstasy. Kahl, on the other hand,was a lesbian.At Par sons’ ur ging the 18-y ear-old Betty left the Univ ersity ofSouthern California (USC). Parsons was 11 years her senior, and herparents were not at all happ y about the arr angement. Parsons laternoted the implied element of adultery and incest in this r elationshipwith his wife’s sister was most appealing. (The breaking of taboos isa typical “tantric” practice, but it may also be that Parsons felt stungby his wife’s “betrayal” with Smith.) P arsons and Betty liv ed as acouple, although they never did marry.Interestingly, Parsons encouraged Betty to take other lovers, as hedid, because he per ceived himself above the petty jealousies felt b ynormal men. For a time , this sentiment w as true, and their v ariousaffairs seem to ha ve strengthened their feelings for each other , para-doxical as that may sound.

Despiteothers’ failures with these materials , Parsons practically insisted onmoving ahead with his o wn experiments. He also attended a solidfuel conference during the summer and fall of 1944, of which histyped notes are now in the JPLarchives.Obviously, Parsons liked to be in charge and not under authority,in both his pr ofessional and per sonal liv es. Sometime that y earPar sons made an interesting statement in a letter sent to McMurtry:“I am a little sour on the OTOinasmuch as by experience I doubt thevalue of membership coming in e xcept via previous experience andindividual training of the A∴A∴sort. It seems to me the early grades(which are all we have here) are too free in admitting non-descriptsand too lax in that they do not provide a definite program of trainingand qualifications. The better people I have met always seem to comevia an interest in A∴A∴aspects.” This instance is not the fir st timePar sons questioned his association with the OTO, nor would it be hislast. He had a long history of bucking authority; the OTOsoon becameone more “authority” trying to tell him what to do.While he concerned with formal training and qualifications in his“spiritual” life, Parsons had no need for it in his aer ospace occupa-tion. Indeed, he thrived without such academic accomplishment andcredentials, as did the business and science he helped found. In 1944,GALCITchanged its name to the Jet Pr opulsion Laboratory (JPL), aterm coined in a memorandum written by von Kármán, Malina, andTsien on No vember 2 0, 1943. A t that time their budget w as anastounding $650,000, and appr oximately 80 people w orked there,though Summerfield w as still oper ating out of his car . Malina w assoon named Director of JPL, a position he held until 1946, althoughhe is usually r eferred to as the second Dir ector, v on Kármán b ydefault being the fir st. It seems that Malina w as retreating from hisanti-capitalist stance, also expressing to his parents just a little over ayear earlier that “we are getting to be more and more like capitalists.”However, Malina and his fir st wife w ere long-standing member s ofthe local communist “cell,” which certainly had much to do with hisgetting out of the rocket business after the end of the war.Despite the impr essive budget, the JPLfacilities were still r atherprimitive. Eugene Pierce, a local architect, took a job as an adminis-trative assistant ar ound this time .

Ther e’s no futur e for an ar chitecthere.” Inside, the buildings things were no better. The corridors wereextremely narrow, and Pier ce shared an 8-b y-10 office with Malinaand secretary Dorothy Lewis, with whom JPLhistorians were able toconduct an oral history interview in 1972. In the interview, Lewis toldthem that P arsons “was the clo wn of the gr oup. He lo ved to pla yjokes. That was all right.” Dorothy’s office overlooked the liquid fueltest pit. Conversation halted whenever a test was run.Malina and Summerfield launched a small series of rockets calledthe “Private” in 1944, when Malina paused long enough to r ealizethat they now had the means to carry out the original goal of theearly GALCITgroup. Constructed of little mor e than JATOs to whichfins and a nose cone were attached, the Privates successfully carriedmeteorological equipment high into the atmospher e—for the pur-poses of pur e research rather than military applications . This com-pleted goal made Malina happ y. The Priv ate A w as launched fr omLeach Spring, at Camp Irwin near Barstow, California, an army basein the Mojave Desert. The following year, however, found Malina working with missilesmeant to be fir ed into enem y territory . The pr oject ORDCIT—“America’s first long range missile and space exploration program”—was formed for this purpose , in the same arroyowhere GALCITwaslocated. Two of the missiles de veloped, the solid-fuel Ser geant andthe liquid-fuel Corporal, were never deployed, but the later R egulusmissile was. The Regulus was developed by others for deployment inwestern Europe during the Cold W ar. These small, mobile missileswere launched from the backs of trucks and, as with the other earlymissiles, were simply made fr om large solid-fuel JATOs with a fe wminor modifications to make them fly.It is another odd “coincidence” that the term “Regulus,” a star inthe constellation Leo, appear s in the w ork of Aleister Cr owley,appearing in the title of Crowley’s Liber V vel Reguliin its plural form.Reproduced in R egardie’s Gems from the Equinox, Liber Vis “theRitual of the Mark of the Beast: an incantation pr oper to invoke theEnergies of the A eon of Horus , adapted for the daily use of theMagician of whatever grade.” The “Mark of the Beast,” of cour se, iswhat Smith was supposed to tattoo on himself during his r etreat.On March 11, 1945, Parsons wrote to McMurtry that he w as “try-ing to get out from under [the OTO] and more into A∴A∴work whichsuits me far better and in which I think I can do more.” However, he97The Return to South Orange Grove Ave.: 1942–1945"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"was not quite r eady to leave the OTOat this time, and its appar entinfluence on his life would continue.Despite his occult leanings , Parsons enjoyed respectability in hisprofessional work. On Mar ch 15 the Saturday Evening P ostran anarticle called “JATOs Get ’Em Up,” highlighting the v ery successfuluse of solid-fuel JATOs, with mention of Parsons, Forman, Malina andSummerfield as the de velopers, under the dir ection of von Kármán.The article discusses the differ ent wartime applications for whichJATOs were currently being used, including on the Navy’s PB-2Y sea-planes and the small Corsairs that were launched from aircraft carri-ers. Because of the JATOs, which helped them launch without theadvantage of a long, smooth str etch of w ater, Catalan Flying Boatswere able to land in the chopp y waters of the South P acific, unde-terred by 18-foot swells, to carry out a r escue mission. Another dra-matic rescue was made in Southern California when a Martin Marinerwas forced down in a small lak e: the Mariner needed a full mile totake off, but the lake was only 3000 feet at its greatest width, so JATOswere mounted under the plane’s wings, allowing it to get back intothe air safely.Another one of the JPLgroup, Charles Bartley9, made an improve-ment to P arsons’ original asphalt binder in 1945. T o r eplace theasphalt, Bartley created a polysulfide compound, for which the word“thiokol” w as coined, fr om the Gr eek w ords for “sulphur” and“glue.” Called “Thiok ol LP-2,” the compound is a polymer , whichmeans an artificial compound with a very repetitive molecular struc-ture consisting of long molecules joined together endlessly . The reg-ular molecular structur e is what giv es polymer s their desir ablequalities.The compound name can also be found in “Morton-Thiok ol,” awell-recognized aerospace manufacturing firm today. As late as theKor ean War, solid-fuel JATOs were used on Sabre Jet fighters, whichwould jettison the canisters after use, such that the Korean junglesmust be full of them. Solid-fuel r ockets launched the P olaris mis-siles, a name corr elating to “Pole Star,” the moniker Parsons usedin writing to r efer to Smith. Solid fuel, of cour se, is also whatlaunches the Space Shuttle, of which Morton-Thiokol was the man-ufacturer until the Challenger disaster , after which A erojet got thecontract.In 1945, Betty’s sentiment was recorded by Jane Wolfe who shared98sex and rockets9.

From the start he always wanted to evoke something—nomatter what, I am inclined to think, as long as he got a r esult.According to Meeka [Aldrich] yester day, he has had a r esult—an elemental he doesn’t know what to do with. Fr om that state-ment of hers, it must bother him—somewhat at least.Par sons’ ardent thrill-seeking was, of course, not just professionalbut personal, and he once wrote that one of the rituals he used w as“liable to pr oduce dangerous side phenomena and sometimes per-manent haunting in an ar ea where it is r epeated.” Wolfe’s “witch-craft” r eference is to one of P arsons’ pr ojects, called “TheWitchcraft,” which, along with “The Gnosis ,” was his attempt todevise a r eligious system of his o wn that addr essed fields Cr owleyseems to ha ve stayed out of. The surviving paper s concerning TheGnosis and the Witchcraft are reproduced in the book Freedom Is ATwo-Edged Sword.The elementals or spirits Parsons was invoking evidently disturbedthe other Parsonage residents. One still-living and activ e member ofthe OTOand the A∴A∴today, Phyllis Seckler (“Soror Meral,” initiatedby W olfe into the A∴A∴), recorded:Meeka also reported to Jane that another two persons always hadto do a lot of banishing in the house.

Like Helen Parsons had for a while, she served as thetreasurer of Agape Lodge in September, though she shared that officewith another during the follo wing month. Meeka kept active in the99The Return to South Orange Grove Ave.: 1942–1945"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"lodge after that, and was the one who found places for the lodge tomeet from late 1946 into 1948.As the w ar ended, the founder s of A erojet started looking for away to make the firm viable , because its futur e was suddenly veryuncertain. It is ir onic that P arsons’ work, despite its anti-militarybeginnings and goal, had become the backbone of military oper a-tions, so much so that his company was virtually dependent on war.How he was able to r econcile his profession with his per sonal life,which, while hedonistic, he ostensibly viewed as spiritual, is a quirkof the human mind in gener al, as millions of other s have been ableto do the same.Fortunately, the firm was able to convince Gener al Tire to investin it. If it succeeded, fine; if not, Gener al Tire was big enough toabsorb the loss as a tax write-off. With the purchase, Aerojet becameAer ojet General, today known as GenCorp Aerojet. Once General Tirebought in, it decided it w anted the whole pie but none of the old-timers hanging ar ound, so it sent its people out to str ong-armAer ojet’s founders into r elinquishing their stock. All sold out butMalina, who happened to be in London at the time and who laterwrote that sunspot activity disrupted the telegr aph tr ansmission,such that he never got the offer. The solar storm proved a boon, how-ever, as he became a millionaire as a result. In the ’60s, von Kármáncalculated that if he himself had held onto his stock he w ould havebeen worth $12 million.But it was hard to resist the offer Aerojet General was making. Thewar was ending, the futur e was uncertain, the gr oup had achievedwhat they intended to achie ve with r ockets, and no w Aerojet wasoffering them $50,000 apiece for their stock. Charles Bartley remem-bers Parsons and Forman coming into his office at JPLquite excited,bragging how they had managed to get out of the compan y whilethey were still ahead. The w ar was over, they told him, and r ocketswere finished. The field had no futur e. They were going to start achain of laundromats with their mone y and become rich men. It isdifficult to understand how the two obviously passionate men couldhave given up their y outhful goals about r ockets so easily, particu-larly since they still hadn’t launched anything into space.In fact, Parsons had actually sold out befor e the war ended andintended to continue his hazar dous passions . In a letter datedDecember 14, 1944 to Gr ady McMurtry, Parsons wrote that he had“sold out at Aerojet, purchased 1003 [S. Orange Grove Ave.], and amstarting a ne w company engaged in chemical r esearch.” Evidently100sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"interested in other danger ous pursuits, he added that he w as tryingto get the e x-High Priestess R egina Kahl to r eturn to the lodge . Inapparent response to a question fr om McMurtry as to whether hecould send Parsons anything from Europe, Parsons replied “a witch,young, red headed . . .” His letters to McMurtry are full of referencesto Europe being “witch country.”The “lady-killer” Parsons did not confine his sexual largesse to hisprivate w orld, ho wever. Indeed, both he and F orman w ere w ell-known around the A erojet office as w ell, and the office manager scringed when the y saw the r andy pair come in because both menseemed to be w orking their way through the secretarial pool.

But the y werethe founders, and their pr esence had to be toler ated until they soldout and left. Zwicky claimed that Hale y had actually convincedPar sons to sell out prior to the Gener al Tire buyout, simply becauseof his pr oblems at the office , but v on Kármán and other s disagreewith Zwicky on this count. Parsons told Rypinski that he left becauseAer ojet was less inter ested in r esearch and mor e interested in pr o-duction and sales. However, Parsons did not get back into r esearchafter he left.Par sons and Forman formed Adastra Research, a small explosivescompany that was investigated for “espionage” when the tw o werecaught with a lar ge quantity of “x-nitr ate,” a powerful explosive. Itwas determined that the compound had been pr ocured for e xperi-mental reasons, and the charges were dropped. Parsons then went towork for the Vulcan Powder Company in Pasadena, where he wouldremain for the next two years.Back in New Mexico, Robert Goddard had his o wn problems. Atthe end of the w ar, he fell into a depr ession, became ill, and diedbefore the y ear w as out. Certainly his failur e with r ockets—andCaltech’s success—was a contributing factor.In late A ugust of 1945, Lou Goldstone br ought L. R on Hubbardover to meet P arsons, who lik ed Hubbard immediately. As noted,Hubbard had been the model for D. Vance Wimple in White’s Rocketto the Mor gue. He told a lot of w ar stories which, though har d tobelieve, were well-liked by most, and he fit right in with the unusualassortment of people who lived there.Hubbard had just come from the Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in SanFrancisco and complained of v arious ailments including rheuma-101The Return to South Orange Grove Ave.: 1942–1945"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"tism, arthritis, hemorrhoids, conjunctivitis, and aches in his side ,shoulder, stomach, and knee. After several hospital visits, Hubbardwas given a medical dischar ge from the Navy and began r eceivingfinancial benefits when he told them he could no longer practice hislivelihood of being a writer.The Parsons circle included not only a circuit connecting Hubbardand Cr owley but also one linking Cr owley to Lo vecraft, whomHubbard had met through Lovecraft biographer Frank Belknap Long.(Writers have tried for years to link Lovecraft and Crowley in one wayor another, but this is a dir ect connection that has not y et beenexplored.) In addition, Hubbard and Parsons associated with peoplein Pasadena who had met Clark Ashton Smith, one of Lo vecraft’sregular corr espondents, as w ell as of Cr owley’s “inner cir cle.”Lovecraft’s “The Colour Out of Space” had appeared in theSeptember 1927 issue of Amazing Stories, the publication Ed Formanhad written about, so Parsons had probably read it. He may also haveread Weird Tales, which regularly featured the work of Lovecraft inthe teens and tw enties. Judging b y Crowley’s remark in December1943 in his letter to Jane W olfe, this was simply the sort of “maga-zine trash” Parsons was reading.Par sons had begun his magical w ork with Betty, Helen’s youngersister, after Helen had left with Smith. His encouragement of an openrelationship, which demonstrated his evolution beyond petty humanjealousy, was to backfire on him, however, as Betty readily agreed totake up other lo vers and ended up with Hubbar d. The relationshipwas to be a source of extreme aggravation for Parsons, who suddenlyhad more than he could bear.Hubbard charmed P arsonage r esident Alv a R ogers, who, lik eHubbard, was a redhead. Indeed, Hubbard confided his belief thatall r edheads descended fr om the Neanderthal r ather than pur eHomo sapiens. “Needless to say,” Rogers wrote, “I was fascinated.”The redhead-Neanderthal connection is interesting to keep in mindwhen reading Williamson’s Darker Than You Think, the story ofwerewolves who return to their atavistic state. Rogers further wrote:It all began on an other wise undistinguished day in the late fall of1945 when we got word that L. Ron Hubbard was planning to waitout his terminal leave from the Navy at “The Parsonage” . . . Shortvisits by such pr o authors as Jack Williamson, Edmond Hamilton,Tony Boucher, and other were fairly frequent; but Ron was planningon an extended stay.102sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Ron arrived on a Sunday, driving an oldish Packard and haulinga house trailer which he parked on the grounds behind the house.He originally intended staying in the trailer , but within a few dayssomeone moved out of the house and he moved in.I liked Ron from the first.

About the only thing heseemed to take seriously and be prideful of was his membershipin the Explorers Club (of which he was the youngest member) whichhe had received after leading an expedition into the wilds of SouthAmerica, or some such godforsaken place.

He was aromantic, a poet—not a businessman. Hubbar d made a big impr es-sion on him, so much so that P arsons forgot his obligation and vio-lated his oath to the Or der, revealing to Hubbard the secrets of thehighest grades of the OTO—grades which P arsons himself ma y nothave actually held but merely had access to some of the documentsassociated with them. However, two of his letters refer to himself asholding this grade, so the matter is unclear. He may have been exag-gerating again.With the w ar ended and the business buy out, it seems P arsonshad a lot of time on his hands and thr ew himself into the magicalwork, possibly also as a distr action from and remedy for his painfulexperience with Betty and Hubbar d. The “magical partner” P arsonsenvisioned was to be his partner in a “w orking” of sexual magic—probably not a IX°, but one of his own devising that fell well outsidethe system of the OTO. Parsons was known to invoke spirits called ele-mentals, so-called because of their association with the four elementsof the ancients: Earth, Air, Water, Fire. The classical symbols associ-ated with each are usually gnomes, sylphs, mermaids, and salaman-ders, r espectively. These ar e, of cour se, just s ymbols, such thatmodern replacements for each could be found: F or example, UFOs,perhaps, would be a good replacement for sylphs.According to Cr owley, to summon an elemental r equires a lar ge107The Return to South Orange Grove Ave.: 1942–1945"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"amount of magical energy, the kind said to be gener ated by an VIII°working, the VIII° being a solo se xual rite, i.e., masturbation.

The Tarot corresponds to the Enochian system obtainedby Dr. Dee—the Trumps to the Aires, the Court Cards to the Gods,Seniors and Angels, and the numbers to the lesser angels.What it all boils down to is that Parsons experimented on his ownwith upper-degr ee OTOtechniques usually char acterized as “se xmagic,” i.e., to affect or bring about e vents. In addition, he r emainsthe best example in support of the OTO’s policy of keeping these tech-niques secret.108sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"sixAn Introduction to Enochian MagicFrom Parsons’ ritual references andother aspects of the occult world in which he so ardently participated,we can piece together the atmosphere surrounding his workings. Forexample, the Enochian s ystem referred to b y Parsons is a form ofmagic founded not b y the prophet Enoch but b y Dr. John Dee and Sir Edward Kelley in 16th-century England. Enochian magic is notnecessarily sexual in nature; in fact, its Elizabethan originators delib-erately refused injunctions towards sexual immorality.John Dee was born July 13, 1527 in Mortlak e, England, a smallvillage on the Thames just outside of London. Dee was a bright boy,enrolling at the university at the age of 15. He began a large privatelibrary at his home and eventually became proficient in various sci-ences including mathematics, navigation (much of which he learnedfirsthand during his world travels), astronomy, optics, and cartogra-phy. He also studied the hermetic sciences and was appointed to bethe Royal Astrologer to Elizabeth I.Dee had been imprisoned b y Queen Mary after dr awing up anunfavorable horoscope for her (at her r equest). Elizabeth pardonedhim, and in addition to his otherw orldly duties he also acted as anagent of espionage, signing his secret communiqués to her “007.” Heseems to have developed some sense of esoteric duty to Elizabeth’ sperson or position, as ther e is e vidence he idolized her as theEgyptian goddess Isis . Indeed, his “ esoteric duty” ma y even haveincluded an application of the famous INRIformula, the “key word”used in Crowley’s magic, in one of its many variations.Dee married relatively late, in 1574, at the age of 47. History doesnot record the name of the wife , who died the follo wing year. Heremarried, this time to a Jane Fromond, one of the Queen’s ladies-in-waiting. Dee’s studies continued independently, and by 1581 he felthe had exhausted all known sources of worldly knowledge and thatthe only way to continue his quest for knowledge was to turn to theotherworldly.A godly man, Dee w as a good Christian and a member of theChurch of England. He admir ed Enoch, the fir st man after the F all109An Introduction to Enochian Magic"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"said to have walked with God. According to tradition, Enoch was theauthor of se veral apocryphal books , in which he w as said to ha verecorded what he learned during these walks. These lost books werein fact pseudepigraphical, i.e., not written by Enoch, but Dee longedto find them and proposed to do it with the help of angels .Addressing God, he pr ayed, “I have read often in Th y books &records, how Enoch often injoyed Thy favour & conversation; withMoses thou was familiar; And also that to Abraham, Issack & Jocob,Joshua, Gideon, Esdras, Daniel, Tobias & sundry other s Thy goodangels w ere sent b y Th y disposition, to Instruct them, informethem, helpe them, y ea in worldly and domestick affair es, yea andsometymes to satisfie their desir es, doubtes & questions of Th ySecrete.”In his quest, Dee acquir ed from various sources several magical“shewstones,” with the intent of taking up cry stal-gazing. Try as hemight, however, he couldn’t do it, as he was just too logical a thinkerand his rational brain resisted all attempts to impose a tr ance stateupon it. He decided he needed a helper and enlisted the services ofEdward Kelley, who had changed his name fr om Talbott. Kelley hada reputation as an alchemist; it was said he had produced gold once.It also seems he was something of a rogue. John Weever recorded thefollowing adventure of Kelley’s in the 16th-century Ancient FunerallMonuments, the spelling of which appear s to have been somewhatmodernized:This diabolical questioning of the dead for the knowledge of futureaccidents was put into practice by the said Kelley, who, upon a cer-tain night in the park of W alton-le-Dale in the County of Lancasterwith one Paul Waring (his fellow companion in such deeds of dark-ness) invocated some of the Infer nal Regiment, to know cer tainpassages in the life, as also what might be known by the Devil’sforesight of the manner and time of the death of a noble young gen-tleman, as then in war dship. The black cer emonies of the nightbeing ended, Kelley demanded of one of the gentleman’s servantswhat corse was the last buried in Law chur chyard, a church there-unto adjoining, who told him of a poor man that was buried ther ebut the same day. He and the said Waring entreated this foresaidservant to go with them to the grave of the man so lately inter red,which he did; and withal did help them to dig up the carcase of thepoor caitiff, whom by their incantations they made him (or rathersome evil spirit thr ough his or gans) to speak, who deliver ed110sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"strange predictions concerning the said gentleman. I was told thisby the said serving-man, a secondary actor in that dismal abhorredbusiness, and divers gentlemen and others ar e now living inLancashire to whom he hath related this story. And the gentlemanhimself (whose memory I am bound to honor) told me a little beforehis death of this conjuration of Kelley, as he had it by relation fromhis said ser vant and tenant, only some cir cumstances except,which he thought not fit to come to his master’s notice.Kelley, called “the crop-eared wizard” because he had had his earscropped as a punishment for earlier sorceries, moved with his familyinto a room in Dee’s house, where they subsisted on a £50 per yearsalary paid by Dee.On a cold evening in 1582, March 8, Dee and Kelley sat down andgazed into one of the she wstones. Impatient, Dee soon got up andmoved to ward the fir e, but within 15 minutes K elley w as seeingangels. Dee came quickly but sa w nothing and became content toassume the role of scribe, recording what Kelley relayed he was seeing.According to Kelley, the angels sho wed him large tablets bearingunusual letter s, which supposedly formed the oldest language ofthem all: the language of the angels . Kelley described the tablets toDee, who wrote down what was said. The angel then pr oceeded todictate the lost books of Enoch to Kelley, by spelling them out letter-by-letter. The angel would point to a letter, and Kelley would tell Deewhich letter it was.During these tr ansmissions, Kelley was so afr aid that the mer emention of these letter s would be sufficient to inv oke demons, thathe only would call out the row and column of each letter as the angelpointed to it. Dee w ould then look up the corr esponding letter andwrite it down. There were many more tablets, Kelley told Dee, whichwere not dictated.The books completed, the angel next dictated the 30 “Aethyrs” (or“Aires”) and their 19 Calls , which are for summoning angels to thecaller, for the purpose of “scrying” or vie wing what w as in theAethyr. The first five Calls were considered so powerful that the angeldictated them backwards to avoid conjuring up the guardians of thecorresponding Aethyrs; the remainder were dictated in the usual way.The Aethyrs are likened to the spheres of the ancients, the plane-tary orbits thought to surr ound the earth. A ccording to ancientmythology and r eligion, souls ascending to hea ven had to passthrough each sphere in succession, aided b y a series of holy names111An Introduction to Enochian Magic"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"and passwords. Unsuccessful attempts led to reincarnation at best, orto hell. Tradition holds that many of the Aethyrs are guarded by harshangels, even demons, who have no patience with men or magicians.After the hazardous dictation process was completed, the angelprovided Kelley with the English tr anslations, which r equired thatDee had to go back over the entire collection of transcripts and sub-stitute the English. Although each Enochian letter has its Englishcounterpart, it is not a letter-for-letter substitution or a code. The let-ter correspondences were only pr ovided as a pr onunciation guide.An actual dictionary was dictated, and Dee had to tr anslate accord-ingly. Enochian is thus a language unto itself, with its own grammarand syntax. It is very succinct and has an odd relationship to Englishthat it does not have with other languages. One example of Enochianis the w ord “Babalon,” meaning “harlot” in Enochian, as in the“Whore of Babylon.” The Enochian s ystem being complicated, theentire process of dictation and tr anslation took se ven years, from1582 to 1589.Amazingly enough, considering the language’ s comple xity, theEnochian Calls translate into English remarkably well. Regardless ofthe fact that they were dictated backwards and forwards, and that thetranslations were only pr ovided later, Enochian turned out to be acoherent language previously unknown to man.The Calls, when translated, are quite evocative, and contain somevery beautiful passages. Although it could easily be claimed K elleywas making the whole thing up, the Calls were nothing at all like hisusual writing style, which was quite crude even when he wrote verse.It seems improbable for Kelley to have defrauded Dee in this regard,as the system is just too immense and well structured.Along with the Calls w ere dictated instructions , such as whenscrying or cry stal-gazing the tw o were to arr ange a special cedartable, around the perimeter of which w as inscribed in Enochian,“This is the place of the outpouring of forgotten treasure in the formof ecstasy. Only fire is substantial her e. This is the w ay of Babalonand of the Beast who is the first form. The eyes only need rest uponthe name of an y guardian and its r epresentative will speedily beencountered.” The whole thing is scrambled in the original, and thename “Babalon” is e xtremely so, in or der to avoid summoning theHarlot.In addition, a special ring and r obes had to be w orn. Some ofthese artifacts are preserved in the British Museum. The angels pro-vided additional messages as w ell, some of which w ere cause for112sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"great concern on the part of Dee and K elly. These communicationsparallel unorthodox messages received from 19th-century fairies and20th-century occupants of UFOs. For example, at one point Dee andKelley were told:1. That Jesus was not God.2. That no prayer ought to be made to Jesus.3. That there is no sin.4. That man’s soul doth go fr om one body to another childes quick-ening [i.e., reincarnation].5. That as many men and women as ar e now, have always been.6. That the generation of mankind fr om Adam and Eve, is not historical but allegorical.Such seemingly blasphemous messages made Kelley balk, and hegrew more and more reticent to continue with their work. Dee had adevil of a time keeping him on, despite the £5 0 salary. The stress ofthe constant scrying once sent K elley running into the str eet like amadman, at which point Dee had to catch him and calm him do wn.However, being a pious man, Dee had occasional misgivings him-self. At one point he burned his entire collection of “angelick” works,allegedly to find thr ee of his books intact a fe w days later. Anothertime Kelley knocked over a lamp and accidentally burned se veralvaluable manuscripts of Dee’s.Other messages w ere less oner ous, such as one instance inwhich the angel supposedly began dictating in Greek. Kelley, how-ever, did not know Greek and soon threatened to stop dictating ifthe angel per sisted with this “Gh ybbrish.” Nevertheless, enoughcame through for Dee to r ecognize the message as a w arning notto trust Kelley.According to the story, the angel later told Dee and Kelley to swapwives, but the tw o were so shock ed at this message that the y andtheir wives all signed a pact (at Dee’s prompting) never to reveal thismessage to an yone. As noted, the br eaking of r eligious and se xualtaboos, from the eating of meat and wine to incest and homose xual-ity, is considered a part of tantra. The shock is intended to decondi-tion the initiate from his usual lifestyle. In the case of Dee and Kelley,living in prudish Elizabethan England, it w as asking too much—atleast for now. They did finally persuade their wives to agree to thisseeming commandment from God: Dee recorded in his diary on May3, 1587, “I, John Dee, Edward Kelley and our two wives, covenanted113An Introduction to Enochian Magic"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"with God and subscribed the same , for indissoluble and inviolableunities, charity and friendship k eeping betw een us four , and allthings between us to be common, as God by sundry means willed usto do.”Dee and Kelley left Mortlake for a tour of Europe in 1583, contin-uing their work with the angels as they traveled. When they returnedin 1587, the y were horrified to see that a super stitious mob hadsacked Dee’s house and burned the contents, destroying most of hisvaluable library.Undeterred by such a faith-destr oying event, the tw o continued,their work with the Calls ending one da y when Kelley was scryingalone in the 7th Air e, during which time he r eceived the followingproto-thelemic message:I am the daughter of For titude and ravished ever y hour fr om myyouth. For behold, I am Understanding, and science dwelleth in me;and the heavens oppr ess me. They cover and desir e me with infi-nite appetite; for none that are earthly have embraced me, for I amshadowed with the Circle of the Stars, and covered with the morn-ing clouds. My feet ar e swifter than the winds, and my hands ar esweeter than the mor ning dew. My gar ments are from the begin-ning, and my dwelling place is in myself. The Lion knoweth notwhere I walk, neither do the beasts of the field understand me. Iam deflowered, yet a virgin; I sanctify and am not sanctified. Happyis he that embraceth me: for in the night season I am sweet, andin the day full of pleasure. My company is a harmony of many sym-bols, and my lips sweeter than health itself. I am a harlot[BABALON] for such as ravish me, and a vir gin with such as knowme not. Pur ge your str eets, O ye sons of men, and wash yourhouses clean; make yourselves holy , and put on righteousness.Cast out your old strumpets, and burn their clothes and then I willbring forth children unto you and they shall be the Sons of Comfortin the Age that is to come.The entire passage is r eminiscent of the gnostic te xt, “ThunderPerfect Mind,” unearthed at Nag Hammadi in 1945 but written atleast 1700 years earlier.This message w as the last str aw for K elley, and he finallysnapped, robbing Dee of a lar ge sum and lea ving town with Dee’swife. The two did not return but ended up in Germany, where Kelleyendeared himself to the Emperor. Focusing his attention increasingly114sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"on practical alchemy, Kelley was soon knighted but was later impris-oned (either for killing a man or simply to k eep him close to theEmperor), and died during an attempt to escape . Dee w as alsoimprisoned when James I, patron of the King James Bible, ascendedto the English throne in 1603. Despite his own personal, extrabibli-cal peccadilloes, the pious King James was scared of magic and puta quick end to Dee’s career as royal astrologer.Dee was subsequently put on trial for witchcr aft but was acquit-ted and spent his remaining years penniless. In 1608, he died, finan-cially ruined but spiritually whole , appar ently ha ving used theEnochian s ystem for little mor e than the satisfaction of his o wncuriosity. The paper s he had hidden a way near the end of his lifewere not found for 1 00 years, and his diary w as not found for 2 00years, but for at least one later student Dee’s personal tragedy wouldeerily appear to repeat itself.As is well known in the world of the esoteric and occult, cry stal-gazing is not the only w ay one may scry in the A ethyrs, as tantricenergy, or sex magick, may also be used to induce the same sort ofecstatic states that Kelley used so long ago. The provocative Parsonsused this method, as did his libidinous mentor Crowley, who claimedto be the reincarnation of Kelley, although that role would in realitybe played to Parsons’ Dee by another man in his personal drama. Inaddition, Crowley further heightened his awareness through the useof psychoactive drugs (see his Liber LXXXIVvel Chanokh). Crowley’sThe Diary of a Drug Fiend, both w ell-received and vilified, w asaccused of encour aging drug abuse . During the cour se of his life ,Crowley consumed massiv e amounts of alcohol, opium, cocaine ,hashish, peyote and heroin, to which he was addicted at his death.Like Dee and K elley, Parsons eventually found himself in tr ouble,seemingly at the hands of the infamous Babalon, the Enochian Whoreof Babylon, the traditional spirit of Rome who subjugated the childrenof Israel. Babalon, as the Harlot, is also a symbol of the material worldin general, the root “mater” also meaning “mother,” as in “Mother ofAbominations.” Adherents to the Jamaican r eligion of R astafari useher this sensual way, as any listener of reggae music might know. Asimilar symbol for certain gnostic sects in the Middle East w as the“Land of the Dead,” i.e., Egypt. Like Egypt, Babylon was the land ofcorruption to the composers of the Bible, as in Revelation 17:3-6:He [the angel] car ried my spirit away to the deser t. I saw theScarlet Woman sitting on the Beast with seven heads and ten115An Introduction to Enochian Magic"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"horns, covered with blasphemous names. The woman was clothedin purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stones andpearls, with a golden cup in her hand filled with abominations andthe unclean things of her fornication. On her forehead a name hadbeen written, a myster y: Babylon the Great, the mother of harlotsand of the abominations of the Earth. I saw the woman was drunkfrom the blood of the Saints, and from the blood of the martyrs ofJesus. Seeing her, I wondered greatly.According to Parsons, Babalon is the gnostic Sophia, slighted b yJohn the Revelator, but justifiably so, as she is still in her fallen state.John fails to offer her r edemption. She is also the Helen of SimonMagus mentioned b y Parsons in his Analysis By A Master of theTemple. She is the Chokmahof the Kabbalah, the Holy Wisdom whocries out in the first and eighth Psalms, folded into the Shekhinahofthe Hebrews.The Greek name Babylon is derived from the Semitic Bab-Il,mean-ing “the gate of God.” At one time or another every holy city believedit was at the center of the w orld, the mystical center where the gatebetween the upper and lo wer w orlds is located. So it is withJerusalem today for three of the world’s major religions, with Benaresfor the Hindus, and with Mecca and R ome. Like so many other reli-gious symbols, however, gates have a sexual symbolism as well.The Hebrew for “gate of God” is Bab-Al, usually written Bab-Elorsimply Babel. The name (actually a title) of God usually translated El(if tr anslated at all) is actually spelled with an “ A” (or alephinHebrew).Although he no doubt follo wed the Enochian spelling, Cr owleyclaimed to ha ve “corrected” “Babylon” to “Babalon” to giv e whatwas to him a meaningful gematria, a term used by medieval Jewishscholars to describe the ancient pr actice of substituting numbers forthe letters in a word or name and adding them up to get a significantresult. Gematriacomes from a Gr eek word meaning “to measur e(land),” and this practice dates at least to Bab ylon, when single let-ters were used to stand for numbers rather than spelling them out. Inan age that has used Ar abic numerals for centuries, the significanceof this achievement may be hard to appreciate.In this system of numeration, A = 1, B = 2, and so on. After the10th letter (“I” in the Hebrew and Greek alphabets, sometimes writ-ten as “Y”) there was no need for an 11 since “IA” stood for a 10 fol-lowed by a 1, which is the w ay we form numer als in our base 1 0116sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"system. Eleven, in fact, is Cr owley’s “number of magick.” The 1 1thletter is “K,” which, accor ding to gematria, equals 2 0, and so on.Thus BABYLON= 2 + 1 + 2 + 400 + 80 + 800 + 50 = 1335, whichis not a meaningful result. In the Book of R evelation the original Gr eek is BABYLONwith anupsilon (Y), rather than an alpha, while the final vowel is not omicronbut is the long “o,” omega. Crowley’s “corrected” spelling BABALON=2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 30 + 70 + 50 = 156, a number significant to JohnDee as the pr oduct of 12 and 13, the dimensions of the table uponwhich he received the Enochian alphabet from the angel.Crowley referred to the number 156 as that of the “City of thePyramids,” where initiates would spend the “Night of Pan.” Babylonwas known for its ziggur ats, stepped pyramids built for the gods todescend and humans to ascend, serving as a model for the biblicalTow er of Babel, also immortalized in the 16th car d of the Tarot. In the Enochian s ystem, the City of the Pyr amids lies in the 14thAire, above which (i.e ., 13th) is the Gar den of Nemo, Nemo beingEnochian for “Master of the T emple.” The 12th Air e belongs toBabalon, and the 11th is called the Holy City. The 10th Aire will be dis-cussed in a later chapter. While Dee and Kelley may have discoveredthe Enochian system and Babalon the Harlot, Parsons was to make thelatter more infamous.10117An Introduction to Enochian Magic10.

The surviving fr agments ofPar sons’ Babalon W orking have been cir culated since the da ys ofmimeograph machines, and ar e widely posted on the W orld WideWeb. They are not a part of Freedom Is A Two-Edged Sword, thoughthe near futur e may see collected writings of John P arsons printedunder one cover.The working began January 4, 1946. At 9 p.m. Parsons wrote, “I fol-lowed this procedure for eleven days, from January 4 to 15,” which isactually 12 days. Presumably, Parsons miscounted and carried on theworking for one e xtra day, a simple mistak e difficult to belie ve of arocket scientist.To begin the working, Parsons chose one of the squar es from theEnochian “Air Tablet” (there are four 12-by-13 tablets, one for eachelement), also known as the “Great Watch-Tower of the East.” He didnot record which of the 156 possible squares he chose. After prepar-ing the other magical w eapons, at 9 p.m. he prepared and conse-crated his “Air Dagger.” An actual dagger purchased for this purpose,the weapon, he said, was the “special talisman of the operation.”Par sons then copied the s ymbols contained within the chosensquare onto virgin parchment. These symbols consist of one of theseven planetary signs, one of the 12 zodiacal signs, a unique permu-tation of the four signs of the elements, and an Enochian letter in thecenter. Present as “Scribe” for the entir e operation was none otherthan Hubbard, in what w ould eventually resemble the Dee-K elleyoperation. The ritual was ready to begin.Par sons first invoked the “P entagram of Air ,” a fiv e-pointed startraced in the air with the dagger. It starts at the upper right-hand pointof the star, representing water, goes left to wards air, then tr aces theremainder of the star thr ough fire (lower right), spirit (top), earth119The Babalon Working: January–February 1946"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"(lower left), then back to water. As he proceeds in the ritual, the magi-cian must visualize the outline of the pentagram in brilliant purple (dif-ferent for each element inv oked) as w ell as the s ymbol of air in thecenter. This ritual includes the oft-hear d recitation invoking the fourarchangels as representatives of the four cardinal directions, and hencethe four elements. “Before me, Raphael; Behind me, Gabriel,” etc.Par sons probably should ha ve invoked with the he xagram next,which is the w ay the rite usually goes , but he does not r ecord thisbeing done. It may be that he assumed this step w as understood, orthat he deliberately left it out of his writing to deter prying eyes fromrepeating his oper ation. There are hexagrams invoked later in theoperation, during the inv ocation of the “Six Senior s,” and he ma yhave felt these were sufficient.Next Parsons recited from memory the “Invocation of the BornlessOne,” a short invocation translated by Crowley and appearing at thebeginning of his and Mathers’ translation of the Goetia, or Lesser Keyof Solomon. It starts:Thee I invoke, the Bornless One.Thee, that didst create the Earth and the Heavens.Thee, that didst create the Night and the Day.Thee, that didst create the Darkness and the Light.Thou art Osorronophris, whom no man hath seen at any time.Thou art Jabas.Thou art Japos.Thou hast distinguished between the Just and the Unjust.Thou didst make the Female and the Male.Thou didst produce the Seed and the Fruit.Thou didst form Men to love one another, and to hate one another.I am Mosheh [Moses] Thy Prophet, unto whom Thou didst commitThy Mysteries, the Ceremonies of Ishrael [sic].Thou didst pr oduce the moist and the dr y, and that which nour-isheth all created Life.Dear Thou Me, for I am the Angel of Paphr o Osorronophris; this isThy True Name, handed down to the Prophets of Ishrael . . .”The original inv ocation is tr aditionally ascribed to Moses , but itbears an Egyptian flavor reflecting the mysteries of Egypt, into whichthe Bible says Moses was initiated. Later v ersions “corrected” someof the spellings to bring them in line with Crowley’s w ork:“Osorronophris” became ASAR UN-NEFER(a form of Osiris), for example.120sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"It would have been this corr ected version that P arsons used. Thecomplete text can be found in “Liber Samekh” in Cr owley’s Magick,and represents the lengthy rite Crowley used at Boleskine to attain tothe Knowledge and Conv ersation of his Holy Guar dian Angel andthus to the 6°= 5 of the A∴A∴, in the v ersion quoted abo ve.Although evidently undocumented, it is possible that success duringthis ritual would have allowed Parsons to claim the 6°=5 .Par sons next recorded a “Conjuration of Air,” a “Consecration ofthe Air Dagger” (apparently a redundancy), and the Key Call of theThird Aire, the latter of which is not to be confused with the elementAir. The dagger is one of the four standard magical weapons used bythe magician. The other three are the pentacle (or disk), the cup, andthe wand.11It seems that P arsons actually r ecited the “Thir d Key” (or Thir dCall), which is different from the Key Call of the Third Aire, as thereis only one Key Call for all 30 Aires. However, the Third Call is appro-priate to summon EXARP, the Angel of the Air T ablet, so it seems tohave been a mistake in nomenclature only. In other words, Parsonsused the correct call but called it by the wrong name in his notes. TheThird Key, in English, is:Behold! Saith your God! I am a circle on whose hands stand twelveKingdoms. Six ar e the seats of living br eath: the r est are sharpSickles, or the Horns of Death. Wherein the creatures of earth areand are not, except in mine own hands; which sleep and shall rise!In the first I made ye stewards, and placed ye in twelve seats ofgovernment: giving unto ever y one of you power successively overthe 456 true ages of time: to the intent that fr om the highest ves-sels and the cor ners of your gover nments you might work myPower, pouring down the fires of life and increase continually on theearth. Thus you are become the skirts of Justice and Truth.In the name of the same your God, lift up, I say , yourselves!Behold! His Mercies flourish, and His Name is become mightyamong us. In whom we say: Move! Descend! And apply yourselvesunto us as unto the par takers of His Secr et Wisdom in yourCreation.All this invocation should have been done from memory. Next wasan Invocation of God and of the King associated with the Air Tablet.121The Babalon Working: January–February 194611. See Cr owley’s Liber A vel ARMORUMin Magickfor instr uctions for constr ucting eachweapon as well as other magical accessories."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The Secret Name of God associated with the Air T ablet is ORO-IBAH-AOZPI, meaning “He who cries aloud in the place of desolation.” TheKing associated with the Air Tablet is named BATAIVAH, which means“He whose v oice seems to ha ve wings.” These odd names ar e allformed from the letter s on the Enochian tablets tak en in differ entorder, much like a seek-and-find puzzle in the newspaper.Par sons next invoked the Six Senior s of the Air T ablet, whosenames are HABIORO, AAOZXAIF, HTNMORDA, AHAOZAPI, AVTOTAR,andHIPOTGA. They are equivalent to the “airy” parts of Mars, Jupiter, theMoon, Venus, Mercury, and Saturn, r espectively—six of the se ven“planets” visible to the nak ed eye, the seventh (the King) being theSun, the same as the se ven days of the w eek, albeit in a differ entorder. The Kings and Seniors are each invoked with their own specialhexagram, in this case a He xagram of Air. Thus Parsons drew sevenconsecutive hexagrams in the air, visualizing the appropriate namesand colors and pronouncing the names, then addressing each in turn,individually, with certain Enochian greetings. Again, from memory.The next step is rather hazy in the record. Parsons says he invoked“blank by blank and blank to visible appearance.” OTOscholars havefilled in the first and last blanks, but the middle one remains a mys-tery. This first is written as RDZA, by which is sur ely meant ARDZA,Enochian for “He who protects,” one of the “Calvary Cross” names,another long series that forms a certain pattern of letter s traced outon the four elemental tablets.ARDZAis the name that controls the force of the “Air of Air” (upperleft) quadrant of the Air Tablet. This force, not recorded by Parsons,is named IDOIGO, “He who sits on the Holy Throne.” Since the upperleft is where the letters ARDZA(in Enochian) appear on the Air Tablet,the proximate name IDOIGOis probably what Parsons left unrecordedin the middle blank, as that is the only possible complement toARDZAin this rite.The last blank is filled in with the name EXARP, again the Angel ofthe Air Tablet, who controls all forces associated with the element ofAir, the Kings and Senior s being invoked merely to preside over therite. Parsons would have been facing the dir ection of the pr evailingwinds in Pasadena while invoking EXARPand, indeed, throughout theentire ceremony.12The next statement is the simplest in Parsons’ magical record, yetit is also the most important. P arsons merely writes, “Invocation of122sex and rockets12.

P arsons here was“energizing,” even “fertilizing” the little par chment square bearingthe chosen square from the Air Tablet, the form s ympathetic magictakes: a symbolic fertilizing of Parsons’ desire through a very literalapplication of the usual means of fertilization. Crude , perhaps, buttraditional.Par sons then wrote “Invocation with [Air] Dagger,” presumably aninvocation of the elemental he wished to attr act, although he doesnot say. Lastly ar e the “License to Depart,” a purification, and thebanishings, which ar e a sign that the rite is o ver. The License toDepart is in the Goetia, or Lesser Key of Solomon, which Mathers andCrowley had translated years earlier. The first English-language edi-tion appeared in 1903.The License to Depart runs, “O thou Spirit N. [name of spirit, in thiscase EXARP], because thou has diligently answered unto my demands,and hast been v ery ready and willing to come at m y call, I do her elicense thee to depart unto thy proper place; without causing harm ordanger unto man or beast. Depart, then, I say, and be thou very readyto come at my call, being duly e xorcised and conjured by the sacredrites of magic. I charge thee to withdraw peaceably and quietly, andthe peace of God be e ver continued between thee and me! Amen!”The invocation also occur s in Cr owley’s later Magick, as w ell as inother texts by various authors.Banishings are as equally inv olved as the inv ocations, as the yinvolve recreating (or, rather, “erasing”) the various hexagrams andfinally the pentagram in reverse of the original way they were traced.Needless to say, this is a very long ceremony, lasting at least an hour,and again, all fr om memory. All the Kings and Senior s have to bebanished, one at a time . Interestingly, the pr ocedure outlined her efrom the initial pentagram to the final banishing is slightly differ entfrom the textbook Enochian invocations. Parsons must have impro-vised somewhat.In 1943, Parsons had published a brief poem in the Oriflamme, anOTOpublication:I hight Don Quixote, I live on peyote,marijuana, morphine and cocaine,123The Babalon Working: January–February 1946"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"I never know sadness, but only a madnessthat burns at the heart and the brain.I see each charwoman, ecstatic, inhuman,angelic, demonic, divine.Each wagon a dragon, each beer mug a flagonthat brims with ambrosial wine.As documented by John Symonds and Robert Anton Wilson, nar-cotics and hallucinogens were a basic staple of Crowley’s magical diet,as the y e xist in esoteric cer emonies of se veral r eligions. Cr owleyrecorded using these drugs in his Confessions, as well as in the pub-lished portions of his Magical Record. Within the world of magick, itis well known that it is easier to induce astr al vision when one alter-nately dulls and e xcites the senses b y chemical means . Indeed, therole of drugs in magick is common, and it is fairly certain they were apart of the Babalon Working. In The Book of Law, (AL II:22), for exam-ple, Crowley wrote, “To worship me [Nuit] tak e wine and str angedrugs whereof I will tell my prophet, & be drunk thereof!” In addition,Helen Parsons Smith told an intervie wer that Parsons got into drugsafter their split in 1943, the same year he wrote his Don Quixote poemand three years before the Babalon Working. Apparently she had beenhis anchor to r eality, and, once she w as gone, he was wide open tojust about anything. She continued to follo w the path of white mag-ick, she said, while he turned down another, darker path.Par sons’ drug use also manifests itself in “Nar cissus,” one of hispoems from his later collection Songs for the Witch Woman, which isdedicated to Cameron, the woman Parsons would claim to be the ele-mental he had purportedly inv oked during the Babalon W orking.“Narcissus” reads:Drug me with drugsSlow acting, sensuous, sweet,Co-mingle gin and musk,Hashish and amber,Let me drink and breatheAnd hear slow, devious musicUntil arousedTo subtle, languorous moods,Until I seeOchre and mazarine and purple124sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Emit lascivious sounds.Then I shall goThrough dark and gothic ruins,Gray and golden mistsDown to a forest, greenWith an old dream.I shall go nakedAnd magnolia and oleanderDatura and jasmine,When blossoms will open and vaginally flowerIn infinite time, for a relative hour,Whose white, subliminal flowersWill caress my breasts.And I shall perform statelyPhallic arabesquesIn the moonlight,Pale and white.The possibly drug-enhanced w orking continued the e vening ofJanuary 5, when Parsons noted “a strong windstorm beginning sud-denly about the middle of the fir st invocation,” which was no sur-prise, as EXARPis the Angel of the AirTablet. In writing, the “firstinvocation,” Parsons was referring to the fact that he r epeated theentire rite after finishing it the fir st time. The entire process took afull two hours, such that Parsons must have been reciting at break-neck speed to finish so soon.On January 6, Parsons continued the invocation, which means heran through the entire rite twice. The windstorm also continued. OnJanuary 7, he inv oked twice mor e, and the wind subsided. A t thispoint he began pla ying Sergei Prokofiev’s Violin Concerto No. 2asbackground music; the actual recording of which is still a vailable tothe diligent searcher.13The w orking continued, and on January 8 P arsons wr ote,“Invoked twice, using blood” (pr esumably as a substitute for the125The Babalon Working: January–February 194613.

Prokofiev (1891–1953) was still alive atthe time. Lasting just over 34 minutes, it is a haunting r ecording, though sentimental inplaces. It is unclear whether the Scribe restarted the record when it finished, or if the par-ticipants just allowed it to r un until it stopped.

In this sex magick, it seems he “invokedthe w and” (gained an er ection) but deliber ately denied himselfrelease so the secretions (sperm) created would be absorbed by thebody, a pr actice found in tantr a. This “magical masturbation” w asevidently carried out in front of the Scribe, i.e., Hubbard.On January 10, Parsons invoked twice and r etired to bed ar ound11 p.m. He was awakened at midnight b y nine loud, une xplainableknocks.14When Parsons got out of bed to inv estigate the knocks, henoticed a lamp la y smashed on the floor , which should ha ve beentaken as an omen, as it is not the desired result and represents a mag-ical misdirection of energy. Parsons recognized as much in his record,but continued regardless. Considering Hubbard was the Scribe duringthis ritual, it is an interesting coincidence that HUBARDmeans “livinglamps” in Enochian, as is the fact that a knocked-over lamp featuresin Dee and Kelley’s enterprise as well.On January 11, Parsons wrote, “Invoked twice, using blood,” andon the 12th, “Inv oked twice. A heavy windstorm.” The inv ocationsand the windstorm both continued on the 13th.January 14 w as the second-to-last da y of the w orking—a veryinteresting day. As Parsons began invoking at 9p.m., the electricitywent out. Parsons records that “another magician who had been stay-ing in the house and studying with me w as carrying a candle acrossthe kitchen when he w as struck strongly on the right shoulder, andthe candle knocked out of his hand.” According to Cameron and oth-ers, this other magician was Hubbard, which is odd in that Hubbardwas consistently referred to as “Scribe” throughout Parsons’ record ofthe Babalon Working, rather than “magician,” indicating the r ecordmay have been garbled here.He [the other “magician”] called us [the “us” appar ently referringto Parsons and some unknown other] and we observed a brownishyellow light about seven feet high in the kitchen.

His [the other magician’s] rightarm was paralyzed for the rest of the night.The final day was January 15, when Parsons wrote:At this time the Scribe [Hubbar d] developed some sor t of astralvision, describing in details an old enemy of mine of whom he hadnever heard [Captain Kynette, the car-bombing cop?], and later theguardian for ms of Isis and the Ar changel Michael. Later , in myroom, I heard the [nine] raps again, and a buzzing, metallic voicecrying “let me go fr ee.” I felt a gr eat pressure and tension in thehouse that night, which was also noticed by the other occupants.There was no other phenomena, and I admit a feeling of disap-pointment.Par sons sleepily performed the License to Depart, and the spiritwas free to return to its home. In his record of the working Parsonswrote that the “tension and unease continued for four days” and thathe didn’t know what to do next.Around this time , Jane W olfe wrote to Cr owley, “Last e vening,when Jack brought me these various papers for me to post to y ou, Isaw, for the first time, the small boy, or child. This is it that is bewil-dered, does not quite kno w when to tak e hold in this matter , orwhere, and is completely bowled over by the ruthlessness of Smith—Smith, who has a master hand when it comes to dealing with thisboy.”Also around this time, Wilfred Smith described his o wn state toCrowley:Ill started, ill maintained, ill ter minated.

There arefour Kerubs for each of the four Tablets, and 12 Lesser Kerubic Angelsand 16 Lesser Angels for each as w ell, part of the complicated (buthighly structured) system.The Priest’s Call in the Gnostic Mass is a short recitation in Greekthat the Priest makes when the Priestess is behind the veil.

The windstorm is very interesting, but thatis not what I ask ed for,” he wrote Crowley. On January 18, P arsonsand Hubbard went into the Mojave Desert to relax. At sunset the feel-ing of tension suddenly left P arsons, and he turned to Hubbar d “inabsolute certainty that the oper ation was accomplished” and saidsimply, “It is done ,” echoing Jesus’ “It is finished” spok en on thecross.At this time, Grady McMurtry, whom Parsons met at a science fic-tion meeting, r eturned from England and mo ved to San F rancisco128sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"with the intent of starting a lodge there. He spent the week of January14th to the 2 0th at 1003 S. Or ange Grove, interviewing the v ariousmembers of the lodge to determine what w as going on and whatcould be done about it. Cr owley had sent him in to see if ther e wasany way to fix the mess he had been hearing about. McMurtry’ sreport is dated January 25 and includes signed statements fr omPar sons and several others. Parsons was surprised to see McMurtry,who had left as an inferior in the Or der, return as his superior.McMurtry told Crowley that Parsons was “. . . a man of integrityand aspiration, all he lacks is an e xperienced instructor. He is easilythe outstanding personality of the whole group.” He also mentioneda new female interest of Parsons’ named Helen Parker, but apparentlynothing of note developed between the two.McMurtry’s report found the lodge in a mess, as many of the mem-bers were bickering about almost everything, yet he saw hope for thefuture. Parsons, he said, was “shaking the debris of A gape from hisshoulders and preparing to make a clean start with a more ambitiousprogram than ever. A lesser man would have washed his hands of thewhole affair.”McMurtry further outlined a pr ogram of adv ertising, initiation,training, and performance of the Gnostic Mass as the immediateneeds of the lodge . Parsons wanted to incorpor ate the OTO, whichMcMurtry endorsed. Parsons would stay in Pasadena with the AgapeLodge, while McMurtry would return to San Francisco and open theThelema Lodge. This plan did not materialize until 1977, long afterPar sons’ death.Par sons w anted to pur sue the adv ertising campaign as a“Synagogue of Satan”; McMurtry thought this angle w as fine forsome but not all-inclusive. He wanted to pursue a less sensationalis-tic campaign in San Francisco, modeled after the Abbey of Thelemain Cefalu, Sicily.McMurtry closes b y referring to A gape Lodge as “Hodge P odgeLodge,” which he sa ys the r esidents of 1 003 S. Or ange Grove call“Ghastly Gables.” Neither title is flattering. P arsons’ attached state-ment says that he sold the big home to finance an e xplosives manu-facturing plant, such that he e vidently didn’t o wn the house v erylong. Another member, Max Schneider, with whom Parsons seems tohave been bickering the most, said Parsons was trying to “combine aLodge, a pr ofess house, and a r ooming house for thrill seek ers allunder one roof.” The other statements speak well of Parsons, but saythat the influence of Smith was still too strong.129The Babalon Working: January–February 1946"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"One interesting remark was made b y Roy Leffingwell, who toldMcMurtry that P arsons w as “impr egnating statuettes with a vitalforce by invocation, and then selling the statuettes .” He further saidthat Parsons reminded him “of the y oung Crowley—he is so set onoverturning the present system that he will stop at nothing.” No men-tion is made of the Babalon Working in any of McMurtry’s reports.Par sons’ disappointment at the r esults of the w orking had beenalleviated by the ne xt month, when, on F ebruary 23, 1946, he tri-umphantly wrote to Crowley, “I have my elemental! She turned upone night after the conclusion of the Oper ation, and has been withme since, although she goes back to Ne w York next week. She hasred hair and slant gr een eyes as specified. She is an artist, str ong-minded and determined, with strong masculine characteristics and afanatical independence. If she returns she will be dedicated as I amdedicated!”The elemental w as Marjorie Elizabeth Camer on, sprung fr omPar sons’ head like Sophia from the Godhead or P allas Athena fromZeus. She actually arriv ed at the lodge befor e Parsons left for thedesert with Hubbar d. McMurtry had just left, and the BabalonWorking w as still in pr ogress (but w as not kno wn to Camer on).Cameron came back tw o weeks later after some friends of P arsonstracked her down at the emplo yment office. This time she came tostay.Par sons described Cameron as an “air of fire type with bronze redhair, fiery and subtle, determined and obstinate, sincere and perverse,with e xtraordinary per sonality, talent, and intelligence .” Sheremained in the dark about the Babalon W orking until long after itwas finished—even though she was to participate in its ne xt phase.Par sons made her a protective talisman, which she wore around herneck for years until police took it a way because it had a potent poi-son sealed inside.Par sons exultantly wrote in his notes that Camer on answered allthe requirements of the elemental he had inv oked. She adopted themagical name “Candida” (the Latin root of “candid”), calling herself“Candy” for short. He wr ote that she “demonstr ated the natur e ofwoman to you [referring to himself] in such unequiv ocal terms thatyou [Parsons] should have no further r oom for illusion on the sub-ject.” Parsons and Cameron would marry in October of that year, justeight months later.

An “air of fire type,” as Parsons calledher, is typically a Leo in the Enochian s ystem (on the Fir e Tabletrather than the Air T ablet), and is associated with the Prince ofWands in the Tarot.Cameron had served in the WAVESduring WWII, at which time shehad been stationed in W ashington, D.C. She had also serv ed as anaide to the Joint Chiefs of Staff ther e, after entering the Na vy as anApprentice Seaman on December 9, 1942 at Chicago, Illinois . Shewas honorably discharged from Washington, D.C. as a photographeron November 16, 1945, after which she moved to Los Angeles, whereone of her Na vy friends took her to the A gape Lodge. Interestingly,Cameron, Hubbard and Heinlein were all in the Navy. A Freedom ofInformation Act request revealed that the FBIhad no file on her.From January 19 (the very day Cameron arrived!) to February 27,Par sons daily recorded that he “invoked the Goddess BABALONwiththe aid of m y magical partner, as was proper to one of m y grade.”131The Babalon Working: January–February 1946"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The magical partner was, of course, Cameron, though some writershave tried to make it Hubbard, who was in actuality not present. Thegrade Parsons referred to is the IX° of the OTO, a rite involving sex-ual intercourse in much the w ay that the VIII° involves masturba-tion. However, Parsons evidently never held this grade, nor was thisa IX°working, based on the w ay Crowley ran the higher gr ades inthe 1940s. At that time, Agape Lodge was the only operating lodgeof the OTO. Members there could request the grade, as it were, andCrowley would confirm their right to w ork it despite the fact thatthey had not attained the intermediate grades. However, just becausea few members were working with the IX° material does not meanthey could demonstr ate attainment, as ther e were no other legiti-mate IX° members present to guide them and confirm their r esults.The Babalon Working in particular was far too unorthodox to havebeen a part of this degr ee; it was specially designed by Parsons forthis one purpose.According to Camer on, the rite consisted of her and P arsonsspending two weeks in bed. Unfortunately, Parsons did not record thedetails of his daily inv ocations, or if he did the y have not survived.Cameron said the two talked incessantly: “He educated me . . . that’swhat he w as supposed to do.” She also r elated that he made heraware she “had a mission in the world.” Of course, she was ignorantof the entire Babalon Working, of which she was supposed to be theelemental invoked, until well past its completion.On February 27, Camer on went back to Ne w York to visit herboyfriend, a photogr apher named Napoleon, spending tw o w eeksthere, during which time she dumped him. She later said she returnedto Pasadena when she discovered she was pregnant by Parsons. Theday after she left for New York, Parsons returned to the Mojave Desertwithout Hubbard, who had gone a way for awhile, perhaps to the VAhospital in San Francisco. Parsons invoked Babalon in the desert, pre-sumably through a solo sexual rite of some sort, though he does notsay. What r esulted was phenomenal: “The pr esence of the Goddesscame upon me,” he wrote, “and I was commanded to write the fol-lowing communication.”The communication Parsons was commanded to write w as Liber49, often mistakenly referred to as The Book of Babalon, of which itis only a part. Liber 49is too long to reproduce here, but it has beenreproduced widely in print and on the internet in unauthorized v er-sions.

Besides being two sevens side-by-side, 77is 7 ×11, and 11, as we have already seen, is the number of Crowley’smagick.Par sons came to see Liber 49as the fourth chapter of The Book ofthe Law. Parsons saw the four chapters as corresponding to the fourletters of the ineffable name of God: YHWH, the Hebrew Yod Hé VauHé. He assigned one chapter to each letter and to what each letterrepresented: Father, Mother, Son, Daughter , or God, Holy Ghost,Christ, and the gnostic Sophia, the Puer, Vir, Puella, Mulier ofLiber36.Of the 77 original verses of Liber 49, 73 survive.

The sign of Apophis and T yphon(given). L.V.X., Lux, the Light of the Cross.”During the ritual, the magician must adopt at each stage of theanalysis certain postures. Crossed arms, for example, represent Osirisslain, as the posture a corpse takes during burial. The entire ritual isrecorded by Crowley in Magickand elsewhere. The gods invoked areEgyptian gods.INRIis not a word but an acronym, representing the initials of themessage Pontius Pilate had nailed upon the cross in the gospel story:Iesus Nazaraeus Rex Iudaeorum, Latin for “Jesus of Nazareth, King ofthe Jews.” The acronym is often seen depicted in paintings of the cru-cifixion, possibly arising as a painter’ s expedient. Medieval clericsmanipulated the letters to find different phrases that described Jesuswhile conforming to the same acronym.Mystics and alchemists found other, less orthodox interpretationsas well. In Morals and Dogma, Albert Pike gives a few possible mean-ings of INRI, withholding the one which he sa ys Masons learn whenthey attain the 18th degr ee of Scottish Rite F reemasonry, known asKnight Rose Croix (Rose Cross). The meanings Pik es does give are:Igne Natura Renovatur Integra(All of Natur e is R enewed by Fire);Igne Nitrum Roris Invenitur(The Cleanser of Fire Comes Like Dew);and the Jesuits’ alleged Iustum Necare Reges Impius(To Judge not butthe Impiety of Royalty).22138sex and rockets22.

Parsons recited the part ofthe Priest, and Camer on (representing Babalon) r ecited the part ofthe Priestess:THE PRIEST: “O cir cle of Stars [the Milky W ay] whereof our Father[the sun] is but the younger br other, mar vel beyond imagination,soul of infinite space, befor e whom T ime is ashamed, the mindbewildered, and the understanding dark, not unto Thee may weattain, unless Thine image be Love.

Letme be drunken on the wine of your fornications; let your kisses wan-ton me to death.

The Seventh Call in English is:The East is a house of Virgins singing praises among the flames offirst glory [the rising sun] wherein the Lord hath opened his mouth;and they are become 28 living dwellings [the phases of the moon,hence days] in whom the str ength of man r ejoiceth; and they ar eapparelled with ornaments of brightness, such as work wonders onall creatures.

InPar sons’ notes he has replaced “IAD” with “BABALON.”The sixth invocation was from Crowley’s play Tannhäuser, alter-nating v erses originating with the w orshiper and his goddess . AWagnerian opera, Tannhäuserwas based on a 13th-century Germanepic poem. The main character, Tannhäuser, was a mortal who spentsome time as the goddess V enus’ lover but e ventually left her toreturn to earth and the sweetheart of his youth. Tannhäuser inadver-tently reveals his try st with Venus, a disclosur e that means certaindeath. His mortal love, Elisabeth, pleads for his life, and he is sparedbut banished as punishment for his deed. Alone, he longs for Venus.She hears him, and is about to r eturn him to her when Elisabethintervenes once again. Tannhäuser is redeemed, and is escorted b yangels to paradise.Here again, P arsons and Camer on probably took turns r ecitingtheir respective lines. Parsons played the part of T annhäuser, whileCameron was Venus. Parsons began the romantic interlude:Isis art thou, and from thy life are fedAll showers and suns, all moons that wax and wane,All stars and streams, the living and the dead,The mystery of pleasure and of painThou art the mother, thou the speaking seaThou art the earth, and its fertility,Life, death, love, hatred, light, darkness return to theeTo Thee!Hathoor am I, and to my beauty drawnAll glories of the Universe bow down,The blossom and the mountain and the dawnFruits blush, and women, our creations crown142sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"I am the priest[ess], the sacrifice, the shrineI the love and life of the divineLife, death, love, hatred, light, darkness are surely mine, Are Mine!Venus art thou, the love and light of ear th,The wealth of kisses, the delight of tearsThe barren pleasures never came to bir th,The endless infinite delight of years.Thou art the shrine at which my long desir eDevoured me with intolerable fire.Thou wert song, music, passion, death upon my lyr e—My lyre.I am the Grail and I the glor y now;I am the flame and fuel of thy br eastI am the star of God upon thy br ow;I am the queen, enraptured and possessed,Hide thee sweet river, welcome to thee, seaOcean of love that shall encompass theeLife, death, love, hatred, light, darkness return to me—To me!After the completed invocation, which was more like a bard’s lovepoem, Parsons burned the Enochian Air T ablet he had used in theJanuary stage of this w orking. He then smashed a small statue ofPan, which had been a fa vorite possession. He r ecorded that at thesame instant the r oof on his guest house caught fir e and was dam-aged, apparently attributing this destruction to supernatur al forces,although the burning parchment may have had something to do withit as well.Regarding such sacrifices as the smashed statue , Crowley’s LiberAstarte, verse 37, reads:Having made by thine Ingenium a talisman or pantacle to representthe particular Deity, and consecrated it with infinite love and car e,do thou burn it ceremonially before the shrine, as if thereby givingup the shadow for the substance. But it is useless to do thisunless thou do r eally in thine hear t value the talisman beyond allelse that thou hast.Crowley noted in his Confessions, “I have noticed that every time143The Babalon Working: March 1946"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"I receive an important initiation, some cherished article mysteriouslydisappears. It may be a pipe, a pen or what not: but it is alw ays anobject which is impregnated with my personality by constant use orspecial veneration.

The theory is that the elementals or familiar spir-its in attendance on the Magician e xact, so to speak, a tip on allimportant occasions of r ejoicing.” In such magical w orkings, evi-dently, if y ou don’t offer something to the spirits , they will tak e itanyway.At 1 1:30 p.m. that same night, P arsons prepared three questionsas directed, and at midnight he ask ed them of Babalon (and w asanswered through Hubbard).How can I communicate dir ectly with BABALON, hear her , seeher, feel her, be sure that I am working aright?At the altar in meditation, as you know how.

Keep your faith, think not over much.While meditating the following morning, Parsons was interruptedby one of his tenants , whom he then cur sed “in the Anglo-Sax onfashion.” The man became ill, and Parsons realized he had erred. Heapologized to him, but the day continued badly. That night Babalonpurportedly continued her message, but the speaker, curiously, seemsto be another (all parenthetical remarks are copied from the original):In the presence of our Lord PAN, at the feet of Our Lady BABALON,at the feet of Her (servants?)

KarlGermer thought the sign “imprinted upon it” to be a small cir cle inside of which wasinscribed an inver ted triangle—the sign for water , but inside a cir cle. Cameron remem-bered otherwise.25.

Guard!The instruction was followed by “a prophecy” of unknown length,which Parsons deliberately omitted recording.Directly following the message , Parsons records instead a poementitled “The Birth of Babalon” that he wr ote as a means b y whichto invoke Babalon. It is unclear at which point in these pr oceedingshe used it, but it ma y have been the seventh part of the invocation,as a six-fold invocation makes little sense here. Parsons also seems tohave ignored the instructions to burn it, already noted.A longish, well-composed poem, “The Birth of Babalon” begins:What is the tumult among the stars that have shone so still till now?What are the furrows of pain and wrath upon the immor tal brow?Why is the face of God turned grey and his angels all grown white?What is the terrible ruby star that burns down the crimson night?What is the beauty that flames so bright athwar t the awful dawn?She has taken flesh, she is come to judge the thrones ye rule upon.Quail ye kings for an end is come in the bir th of BABALON.Afterwards, Parsons expressed his confidence in the working, butwrote, “Now I can do no mor e than pray and wait.” On the sixth ofMarch, Parsons recorded in a letter to Crowley:I hardly know how to tell.I am under the command of extreme secrecy.I have had the most impor tant and devastating experience ofmy life between February 2nd and March 4th.I believe it was the r esult of the 9th [degr ee] working with thegirl [Cameron] who answered my elemental summons.

There is no danger,save in weakness or pride.Although he claimed there was no danger, in his metaphysical life,the fearless Parsons thus showed the same methodology he used inhis rocket propulsion work, a tenaciousness in testing and a thrill-seeker’s lack of caution concerning what he ma y “conjure.” SecretlyPar sons did write the name of the “One , who is most Holy andBeautiful”: he called her Babalon. He further directed Crowley to con-tact no one sa ve himself or Hubbar d r egarding this matter .Unfortunately, he does not seem to have tested this spirit with the rig-orousness of his r ocket-testing or thor oughness that Cr owley used148sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"when he w as contacted b y entities such as Abuldiz, Amalantr ah,Aiwass, and Lam. Crowley always required proofs during such con-tacts, proofs established b y the gematriaof certain k ey words, i.e.,the entity’s name, location, or some other word or phrase. If Parsonssubjected “Babalon” to such a test, no record survives.Again Parsons wrote, “For the last three days I have performed anoperation of birth, using the air tablet, the cup, and a female figur e[Cameron?], properly invoked by the wand [penis], then sealed up inthe altar. Last night I performed an oper ation of symbolic birth anddelivery.” This operation is not part of the instructions contained inLiber Astarte, which Liber 49told him to enact, but it seems to havesatisfied Parsons.On Mar ch 15, Cr owley sent P arsons an admonishment aboutCameron: “I am particularly interested in what you have written meabout the elemental [Camer on], because for some little time past Ihave been endea vouring to interv ene personally on y our behalf. Iwould however have you recall [Eliphas] Levi’s advice that ‘the loveof the Magus for such things [elementals] is insensate and ma ydestroy him.’” “Eliphas Lévi” was the pseudonym of Alphonse-LouiseConstant, a “magic theoretician” who wrote two books, Dogma andRitual of High Magicand History of Magic, published in 1854 and1856, respectively. Although he died in 1875 in relative obscurity, hisworks gained popularity with F rench intellectuals such as VictorHugo. Lévi’s popularity stems fr om his ability to be r omantic yetrational at the same time. Crowley was so impressed that he consid-ered himself the reincarnation of Lévi. Crowley’s claim to have inter-vened personally on Parsons’ behalf is interesting, as it certainly tookplace by use of the OTO’s “key,” i.e., magically.Crowley cautioned Parsons yet again about his own worst traits, inthe letter of March 15, 1946:It seems to me that there is a danger of your sensitiveness upset-ting your balance. Any experience that comes your way you have atendency to over-estimate. The first fine careless rapture wears offin month or so, and some other experience comes along and car-ries you off on its back. Meanwhile you have neglected and bewil-dered those who are dependent on you, either from above or frombelow.I will ask you to bear in mind that you have one fulcr um for allyour levers, and that is your original oath to devote yourself to rais-ing mankind.

Parsons wrote that the “IXths”—meaning Leffingwell, Jane Wolfe, and himself—would hold councilmonthly to discuss lodge policy. Whatever had happened to Parsonsin the desert must ha ve been quite amazing for him to r eact so. Hefinally had dir ection, something he had lost when he sold out ofAer ojet—something he ne ver really had spiritually , except perhapswhen he first encountered Crowley and the OTO. A letter dated oneday later was sent to all Agape Lodge members, declaring Leffingwell“ex ecutive head” of the lodge.Crowley was now a dying man with a heroin problem brought onby his physician’s treatment of his r espiratory problems. As furtherletters arriv ed fr om the States , he became incr easingly unhapp yabout Parsons’ claims, no doubt concerned about the futur e of hislife’s work.On April 19, Crowley wrote Parsons, “You have got me completelypuzzled by your remarks about the elemental—the danger of dis-cussing or copying anything. I thought I had a most morbid imagi-nation, as good as any man’s, but it seems I have not. I cannot formthe slightest idea what you can possibly mean.”And to Karl Germer, Crowley wrote, “Apparently he, or Hubbard,or somebody, is pr oducing a Moonchild. I get fairly fr antic when Icontemplate the idiocy of these goats.”29The purpose of Parsons’ Babalon Working seems to have been thebirth of a child—the Moonchild—into whom Babalon would incarnate.It had said in The Book of the Lawfour decades earlier that this childwould be “mightier than all the kings of the Earth” (AL III:45). AleisterCrowley had once thought F rater Achad was this magical child, thebirth of which occurs on the astral plane rather than the physical andrepresents a possession of sorts . Jane Wolfe wrote that Jack P arsonsmight be this child, but Parsons himself thought differently.150sex and rockets29. The last word is often misquoted in secondar y sources as “louts.”"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"The fact that Cameron later claimed to have been impregnated byPar sons during their first two weeks together casts doubt upon the lit-eral application of the term Moonchild. She said she had an (illegal)abortion with Parsons’ consent (and another abortion later on), thenjust a few days later they were performing another working. If a lit-eral child were what he was seeking (remember, she didn’t know thepurpose of the w orking), the purported pr egnancy probably wouldhave gone another w ay. This abortion story actually serv es as goodevidence that Parsons was looking for an adult female to arrive, per-haps in a manner similar to Cameron’s arrival.In any case, the “magical child” is an ages-old concept found inthe m ythologies of certain cultur es. The magical child conceptPar sons was pursuing was given definition by Crowley, of course. InDe Arte Magica Aleister Crowley wrote, “It is said by certain initiatesthat to obtain Spiritual gifts, and to aid Nature, the Sacrament shouldbe as it were a Nuptial of the Folk of the Earth; but that Magick is ofthe Daemon, and that b y a certain perversion of the Office, may becreated Elementals fit to perform the will of the Magician.” The “per-version,” no doubt, refers to unorthodox acts of sex by which may becreated elementals or “magical” children.Also called a “homunculus” (“little man”), the Moonchild’ s cre-ation is described in Cr owley’s novel by the same name, Moonchild(originally titled The Butterfly Net):But other magicians sought to make this Homunculus in a waycloser to nature. In all these cases they had held that environmentcould be modified at will by the application of telesmata or sympa-thetic figures. For example, a nine-pointed star would attract theinfluence which they called Luna—not meaning the actual moon,but an idea similar to the poets’ idea of her . By sur rounding anobject with such stars, with similarly-disposed herbs, per fumes,metals, talismans, and so on, and by carefully keeping off all otherinfluences by parallel methods, they hoped to invest the originalobject so treated with the Lunar qualities, and no others. (I am giv-ing the briefest outline of an immense subject.) Now then they pro-ceeded to try to make the Homunculus on ver y curious lines.Man, said they, is merely a fer tilized ovum properly incubated.Heredity is ther e even at first, of course, but in a feeble degr ee.Anyhow, they could ar range any desir ed envir onment fr om thebeginning, if they could only manage to nourish the embr yo insome artificial way—incubate it, in fact, as is done with chickens151The Babalon Working: March 1946"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"to-day. Furthermore, and this is the crucial point, they thought thatby per forming this experiment in a specially pr epared place, aplace protected magically against all incompatible for ces, and byinvoking into that place some one for ce which they desired, sometremendously power ful being, angel or ar changel—and they hadconjurations which they thought capable of doing this—that theywould be able to cause the incar nation of beings of infinite knowl-edge and power, who would be able to bring the whole world intoLight and Truth.I may conclude this little sketch by saying that the idea hasbeen almost universal in one form or another; the wish has alwaysbeen for a Messiah or Super man, and the method some attemptto produce man by artificial or at least abnormal means.Crowley speaks of a (female) magical child who would be the prod-uct of her envir onment rather than her her edity, a development thatdistinguishes magical childr en from the r egular type. One r elativelyrecent attempt at producing a messianic child occurred with the occultsociety of Theosophy, whose leaders at the time tried to raise the youngIndian boy, Jiddhu Krishnamurti, as their own World Savior. The planfailed, as Krishnamurti e ventually abandoned the Theosophists andstarted his own movement, for which he became w orld-renowned. InPar sons’ case, however, he (and Crowley) seem to have been using thephrases “magical child” and “Moonchild” interchangeably—and not asliterally as Crowley’s description would suggest.Although like Jones before him Parsons himself was viewed as themagical child, he e vidently felt otherwise , such that he w as deter-mined himself to pr oduce it—or, rather, her—as Parsons wrote of afemalemessiah. Indeed, the purpose of Parsons’ operation has beenunderemphasized, as the Babalon W orking itself was a preparationfor what w as to come: a thelemicmessiah. This messiah w ouldmature in a magically influenced envir onment. She w ould thenassume a leadership role. In addition, the word “child” was symbolic,intended not for an infant but for one w oman in particular (or per-haps even all women in general).It seems clear that P arsons was seeking not an idea but a livingbeing, who evidently was not Cameron. “There was a desire to incar-nate,” he wrote. He considered Cameron his elemental, though he didoccasionally (and par adoxically) refer to her Babalon—as she laterdid herself. But the Babalon W orking was clearly aimed at bringingBabalon down to earth from somewhere else. This plan backfired.152sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"It was not nine months but nine y ears later that Cameron wouldclaim to be Babalon herself and to have given birth to a magical childon the astr al plane.

However,this operation is accomplished and closed—you [referring to himself]should have nothing more to do with it—nor e ven think of it, untilHer manifestation is r evealed, and proved beyond the shadow of adoubt.”With the Babalon Working, it may also be that Parsons was tryingto compete against Smith for Crowley’s attention, even though Smithhad been forced into exile. Indeed, the Babalon Working has parallelswith Crowley’s Liber 132, in which he exalted Smith in order to sendhim on a “retreat.”153The Babalon Working: March 1946"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"154sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"nineParsons’ Final Years: 1946–1952On February 20, 1946, in betweenthe two parts of the Babalon W orking, Parsons, Hubbard and Bettyformed a compan y called “ Allied Enterprises .” T o Hubbar d’s$1,183.91, Parsons put up $2 0,970.80, which w as his “laundr omatmoney,” while y oung Betty contributed nothing. In this enterprise ,they were to buy boats on the East Coast and sail them back toCalifornia for r esale (or to w them b y trailer, if cheaper). The y alsostated an inter est in inv estments of a “v aried and eclectic natur e,”from which it may be inferred that they went beyond boats—perhapsinto explosives. Some of the mone y, Parsons said, as did R ypinski,was used to buy the house at 1 003 S. Or ange Grove Ave. as w ell,which Parsons leased first.In April 1946, after the second part of the Babalon W orking, Ronleft with Betty and $1 0,000 of the compan y’s mone y. Later thatmonth Parsons started to think that they had cheated him. He threat-ened to chase them, but a call to Hubbar d soon calmed him do wn.Astrologer and initiate Louis Culling overheard the call and couldn’tbelieve the formerly angry P arsons could be so easily sw ayed.Par sons ended the call with, “I hope w e shall alw ays be partner s,Ron,” a comment that made Culling cringe.Culling wrote to Karl Germer on Ma y 12, “As you may know bythis time, Brother Jack signed a partnership agreement with this Ronand Betty whereby all money earned by the three for life is equallydivided between the three. As far as I can ascertain, Brother Jack hasput in all of his money . . . meanwhile, Ron and Betty have bought aboat for themselves in Miami for about $10,000 and are living the lifeof Riley, while Brother Jack is living at rock bottom, and I mean rockbottom.

He found two of the boats, but not Ron and Betty.One, the Harpoon, was anchored at Ho ward Bond’s Yacht Harbor.Another, Blue Water II, was at the American Ship Building Company.Par sons then r ented a r oom and w aited. Two days later, someonefrom Bond’s called Parsons to say that the Harpoonhad just sailed.He was too late to catch them, so he r eturned to his room and con-secrated a circle.

Betty later described her and Hubbard’s situa-tion during the storm as “desperate,” relating that the two were veryscared that they would not make it back to shore.On July 1, 1946, Parsons sued Allied Enterprises in Dade County,Florida Cir cuit Court, case number 1 01634. In an instance ofremarkably swift justice, the court appr oved a settlement on July10, and on July 11 the three partners signed an agreement dissolv-ing the compan y. Parsons recovered two boats: Blue Water II(aschooner) and Diane(a yacht). Hubbard was allowed to retain pos-session of the Harpoon, a two-masted schooner, and use it as col-lateral against a promissory note in the amount of $2900. Hubbar dwas also or dered to pa y Parsons’ legal fees . Parsons returned toPasadena and ne ver heard from either party again. Hubbar d andBetty eventually married and had a daughter. Hubbard’s career withScientology is well-documented, in various versions, elsewhere.The incident affected not just Parsons, as his bad luck now forcedhim to stop sending money to his ex-wife, Helen, and Wilfred Smith,who had married. The fact that he w as sending money to them inthe first place reveals how much he thought of Smith, as well as hisgenerosity. P arsons’ r egular contributions to Cr owley, ho wever,would continue until the latter’s death the next year. At the time ofthe financial disaster, Smith wrote to Crowley:It all seems to be folding up together. [Jack] can’t send any moremoney. Grimaud’s [Helen] is r unning out.

You must be so inur ed to disciples’ failur es that justone more won’t surprise you.On August 20, Parsons sent a formal letter of resignation from theOTOto Cr owley. Instead of the usual “Thrice Illuminated, ThriceIllustrious, and V ery Dear Br other” salutation, he began it “DearAleister.” He gave no explanation but merely said the resignation washis will, although it certainly may have been a reflection of his disil-lusionment in the face of such misfortunes. He expressed his contin-ued sympathy to the Cr owley’s “Rights of Man” (Liber OZ), quotedbelow, but finished b y saying, “I do not belie ve that the OTO, as anautocratic organization, constitutes a true and proper medium for theexpression and attainment of these principles [the Rights of Man].”Many resigning members have made similar remarks.Regarding P arsons’ sour ce of e xtra income , Louis Cullingremarked that Parsons was “bootlegging nitroglycerine,” presumablymeaning he was selling it illegally . But to whom? Camer on appar-ently was bold enough to help him in this enterprise , whatever itwas. She and P arsons w ere married in San Juan Capistr ano onOctober 19, 1946 by a Justice of the P eace named Marco F. Forster,with Ed Forman and his wife Jeanne witnessing the event. Recordedin the Orange County Recorder’s Office, the marriage took place justbefore P arsons’ JPLpartner F rank Malina w as invited b y JulianHuxley to go to F rance and work for UNESCO. Rypinski opined thatMalina left the country to distance himself fr om the scandal revolv-ing around Parsons, as there apparently was an investigation into thehouse and possibly some ne wspaper exposure. But Malina himselfsays he was just looking for something differ ent to do, which ringscloser to the truth.In late 1946, Parsons and Cameron left 1003 S. Orange Grove Ave.,and the lodge, which met at several different places after this. The bighouse was later torn down to make way for apartments. Parsons alsoleft his job with the V ulcan Powder Company, having been offeredemployment with the North American A viation Corpor ation in158sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"nearby Inglewood, California, wher e he w orked until 1948, whenHughes Aircraft in Culver City hired him.In addition, Parsons engaged in consulting work.

Parsons was also a member of se veraltechnical societies , including the American Chemical Society , theInstitute of A eronautical Sciences , the American Institute for theAdv ancement of Science , the Society of Sigma Xi, and the Arm yOrdnance Association. His obituary said he had refused several hon-orary degrees, but there is no further evidence to support this claim.A membership in Sigma Xi seems unlikely due to his lack of a degreebut is reported by two different sources, such that it is possible hisreputation was enough to gain him entrance.Disillusioned by the incident with Hubbar d and Betty , Parsonsdrifted a way fr om magick and focused his will on his technicalcareer, although the two aspects of his life could never be completelyseparated. Unfortunately, his misfortune continued, and he had littlesuccess, nothing to equal the glory of his W orld War II efforts . OnMay 17, 1948, his tw o worlds collided, as he lost his go vernmentsecurity clearance “because of his membership in a religious cult . . .believed to adv ocate sexual perversion . . . or ganized at subject’ shome . . . which had been r eported subversive.” Elsewhere the FBIdescribes it as a “mythic love cult,” despite Parsons’ insistence it was“dedicated to the fr eedom and liberty of the individual.” The sameold plagues were still haunting him.In a letter to Karl Germer dated June 19, 1949, Parsons said he lostthe clearance for membership in the OTOand for publicly circulatingLiber OZ, a statement of “the rights of man.” Kno wn also as LiberLXXVII, certain elements of the statement are understandably disturb-ing to different factions of society and, although P arsons may haveviewed himself a teacher destined to affect the po wers that be, thelatter, according him, e vidently perceived him and his ideas as asecurity risk. Liber OZreads in full as follows:The law of the strong: this is our law and the joy of the world.—AL II:2Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law .—AL I:40159Parso ns’ Final Years: 1946–1952"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Thou hast no right but to do thy will.

As early as 1938, the self-described anti-war, anti-capitalist P arsons had subscribed to the Daily P eople’sWorld, a Communist paper, and had attended a few meetings of dif-ferent groups during the subsequent y ears, joining the “subversive”American Civil Liberties Union in 1946.

Nonetheless , Cameron lefthim soon after.Humorously, Parsons’ FBIfile is full of r eferences to the “Chur chof Thelma.” Ther e is also an unclear r eference to P arsons doingsomething on September 2 1, 1948 to bring the attention of go vern-ment officials upon him once mor e, but apparently nothing came ofit. Parsons then spent tw o years on the staff of the Univ ersity ofSouthern California’s Pharmacology Department starting in 1948.Despite his occupational troubles based in part on his occult activ-ities —or possibly because of them—Parsons was unable to avoid theexotic lure. On Halloween of 1948, Babalon called on Parsons in someunspecified manner and ur ged him to r esume his magick. Lik e somany who suffer the ills of the ph ysical world, Parsons would turnonce more to religion in his time of need, beginning a 17-day “work-ing of the wand” (17 is a masculine number because of its associa-tion with Mars), the climax of which was Babalon’s manifestation ina dream. He had Smith christen him “Belarion Armiluss Al Dajjal,AntiChrist” as he took the Oath of the Abyss. Oddly enough, consid-ering the friction between them, Parsons remained close to Smith, theman who had married Parsons’ wife and who w as also his superiorin the A∴A∴. Their relationship was probably more formal than per-sonal by this time.At the conclusion of his 17-da y w orking, Babalon instructedPar sons on an “ astral w orking,” i.e ., an out-of-body e xperience.Par sons had, by his own accounts, a “well-developed body of light,”so apparently this travel was an easy task for him. Indeed, he claimedsuccess with a vision wherein he “went into the sunset with Her signand into the night past accur sed and desolate places and c yclopeanruins, and so came at last to the City of Chor azin. And there a greattower of Black Basalt was raised, that was part of a castle whose fur-ther battlements ruled over the gulf of stars.”Chorazin was a small town on the Sea of Galilee that, according tothe gospel story , Jesus cur sed when the citizens w ould not r epent(Mt. 11:21; Lk. 1 0:13). Later legends claimed that the Antichristwould be born in Chor azin, whose modern name is K erazeh. Theblack basalt ruins of the city’s old synagogue to which Parsons refersare still standing.161Parso ns’ Final Years: 1946–1952"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Regarding the title with which Parsons had himself christened bySmith, Belarionis an alternate spelling (presumably from the Greek)of “Belial,” a demon named in the Bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls and theJewish apocrypha (hidden texts of dubious authenticity) whose namemeans “Without God,” as “Bel” or “Ba’al” means “God” or “Lor d.”Belarion is often identified b y Christian writer s with the Beast inRevelation, with whom Aleister Cr owley in turn identified himself.Rather than emulating his mentor , ho wever, P arsons ma y ha veacquired the moniker from a fantasy novel which featured a charac-ter by that name.The term Armilussis the Jewish equivalent of the Antichrist. Asthe end appr oaches, Je wish eschatology states , the Messiah benEphraim (“born of Ephr aim” or Isr ael, the northern kingdom) willcome first, following by Armiluss who will lead the armies of Gogand Magog against the armies of the Messiah at the battle ofArmageddon, murdering him. Ben Ephr aim’s corpse will be left forthe scavengers, but the Messiah ben Da vid (whom the Christiansbelieve was Jesus) will appear and resurrect him.The next word in Parsons’ title, Al-Dajjal, is the Islamic version ofthe Antichrist, whose name is Arabic for “the deceiver.” He does notappear in the Koran but rather in the hadith, which are the sayingsof Mohammed as recorded by his disciples. Al-Dajjal is blind in oneeye but is able to perform mir acles, the gr eatest of which will bebringing order to a w orld in chaos .

The oath has survived along with some ofPar sons’ other papers from this period and begins as follows:I, who am called John Whiteside Parsons in the outer, and Fra. 210in the inner, do hereby in the presence of Fra. 132 [Wilfred Smith],take this oath of a Magister T empli [Master of the Temple], whichfor me is the Oath of Antichrist.

Analysisseems to have been pre-pared prior to P arsons’ attempt to cr oss the Ab yss, as “F raterBelarion” speaks to Parsons in the third person, saying “I await youin the City of the Pyramids.”Subsequently writing asBelarion, Parsons refers to the OTOas “anexcellent training school for adepts, but hardly an appropriate Orderfor the manifestation of Thelema,” a statement tantamount to heresy.Obviously, he was frustrated by attempts to discipline him, and hisnotion of Thelema w as almost fundamentalist, based on little mor ethan Liber OZ.

It is important to note thatcrossing the Abyss is a part of the A∴A∴’s doctrine, and has nothingto do with the OTO. In fact, b y this time Parsons had resigned fromthe latter.Crowley carried out his Ab yss-crossing process during 1908 and1909. A key part of this working was a 30-day walk across the Algeriandesert, upon which he took along Frater Omnia Vincam, known in the“world of men” as Victor Neubur g, the acolyte who w as in love withhim and received Crowley’s abuse. Although this endeavor was a fullthree years before Crowley would learn the sexual secret of the OTO, onone occasion he used Neuburg in an act of sex magic, taking the sub-missive role to Neuburg’s dominance. Neuburg took notes as Crowleydescribed what he saw.The crossing of the Ab yss is part of the old Enochian s ystem,which posits a universe of 30 concentric Aires (or Aethyrs) with theearth at the center, much as the ancients did with the se ven plane-tary spheres, although there are other arrangements. The 30th Aire isthe lowest; hence, it is the closest to the earth. The Fir st Aire is thusthe highest, but ther e are said to be unkno wn, unnumbered Airesabove it.Each Aire, as seen in the discussion of the Babalon W orking, hasits angels, kings, Seniors, cherubs, etc. associated with it. W orkingwith each Air e r equires inv oking these entities , just as P arsonsinvoked EXARPin January 1946. The full ritual is full of consecrations,hexagrams and pentagrams, and takes at least an hour to perform foreach Aire. The ritual must be recited from memory, and “vibrated” inthe original Enochian language.The Aires are transversed in r everse order, as the highest num-bered Aire is closest to the earth. Crowley worked with the 30th Airefirst, then the 29th, and so on. On the 21st day, the day of his work-ing with the 1 0th Aire, Crowley had his Ab yss-crossing experience.The 10th Aire is guarded by the demon Choronzon, who dwells in theAbyss.For Crowley, Aires 30 through 11 involved astral vision (“skryingin the Aethyrs”). The working of the 10th Aire involved a full-blownpossession experience in which Crowley’s psyche was overtaken byChoronzon for a time . Neuburg was extremely frightened b y thisintense change in his usually amicable master , and w as glad thatCrowley was bound inside a consecr ated circle. Unlike the inv oca-tions of the previous nights, there was no physical contact between165Parso ns’ Final Years: 1946–1952"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"the two men. The possession lasted until the energy produced by theblood of three sacrificed pigeons ran out, and then it ended.Crowley emerged with his sanity intact, having survived a face-to-face encounter with the blind forces of the Abyss. He had tasted mad-ness and survived. He had cr ossed the Abyss by giving up his ego.He was now a Magister Templi(Master of the Temple) in the A∴A∴.Crowley scryed the remaining Aires during the course of the nextnine days, then finished the rite (and his desert w alk). A detailedaccount of these endeavors and his ordeal can be found in Crowley’sThe Vision and the Voice, as well as in his Confessions.As noted, it is unclear to what extent Parsons emulated his masterin his Abyss working, for which he may very well have retired to theMojave desert, as Crowley had to that of Algeria. This period w as alow point in Parsons’ life: his former glory lost, he w as employed ata gas station. The w orking lasted 40 da ys, whatever form it took—longer than the entir e Babalon Working, and longer than Cr owley’sown Algerian w orking with Neubur g. Unfortunately, most of therecords documenting the endea vor ar e no w gone , if the y e venexisted.Whatever form it did tak e, this oper ation w as P arsons’ BlackPilgrimage, foretold by Babalon three years earlier in Liber 49, vs. 33,58, and 61. After the end of the 40 days, Parsons wrote a two-page doc-ument called The Book of AntiChrist. In it he predicted the manifesta-tion of Babalon upon the earth within seven years, which he would nothave done had he consider ed Cameron to be Babalon. He also pr e-dicted that an entire nation would embrace Thelema. Babalon told himthese things w ould come to pass only if he surviv ed the ne xt sevenyears. He did not, and it is odd that Babalon, or P arsons’ own psyche,or whatever it was, would even suggest that the young man might not,as if it or he knew his sad fate.In “The Black Pilgrimage,” which was the first part of The Book ofAntiChrist, P arsons compar ed himself to se veral infamous butobscure figures from the past. He referred to them as past lives of his,though probably just as a literary device. The first, Simon Magus, wasthe legendary fir st-century Samaritan magician who made a livingselling miracles to the populace. According to the Bible, after his bap-tism by Philip (A cts 8:9 ff), Simon continued to peddle his w aresunder a Christian guise , giving rise to our w ord “Simony.” Simonpreached a gnostic message in which his consort Helen, found in abrothel, w as the fallen Sophia (i.e ., wisdom) whom he hadredeemed.166sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"The second past life was Gilles de Retz (usually spelled “Rais” or“Raiz”), a child tortur er and killer also kno wn as Bluebear d thepirate.

The fourth Earl had been named Hepburn. The fifth Earlwas the “Arch-Dianist” of Scotland, meaning the spiritual leader ofthe Diana-worshipping witches, who saw in Stewart the incarnationof the “horned god.” He also had a claim to the throne, toward whichhe directed his supernatur al efforts. In fact, Ste wart was the fir stcousin of King James VIof Scotland, the same murderous King JamesI of England whose translation of the Bible remains a standard, andwho had John Dee arr ested. As noted, the King fear ed witchcraftgreatly, and he saw in his cousin the v ery devil whom he knew thewitches worshiped. When Ste wart busted into the King’ s house onJuly 24, 1593, the King asked whether Stewart came for his life or forhis soul. Had James died heirless , Stewart could ha ve claimed thethrone. Some of Stewart’s anti-Christian writings are even used in ourage. Parsons mentioned him specifically in regard to a Gille Duncan,about whom there seems to be no information.The fourth life w as Count Cagliostr o, the famous 18th-centuryalchemist who studied under St. Germain, the supposedly immortalmiracle worker, and Seraphina (AKALorenza Feliciana), Cagliostro’swife.

His sentence was commuted to life in prison, and Seraphinawas allowed to retire to a monastery of nuns.31The common thread in all of these past liv es is the poor r elation-ship with w omen: Parsons was still beating himself up for ha vingtrusted Betty. In addition to pummeling himself, Parsons also trouncedChristianity and “the lying priests, conniving judges, [and] blackmail-ing police,” ending the second part of The Book of AntiChrist, called“The Manifesto of the AntiChrist,” with the following:I, BELARION, ANTICHRIST, in the year 1949 of the r ule of the BlackBrotherhood called Christianity, do make my Manifesto to all men.And I, THE ANTICHRIST, come among you, saying:167Parso ns’ Final Years: 1946–195231.

At that time, he wrote Crowley, “It has now beenalmost a year since I last wrote—at that time I was near mental andfinancial collapse. Since that time I have laboriously gained some sortof mental equilibrium and gradually regained something of a positionin my old field in a large aircraft company. My one aim is to rebuildmyself.”Also in 1949, Cameron returned from Mexico and made Parsons agreen box with the Hebrew letter shinpainted in red on the lid.

In September,Hughes had him w orking on a pr oposal for a “R ocket PropellantLoading Plant.” The pricing data in this pr oposal was what Parsonsneeded to finish his pr oposal to the Isr aelis.

One referred to the cou-ple as “characters and screwballs.” Another called Parsons a “crack-pot.” References to earlier inv estigations of his “ cult” at 1 003 S.Orange Grove occupy much of the FBIfile.

Someoneelse told the Independentthat Parsons was going to set up his o wnbusiness in Mexico, but Cameron insisted it was merely an extendedtrip. The amount of baggage, however, indicated a long-term stay. Infact, the couple w ere headed next to Israel, where they intended toraise a family.Motorcycle officer Ernie Ho vard was the fir st policeman on thescene of the explosion and was later joined by Donald M. Harding, aPasadena police for ce criminologist. Har ding found numer ous con-tainers of explosives, many of which had already been placed outsideby Par sons, in preparation for the trip, which w as obviously not forsightseeing. The legality of the e xplosives was questioned, and the58th Arm y Or dnance Disposal Unit w as called in fr om F ortMacArthur to help determine the cause of the e xplosion, as well asto inspect the immediate area and the house at 424 Arroyo Terrace forfurther e xplosives. As photogr aphers took flash photos , Har dingshielded certain of the remaining bottles, afraid that the light wouldset them off as well. The Disposal Unit removed the rest of the explo-sives from the pr emises, and the inv estigators and other s began to179Death and Beyond"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"speculate as to what caused the blast—nitroglycerin? Rocket fuels? Orthe more exotic-sounding trinitrobenzene or PETN?33In addition to the e xplosion, Harding found numer ous scientificnotes in the debris, most of which contained chemical formulas. Oneinteresting document contained Parsons’ notes concerning industrialexplosions: “Texas City Disaster Report: 433 dead, 128 missing. [Theexplosive] cannot be detonated with rifle bullets , blasting caps ordynamite.” Parsons also had notes about a Los Angeles electroplatingcompany explosion in 1947 that killed 15, and another e xplosion atAer ojet that killed eight. He had been a member of the coroner’s juryon the 1947 incident.A more curious fragment was obviously not a part of his pr ofes-sional work. The note r ead, “Let me kno w thy misery totally. Andspare not and be not spared. Sacrament and Crucifixion. Oh my pas-sion and shame . . . Mother s . . . Sisters . . .” Unfortunately, he gothis morbid wish, as did his devoted mother.Harding eventually determined that the blast occurred just behindPar sons, and to his right, just above floor level. Had the building notbeen of heavy timber construction, it probably would have been lev-eled. As it w as, the entire half of the lo wer level containing his labwas gutted. Firemen reported that they noticed a “funny odor” whenthey arrived on the scene. Interestingly, considering she had purport-edly found mercury there, Cameron said that the explosion occurredbeneaththe floorboards, lifting them up.Martin Foshaug said that Parsons “had been experimenting in aneffort to pr oduce a ‘Super’ fog effect for motion pictur es,” but thiswork certainly had nothing to do with the blast that killed him, sincePar sons had left his special effects job with the Bermite P owderCompany on the previous Friday, June 13.On June 19, the newspapers reported that the cause of the e xplo-sion had been determined to be “fulminate of mer cury,” a very sen-sitive and powerful detonator that Army Ordnance had stopped usingbecause of the number of deaths it had caused. However, the size ofthe explosion seems e xcessive for fulminate of mer cury. Harding,who had just joined the P asadena police force, was assigned to hisfirst investigation with the P arsons blast. He could ha ve both beeninexperienced and had based his conclusions on hearsay, rather thanscience, about mercury. Harding was told by a neighbor that Parsonswas manufacturing the mer cury explosive (illegally) in the gar age180sex and rockets33. PETN is still used for demolition and special ef fects today."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"laboratory. It was to be his last batch, Parsons had told the neighbor.Obviously, he w as right. Har ding searched for other stor age placesPar sons might ha ve maintained, and stated that enough e xplosivesremained in the lab to “blow up half the block.”Harding’s determination of the bomb device’s origin was based onhis discovery in the rubble of ingr edients needed to make fulminateof mercury. Shrapnel from a coffee can w as found in the w oodenfloor and in the w alls, radiating out fr om the hole at gr ound zero,which led Harding to surmise that Parsons must have reached for thecan when it dr opped but w asn’t quick enough. This de velopment,Harding inferred, was why the e xplosion occurred low to the floorand why Parsons’ right arm was missing, since it w as closest to theblast. Harding believed Parsons was mixing the chemical in the canwhen it dropped. Fulminate of mercury, he reasoned, “is made w etand gets more sensitive as it dries. A little friction, per cussion, heator agitation is enough to set it off.”Based on Har ding’s findings , Detectiv e Lieutenant Cecil H.Burlingame was told by the coroner’s office that no inquest would beheld. After an autops y performed the ne xt day by Deputy Cor onerI.G. Mcfarland, the death w as ruled accidental and attributed to“multiple injuries of entir e body.” Burlingame told r eporters thatpolice had received reports in 1942 that Parsons was illegally storingexplosives at 1003 S. Orange Grove Ave. Nevertheless, a search con-ducted in conjunction with the FBIhad turned up nothing.The Pasadena Independenttalked to J.H. Arnold of the BermitePow der Compan y, who told them that P arsons had sta yed longenough with his company to finish a special effects pr oject. Parsonshad, in fact, been w orking on a “r ocket propellant detonation andpyrotechnic short-interval delay” project, which w as a confidentialprogram at the compan y. Contrary to Camer on’s testimony, his co-workers related that he had told them he w as heading to Mexico tocontinue his research with explosives and miniature special effects.Arnold had asked him to stay long enough to see the tests of the con-fidential project, but P arsons was eager to get to Me xico. “He hadbeen working hard,” Arnold told the inv estigators, also stating thatPar sons was extremely safety-conscious. Said Arnold, “He w orkedcarefully, had a thorough knowledge of his job and was scrupulouslyneat.” But Harding called him “ criminally negligent” in the w ay hehandled the explosives at his home lab. Arnold was surprised to hearthat Parsons had so many explosives at home, which police learnedhad been there at least six months. Arnold added that Parsons at one181Death and Beyond"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"time had his o wn powder magazine near Rialto, which w as a legalstorage place. His home , however, was in obvious violation of thePasadena fire marshal’s code. In addition, Arnold noted, six or eightmonths earlier P arsons talked about going into the dynamite busi-ness. Other comments came from T.E. Beehan, Secretary-Treasurer ofAer ojet, who described P arsons as a “loner” and said, “He lik ed towander, but he was one of the top men in the field.”In their r eportage about his life and death, the PasadenaIndependent dug up some of the older stories about P arsons when hewas at 1003 S. Orange Grove and recalled that in 1942 a letter had beensent from San Antonio, T exas by “A Real Soldier,” who wr ote that a“black magic” cult was operating in the house. The same Detective Lt.Burlingame had inv estigated the letter incident and w as told b yPar sons that the “cult” was merely a “non-sectarian and non-politicalfraternity” which “held open forums on Sunda y afternoons, and dis-cussed philosophy, religion, personal freedom, and fortune telling.”However, in 1944 police investigated a small fire at the house, dur-ing which inv estigation Detective O.A. Nelson found “ considerableparaphernalia . . . which indicated that spiritual seances ma y havebeen held in the house.” Said Nelson, “It appears to be the home ofsome type of secret society.” Nevertheless, the matter was dropped.Smelling a good story , the sensationalistic Independentannounced in its obituary that on July 19 “secret rites” were held forJohn Parsons at Turner & Stevens Mortuary, Marengo Ave. and HollySt. However, the funeral home referred to the ceremony as a “privateprayer service .” The obituary used his birth name , Marv el, andreported that Cameron was the only survivor. It also stated that cre-mation took place earlier that da y at the Liv e Oak Cr ematory andthat his body was embalmed by W.T. Stahlman. The Social Securitynumber giv en on his death certificate , pr esumably pr ovided b yCameron, is incorr ect and belongs to a Vir ginia Wilson, also ofCalifornia, who had been born the same y ear as Parsons and wholived until 1980.On July 20, a private service was held for R uth Parsons, also byTurner & Stevens, and her body was cremated as well. She was sur-vived by a Mr s. Emma Aldrich of Santa Monica, California, appar-ently no relation to lodge member Meeka Aldrich.On June 22, both the Los Angeles Timesand the PasadenaIndependentaddressed a new development: George W.

Police had found 500 grams of cordite (an ammunition com-ponent) and six filter papers containing fulminate of mercury residuein Parsons’ trash can, which was either at the back of the lab or justoutside it, depending on the account. “For Parsons to have disposedof such materials in that manner ,” said Santm yer, “would be thesame as for a highly trained surgeon to operate with dirty hands. It’scompletely out of char acter for him.” Criminologist Har ding, whenasked, admitted that P arsons’ supposed sloppiness seemed “incon-gruous.” Harding also said that enough cordite and fulminate of mer-cury were found in the trash to blow up the garbage truck and driverswho would have picked up the can. In his statement to the papers, Santmyer argued that someone elsemust have put it ther e, that P arsons would not ha ve disposed ofhighly dangerous explosives at the last minute , nor would he haveprepared them for tr ansportation on a long driv e into Me xico, aseverything he needed to produce fulminate of mercury could be eas-ily pur chased once he arriv ed ther e. Santm yer also stated thatPar sons was “on the trail” of a completely ne w explosive that “wasto be far superior to an y existing commercial blasting material” andmuch safer to handle. According to Burlingame, however, Santmyer’squestions w eren’t “sufficient to w arrant us r eopening the case .”Nevertheless, Santmyer was not the only person who smelled some-thing fishy in the untimely death of John Parsons.Something else was allegedly found after the death of P arsons thatdidn’t make the 1952 Los Angeles Times. Amateur r ocket advocateHarold Chambers, who worked at a technical bookstore in downtownLos Angeles for 40 y ears, was told on separ ate occasions b y bothHarding and Santmyer that an “odd, bizarre, fairly big box, decoratedwith snakes and dr agons” was found in a tr ailer at P arsons’ resi-dence. The odd bo x was found to contain home mo vies of Parsonsand mother ha ving se x, not only with each other , but also withRuth’s “big dog.” According to reports from Pasadena police, passeddown to their friend Har old Chambers, we now have circumstantialevidence that John P arsons indeed fulfilled his goal to “ exteriorize[his] Oedipus complex.”Ruth Parsons’ “big dog” also made it difficult for police to attendto her suicide scene . After being attack ed by Ruth’s agitated beast,Pasadena police officers shot the dog in the head.Chambers also r eports that Don Har ding, ha ving disco vered asyringe among the blast debris , partially filled with a morphine-lik e183Death and Beyond"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"substance, believes that P arsons’ drug use contributed to his mis-handling of explosives.The high-reaching pioneer Parsons was gone but not for gotten. In1969, Darker Than Y ou Thinkauthor Jack Williamson wr ote, “InPasadena not long ago, w alking acr oss the gr ounds of the JetPropulsion Laboratory, I was jolted to see Parsons’ name on a memor-ial tablet set up to honor the first martyrs to space. He had written meonce about testing multicellular solid-fuel rockets designed after thosein my story ‘The Crucible of Power.’ When I first heard about his deathI wondered if m y own rockets had killed him, but [L.] Spr ague deCamp tells me that he dropped a bottle of picric acid.” It wasn’t picricacid, but he had the right idea.Rather than any “martyrs to space,” the JPLplaque actually hon-ors the first successful series of JATOtests, which began on Halloween1936. The monument w as unveiled on Hallo ween 1968, the 32ndanniversary of the original date. “The Crucible of Power,” containedin the anthology The Best of Jack Williamson, describes the multi-cel-lular, solid-fuel rockets as follows: “[I]t was a four-step rocket, eachstep containing thousands of cellules, each of which was a completerocket motor with its own load of alumilloid fuel, to be fired once andthen detached.” No doubt P arsons would have also been inter estedin the solar r eligion of the story’ s Martians, whose high priest w ascalled the “Lance of the Sun.”While the police were content to let the tragedy stand as an acci-dent ostensibly caused b y his pr ofessional endeavors, others felt ithad to do with the occult. In The Occult Explosion(published 1972),Nat F reedland intervie wed filmmak er R enate Druks , who said,“Cameroun [sic] stayed with me at m y Malibu Beach house for sixmonths, pulling herself together after Jack died. I ha ve every reasonto believe that Jack Parsons was working on some very strange exper-iments, trying to create what the old alchemists called a homunculus,a tiny artificial man with magic po wers. I think that’ s what he w asworking on when the accident happened.” Druks e vidently was thesource of Michael Hoffman’s statement in Apocalypse Culturethat “In1952 Parsons was blown up in what is officially described as an acci-dent but which others have said was a homunculus experiment thatwent bananas.” Before moving in with Druks, Cameron stayed brieflywith Wilfred and Helen Parsons Smith. She also spent time alone inthe desert.Par sons’ friends did not belie ve he killed himself, at least inten-tionally. Indeed, he had too man y plans, as r eflected by his dying184sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"words: “I w asn’t done.” It is some what ironic that these w ere thedying words of the man who claimed to be the Antichrist, while ,according to the gospel tale, the dying words of Christ were the oppo-site: “It is finished.”Druks, who later w orked with a vant garde filmmaker KennethAnger and who also studied magic under Jane W olfe, related thatPar sons was going to Mexico “to experiment with his new formula foran explosive ‘more powerful than anything yet invented.’” Accordingto JPLemployee Charles Bartley, Parsons told him he was going thereto start a fireworks company, yet von Kármán stated that Parsons toldhim it was an explosives factory—which is admittedly not much dif-ferent—that the Mexican government had hired him to set up. V onKármán also said that Parsons told him the government was furnish-ing a 17th-century castle for him to stay in while he was there. Sincethere are few if an y castles in old Me xico, perhaps Parsons or v onKármán confused palacio forcastillo. Camer on r elated a similaraccount but stated it w as in Baja California, r ather than Me xicoproper. These e xperiments were to be a step to ward their e ventualplans for working with the Israelis.Decades later Camer on spoke of the e xplosion as coming fr omunder the floorboar ds, implying mur der rather than an accident orsuicide. In the OTOnewsletter The Magical Link, she stated that agood suspect was the explosives expert against whom P arsons hadtestified and who had been par oled immediately prior to the fatalexplosion, a r eference to Captain K ynette of the Los Angeles “sp ysquad,” found guilty of murdering another police officer in 1938. Theweapon Kynette used was a car bomb , and Parsons’ testimony hadbeen crucial in his conviction.In recent years, one researcher was informed by the City of LosAngeles’ Hall of Records that Parsons’ will was still sealed and thathe would have to get permission from the executor to obtain a copy.The executor was Ed Forman, who is dead. When I visited the Hallof Records, the clerk was unable to find any listing for Parsons’ willin the probate records for Los Angeles county. The will, in fact, wasnever probated.On August 13, 1952, just a month after his tr agic death, PeopleToday published a half-page piece on Parsons in its “People in Crime”section, which included a delightfully sinister photo of P arsons. Thearticle was entitled “L.A.’s Lust Cult” and is worth quoting in full, todemonstrate the general attitude toward Parsons at the time. The boldprint appears in the original.185Death and Beyond"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Rich, rock-ribbed Pasadena, famed for its r oses, the Califor niaInstitute of T echnology, and as a r etirement haven for Easter nmillionaires, looks like the last place a black magic cult dedi-cated to sex would thrive. Never theless, the Church of Thelema(the name means “will”), a cult practicing sexual per version,has been making converts of all ages, sexes, there since 1940.Among the believers: many pr ominent r esidents of thePasadena-Los Angeles ar ea; at least one member ofHollywood’s movie colony.The existence of the cult, r eported to police in an anonymousletter mailed from San Antonio, Texas, in September ’42 by “A RealSoldier” and in an October ’ 44 letter, was only pr oven this Junewith the “accidental” death of high priest John W. Parsons.Parsons, bushy-haired, 37-year-old scientist who was one of theinventors of JATO(jet-assisted take-off), was killed when an explo-sion r ocked his lab in the car riage house of the old F .G.Cruickshank [sic] estate along Pasadena’s “Millionair e’s Row,”where he lived with his artist-wife and mother. Within hours of herson’s death, the elder Mrs. Parsons had committed suicide byswallowing 50 sleeping pills. The estate, investigators soonlearned, had been the ‘T emple’ wher e Thelemites ran theirstrange sexual orgies.Parsons had ser ved as high priest since the death, in ’ 44, oflocal prophet Wilfred Smith, a disciple of Aleister Cr owley, called“the sinister man” by French authorities. Crowley’s chief command-ment: “Take your fill of love . . . with whom ye will.”Says an ex-member: “The inner circle followed this rule, espe-cially at the fer tility rites at the spring and fall equinoxes.”Tor ch-carrying hooded cultists, chanting prayers to “Thou burn-ing rapture of girls, that disport in the sunset of passion,” con-centrated on “begetting a r oyal race befor e dawn.” Otherrituals: a Black Mass,patterned on a r eligious cer emony, inwhich High Priestess disr obed to tune of uninhibited chanting;“purifying” fir e tor ture.Members ar e accepted in the cult—which also existed in Chicago and New York—on a probationarybasis, must pass thr ough 10 degrees before qualifying for par-ticipation in sex rites.With the bizarre death of Parsons and the suicide of his mother,Thelemites have gone fur ther underground. But, still active, theyconducted a secret funeral for their dead high priest.186sex and rockets"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"A sidebar to the article reads:Thelemites follow code set down by founder Aleister Cr owley,Englishman who died 25 years ago after a stor my life.

Indeed, b y October of the y ear Crowley hadbecome disillusioned with Parsons and wrote to Culling, “About J.W. P.[Parsons]—all that I can say is that I am sorry—I feel sure that he hadfine ideas, but he was led astray firstly by Smith, then he was robbedof his last penn y b y a confidence man named Hubbar d.” And inDecember he wrote, “I have no further interest in Jack and his adven-tures; he is just a w eak-minded fool, and must go to the de vil in hisown way. Requiescat in pace.”Although Crowley may have found Parsons naïve and ineffectual,there are many who r ealize his k ey role in the aer ospace/militaryindustries, and not a fe w who belie ve he accomplished amazingthings esoterically , lea ving behind an e xtraordinary legac y thatincluded “flying saucers,” which would not be surprising consideringhis fervent interest in space and his attempts both chemically andalchemically to “shoot for the stars.”187Death and Beyond"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"In fact, Kenneth Grant writes, “The [Babalon] Working began . . .just prior to the wave of unexplained aerial phenomena now recalledas the ‘Great Flying Saucer Flap.’ Parsons opened a door and some-thing flew in.” Indeed, this notion has entered certain fringe areas ofpop culture.Crowley sensationalizer F rancis King mentions that P arsons feltflying saucer s “w ould pla y a part in conv erting the w orld toCrowleyanity.” When Camer on later became obsessed with flyingsaucers she ne ver whispered a w ord about P arsons’ interest. Shebelieved saucers were not high-tech, but rather a “restoration of theelemental powers.”An unconfirmed statement attributed to conspiriologist John Judgeclaimed that Parsons may have flown with the pilot Kenneth Arnold,who in 1947 saw several silver disks over Mt. Rainier in WashingtonState and coined the term “flying saucer” to describe them. Another Aerojet employee, Daniel Fry, saw a saucer in 195 0 andwent on to become an activ e figure in 195 0s contacteeism. Somewonderful footage of him in his final y ears is r ecorded in the filmFar ewell, Good Brothers. Still another occult-oriented employee in theaerospace engineering industry , the Californian Orfeo Angelucci,claimed to have been a contactee in the 1950s.Other momentous events were attributed to Parsons. Referring tothe date of Parsons’ death, Arthur Lyons said, “It was 13 years later,the period of human matur ation, that twins w ere born in SanFrancisco—the counter culture and the Chur ch of Satan.” Ger aldSuster, in his biography of Israel Regardie, credits Parsons with help-ing birth the sixties.After his death, Camer on continued P arsons’ w ork—not theBabalon Working, but that inv olving per sonal gr owth and e xplo-ration.

This lar ge claim comes despite the kno wn fact that P arsonsbelieved Cameron was an elemental who he hoped w ould later giv e“birth” to Babalon. He w ould not ha ve predicted Babalon’s physicalmanifestation to occur within se ven years, as he did in 1949 in TheManifesto of the AntiChrist, if she were already on earth. After the three-day working of March 1946, Parsons proclaimed, “Babalon is incarnateupon the earth today, awaiting the proper hour of Her manifestation.”In 1949 Parsons revised this statement, perhaps anticipating Cameron’sreturn. The year 1949 must have been significant to Parsons—the bookthat purportedly came from Babalon is titled Liber 49.Par sons’ Songs for the Witch Womanis dedicated to Cameron, “inwhom She is incarnate.” But in “The Star of Babalon” P arsons saysthat Her spirit is within all w omen who pr oclaim their equality tomen. If this is indeed the case , a billion women on planet Earth ar enow wearing Babalon’s tiara.In 1953, Cameron wrote:For some months now I have been aware of the heightening inten-sity of what I call a thir d beam of hearing. I can describe it as thesound of a radio beam that one picks up on shor twave. It is inde-pendent of my normal hearing—if I close my eyes it is not affectedin any way.

In a letter to Jane Wolfe dated January22, 1953, Camer on speculated the UFOwas the “w ar-engine” men-tioned in The Book of the LawIII: 7-8 (“I will give you a war-engine.With it ye shall smite the peoples; and none shall stand before you.”)Eight years earlier Crowley wondered if the atomic bomb constitutedthis engine.189Death and Beyond"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"In another letter Cameron wrote about:[Mars], which I believe, is somehow my home.

Jack Parsons ofPasadena, California, was America’s Number One solid fuel r ocketexpert. He was involved with the infamous English black magicianAleister Crowley who called himself ‘The Beast 666.’ Crowley ran anorganization called the Or der of Templars Orientalis over the worldwhich had savage and bestial rites. Dr . Parsons was head of theAmerican branch located at 100 Orange Gr ove Avenue, Pasadena,California. This was a huge old house which had paying guests whowere the U.A.S. nuclear physicists working at Cal. tech. Certain agen-cies objected to nuclear physicists being housed under the sameroof.L. Ron Hubbard was still an officer of the U.S. Navy [and] becausehe was well known as a writer and philosopher and had friendsamong the physicists, he was sent in to handle the situation.

The physicists included many of thesixty-four top U.S. scientists who were later declared insecure anddismissed from government service with so much publicity.34Despite the vilification and br ouhaha, in 1972 the InternationalAstronomical Union in France honored Parsons by naming a crater onthe moon after him. “Parsons Crater” is at 370N latitude, 1710W longi-tude, and, appropriately enough, on the darkside of the moon. Due tothe Ranger survey, the first to photograph the dark side and reveal hun-dreds of new craters in need of names, NASAturned to its own past toprovide them. Parsons was the only GALCITscientist to earn this honor,in which Frank Malina, now living in France, may have had a hand.Par sons’ buddy, Ed Forman, died in 1973 of heart tr ouble whileemployed by Lockheed in El Segundo. Despite his lifelong closenesswith Parsons, Forman never joined the OTO. (Parsons’ mother, Ruth,also worked at Lockheed during the war.)It is evident that Parsons was considered an important if danger-ous figure by the authorities. His FBIfile, which was requested priorto the Freedom of Information Act as part of a JPLhistory project, isheavily censored. Although FOIArules have since changed, when onerequests the file one normally gets a photocop y of the file that hasalready been processed. There have been no updates, simply becausethe FBIhasn’t noticed or doesn’t want to bother with it.Among the many reasons Parsons was investigated was not onlythe “black magic” but also his association with communist s ympa-thizers.

Malina died in France in 1981.It may have been Malina who first introduced the late John Parsonsto the UFO-researcher and debunker, Jacques Vallee, who was the rolemodel for the French scientist in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.Vallee suggests that JPLwould deny Parsons ever existed; but, as evi-denced by a memorial plaque on JPLgrounds (and numerous conver-sations with the staff of JPL) the opposite is actually the case.After the war, group leader and rocket scientist von Kármán wasinvited to Germany to inspect various Nazi research installations likethe one at Peenemünde. This visit occurred at the invitation of HapArnold and his other old friends in Washington. Von Kármán’s auto-biography, The Wind and Beyond, contains pictures from his trip toGermany, including one shot of him interrogating a German scientist.As previously noted, v on Kármán w orked in German y during thedecade following World War I.

Evidently he was accused of beinga Communist simply because he was Chinese, as, years later, Malina’swidow told an interviewer, “We never saw him at any of the cell meet-ings.” This incident embarr assed Tsien so much he decided to r eturnto China—something he thought he’d never do. However, immigrationstopped him at the docks and detained him for fiv e years, by whichtime, the authorities figur ed, anything he kne w would be obsolete .Then they deported him, and subsequently he singlehandedly built theChinese missile pr ogram from scratch using what he had learned atGALCIT. Tsien’s fascinating life is r ecounted in Iris Chang’s biography,Thread of the Silk Worm.In 1989, a collection of Parsons’ unpublished essays, Freedom Is ATwo-Edged Sword, appeared and renewed interest in the man, which193Death and Beyond"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"has sur ged with the adv ent of the W orld Wide W eb. The bookincludes Parsons’ commentary on the “Red Scare.” Much of the othermaterial reproduced in Freedom Is A Two-Edged Sworddeals with twoof Parsons’ post-OTOprojects: The Gnosis and The Witchcr aft. Theformer was an attempt to set up a regular form of worship for Parsonsand for whomever would follow.Par sons christianized his Gnosis by having Sophia, the incarnationof wisdom, play the role of the daughter of God, equating her withthe Holy Ghost. In Parsons’ version, Sophia’s union with Christ wasequal to God. In “tr aditional” Gnosticism, Sophia w as usually themother of God, and Christ the savior of both. Only in Parsons’ workdo we find the alternative formula, to which end Parsons wrote “OnMagick,” “The Gnostic Creed,” and “The Gnostic Doctrine.”Par sons’ other project was The Witchcraft, a course on magick forthe layman. Surviving documents include “Basic Magick: FundamentalTheory and Practice,” “Manifesto of The Witchcraft,” and a few chap-ters of a book called The Cup, the Sword and the Crux Ansata. Parsonswrote the manifesto June 15, 195 0, but he still thought enough ofBabalon to note this as the y ear 4000. However, the date is inconsis-tent with pr evious Babalon-influenced dates . In 1946, Hubbar d pro-claimed the year Babalon 4063, and in 1949 Parsons dated The Book ofAntiChrist 4066. The year 4000 may indicate a change of his number-ing system; it is not a misprint.Par sons’ purpose in creating these texts was clear: To Cameron hewrote, “Simplicity has been the k ey to victory in all the idea w arsand, at present, Magick does not have it. There is the skeleton in theRights of Man [Crowley’s Liber OZ], and the coverings in the main lit-erature. But the true body has never been shown forth.”In addition, short outlines on “General Field Theory” that Parsonsleft unfinished could almost be taken as precursors of the late RupertSheldrake’s “morphogenetic field theory .” Notes on W agner’s TheRingtake us to the final chapter of Freedom: it is “The Star ofBabalon,” already mentioned. Part of Parsons’ The Book of Babalon,this chapter consists of instructions received from Babalon herself forthe Magical Child. Much like the magical letter in the beautiful gnos-tic “Hymn of the P earl,” these instructions would serve to effect ananamnesis(awakening) on the child’s part, to further her mission onEarth. This text serves as further e vidence that it w as not Cameronwho was to become Babalon, but someone as yet unknown.As noted, Camer on occasionally sho wed her art, but she ne versold it.

Near the end of her life sherequested permission fr om JPLto give her gr andson Silver a tour ,wanting him to see wher e his “grandfather” had worked, a requestthat was granted. Cameron died of cancer on July 24, 1995, aged 73.Having reviewed the life of John P arsons in more depth than mostwriters, I ha ve come to the conclusion that he has been misunder-stood—even misrepresented. Historians of rocketry and the space pro-gram seem to have underestimated his contributions to the field, whilewriters on the occult have romanticized him as some sort of great sor-cerer. Without his contributions to both solid and liquid fuels , theAmerican space program would not be where it is today. In less thanfive years, Parsons accomplished what Robert Goddard could not do ina lifetime. The list concerning the top leader s in the world of rocketrycontained in von Kármán’s 1958 letter, written the same y ear as thesolid-fueled Explorer I, was self-aggrandizing, as von Kármán himselfadmitted. To wit, Malina had written to von Kármán concerning opin-ion on who were the top 10 Americans who had contributed to the pro-gram. “Starting, of course, with ourselves, the list is of the following,”von Kármán replied. Parsons name was at the top.While one cannot take von Kármán’s name off the top of that list,there is justification for placing P arsons’ name abo ve Malina’ s, asPar sons is the individual who per severed in the face of r epeated fail-ures, and Parsons and the others funded their own research until some-one (Hap Arnold) finally took notice . Furthermore, Parsons was theone in the field blowing up rocket after rocket until he found just theright combination that w orked. Von Kármán encour aged him, butPar sons did the difficult and e xtremely hazardous work. Everythingtoday in the field of solid fuel r ockets is essentially P arsons’ work, ifslightly modified. Obviously , it cannot be said that P arsons single-handedly won the war, but his JATOswere deployed in several areas forits last thr ee y ears. In addition, the global compan y A erojet w asfounded upon Parsons’ innovations with solid fuels, and nothing else.It is likely that Parsons’ underestimation had little to do with hisoccult activities, which seem to ha ve been tolerated as one of man yeccentricities associated with his brand of genius. Amo Smith had hispith helmet, Malina was a communist, and von Kármán talked aboutthe golem—this was the normal state of affair s at Caltech.

He did not hold a degreefrom an accredited university.One of the biggest questions r emaining is wh y P arsons andForman abandoned r ockets altogether at the end of the w ar. Theirearly work was diverted into other dir ections as the w ar demandednew technologies, yet it was not they but Malina who took up pur erocketry after the war ended. Was Parsons’ work with the OTOmoreimportant now than his profession? Did Aerojet make him sign a non-competition agr eement? W as he r esting on his laur els when heshould have been pursuing other fields of research? Or was there sim-ply no funding for such things an ymore? Hopefully, and likely, con-sidering Parsons’ mentality, his original inter est was more than amatter of mere profit, but what had started as a passion got lost inthe distraction of war and personal upheavals.Today, Parsons’ inspir ed ingr edient for r ocket fuel, ammoniumperchlorate, is causing its o wn pr oblems. A ccording to JonathanParfrey, president of Physicians for Social Responsibility, toxicologicalstudies by the EPA show that perchlorate is an endocrine disruptorwhich also harms fetal development. Perchlorate has also been linkedto conditions like aplastic anemia and hypothyroidism. After havingleached into groundwater at Aerojet’s Sacramento, San Gabriel andChino Hills facilities , multimillion-dollar per chlorate cleanups ar ecurrently underway.In contradistinction to the under estimation in the field of r ocketscience and the aerospace industry, Parsons’ accomplishments in thearcane sciences have been highly overrated and grossly exaggerated.As a magician he was essentially a failure. As a Thelemite he learnedthe hard way what w as required. He lo ved Crowley’s “Law” butcouldn’t adhere to it—though he tried harder than most. He violatedthe rules, undertook unauthorized and unorthodo x magical oper a-tions, and claimed the gr ade of Magister Templiwithout first com-pleting all the gr ades below it. He couldn’t handle w orking underauthority—his ego w as too big. His r ecord of failur e is v aluable inthat regard. He w as a gr eat promulgator of thelemic ideals in hisessays, but as an idealist his elitism ruined his w ork. Indeed, somewould say he was guilty of hubris, which the gods always punish.In his (short) per sonal and business liv es Parsons also scor edpoorly. His romantic naiveté led him to trust those whom he shouldnot have trusted. He chose some v ery good friends but also somevery bad associates.

In addition, his mix-up with the Israelis was perhaps a sim-ple mistake in judgement, but one that he could ha ve avoided quiteeasily. He admired them but misjudged U.S.policy.The whole matter of his death has also been gr eatly overempha-sized. Suicide is simply not tenable, and the only clear possible mur-der suspect is K ynette, the cr ooked cop, although ther e ma y beothers. A U.S.scientist who attempted to pass go vernment “secrets”onto the Isr aelis, and who w as loading e xplosive chemicals on atruck bound for Mexico and then Israel, may have won himself a fewanonymous enemies.Despite these suspicions and the fact that P arsons was an experi-enced handler of explosives, his death may truly have been acciden-tal.

Even a safety-conscious expert could leta tin can slip out of a sw eaty hand. The hole in the floor, the shrap-nel stuck in lo w places, the loss of the right arm, all point to adropped container . And it is questionable just ho w “safety-con-scious” was a man who stored all sorts of dangerous explosives in hiskitchen, on the back porch, in unlicensed labs in residential areas.The only evidence not easily e xplained is the detectiv e’s originalcomment that the e xplosion occurred behindPar sons, and the factthat the trash can was full of explosive substances which should nothave been ther e.

She w as survived by her son Kwen Smith and his wife ,along with their two children and their two grandchildren. Helen wasthe oldest OTOinitiate at the time of her death, the numer ologicallysignificant age of 93. Her obituary sa ys that for a long period in herlife “she may well have been the only regularly active priestess in theworld who carried forth the celebr ation of the mass of EcclesiaGnostica Catholica.” Per her wishes there was no funeral; she enjoyedher privacy to the end.One other notable event took place since this book was first pub-lished four y ears ago. I w as able to unco ver the inspir ation forPar sons’ Black Pilgrimage , which I discussed in chapter 1 0. Thesource was M.R. James’ short story “Count Magnus ,” published in1904. It has been reprinted in several places; my copy is in CollectedGhost Stories, published b y W ordsworth Editions , Ltd. in 1992.I believe the story may also be found online.The fictional Count Magnus De la Gardie was a late 16th-century/early 17th-century mage residing in a huge manor in Vestergothland,Sweden. He seems to have been named for a real Count Magnus wholived in the same area from 1622 to 1686, but the tw o have nothingelse in common. The center of the story is the m ysterious BlackPilgrimage he w as said to ha ve undertaken, what form it actuallytook, and what he brought back from it. The nature of the pilgrimageitself is never discovered, though the thing he brought back is hintedat. It seems to ha ve been some sort of supernatur al beast, a demonor familiar spirit that protected Magnus even in death.James does specify the destination of the Black Pilgrimage. It wasChorazin in Palestine (now in Israel), the city which Jesus cursed, thecity which later legends said w ould birth the Antichrist, the citywhich Parsons also named as the destination of his pilgrimage . Itsunique black ruins still stand; they are black because they are madeof the local basalt. Of all of Chor azin’s ruins, the best-known is theunfinished synagogue. James has Magnus write of his Liber nigraeperegrinationis, “If any man desires to obtain a long life, if he would"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"obtain a faithful messenger and see the blood of his enemies , it isnecessary that he should first go into the city of Chorazin, and theresalute the prince [of the air].” The story doesn’t specify ho w longMagnus lived, but based on internal evidence one may deduce it wasaround 120 years. The story does mak e clear that Magnus obtainedhis faithful messenger, and did have occasion to see the blood of hisenemies.On F ebruary 28, 1946 P arsons wr ote Liber 49, a book fr omBabalon whose 58th v erse sa ys, “Thou shalt mak e the BlackPilgrimage.” No further details w ere given until Parsons wrote TheBook of AntiChrista few years later. In The Book of AntiChrist, thefirst section of which is entitled “The Black Pilgrimage ,” Parsonswrote that he began his pilgrimage in November of 1949, in responseto a dream he says came from Babalon. He describes the pilgrimageas an astral working conducted in his temple.Par sons wrote, “And I went into the sunset with Her sign, and intothe night past accursed and desolate places and cyclopean ruins, andso came at last to the City of Chor azin. And there a great tower ofBlack Basalt was raised, that was part of a castle whose further bat-tlements reeled over the gulf of the star s. And upon the to wer wasthis sign [a circle inscribed with an inverted triangle]. And one heav-ily robed and veiled showed me the sign, and told me to look, andbehold, I saw flash below me four past lives wherein I had failed inmy object.” P arsons goes on to name these past liv es; I ha vedescribed each of them in detail in chapter 1 0. After this he writes ,“And thereafter I w as taken within and saluted the Prince of thatplace . . .,” echoing Magnus’ instructions to go into the city andsalute the Prince of the Air. Judging from hints in Parsons’ letters toKarl Germer in 1949 and later, his purpose was not long life, a faith-ful messenger, nor to see the blood of his enemies; it was always thefurtherance of Thelema. (But if the furtherance of Thelema necessi-tated an y of these , Parsons sur ely hoped the y w ould follo w. Hespecifically names Christianity—all of Christianity—as the enem y ofmankind.) The pilgrimage itself is not mentioned again in his sur-viving writings.In Ghosts & Scholarsissue 26, Jamesian scholars Rosemary Pardoeand Jane Nicholls discuss the possible literary and historical sourcesfor James’ Black Pilgrimage . They document James’ kno wledge ofthe apocryphal Revelation of the Pseudo-Methodius(fourth century)in which Chor azin is fir st mentioned as the birthplace of theAntichrist, as well as his familiarity with W. Bousset’s Der Antichrist,201Afterword"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"published in 1895, which also documents the legend. James’ favoritestory by the early Irish horr or writer Sheridan Le F anu was “TheFamiliar,” in which the phr ase “the prince of the po wers of the air”occurs. The phr ase originates with St. P aul, who r efers to Satan inthis manner in Ephesians 2:2, and James w ould have known aboutits Biblical origin as well.Par doe and Nicholls also document James’ familiarity with JohnDee. James edited a list of Dee’ s manuscripts in 1921, compiling hislist from several others and from original sources. One of the titles onElias Ashmole’s list was Liber Peregrinationis Primae(The Book of theFirst Pilgrimage). The author s speculate that this title influencedJames’ Liber nigr ae per egrinationis(The Book of the BlackPilgrimage). This may be, but it only takes a basic knowledge of Latinto translate such a title. (Dee’s book describes magical conversationsrecorded during a trip to Krakow in 1583.)Par doe and Nicholls e xcel when the y sho w just ho w P arsonscould’ve encounter ed James’ story—and it occurr ed only monthsbefore he received his instruction to go on the Black Pilgrimage fromBabalon. Samuel D. Russell wrote an essay on James which appearedin the Fall 1945 issue of The Acolyte(a fanzine). Russell and Parsonsboth frequented the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society (LASFS), soit’s fairly certain that James was discussed there. Parsons received hisinstructions on February 28, 1946, which seems to imply he had beenreading James recently.Unless further e vidence appear s, it appear s that M.R. Jamesinvented the Black Pilgrimage as a liter ary device based on legendsof Chor azin, r ather than its being a genuine magical tr adition.Par sons took inspiration for a magical working based on this concept,just as he had tak en inspir ation fr om other fantas y w orks (forinstance, his fa vorite no vel w as Jack Williamson’ s supernatur althriller Darker Than Y ou Think, discussed in chapter 4.)

Despite the criticism, Parsons continued to takehis inspiration wherever he would find it.James doesn’t tell us how Count Magnus died; his death is a mys-tery, as is Parsons’. In contrast, however, Magnus had something thatPar sons didn’t. He had his “faithful messenger ,” the thing that hebrought back from his Black Pilgrimage, the thing that protected hisestate even after his death.
