The editors regret the long production timedue to unforeseen health problems among two of its members. The final editing ofthe manuscript was finished by January 2012.The conference was born out of an exhibition at the Museum of Cultural History,Dead Classic, which had opened just a month earlier. The exhibition was apresentation of artefacts connected with death from the Mediterranean area inthe Museum’s possession and was the largest exhibition of its kind so far inNorway. The idea was to bring together both prehistorical and historicalarchaeologists to discuss theoretical and methodological issues for the purposeof testing diverging perspectives on different phenomena of change, both of ashort and a long time duration, visible in either archaeological or textualmaterial alone, or in combination. The wide approach to the subject encourageddiscussions across some of the traditional chronological and material limits,and called the attention to various observances in past societies, such asbeliefs, rituals, performances, commemorations, social norms and transitions,behavioural and mental states, identities, treatment of bodies, pollution andpurification, taboos, symbols, traditions, and others. The keywords were ritual,change, and transformation processes. The speakers were personally invited andcame from Croatia, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Norway, Romania, andSweden, though not all working in their country of origin.The conference was made possible thanks to a generous contribution from theMuseum of Cultural History and additional support from The Department ofArchaeology, Conservation and History, both at the University of Oslo. The sameinstitutions gave further financial support for the copy-editing of the textsdelivered for publication. We are very grateful to both institutions and hopethat the present publication can be considered as a small, but visible token ofmoney well spent.We owe special thanks to the former Director, Prof. em. Egil Mikkelsen, from theMuseum of Cultural History, for hosting the Ritual Changes-conference andproviding financial guarantees that made the conference possible. Furthermore wewish to thank Research Advisor, Arve Monsen for enthusiastic support, JohnnyKreutz for the conference website and the administrative staff at the Museum forpractical assistance.Our thanks are also extended to Dr Alex Chepstow-Lusty, who diligentlycopy-edited all the papers written by the non-native English speakers, and to DrAdam Lindhagen for help with the index. For any mistakes which remain theeditors take the blame.The publication was already at an advanced stage of preparation when the firstpublisher realised that the publication was beyond their capacity and we weresuggested to use Oxbow Books instead. Sincere thanks go to the staff of OxbowBooks for their professional handling of this publication from the minute theytook over production to the final product. These expressions of thanks are alsoextended to the anonymous peer-reviewers, who made very valuable suggestions toimprove the quality of the publication. In particular, we should like to thankMs Clare Litt and Julie Blackmore, who patiently has supported this publicationproject in its final, important stages of production.The Norwegian Research Council generously covered some of the publication costs,a necessity to see the book safely through to print.Last, but not least, we should like to thank all the participants, who allcontributed in making the seminar a successful event, and in particular to thosewho found the time and energy to rewrite their papers into what makes up thisbook. We were very touched by their many expressions of thanks afterwards. Wewill also use this opportunity to forward an excuse to the authors (and to thereaders) for the unexpected vicissitudes of production, which has delayed thepublication unnecessarily.J.

Rasmus BrandtFor the human being there is only one way into this world, through the woman’swomb, but many ways to leave it, from a natural death due to old age, to deadlysicknesses and mortal accidents and disasters, to duels, wars, and meaninglessmassacres, like the one experienced near Oslo at Utøya on July 22, 2011. Even ifthere are in general only two ways of getting rid of the corpse: by inhumation(in soil, air, or water) or by cremation, the forms by which the deceased arebrought to rest are as many as there are causes of death, from the corpse beingleft to the decompositional hazards of atmospherical forces, scavenging birdsand animals, and insects, to being ‘preserved by smoking, embalming, orpickling; they are eaten – raw, cooked, or rotten… or they are dismembered andtreated in a variety of these ways’ (Metcalf & Huntington 1991: 24), to beingproperly interred.The funerals, the framework of how to eliminate the corpse, are ‘the occasionfor avoiding people or holding parties, for fighting or having sexual orgies,for weeping or laughing, in a thousand different combinations’ (Metcalf &Huntington 1991: 24). These celebrations, generally termed death rituals, can beperformed in many ways from the most simple act of deportment in solitude to theengagement of large masses of people in laborious and creative festivities. Byritual in a funerary context we mean a strategy which incorporates all theactions performed and thoughts expressed in connection with a dying and deadperson, from the preparatory pre-death stages to the final deposition of thecorpse and the post-mortem stages of grief and commemoration. Seeing ritual ‘aspart of a process of social reproduction’ (see the article of Nilsson Stutz) wehave chosen to adopt this wide and flexible definition as a reflection of thecomplex and multiple practices performed in funerary situations, seen both froma chronological and a geographical point of view. In short, the funeraryprocess, or cycle, cover the rites performed from the moment of the biologicaldeath of a person to the final interment of the corpse and its thereby socialdeath (Weiss-Krejci 2011: 70–80). It is a large web of ideas turned into actionsin a wide variety of expressions.The central theme of this book, however, is not to look primarily into differentfunerary practices, their function and meaning, but into the changes of suchrituals and how they shall be explained. Many practices become more easilyvisible when looked at through studies of change. In order to approach theproblem of funerary changes from a wide variety of situations, scholars fromdifferent prehistoric and historical periods (which span from the MesolithicPeriod to early modern times, some contributors also drawing parallels to modernsociety: Nilsson Stutz, Härke/Belinskij, Brandt, Bowden) and working indifferent geographical areas (which cover the Old World from the Atlantic Oceanto the Caucasus and from the Arctic Sea to the Mediterranean) were asked to giveexamples from their fields of study and to reflect upon theoretical andmethodological issues connected to their case studies. This is a seriouschallenge to both the editors, the publisher, and the reading public, and hasbeen done on purpose. As editors we find it important to transgress theboundaries of time and place specialisations. Each specialisation develops itsown sets of interpretations and ‘truths’ depending on the availability ofphysical material and/or textual information. Thus it happens that when a changein one kind of funerary practice in one field of archaeology is interpreted withreference to eschatology and cosmology, a similar change in another field isinterpreted as a simple change of trend. Both fields may be right in theirinterpretations, but some challenges across the specialisation boundaries arenecessary to stimulate further research. In fact, three of the contributors,Härke and Belinskij and Gilchrist, address this particular problem ofchronological specialisation boundaries and call for more continuity studies aschanges are most often not abrupt, but best visible in a longue duréeperspective.In difference to other social actions, an organised burial is performed to‘preserve’ the deceased for ‘eternity’; tombs are therefore the most commondiscovery in archaeology – and since, in addition, many graves containfurnishings of remarkable workmanship and high spectacular and economic value,burial archaeology has attracted easier funding. The majority of archaeologicalfinds in all museums around the world derive from grave contexts; burialarchaeology is therefore perhaps the most thriving discipline of the field.Publications are many (the long bibliographies presented by the presentcontributors open only a small glimpse into this vast publishing world) and onemay ask why a new publication in the field is necessary. By concentrating onchange it is our hope that we shall be able to introduce new ways (or old waysin new settings) into the study of the function and meaning of funerarypractices and the processes which triggered the changes. Analyses of the cadaverper se, like osteology, isotopes, and DNA, will not be considered in thispublication, though this does not exclude that observations on the corpse areconsidered.In this introductory chapter we should like, not to make a presentation of eachsingular contribution (for that the reader is advised to read the abstract ofeach article), rather to pull together some of the theoretical issues andmethodological grips used by the contributors, in order to reveal how thearticles are bound together despite the wide chronological and geographicalframework adopted. This will be done by presenting briefly some concepts relatedto the central problem of the present publication, as the question about Changeand Continuity, and to some of the important elements of the funerary processconnected to Belief and Ritual, Body and Deposition, Place and Burial,Performance and Commemoration.Before doing so, however, it should at once be noted that apart from addressingchanges in funerary practices, a change can also be noted in the contributors’approach to the changing rituals problem. In the wake of the intensive debate onprocessual and post-processual archaeology in the 1970s and 1980s, thearchaeologists moved from documenting the funerary material with a view tochronology, geographical origin, and distribution to look at the same materialin a social context reflecting status and identity of the dead. In the presentpublication, independently of each other, the contributors have shifted theirfocus to the burial itself and the social behaviour, the mental metaphors, andthe belief systems hidden in the funerary practices, and whether they can beextracted from the funerary material itself and/or from written evidence – inother words, the focus is shifted more to a study of the content of thepractices than of their form.Change and continuity1The keyword in the present publication is change. But what do we mean by change?Implicitly it means something altered that is seen in relation to what isconsidered normal/the norm and thus requires an explanation. The purpose of thiscollection of articles is to document how changes manifested themselves in thearchaeological/textual material, why changes were made and in what way they canbe explained – whether related to changes in the funerary ceremonies andeschatological ideas per se or to other types of changes in the society. Whilethe how question will regard the funerary form or the archaeological/textual (=empirical) data, through the questions why and in what way we may approach thefunerery content or the social behaviour and ancient belief systems connected toeschatology and cosmology. However, in such discussions it is important toconsider if a change in form necessitates a change in content.From an archaeological point of view changes can be observed in many ways, mosteasily visible in a change in the treatment of the dead body from being inhumedto being cremated, or vice versa (Nilsson Stutz, Fowler, Ahrens, Pearce,Rebillard, Achim, Oestigaard); however, the changes may also regard the lay-outand distribution of tombs (Dolfini, Fowler, Achim), the treatment of thedeceased in the tomb, whether as a primary or secondary deposition (NilssonStutz, Dolfini, Fowler, Oestigaard, Gilchrist), tomb forms and architecture(Fowler, Härke & Belinskij, Ahrens, Pearce, Rebillard, Achim, Bowden,Oestigaard, Gilchrist), themes in funerary pictorial decorations (Brandt),composition of the funerary goods (Fowler, Härke & Belinskij, Pearce, Bowden,Oestigaard), inscription formulas (Ahrens), etc. Though many changes in funerarypractices may not be visible in the archaeological material, and only in thetextual material (Tarlow, see also Rebillard) – this is a limitation difficultto get round.What drives a ritual change? As demonstrated by many of the contributors aritual change is not necessarily related to changes in the belief system (as,for example, witnessed with the conversion to Christianity: Achim, Gilchrist),rather to other social and cultural phenomena (Nilsson Stutz; see also Ahrens),as attitudes to death (Brandt, Rebillard), to the body (Nilsson Stutz, Dolfini,Fowler, Pearce), to tensions between social norms and individual behaviour(Härke & Belinskij, Oestigaard, Tarlow), to mental stress (Bowden), and otherfactors – in fact the causes of ritual change may often be strongly interlinked,and hence not bound to one single obvious cause (Härke & Belinskij).How do changes appear? They can be abrupt breaking away from the dominatingscheme (Nilsson Stutz), often the result of intentional acts of a social,political, and/or religious character on a local, regional, or world-wide level(Ahrens, Rebillard, Achim, Bowden, Oestigaard, Gilchrist); and they can begradual of a longue durée (Fowler, Härke & Belinski, Pearce, Tarlow) referringto societal developments and alterations. In some cases a change also appears asa reworking or reinvention of older traditions (Oestigaard, Gilchrist). Anobserved change in the archaeological material, however, may not necessarilyexpress a change as such, it may also be an expression of continuity. ChrisFowler in an earlier version of his contribution asked in the title: ‘The morethings change, the more they remain the same?’ This is a challenging question,because what often appears to be a change may actually be an expression of thesame, only expressed differently. This may be why some of the contributors haveused the antonym of change, continuity, as part of their title (Fowler, Brandt,Rebillard; and indirectly Dolfini), whether as an affirmation or as a question.Belief and ritualBeliefs are the content of the funerary practices, with rituals the forms inwhich the content, through the practices, are expressed. The forms can beexpressed in many ways through ephemeral actions, such as for example, dance andmusic, grief and laughter, and through physical material in the form ofnecropoleis, tombs, furnishings, but also through pictorial presentations of thepractices and inscriptions in various media, both within and outside a funerarycontext.When studying the physical material preserved we study the material of pastactions, or the form of ritual/funerary practices (Nilsson Stutz, Brandt).According to practice theory, well presented by Nilsson Stutz, the understandingof the past actions will ideally reveal how ritual as a process works and theembodied experience of this process, i.e. the active participation in the ritualcreates a sense of structure in the participant, through which meaning, inherentin action, is formulated. This means that meaning as such could vary, while theembodied knowledge – the sense of how things are done – was shared, or in otherwords: the participants would have had a sense of what a ‘proper’ burial wouldbe like, but they may have projected different meanings to the practices. Asimilar attitude to the practices, but not expressed in a theoretical framework,can be found also in the contributions by Bowden and Oestigaard, who both,within the established ritual practices, stress the role of the living inconveying messages about the dead person, their relation to the deceased and toother members of the society, to ancestors, to the spiritual world, or in usingthe deceased as a medium for social outcomes in the reconstitution of society(cf. also Härke & Belinskij).This interpretative model gives greater flexibility to the interpretations ofthe funerary data, but does not exclude a bond between the data (i.e. thefunerary practices) and the belief systems, whether they are connected toafterlife (Fowler, Härke & Belinskij, Brandt, Gilchrist), to cosmologiesconcerning the human body (Dolfini), or to other eschatological ideas (Ahrens,Oestigaard, Tarlow). By looking at rituals as a practice, both in social andreligious life, they open up a sphere of manifold interpretations, in whichnegotiations, manipulations, and constructions of political and cosmologicalorders are active (Oestigaard).In these examples, belief is presented as a religious, or theological belief,concerning transcendental actions and forces, but belief, or rather ‘beliefdiscourses’, can also be expressed in different forms, as social, scientific,and folk beliefs; by which they all affect the kinds of rituals that surroundthe dead body (Tarlow). Tarlow’s conclusions are drawn from the study of awealthy set of written sources, but such a categorisation of beliefs iscertainly not only limited to an early modern European society; it may well havebeen part and package of funerary practices in other societies in other timeperiods as well – we only have to start looking for them. Taboo may be animportant element of such non-religious beliefs (Brandt). Tarlow also makesanother observation of interest and contrary to the normal understanding of therelationship of belief and ritual: under certain circumstances ritual action mayactually have been more stable than belief.Body and depositionThe deposition of the dead body is the main objective of all funerary practices;this can be done either by cremation or inhumation. The choice of the one or theother practice has often been related to eschatological ideas and ancient beliefsystems, but here, as in other aspects of funerary practices, multipleexplanations, evaluated case by case, are now more favoured. This comes more tolight when a change from one practice to another is considered, but it does notexclude a religious explanation. For example, the Christian insistence oninhumation may well be connected to their belief of resurrection at Judgment Day(Achim, Gilchrist), but the change from cremation to inhumation in the RomanEmpire from the 2nd century AD onwards was not the result of Christian thoughtsof death and afterlife, but the practice was upheld by them. The change canrather be ascribed to a change of fashion, as has also been observed in earlierperiods when in Rome the mode of deposition changed (Morris 1992: 52–68).Alternatively, the change in the Imperial Period has suggestively also beenattributed to a new, pre-Christian concern for the body (Rebillard).Practical circumstances may often have been the reason for a change ofdeposition practices, as when in Victorian England, due to over-crowdedcemeteries, hygienic considerations, and new furnace technology, cremation (evenif contested and causing distress and conflict) gradually became the norm(Nilsson Stutz). In a more distant past, when both practices appear next to eachother in the same region or between neighbouring regions, they may not have beenconsidered as something contrary, rather, as in the Greek and Roman Asia Minor,as two options in a multifaceted specter of funerary rites connected topractical considerations, personal preferences, traditions, fashions, and evento migrations (previously the most favoured model among cultural historians toexplain the reasons for a change in the deposition mode) (Ahrens; cf. alsoAchim). Actually, the tendency among a couple of the present authors, incomparison with other contextual evidence, is to downplay the importance of theshifts in such funerary practices (Fowler, Pearce), though it does not eliminatethe fact that cremation (more than inhumation) dramatised the transformation ofthe dead, making it visible to the mourners (Fowler). However, it shall not beexcluded that the choice between the one or the other practice can have carriedmore or less strong ideological implications, especially in times of religious,social, and political upheaval, as in the early Viking Age in Norway, conveyingexplicit references to funerals, which both break with tradition and at the sametime reinvent it (Oestigaard).Cremation or inhumation was one way of treating the dead body, another was toexpose it to disarticulation, i.e. the whole body, or body parts, were disturbedand manipulated, whether at the moment of interment or at a later re-opening ofthe grave (Nilsson Stutz, Dolfini – in Mesolithic and Neolithic contextsrespectively in the Baltic area and Italy), or through reburial in a secondarycontext (Dolfini; see also Gilchrist). This is a phenomenon which can befollowed through all periods, finding its extreme result in charnel houses fromthe Medieval Period onwards. The explanations for their manipulation may bemany. They can, as in the present examples, be connected to questions of thenature of the disarticulated bones, if they were considered of this or the otherworld, or if they were associated with questions of social control and normalcy(Nilsson Stutz), in which questions of ancestry and group and individualidentity may have played an important part (Dolfini). In both case studies canbe sensed a view in which bones of dead persons were imbued with some kind oftranscendental power, a view still actively maintained, but under a differentexplanatory umbrella, in early modern Europe through the veneration of saintsand martyrs and through folk practices as ‘bier-right’ and the curative power ofthe ‘dead hand’ (Tarlow).The treatment of the body raises also a question about the soul. Even if nottreated in particular in this publication the soul is normally related to ideasof immortality, as among the Etruscans (Brandt) and the Romans, and ofresurrection, as among the Christians, in all three examples linked to apreceding death journey. In early Christian thinking only pure souls, notburdened with heavy sins, could find their rest inside a church (Achim), and inlater Medieval thoughts the soul could be protected on its purgatory journey byitems buried with the dead: in fact, the progress of the soul in judgmentappears to have been directly affected by the condition of the corpse in thegrave. The experience of the Christian dead in Purgatory was embodied andsensory, and the living could alleviate their suffering by taking theappropriate preparations of the corpse and the grave (Gilchrist) – ideas whichwere not alien to Etruscan (and Roman) ritual thinking, only enveloped in adifferent dress. With the Protestants the journey through Purgatory waseliminated – the soul went directly to Judgment, and nothing that the living didcould make any difference to the fate of the dead person’s soul (Tarlow).Place and burialThe deposition of the body in most societies was not a chance act; first theplace and shape of the tomb had to be decided. In an Etrusco-Roman context aclear distinction was made between the place of the dead and the place of theliving. Due to an inherent risk of pollution, all dead (with some exceptions ofchildren in their first months/years of life) were buried outside the spacereserved for the dwellings. However, this was a time-defined situation and notobserved with the same rigidity within the boundaries of the Roman Empire. Theimportance of place is underlined in two of the present articles and expressestwo modes of change, both connected to the conceptional views of the deadbodies: the first, in a centrifugal movement, from lived towards unlived areas(Dolfini); the other in a contrary, centripetal movement from the unlived backto the lived areas (Achim).In the Italian peninsula, in the transition between the Neolithic and Copper Age(late 5th/4th millennia BC), burials were gradually moved from the nucleatedvillages to their peripheral areas before they were gathered in cemeterieslocated in the landscape. The process may be explained not as a change in themeaning of the burial per se, but as a change in the medium chosen by thesociety to stress the same group identity which were previously conveyed byco-residence, and which made the body of the dead a major locus for thereproduction of prehistoric society (Dolfini). A similar process of change fromisolated burials to the use of collective burial grounds could also be observedin Northumberland, England, in the Early Bronze Age (c. 2400–1500 BC), also hereunderlining the importance of the body, person, and death for the community inthe ritualised transformation of the dead (Fowler).New views on the dead bodies, not as a polluter in the Etrusco-Roman view, butas sacred and holy, permanently purified at the moment of baptism and‘prefiguring the transformed body that would be resurrected into eternal life atthe end of time’ (Paxton 2011), in early Christian times (and thus linked to achanged belief system) caused an opposite, centripetal movement of the burialsfrom the outside of towns, towards the inside – at first detached from, butlater unified with the new cult monuments, the churches. The case study selectedconcentrates on the Scythia Minor and Moesia Secunda (present day southeastRomania and northeast Bulgaria) and presents new important data on this processfrom an area in the periphery of the Roman Empire, an area otherwise not easilyaccessible and not much known (Achim).Size and shape of graves, and the composition and wealth of grave goods aregenerally considered as markers of the deceased’s social position and identity.Long descriptions of funerary monuments and physical contents are avoided inthis publication. Instead the discussions and interpretations, seen in relationto funerary changes, underline the complex multiple meanings attached to thefunerary data. Some interpretations are connected to ritual, worship, and beliefsystems (Dolfini, Fowler, Brandt, Achim, Gilchrist), others to practicalpurposes (Ahrens) and the use of traditions (Oestigaard), and others again tosocial life and behaviour (Pearce, Bowden), interpretations already touched uponin the previous sub-chapter or which will be elaborated a bit further in thenext.Performance and commemorationThe funerary ritual, much like a religious festival, is an orchestratedperformance in which the ‘programme might evolve in a succession of shiftingmoods and sentiments, guided by symbolic, that is, imaginative and affectivestimulants’ (Bouvrie 2012: 62). It covers often a pre-defined period whichextends from the physical death of the person solemnised to his/her social deathmarked by the interment and successive concluding ritual acts. Depending on theassociated belief systems the programme guides and modulates the acts andsentiments of family and friends through the ceremony and guarantees thedeceased a ‘proper’ burial. The programme can involve moments of dance andmusic, weapon fights and erotic plays, weeping and laughter, eating and drinking– Etruscan tomb paintings being a rich treasure for establishing the componentsof this people’s funerary rituals (Brandt).In societies with a belief system propagating a death journey and a life afterdeath, the duration of the funerary rituals is often considered a liminal periodin which the dead subject has not yet become an object of commemoration, but issomething in between, and which by Julia Kristeva is referred to as an abject(Nilsson Stutz). It is a particularly difficult period for the deceased whenhe/she is operating in a no-man’s land on the way from one kind of lifeexistence to another. The funerary process thus becomes a ritual passage for thedeceased, composed of three phases: separation (the pre-liminal phase),transition (the liminal phase), and reintegration (the post-liminal phase). InEtruscan tomb paintings this process can be followed as a parallel journeyundertaken by both the deceased and the living mourners in which the actions ofthe latter shall ease the passage of the former (Brandt). A similar mode ofliminal thinking may also be unveiled if mortuary deposits (here in an EarlyBronze Age context from England) are studied, not primarily as indicators ofsocial standing and prestige, but reflecting mortuary rites (whether the bodywas inhumed or cremated) as being the result of a sequence of ritualised actionsthat transform social relations and identities (Fowler).Christian beliefs of afterlife and the embodied experience of Purgatory containelements of a similar thinking: separation (deathbed rites of confession,communion, and the sacrament of extreme unction) and transition (the preparationand dressing of the deceased during which the living were empowered to assistthe soul through Purgatory) (Gilchrist), but in difference to the Etruscans (andRomans) the Christian mourners did not participate actively in the liminalritual performances, and in difference to the Christians the Etruscanreintegration did not contain an element of resurrection of the flesh.The performed sequence of ritual actions may, as mentioned, be used toorchestrate the sentiments of the mourners, for example, creating ecstatic moodsthrough dance, laughter, and erotic plays (Brandt), but such sentiments aredifficult to abstract from the funerary material. However, the materialdeposited by the participants of the funerary ritual may, apart from a possiblesocial status, also reflect symbolically the identity of the dead embodying andevoking a certain life style (Pearce, in Roman Britain and Belgium/theNetherlands) – or even, through a wide diversity of burial practices, reflectthe uncertainties and anxieties that accompanied the adoption of new practicesin a rapidly changing world (Bowden, in post-Roman Albania).Sacrifices and banquets are returning elements of the funerary procedures.Sacrifices of animals, in addition to honouring a particular deity, had apurative effect in societies in which death was considered as pollution, asamong the Etruscans and Romans (Brandt). Sacrifices also recall blood, animportant element in Etruscan funerary customs, as a blood sacrifice (whetheracquired by a slain animal or through fierce human combats) was considered togive immortality to the deceased’s soul. In some societies, animals weredeposited with the deceased, such as horses in the nomadic Sarmatian phase (2ndcentury BC–4th/5th century AD) of the Klin-Yar cemetery in the North Caucasus(Härke & Belinskij); a possible human sacrifice from the same period in the samenecropolis appears to be an extremely rare occurrence, but together with theanimal sacrifice may raise a question of belief in immortality.In North Africa, in the 3rd century AD, animal sacrifice to the dead gave way tobanquets as the focus of ritual attention, but was, as already observed, not theresult of a Christianisation of the dead, but an important act of piety(Rebillard). Banquets had also previously been a central element in funeraryrituals, in an Etruscan context marking the end of the transitional liminalperiod of the celebrations (Brandt), perhaps coinciding with an animal sacrificeas seen in Roman usage. In an Early Bronze Age context, animal bones fromburials and their environs may comprise direct evidence for foodstuffs consumedby the funerary participants and/or burnt on the cremation pyre (Fowler), thelast a habit also observed in a northern European Roman context (Pearce). Animalsacrifice is often considered as an act of purification, a concept which,together with its antonym pollution, is often closely connected with funerarypractices (Brandt). In some societies (as in Bronze Age England, and ClassicalGreece and Rome) cremation may be looked upon as a purifying act and emblematicof physical transformation (Fowler, Ahrens), but in Persian funerary practicesan exposure of the body to water and fire was considered as acts of pollution(Ahrens).Funerary ritual is not only a question of belief (as already discussed), butalso of commemoration of the deceased beyond the moment of death and interment.This runs as a leitmotif through most burial practices and is an area ofextraordinary complexity as funerary rituals and memorials to the dead send outa multiplicity of messages (Bowden). However, the need for commemoration isperhaps more strongly emphasised in societies in which ancestor cult isimportant in regularising social and political imperatives. For example, in bothNeolithic/Chalcolithic Italy and Early Bronze Age England, ancestorcommemoration rituals were crucial to the development of ideas of lineages,identity and personhood (Dolfini, Fowler), basic ideas which are well preservedboth in later Etruscan beliefs in afterlife (Brandt), in Roman funerarySelbstdarstellung art (Pearce), and Viking Age ‘death myths’ (Oestigaard).To conclude, funerary practices (covering the period from the biological to thesocial death of a person), if looked upon as a web, or rather as a piece oftextile built up of vertical threads expressing movement in time and horizontalthreads movement in space, they can be said to have a clearly defined frame. Thepractices, however, consist of threads loosely bound to each other: some threadsrepresent practices which can be followed through both in time and space, somerepresent practices which can be followed in one time period across largespaces, while others represent threads which are linked to one space over a longperiod of time; some practices may also appear in one shape, later developinginto a different shape, but without changing content. The purpose of thisintroductory chapter has been to highlight some of these threads and demonstratehow the articles in the present publication are woven together despite the widechronological and geographical framework chosen. We leave the reader to judge ifwe have succeeded.Note1 I shall in the following presentation often quote or paraphrase sequencesfrom the contributed articles.

This article provides anopportunity to explore these fundamental questions through the lens provided bypractice theory influenced by ritual theory, and through three case studies: twohistorical examples of ritual change in the handling of the dead body: theintroduction of cremation in Victorian England, and the emergence of theAmerican Way of Death (with embalming and the funeral home), and one prehistoriccase: the handling of the death at two Mesolithic cemeteries in southernScandinavia. It is argued that the focus on practice is especially valuable inarchaeology since it is well adapted to the nature of our sources; the materialremains of past actions. The author explores the usefulness of the practicefocused framework, both to reflect over ritual change and changing rituals inhistoric periods and prehistoric periods where we are limited to thearchaeological sources.Keywords: American way of death, corpse, Mesolithic Period, mortuary ritual,practice theory, Scandinavia, Victorian EnglandHow can archaeology study and understand ritual change and changing rituals? Inorder to begin to answer this question we need to understand why people needritual and what role ritual plays in society. In the past, ritual was oftenunderstood as conservative in nature. This view has long been abandoned, butuntil recently, theory about ritual has (sometimes implicitly) emphasised itsrole in maintaining existing structures. Today, the focus in ritual studies hasshifted toward seeing ritual as part of a process of social reproduction, aprocess that holds the potential for both continuity and change (Bell 1992).This view on ritual as dynamic and as an integral part of social and culturalreproduction is relevant in archaeology, which since its very beginning hasattempted to understand and theorise change within a range of different schoolsof thought. But while archaeology may be comfortable with the concept of change,it is more challenged when approaching ritual. As opposed to other disciplinestied to the field of ritual theory, archaeology does not have access to the samekind of immediate information about the range of the practices, alongside thethoughts and motivation of the practitioners that are often obtained throughwritten and oral accounts. We are limited to the fragmentary remains of whatpeople in the past were doing. I will argue in this article that whilearchaeology’s fragmentary sources continue to constitute a challenge, the recentdevelopments in ritual theory that emphasise practice point toward an importantmethodological opportunity.In archaeology we need a theoretical framework that allows us to reflect onsocial and ritual dynamics on a general scale and that can be articulated to thenature of our sources. Any kind of model assumes a certain amount ofgeneralisation and is founded on the idea that while every culture, and everyindividual is unique, the human condition is a shared experience, and theresponses we have to different situations to a certain extent can be understoodthrough generalising models that allow us to relate to other human beings acrosscultural and chronological boundaries.In this article the problem of ritual change takes its departure in theuniversal experience of death and the encounter with the human cadaver. I arguethat while the human responses to death and the cadaver may be extremelyvariable, all societies deal with death, and the responses tend to be ritual incharacter. After a general introduction to the theoretical understanding of therole of ritual in society and its particular role in mortuary practices, twohistorical cases of changing rituals are introduced in order to discuss thedynamic shifts in social practices that constituted the rituals. Finally, themodel is tested on a prehistoric case, Mesolithic mortuary practices fromScandinavia.The liminal cadaverWhen a social being dies, the survivors are left not only with the abstractproblem of loss and grief, but also with the concrete product of death: acadaver. Archaeology has tended to overlook this aspect of death and focus onlyon the reconstruction of the role of the living – often as part of anarchaeology more interested in burials for their potential for revealing socialroles in life, than in their religious and ritual components. This isunfortunate, because how the body is handled in the mortuary ritual appears tobe universally linked to important cultural phenomena that can give us a morecomplete image of past societies. The handling of the corpse reveals structurestied to attitudes toward the body, the self and other, the dead and the living,culture and nature, order and disorder, and the present, the future and thepast, all potentially crucial dimensions of human life. As archaeologists weneed to work toward a deeper understanding of these phenomena and how and whythe ritual response to death may change over time.In order to define the cadaver and understand it in a ritual context, I havebeen inspired by Julia Kristeva’s abject theory (1980) and Victor Turner’sconcept of liminality and anti-structure (1969). Their respective models can besuccessfully combined in a discussion of the encounter with the cadaver and theprocess of dealing with it and redefining it through ritual. At death the systemof the mindful body and the embodied mind (Csordas 1994; Schepher-Hughes & Lock1987; Varela et al. 1999; and others) breaks down. The body is no longer asubject engaged in the dialectic of structured and structuring practices whichsimultaneously, through hexis, reproduce social order and embody it to the pointof affecting how people feel and think (see Bourdieu 1977: 124; 1980: 117). Thedead body that used to incorporate a person, a subject, is now radically changedon several levels. At first, while the cadaver still resembles the person itused to embody in so many ways, it is no longer this person. Moreover, the factthat death constitutes the starting point for an irreversible process of decayand destruction that will disfigure the remains and alter them forever, gives usa clear indication that social control and cultural shaping of the body nolonger can be exercised from within, but can only be imposed from the outside.But while the body at death loses its subjective character, it does notimmediately acquire an object status. Instead it is located somewhere in betweenthese categories. In fact the cadaver can be perceived as an abject in the sensedefined by Kristeva (1980). She introduced the term as a psychoanalytical andphenomenological category that builds on the French word abject, whichdesignates something repulsive, low and despised (Rehal 1992: 15) and includesassociations to the not-desirable, the borderline, and indeed, the viscerallyrepulsive. The abject is neither subject nor object, but a sort of pseudo-objectlocated in between these defined categories. The human cadaver fits well withinthis model and Kristeva has actually defined it as ‘the ultimate abject’(Kristeva 1980: 11). The lack of obvious separation between the living personand dead body introduces conflicting dimensions of desire and perversion, whilethe otherness of death causes the cadaver to be designated as taboo andnon-object for desire (Rehal 1992: 16). Kristeva makes an important distinctionwhen she points out that it is not the absence of purity or health that definesthe abject, but that which disturbs an identity, a system and an order. Thatwhich does not respect the limits, the places, the rules. The in-between, theambiguous, the mixed (Kristeva 1980: 12). In other words, the category of theabject is especially useful when reflecting over the power of that whichtransgresses cultural categories and defies order, rather than as somethinginherently repulsive (we know for example, that the cadaver is not universallyexperienced as such). But when contemplating the concept of the embodied mindand the mindful body, invested with an embodied sense of rules and limits, wecan begin to sense the danger of the cadaver. Here we have a body that is nolonger controlled from within and thus threatens the order of things. Again, itmay be important to point out here that this does not automatically mean thatthe bodily decay necessarily is seen as a horrifying experience. Rather, byacknowledging that death constitutes a crisis, we can also observe that nomatter what values or associations are projected on the cadaver in differentcultures, all cultures deal with it, albeit in a wide variety of ways.Being no longer a subject nor an object, the cadaver seems to occupy a positionthat integrates well into Victor Turner’s model of liminality and anti-structure(Turner 1969). The cadaver, being neither fully dead nor alive, neither subjectnor object, is clearly a betwixt-and-between category of person/body. It definesa truly liminal category that fits Turner’s definition of its two-fold character‘at once no longer and not yet classified’ (1969: 96). While Turner’s model ofcommunitas and anti-structure was developed to understand initiation rites, itcan also be transposed to mortuary rituals as rites of passage more generallyaccording to the framework proposed by Arnold van Gennep and which Turnercontinues to build upon, as rites which transfers an individual from a definedstate to different but equally defined state (van Gennep 1981: 4). The need forthe ritual stems from the fact that the cadaver has to be separated from theworld of the living in order for the survivors to carry on with their lives. Thecadaver, described as an abject, liminal phenomenon, threatening the order ofsociety and life, constitutes a problem that has to be solved. Now that cultureand society have no place within the body (through hexis), culture and societyhave to be imposed from the outside by others. Through cultural practice, theritual handling of the dead body effectively transforms it from its identity asa living human being. Through the embodied practices of the survivors, the bodyof the dead, the cadaver, is ritualised and redefined. The process of ritualredefinition of the deceased – and of the cadaver – tends to generate structuralconnections with other ‘life crises’ or rites of passage, where the societalorder is recreated and reinforced through embodied ritual practices. As actionin response to the crisis of death, the mortuary practices are more or lessexplicitly linked to basic, embodied attitudes about life and death, and inturn, because these attitudes are connected – through their process ofritualisation – to concepts of self identity, order and disorder, culture andnature, individual and collective, etc., their embeddedness in the structuringstructures that give form to society can help us to understand quite much aboutthose structures. These rites of passage allow us to redefine the individual asdead and the abject as object, while at the same time helping us through thecrisis that death generates and get on with life. The liminal phase is a timewhen mourners are allowed to mourn their dead, where life is secondary(Rosenblatt et al. 1976: 89–90). The duration of this period is highly variablewithin each culture and likely also on an individual level. In fact, on apersonal emotional level, the transition often requires more time than isallowed for in the ritual structure (compare de Boeck 1995). But the symbolictransition from one state to the next helps define the borders that are beingtransgressed and provides a frame of reference for the social structure of theliving.At the same time, death is also the starting point for the processes of decayand decomposition that gradually will consume the body. This process alters theappearance of the cadaver further and thus imposes a time cap on the separationprocess. Mortuary rituals, in a variety of ways, handle this process as well. Insome cultures, like our own, the processes of decay are hidden – our corpses areplaced inside coffins or they are rapidly destroyed by fire. In the contemporaryUS the open casket burial takes the denial of decay to extremes, throughembalming and restoring the cadaver so that it closely resembles the livingindividual in a state of sleep (see below). When we consider cadavers asabjects, we can better understand how they become the focus of the liminal phaseof a ritual that aims to pass a person through the life crisis of death. Thestructural associations of oppositions and contradictions produced in dealingwith death and the cadaver seem to stretch out beyond the physical remains ofthe body. They draw in opposing elements to the cadaver and thus form a symboliccomplex that defines good vs. bad death. To control death as well as the deadbody defines a ritual instrument for controlling biology and nature in a tightconnection to controlling the social death. Thus, the mortuary ritual practicestend to embed the phenomenon of death – along with that of society – into anidea about the eternal order of things. In handling the cadaver in the rightway, the survivors affirm the structure at a much more fundamental level thansimply restoring a peaceful, effective arrangement of social relationships.So how is this redefinition of the corpse possible? How does the ritual operatein this context, and how can we understand change in mortuary practices? Inorder to respond to these questions, we need to turn to ritual theory.Understanding rituals as practiceRitual studies have in recent years come to focus increasingly on practice (Bell1992; de Boeck 1995; Humphrey & Laidlaw 1994; Parkin 1992). The main model drawson the sociology of Pierre Bourdieu (1977; 1980), but has its roots in the earlysociological studies of ritual and religious phenomena (e.g., Durkheim 1965[1915]; van Gennep 1981 [1909]), and the later forms they inspired in social andcultural anthropology (e.g., Rappaport 1999; Turner 1967; 1969). Thistheoretical framework is very useful for archaeology since it emphasisespeople’s actions rather than prescribed meaning and symbolic content. Likepractice theory in general, it does not infer that practices are meaningless,but rather than embodied knowledge and bodily practice precedes verbalisedmeaning. Moreover, while these models build on sociological and anthropologicalstudies and comparisons, they attempt to formulate how ritual as a processworks. It is assumed that there are certain recurrent elements within ritualthat allows us to formulate a series of cross-culturally shared fundamentallyhuman mechanisms integral to the ritual process per se, which could be appliedwithin archaeology.Catherine Bell has proposed a comprehensive, influential and useful theory ofritual practice (1992). She views ritual as a strategic way to act and uses theconcept ritualisation to distinguish ritual from non-ritual acts. Ritualisation,according to Bell (1992: 7), is a strategic way to act that, which, in theprocess of being carried out, creates a distinction from other practices,defining this specific practice – in relation to other practices in its socialcontext – as ritual, privileged, significant and powerful. Bell draws onBourdieu’s practice theory framework and sees ritualisation as proceeding indialectic between practice and structure. The structures that give form toritual may be said – in the sometimes difficult but carefully formulatedlanguage of practice theory – to structure and be structured by actions thattend to generate practices, memories, emotional sensations, symbolicrepresentations, and so on, that display formal relationships organised intobinary oppositions, often articulated hierarchically (Nilsson Stutz 2003: 41).Moreover, the structural links between the elements of ritualising practicesintertwine into complex chains of associations, and despite the dynamicdialectical variation in ritual practices from one moment to the next,ritualisation generates a feeling of a logical system with a clear,comprehensive, hierarchically organised order. Through this process, acosmology, i.e. a structured world of significance, is created through thisproduction of separation. Ritual creates a world: a structure that appears to belogical and natural (for similar ideas see for example Turner 1969; Kertzer1988). Instead of emphasising underlying meaning, this perspective on ritualunderlines the process of embodiment. The model emphasises the embodiedexperience – it is the active participation in the ritual that creates the senseof structure in the participants. This further means that ritual does notexpress a meaning, nor does it reflect social structure; instead it creates andgenerates meaning and relationships (Bell 1992: 82; Bourdieu 1977: 120). Sincemeaning does not exist independent of practice, it is secondary. The ritual doesnot have to create a coherent and uncontested meaning for the participant;instead it is the embodied action that creates the sense of structure – not therationalisations that the participants may give for their actions. This does notmean that rituals are meaningless. Perhaps it is better stated that practicetheory emphasises a different understanding of meaning, as being inherent inaction, which has social-historical consequences – no matter how small orshort-term. This broader notion of meaning may be opposed to the classic,linguistically inspired structuralist conception, that meaning in ritual may bedirectly translated into a verbal reference (Nilsson Stutz 2003: 38). Thisfurther means that meaning as such can vary, while the embodied knowledge – thesense of how things are done – is shared. In the case here, it would mean thatthe participants would have a sense of what a ‘proper’ burial would be like, butthey may still project different meanings to the practices.What is particularly interesting here is that the model provides a framework tounderstand ritual change. Following practice theory, this model allowsconsiderable potential for flexibility, through reinterpretation andappropriation. Since practice precedes meaning, every ritual event becomes apotential opportunity for reproduction or change. The change can be intentionaland clearly break away from the dominating scheme, but it can also be gradual,almost invisible and unintentional, and only in a long term perspective becomevisible without the participants necessarily being aware of the process as it istaking place.In the previous section we discussed how the handling of the cadaver constitutesa crucial component of mortuary ritual. When viewing this through the practicetheory focused framework proposed by Bell, we can comprehend the treatment ofthe body as a response to the uncontrollable nature of the cadaver and indeed ofdeath. Through ritualisation the cadaver is redefined into an object thatconforms to structured ideas about death and from which the mourners canseparate. The ritual practices create an image of death, and a final image ofthe dead, which conform to and can be articulated with more general ideas abouta ‘good death’ (relating to attitudes to life, death, the dead body etc.) andthrough these practices the social and cultural structure is reproduced throughthe structure-practice dialectic. When viewing the mortuary ritual and theritual redefinition of the cadaver from this perspective, every burial – orevery other occasion for a mortuary ritual – becomes an arena for thereproduction of social structure in the widest sense of the term, including notonly the classic archaeological categories of social status, gender, etc., butalso attitudes to life and death, to the body, to order of society and the widerworld, etc. In this way practice theory allows us to link the specific practiceof handling the dead to a society’s cosmology as a whole. And since every ritualevent is a separate occasion in this process, the ritual holds potential forchange as well as continuity.Archaeologically we often see variation in practices and we try to understandthis pattern. This kind of variation could be a part of the ritual program whichprescribes a proper way to single out different individuals within a group(according to gender, age, social class etc.). Variation may also take otherforms: the proper burial may not be possible to carry out (for example if thecorpse is missing) or, some individuals may be denied a proper burial as asanction or punishment. In these cases, differences are viewed as variationwithin a program. But what about change? How can we view the processes of changein the archaeological material within this framework? And how can variationwithin an existing program relate to long term change? While it would be wrongto assume that all rituals are conservative, it would be equally difficult toassume that change takes place for no particular reason. The production of a newimagery of death must have been articulated with other views within the socialstructure and operate in a way that would make sense in the past through alteredconceptions of death, of the body, of the individual, or as part of shifts inthe processes of identification, for example through emulation and aspiration.Change can thus be highly visible in the society where it takes place, oroperate in a less visible way and gradually affect the views of what a properburial and a good death is. In order to illustrate this I will now proceed todiscuss two historical cases of change in the handling of the body.Ritual changes and changing rituals: two historical casesWhat does ritual change with regards to mortuary practices look like? Why andhow do mortuary rituals change? The framework developed above indicates thatmortuary practices are important both for society and for the individuals. Ifindeed the treatment of the corpse constitutes a an arena for the production ofthe proper death and for control over death and nature, then changes in thattreatment would be a serious matter with repercussions in other dimensions ofsociety as well. To test this assumption I will now briefly discuss twohistorical cases of mortuary ritual change. Through the examination of theintroduction of cremation in nineteenth century England and the development ofthe American way of death in the twentieth century, I will explore the dynamicsinvolved in changing mortuary ritual.The shift from inhumation to cremation in 19th century EnglandIn the 19th century, attitudes toward the disposal of the dead changed radicallyin England. From predominantly disposing of the dead through inhumation,cremation gained not only acceptance but eventually also popularity. BrianParsons (2005) accounts for the multiple factors that intertwined in this changein the perception of the proper burial. It is often assumed that a religious oreschatological shift underlies ritual change, but the introduction of cremationin nineteenth century England tells a more complex story. Rather than reflectinga religious conversion, the introduction of cremation was situated in a time ofsocial, cultural and technological change which all in different wayscontributed to the radical break with the traditional practice of inhumation.Overcrowded urban cemeteries associated with stench and nuisances like drunkengrave diggers and the business of body snatchers, were perceived an unattractiveplace for the liberal and forward thinking reformers that pioneered themovement. They argued for a more hygienic and modern practice of disposing ofdead bodies, an attitude which also, and rather typically for this period,occasionally was associated with nostalgia for a very distant past. With thetechnological development of furnaces that made the cremation process possibleto be conducted out of sight and in an efficient manner that reduced the body tocremains within hours also contributed to offering a socially acceptable kind ofcremation which could be synchronised with the ideals of progress and modernity.While the practice broke off with tradition it also gained support from certainclergy, which allowed for it to be articulated with the Christian faith and as aconsequence an alternative for a larger group of society. But even if cremationcan be seen as a part of modernity that swept through society more generally, itwas still perceived as a radical idea, and the introduction was visible,contested and controversial. In many instances legal indictments were part ofthe process of the transition (see for example the case of Dr Price, Parsons2005: 100–7).When viewed through the lens of practice theory, this ritual change was radicaland intentional. Through a clear and visible break with tradition, a new form of‘proper burial’ was proposed. It is interesting to note that while certainpractices changed radically, other components remained the same. While thereduction of the corpse to cremains in a specially constructed furnacecontextualised this death within a worldview that valued progress, modernity,hygiene and technology, the use of coffins and the actual shielding of theobservers from the destructive processes anchored these practices within atraditional idea of a proper burial. Moreover, while the destructive power ofthe flames horrified many (for example, Parsons 2005: 38), cremation was stillfounded on the idea of a dignified and proper way of handling the body, bykeeping it away from the appalling cemeteries, the body snatchers and theunhealthy aspects of decay etc. In this way also, the radical new practice couldbecome articulated with the older tradition. In a way, cremation offered a newway of sustaining a dignified way of dealing with the dead as the surroundingsociety corrupted the traditional ways of doing so. In this way we can alsounderstand how people eventually came to accept this ritual change: while itbroke off with tradition on some levels, it still held on to traditional values.It was probably also important that through the sanction of certainrepresentatives of the clergy, the practice could become embedded within theChristian faith. While we in retrospect might view this new practice as areflection of change in other areas of society, the practice itself constitutesthe act of reproducing that ideal, a reproduction that also would have equalrepercussion in other areas of society.The introduction of cremation in 19th century England illustrates how ritualchange can be abrupt and collide with contemporary society in a way that causeddistress and conflict. It also provides an example for how mortuary ritual canbecome a privileged arena for the conflict between different positions insociety. Finally, we can also see how a new practice within generations becomescompletely embraced by society – something which those of us working with a deeppast may need to keep in mind as we observe what form our point of view mayappear to be drastic shifts in the archaeological record.The emergence of embalming and funeral homes in AmericaThe second example of a change in the treatment of the body after death shows adifferent trajectory. In the early 20th century the attitudes to death and thedead went through a radical transformation in the United States. And just likein the case of cremation in England, the ritual change was not immediately tiedto religious changes, but rather a shift in the general attitudes to death andthe dead body. Gary Laderman (1996; 2003) who has written extensively on theAmerican death rituals, relates the changes to three main factors: changes indemographic patterns, the rise of hospitals as places of dying, and the growthof modern funeral homes which all contributed to creating a divide between themourners and the physical remains of the dead (Laderman 2003: 1). As mortalityrates dropped and life expectancy improved, death became a rare occurrence, tothe point that ‘it was easier to imagine the dead than to actually encounterthem in everyday life, a common feature of social history up until that time’(Laderman 2003: 1). During the 19th century the development of medicine led notonly to lower mortality, but also to changes in the ways people died. In theearly 20th century the medical profession had assumed power to define death andcontrol the process of death, and where ultimately death was seen as defeat(Laderman 2003, see also Ariès 1981: 583–8).In this context a new attitude to the dead emerged. Just like medical doctorswere the professionals of dying, the funeral directors rose as a newprofessionalised specialist in the care for the dead. While many complex factorscontributed to the separation of the dead and the living, the practice ofembalming appears to have become a particularly important one. In the early 19thcentury, embalming was only carried out in medical faculties, away from thepublic consciousness as a method to preserve corpses for education and researchpurposes (Laderman 2003: 6). The technical knowledge of it existed within themedical community, but it was not part of a general approach to death. Thetechnique appears to have become more commonly used at the end of the civil waras the bodies of dead soldiers were embalmed in order to sustain thetransportation home for burial. When the body of President Lincoln met the samefate before its transportation from Washington DC to Springfield, Illinois, thepractice gradually gained more general acceptance. Eventually it found animportant place within the American mortuary ritual of the viewing of thecorpse, where it transformed the experience of encountering the dead. Over thecourse of the 19th century, the viewing of the corpse had become an integralpart of the American funeral and instrumental in the struggle to make sense ofdeath (Laderman 2003: 6). Along with social and cultural changes such as concernwith sanitation and the fact that people had become highly mobile and needed totravel great distances for a funeral (Laderman 2003: 6), the ritual began toconstitute an emerging problem. The art of embalming proposed an immediate andavailable solution.As the practice of embalming gained ground a new profession emerged to carry itout. Gradually the treatment of the dead was moved from the private home to thefuneral home, a new phenomenon that starts to emerge in the early 20th century.The funeral home provides new place for the ritual – a kind of pseudo-home thatprovides a professional yet domestic place for the ritual viewing. This ‘homeaway from home’ provided the space both for the new treatment of the body andthe intimate ritual viewing of the body. At this point, Laderman argues:the body had become more than simply a container for the spirit… Under theloving gaze of mourners, the corpse acquired a sacred status that was decidedlymaterial rather than spiritual, and comforting rather than horrifying (Laderman2003: 22).The final image of the dead became central to the ritual, and was oftendocumented through photography – and the responsibility to create this imagefell upon the funeral director. Embalming also restored bodies after destructionand could present the corpse of the person the way they had lived rather thanthe way they had died. This art was widely and publicly appreciated. The corpsethat ‘looked good and was at peace’ embodied the good death. This new image ofthe dead fit the needs of people caught in ‘the fast-paced, technologicallydriven changes in modern society’ as they ‘longed for a fixed, permanent imageof the deceased at peace’ (Laderman 2003: 8). It also fit into an increasinglyconsumerist and capitalist society.From a practice theory perspective the changes that occurred at the turn of thelast century in the United States are extremely interesting. As in the previousexample, it is not mainly changes in religious beliefs that drive the ritualchange, but rather other social and cultural phenomena, mainly attitudes todeath, the body, hygiene and the commodification of specialised services. Thesevalues have long-lasting effects on mortuary ritual. Through the generalisationof embalming, the handling of the corpse becomes so complex that it requiresspecial training and equipment and is transferred from the mourners to thefuneral director and the funeral home. As a result, not only the dead but alsodeath is removed from proximity with the living. The practice that engages themourners is now exclusively the viewing of the perfect corpse, staged in orderto project an image of peaceful sleep of the unaltered and even perfected body.Again, while we could view these new rituals as mere reflections of changes insociety, it is important to see them as an active part of changing these ideas.Every time a dead body was viewed according to the new ritual program, theattitudes were reproduced and reinforced. Death was constantly moved furtheraway from lived experienced and encased in a new artificial mold that throughthe ritual of viewing came to represent ‘real’ death.As opposed to the previous example, this transition is more seamless andgradual, and while critical voices that viewed embalming as unnatural,unnecessary and un-American and that claimed that the profit-making funeralindustry was unethical were heard (Laderman 2003: 29), there was not the sameintense conflict surrounding the development of embalming and the development ofthe funeral home in America as at the introduction of cremation in England a fewdecades earlier.Both these historical examples illustrate how ritual change takes place insociety. The development is complex and draws in multiple aspects of the socialand cultural reality. Interestingly, in both cases, religion plays a minor roleand tends to just be flexible enough to incorporate the new practices ratherthan to lead the way to change. In the first case we see how a new ritual isintroduced as a controversial idea by a few radical minds and only graduallygains support among the public. In the second case, the change is more gradualand seeps in on all levels of society and gains acceptance without causinggeneral outrage or distress. The cases show the archaeologist that ritual changecan take many shapes, but also that it operates on several levels of the socialfabric where it needs to make sense in order to gain ground.Understanding the treatment of the body in the MesolithicThe previous cases have shown us how complex ritual changes can be, and how manydifferent dimensions become intertwined in the process. There is no reason tothink that prehistory was any different. How then can we understand ritualchange and changing rituals archaeologically? To approach this question, I willexplore the example of Mesolithic cemeteries around the Baltic (this work isbased on previous research, for details, please see Nilsson Stutz 2003). Here wedo not have the rich record of the historical periods regarding people’semotions, thoughts and attitudes. Instead, we need to try to recreate thissocial and cultural history, or at least fragments of it, by starting with thepractices that we can observe in the archaeological record. The assumption hereis that following the ritual theory proposed by Bell, and illustrated in theexamples of historical mortuary ritual and ritual change, the mortuary practiceswould be linked to general attitudes in society toward death, the dead body,ideas about the life, death, the afterlife etc.During the later phases of the Mesolithic in northern Europe (6th–7th millenniumBC), the first formal cemeteries emerge as places for the disposal of the dead(see Fig. 1.1). In places like Vedbæk/Bøgebakken in eastern Denmark (Albrethsen& Brinch-Petersen 1977) and Skateholm in southern Sweden (Larsson 1988),Zvejnieki in northern Latvia (Zagorsikis 1987), and Olenii Ostrov in Karelia(Gurina 1956; O’Shea & Zvelebil 1984), the dead are buried in what appears to bespecifically dedicated areas, often close to the occupation sites, in dozens andup to several hundreds. The mortuary rituals at these sites have often beendescribed as complex because of the variation in position and grave-goods placedwith the dead. In my work I have looked closer at the practices at Skateholm andVedbæk/Bøgebakken in detail and also to a certain extent the practices atZvejnieiki. Instead of focusing on what distinguishes the individuals buried atthe sites, I initially wanted to establish a core of practices that theoverwhelming majority could be said to share. My focus has been mainly on theritual treatment of the body which I have reconstructed in detail with theFrench taphonomical approach to burials called Archaeothanatology (Duday 2009).Overall the burials in Skateholm and Vedbæk/Bøgebakken can be characterised by apractice that appears to emphasise the integrity of the body at the time ofdisposal. The overwhelming majority of the bodies were buried intact shortlyafter death. The practice hides or denies the processes of decay anddecomposition since the bodies are buried before the postmortem disfigurationhas reached an advanced stage. At the time of burial the bodies probably stillresembled the living individual. This impression of a remaining subjectivityassociated with the body is strengthened by the fact that the bodies often wereplaced in life-like positions. There are several cases of bodies arranged tolook at each other or even hold one another in the grave. In some rare instancesthe analysis has also shown that the bodies were shielded from the surroundingsediment either by the use of platforms under the body, or wrappings ofdifferent kinds. The attention to the integrity of the body could also explainthe very few disturbances of the burials, which indicates that the burial placewas known and respected. In some rare instances disturbances have occurred, andit is interesting to note that in these cases there is no visible trace of anyattempt to correct the disturbance (like we often witness in Medievalcemeteries). Maybe the body of the dead after a long time in the ground hadcompleted its transition from subject and abject to object, and the disturbancewas therefore unproblematic. It is of course also possible that since this kindof disturbance was rare, there might not have been a prescribed way to deal withit.Within this core of practices that respects the body, we can see a significantamount of variation. The bodies are placed in different positions, and they areaccompanied by different kinds of deposits – often artifacts, but also ochre,possible food items, etc. This variation can be understood as being linked toeach of the buried individuals. Every time a burial is carried out an attempt ismade to create a proper burial and a good death. The variation regardingposition and burial goods could be seen in this perspective as a variationwithin the core of practices, sometimes as a reproduction, and sometimespotentially also as a way to distinguish the dead or highlight an aspect oftheir identity.But some burials break away from the established norm in other ways that mayindicate a tension within the attitudes to death and the dead body. AtSkateholm, three individuals appear to have been burned before disposal at thecemetery. In another case, grave 28 in Skateholm, the analysis has shown how thebody was buried in a way that facilitated the removal of several bones from thegrave after the process of decomposition was terminated (for more details of thestudy, see Nilsson Stutz 2003). This indicates that while the processes ofdecomposition and decay were hidden at the time of burial of the dead, they wereintimately known and could be controlled and exploited. Here the dry bones ofthe dead have been removed from the burial probably to become reintroduced intothe world of the living. We may ask ourselves if they at this point representedthe dead individual whose body was buried in a way that indicates premeditationof this removal, or if they represented the world of the dead. Had thetransition from subject to object of death been completed at this point, orwould these bones forever be considered abject? The presence of human bones onMesolithic occupation sites raises questions about how common these practicesmay have been as a parallel to the burial practices that respect the body’sintegrity.Another interesting case to discuss here is burial 13 in Skateholm where theincomplete and partially disarticulated remains of a body were found in aconstrained space. The analysis has revealed that the remains were disposed ofwhen the cadaver was still fresh, which indicates that the individual must havebeen cut up in pieces. There are several possible interpretations to thisburial. Maybe the dismemberment was part of the ritual practice and contributedto actively separate this individual from a ‘proper’ burial, maybe as a case ofa scapegoating strategy. This would open up to a discussion of the role ofritual as an instrument of social control. But it is also possible to proposethe opposite hypothesis: the body may have been violated at the time of deathand the mortuary practices may have hidden this state by burying the remainswith a container that shielded the mourners from the real state of the remains.In this case the ritual practice would be an example of trying to recreatecertain fundamentally important aspects of the burial ritual, as it would beexperienced at the time of disposal, as an attempt to create normalcy.When looking at the Mesolithic cemeteries we can also track a certain amount ofchange, both over time and space. When looking at change over time, Skateholmconstitutes an interesting example. Here two chronological phases can bedistinguished. For the older phase the individuals are distinguished by avariation in grave-goods. The things placed with the dead are both more variedand more numerous. In the second phase, grave-goods appear to become lessinstrumental in the distinguishing of individuals, and instead the position ofthe body shows greater variability. Here it is possible to track a change in theway in which the proper burial is staged, and possibly in the way in which theindividual is marked at the time of separation from the living. At the same timethe integrity of the body continues to be a central feature emphasised in theburial. This indicates that while certain things are negotiable for change,others are not. Again, this indicates that the integrity of the body and thelife like arrangement at the time of separation probably was a fundamentalcomponent of mortuary ritual and the attitudes to death and the dead body.When taking a wider perspective on changing rituals it is interesting to comparethe pattern in southern Scandinavia to what we can observe in the easternBaltic. Here the Mesolithic burials show many interesting similarities to theScandinavian practices. However, when extending the perspective chronologicallycontrasts emerge. During the Neolithic Funnel Beaker Period in southernScandinavia (c. 4000–2700 BC) collective mortuary practices associated withmegaliths were embraced, practices which are also highly associated with thefragmentation of the individual body. The ritual practices at Zvejnieki remainin the same cemeteries and while the position of the body changes and the gravegoods changes (for a summary of the changes in the burial practices over time,see Zagorska 2006), the respect for the individual body remains at the center ofthe archaeological image of the mortuary ritual, perhaps eventually giving wayfor a focus on location and place as the cemetery filled up. Maybe the change tocollective burials and extensive manipulation of the body in southernScandinavia has deep roots in the local Mesolithic practice of occasionallymanipulating human bones as was shown in burial 28 in Skateholm described above.Here, we can begin to discuss how ritual variation at a certain point in timemay constitute practices that ritual change can articulate with and thus beviewed as a continuation of traditional ways or at least as a continuation of anaccepted variation. For example, maybe the occasional ritual manipulation ofbody parts in the Mesolithic (for which we do not know the extent) were crucialin rendering the more extensive manipulation of the dead seen in later periodssocially possible and acceptable. Here the examples of historical examples ofritual change (for example the cases described above) can help us understand thedynamic processes of changing ritual in prehistoric settings.Concluding remarksIn this article I have attempted to propose a way in which archaeology canapproach the question of ritual change. The practice theory based ritual theoryprovides a framework for thinking about how ritual operates in society, and italso gives us a framework to reflect over the dynamics of ritual change. I havelimited my exploration to mortuary ritual, but I believe that the overalltheoretical model is valid also for other ritual practices. The historicalexamples serve as inspiration to think about mortuary ritual and how change inthe treatment of the body may be contested in one context and almost seamlesslyaccepted in another. Still, the examples of modern cremation practices inEngland and embalming and open-casket viewing in the United States underscorehow – because all societies must deal with ritually redefining their dead –changes in mortuary ritual reflect dynamic changes in the rich fabric ofattitudes linking aspects of death (such as decay) to the surrounding culture.Thus, we can make sense of these changes within their cultural contexts. Finallythe prehistoric example serves as a test case to see just how we can approachthese issues archaeologically – principally by turning the approach around,starting with the practices, rather than with the history of shifts in socialattitudes. In this way, the focus on material traces of ritual practices canhelp us to reconstruct what people in the past were doing in order to handletheir dead ritually, allowing us to interpret a sort of social history thatreveals long-term attitudes to death and to the dead body.BibliographyAlbrethsen, S.

For much of the Neolithic,burial was carried out within the nucleated village in the form of a relativelysimple performance, which started with the interment of an articulated body andended, in most cases, with the disturbance of the grave and the scattering ofthe dry bones. In the late and final Neolithic, however, burial was increasinglyundertaken at peripheral or otherwise distinct areas within villages, and by theearly Copper Age it was moved to purpose-built extramural cemeteries. Moreover,disarticulation practices became increasingly complex in this time period, andcaused most of the deceased to lose their individuality. Finally, the Copper Agesaw the appearance of the first richly furnished burials, which are ofteninterpreted as markers of growing social inequality. It is argued in this paperthat the emergence of the cemetery as a separate locus for the performance ofburial does not depend on radical changes in the political structure of society.Rather, it would mark a profound modification in the symbolic toolkit used byprehistoric society to express individual and group identity as well as beliefsconcerning the human body. In other words, it is not a change in the meaning ofburial per se that we are witnessing in the Copper Age but a change in themedium chosen by society to stress overarching ideas of group identity, whichwere previously conveyed by co-residence in the nucleated village. However,since social relations derive their meanings from the practices through whichthey are articulated, modifications to the social understanding of burial didemerge from the changing media employed for their expression. The most importantof these concerns the body of the deceased, which Copper Age communities turnedinto a major locus for social reproduction.Keywords: body, burial, identity, Italy, mortuary practices, Neolithic, CopperAge.Introduction: burial, politics, and identityA central avenue of investigation in funerary archaeology claims that changes inburial rituals are to be explained with changes in the political structure ofsociety. Explorations into the political aspects of burial were especiallyfavoured by processual archaeologists in the 1970s and early 1980s. Thistradition of studies can be traced back to Binford (1971), who famouslymaintained that burial directly reflects the structure of society, and thatdifferences in funerary treatment are informative about power inequalities andsocial hierarchy amongst the living. He also argued that the social persona ofthe deceased, or the composite of a person’s social identities recognised asappropriate for consideration in death, would vary according to their lifetimerank.Working within a similar research milieu, Tainter (1978) introduced the conceptof energy expenditure into mortuary analysis. He claimed that the more energy isexpended by mourners during all stages of the funerary performance – be it inthe lavishness of the funeral, the monumentality of the grave or the quantity ofgoods deposited therein – the higher is the standing of the deceased withintheir community. In a similar vein, Saxe (1970) argued that cemeteries areestablished by corporate groups to legitimise their rights to access restrictedresources, for ancestors provide a powerful medium to support political claims.Finally, O’Shea (1981) assessed the viability of mortuary data as an indicatorof ‘vertical’ (i.e. hierarchy-driven) and ‘horizontal’ (i.e. descent-driven)social distinctions. By examining changes in burial patterns at a number ofnative cemeteries in the American Central Plains, he found that ranking wouldemerge quite clearly from variations in the mortuary record while the‘horizontal’ dimensions of society would be more difficult to identify.In the last three decades, these concepts have been applied to investigating thechanges in funerary customs which occurred in the Italian peninsula during thelate/final Neolithic and early Copper Age (c. late 5th and 4th millennia BC).Burial, in particular, was widely employed as a proxy for two major phenomenathat were thought to characterise prehistoric Italian society at this importantjuncture: the rise of social ranking and the establishment of political claimsover land or other restricted resources.In numerous works dedicated to the Italian Copper Age, Cazzella (1992; 1998;2003a) argued that the appearance of richly furnished burials would reflect theemergence of structural inequalities within prehistoric society. In particular,he interpreted the practice of burying adult males with rich sets of tools andweapons as a marker of a ‘Big Man’ society, in which men competed for powerthrough the accumulation of prestige-giving goods. Since power could not betransmitted by descent in societies of this kind – he argued – the funerals ofthese individuals were marked by acts of conspicuous consumption whereby thesymbols of their lifetime authority were removed from circulation. Thus, theburying of ‘Big Men’ would have sanctioned the opening of a new power contestwithin their communities. Similar readings were championed by Barker (1981),Guidi (2000), and Peroni (1989; 1996), and greatly contributed to shapingscholarly interpretations of Copper Age society in the central Mediterraneanregion.With regard to the politics of resource procurement and land use, Skeates (1995:229) noted that the earliest Copper Age cemeteries to be found in east-centralItaly lay at the heart of the agricultural zone stretching through valleybottoms and coastal lowlands. Following Saxe (1970) and Bradley (1981), heproposed interpreting this evidence as the archaeological correlate of thepolitical claims made by emerging elites over arable land and pastures. However,he tempered his reading by pointing out that graves in this period presented noexterior monumental aspects. Therefore, he argued, such claims might have had arather limited outreach, and were perhaps intended more for the immediatefuneral audience than for society at large. Notably, such interpretations werenot solely put forward for the fertile valley bottoms of middle Adriatic Italy,but were also extended to the rugged landscape of southern Tuscany and northernLatium, where arable land is historically scarce. For example, it was suggestedthat Ponte San Pietro, a Copper Age cemetery in this region, had beenpurposefully established near now-depleted copper and antimony deposits, perhapsas a way to claim access to critical ore sources (Giardino et al. 2011). Thefortune of such readings is most apparent in a recent synthesis of research onthe Italian Neolithic, in which the rise of corporate burial in the 5thmillennium BC is ascribed to the need to legitimise control over valuableresources by placing the dead in the landscape (Pessina & Tiné 2008: 304).The limits of these approaches, which tend to equate funerals with a socialarena for power contests, have been revealed by an alternative tradition ofmortuary analysis stemming from contemporary social theory (Bourdieu 1977;Giddens 1984). For the purpose of this work, two lines of critique can beisolated within this tradition of study. The first challenges the assumptionthat modifications in burial practices are induced by changes in the politicalconfiguration of society. The second argues that politics provide just one ofthe many answers that could be given to questions of mortuary variability andritual change.Processual archaeologists tended to see the fossil record as directly reflectingthe dynamic behaviour of people in the past. This prompted a frantic quest for‘middle range theories’ which were thought to provide meaningful links betweenpast and present (Binford 1977; Schiffer 1987; Trigger 2006: 414–15). Inmortuary archaeology, in particular, a key component of middle range theoriesconsisted of Saxe’s (1970) and Binford’s (1971) concept of the social personawhereby the deceased were rather mechanistically reduced to the sum of thesocial roles they had maintained in life. Dissatisfactions with this standpointhave been voiced by many a scholar (Barrett 1990; 1994; Hodder & Hutson 2003;Parker Pearson 1982; 1999; Thomas 1999; Ucko 1969). A common point of theircritiques to the Binford-Saxe agenda is that ‘social systems are not constitutedof roles but by recurrent social practices’ (Parker Pearson 1982: 100). Socialtheory emphasises that roles are not defined once and for all, but arecontinuously created and re-enacted through daily practice (Bourdieu 1977;Giddens 1984). As such, they are open to negotiation and reworking in allspheres of social life including, of course, funerals. This implies that nodirect relationship can be postulated between burial and the political structureof society. Rather, both burial and politics are to be conceptualised asstrategic engagements that contribute, subtly or openly, to the making andbreaking of the fabric of society.The second line of critique stresses that politics represent at best one of thepossible angles for approaching the study of mortuary practices (Robb 2007b).Far from being solely concerned with status and power contests over restrictedresources, funerals are increasingly understood as powerful media for socialcommunication, which have the capability to convey several messages at once:cosmological and religious beliefs, the well-being or crisis of the socialgroup, ideas concerning the body and personhood, and the place occupied by thedead within an idealised life-cycle (Bloch 1971; Fowler 2010; this volume; Gnoli& Vernant 1982; Goody 1962; Metcalf & Huntington 1991; Robb 2002). Inparticular, a fruitful strand of this research tradition claims that burial actsas a meaningful arena for defining, challenging and reworking people’s identity(Barraud et al. 1994; Brück 1995; 2001; Shanks & Tilley 1982; A. Strathern 1981;M. Strathern 1988).Identity is an ambiguous concept that refers to the recognition of the self atboth individual and group level (Diaz-Andreu & Lucy 2005; Meskell 2001).Individual identity is often conceptualised in terms of gender, age, status, andother aspects of human life which are deemed central to the self-understandingof people. However, identity is far more complex and multi-layered a conceptthan it might appear in the first instance. For example, it has been pointed outthat each person embodies several facets of identity at the same time, eachfacet interacting and recombining with the others in potentially infinite ways(Meskell 2002; 2007). Moreover, Fowler (2004; 2008) drew our attention to thefact that the ideas of individual personhood and the bounded body underpinningpersonal identity in Western society are historically contingent. In othercultures, persons may be conceived of as partible and permeable, or as made froma combination of distinct substances, or indeed as resulting from the encountersand relationships in which one would engage in the course of their lives. Thissuggests caution in extending our own ideas of identity to non-Westernsocieties.Other aspects of identity are by definition relational. This is the case ofclass, caste, religion, and ethnicity. Interestingly, group identity is no lessopen to contrasting definitions than individual identity. In a seminal work,Jones (1997) convincingly argued that the culture-historical agenda thatcharacterised prehistoric archaeology for the best part of the 20th century wasshaped by Western ideas of ‘people’ and ‘culture’. She claimed in particularthat the normative and bounded idea of the ethnic group elaborated in Europeduring the 18th and 19th centuries is specific to our own society, and cannot beextended uncritically to the prehistoric past. On the contrary – she argued –ethnic identity must be understood as a dynamic and contested notion, which iscontinually recreated and renegotiated through social practice. A similarinterpretive framework has also been proposed for religion and the reworking ofidentity following colonial encounters (Edwards 2005; Edwards & Woolf 2004;Insoll 2007).A common point of these investigations lies in recognising that identity cannotbe understood in isolation, but only as something that is articulated throughsocial relations. Lying at the intersection between personal ideas of the selfand cultural representations of society as an orderly cosmos, identity isconstantly challenged and redefined through social reproduction. Hence, it is onthe dynamic interplay between individual beliefs and societal values that wemust focus our attention if we are to explore how identity was conceptualised inthe prehistoric past.In this paper, I shall apply the ideas of identity hitherto discussed toinvestigate the profound modifications in mortuary practices, which occurred inthe Italian peninsula (broadly defined as the landmass lying south of theApennines) during the late 5th and 4th millennia BC (Fig. 2.1). I will argue, inparticular, that the rise of the cemetery in this time period is not to beinterpreted as a marker of major social changes, but ‘merely’ as the emergenceof a new medium to express the same principles of group identity and solidaritywhich were previously conveyed by co-residence in nucleated villages. I willalso maintain that the changing role of mortuary practices brought about, and inturn rested upon, a new understanding of the human body, which was conceived ofas a more partible and permeable entity than had been previously. In turn, novelideas of the body allowed prehistoric communities to inscribe social change intothe very bones of the deceased, thus naturalising it through reference to aseemingly immutable ancestral cosmos.The Italian Neolithic: the age of the villageTo the archaeological imagination, the Italian Neolithic is the age of thevillage (Robb 2007a: 76). This is best exemplified by the substantial villaggitrincerati (ditched villages) brought to light in the Apulian Tavoliere, thehinterland of Matera, and southeast Sicily since the late 19th century (Pessina& Tiné 2008). Typically measuring between 80 m and 300 m in diameter, with a fewmuch larger, these substantial settlement sites were surrounded by series ofround or elliptical ditches, which sharply divided the inner inhabited spacefrom the outer landscape (Fig. 2.2).At Lagnano da Piede, for example, five concentric ditches, some of which werecertainly in use at the same time, encircled a 5 ha village; within it, a seriesof C-shaped interrupted ditches enclosed smaller areas that are normallyinterpreted as domestic compounds (Mallory 1984–87). At Passo di Corvo, one ofthe largest and best investigated villaggi trincerati in the Tavoliere, thesettled area marked by the C-shaped ditches was surrounded by three largeenclosures, the outer extending about 6 km out of the village to encircle whatis thought to be the community’s farmland (Tiné 1983). Although ditched villagesare typically found in southern Italy and Sicily, structured enclosuresseparating the inhabited space from the landscape are relatively common in theItalian Neolithic (Pessina & Tiné 2008: 154). For instance, traces of woodenpalisades were unearthed at Pienza in the middle Tyrrhenian peninsula, anddry-stone walls encircled the inhabited area at Pulo di Molfetta and othercontemporary sites in southeast Italy (Radina 2002). Similar arrangements arealso known at northern Italian sites (e.g. Degasperi et al. 1998), but these liebeyond the scope of this paper.[../images/fig2_1.jpg]Fig. 2.1.

Neolithic ditched enclosures from the Apulian Tavoliere. A: Lagnano daPiede; B: Passo di Corvo (Pessina & Tiné 2008, modified).The debate over the meaning of Neolithic enclosures has traditionally focused onthe Apulian evidence, which is the most intensively researched (Brown 1991;Skeates 2002). In this region, ditches have been variously interpreted asstructures built for defence (Robb 2007a: 94; Trump 1966: 42), herd containmentor corralling (Jones 1987; Whitehouse 1968), the drainage and perhaps catchmentof water (Bradford 1950; Gravina 1975; Tiné 1983), and the symbolic demarcationof community boundaries (Cassano & Manfredini 1983; Morter & Robb 1998).Micromorphology has revealed that water did flow in the ditches of Passo diCorvo and other Apulian sites (Pessina & Tiné 2008: 155), but it is doubtfulwhether water management was the intended goal of ditch building given theporosity of the base sediment, the high number of interrupted enclosures, andthe frequency of villages built on relatively high ground (Manfredini 1972;Skeates 2002). It must perhaps be recognised that all interpretations have theirown difficulties and limitations, and ditches may have served a plurality offunctions (Robb 2007a: 94).Whatever their practical role, it is fair to say that ditches must have providedNeolithic people with a discernible boundary between the inhabited village andthe landscape (Pessina & Tiné 2008: 154; Robb 2007a: 94; Skeates 2002).Interestingly, recent research has shown that ditches were not built once andfor all, but were continuously maintained through a series of practicesencompassing filling as well as digging; meaningful acts of deposition includingburial were also carried out at Neolithic ditches (Conati Barbaro 2007–08). Itis not hard to imagine that such practices would have strongly contributed toreinforcing the common identity of the village community, and would have alsohelped to develop a cultural distinction between ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’.Furthermore, similar concepts of boundedness and separation can be discerned inthe C-shaped ditches surrounding household compounds. These might have informedideas of intra-kin bonds vis-à-vis the collective identity of the villagepopulation. Significantly, mortuary practices carried out in the ditches wouldhave further contributed to defining these structures as liminal boundaries thatseparated not only a group from another, but also the living from the dead(Skeates 2002: 178).The centrality of the village for the Neolithic way of life is furtheremphasised by the frequent occurrence of burials (or scattered human remains) atopen settlements and inhabited caves, the latter being especially common in thecentral Apennines (Grifoni 2003; Skeates 1997). Neolithic burial practices areextremely varied and do change remarkably in both space and time. Nonetheless,two recurrent features can be recognised in the Italian peninsular record.Firstly, for much of the Neolithic, the basic burial rite consisted of theprimary inhumation of crouched individuals in earthen pits, stone-lined trenchesor slab-built cists without durable goods (Fig. 2.3). Secondly, primary burialwas frequently followed by the intentional or unintentional disturbance of thegrave, which caused human remains to be disarticulated, fragmented, and finallydispersed within or outside the village (Pessina & Tiné 2008; Robb 2007a). Thesecondary treatment of bodies could take several forms ranging from the reburialof selected bones (e.g. at Samari: Cremonesi 1985–86) to their cremation (e.g.at Balsignano: Radina 2002). Acts of ancestor commemoration were also enacted atNeolithic villages. These focused on either the skull, which was sometimesremoved from an otherwise complete burial (e.g. at Cala Colombo: De Lucia et al.1977), or the undisturbed individual grave. The intentionality of the latterpractice can be postulated in those cases where the undisturbed body iscontained in a durable stone structure, which would have served as a visiblemarker for the perpetuation of ancestral memory.[../images/fig2_3.jpg]Fig. 2.3. Neolithic primary burials in earthen pits and stone-lined trenches. A:Passo di Corvo; B: Balsignano, tomb 2 (Pessina & Tiné 2008, modified).Gender is normally not stressed in the Italian Neolithic (except for astatistically significant tendency to bury males on their right-hand sides andfemales on their left-hand: Robb 1994a), but age occasionally is. Adult burialsare slightly more numerous than children’s and were left undisturbed morefrequently. Moreover, children and juveniles were usually excluded from skullcuration and other acts of veneration, seemingly because their untimely deathhad prevented their becoming ancestral beings (Robb 2007a: 63). However, unequalpreservation of children and adult bone might have concurred to creating such ascenario, and caution must be taken in interpreting data that might be distortedby a sample bias.Following Gnoli and Vernant’s (1982) concept of the ‘good death’, Robb (2002)proposed interpreting the multifarious burial patterns of the Italian Neolithicaccording to their responding to an ideal life narrative, against which thecircumstances of death would have been judged and the prescribed funeraryrituals would have been performed (Fig. 2.4). Individual burial within villagesor inhabited caves would have marked the normal deathway in Neolithic Italy. Formost of the deceased, and with near-certainty for children and juveniles, thiswould have been followed by the disturbance of the grave and the dispersal ofthe bones, which would have marked the transformation of the dead into anon-individualised ‘ancestral presence’ for the village community. In a fewcases, however, the social being of the deceased would have been preserved forremembrance and veneration by retaining their skulls or other selected remains.Finally, extraordinary circumstances of death would have compelled theperformance of exceptional mortuary treatments. For example, epidemics andwarfare would have dictated mass burial at special locales, and the stigmatiseddead would have been left unburied. The latter practices is probably documentedat Passo di Corvo, where a young woman was found lying face-down at the bottomof a well (Tiné 1983).[../images/fig2_4.jpg]Fig. 2.4. Burial pathways in the early and middle Neolithic of the Italianpeninsula (Robb 2002).Two notable points emerge from Robb’s reconstruction of the Neolithic burialprogramme. Firstly, burial and ancestor commemoration rituals wereoverwhelmingly performed at villages or other inhabited sites. Ditches andhouses would have provided special foci for primary and secondary burial1,although human remains are generally found wherever domestic activities werecarried out, seemingly as a part of the normal detritus of daily life. Secondly,the disturbance and dispersal of human remains were probably the consequence,either wanted or unwanted, of an array of mundane tasks such as digging new pitsand building new houses. However, some ancestors were singled out forindividualised remembrance either by removing selected bodily remains from theirgraves or by consciously avoiding disturbing their tombs, for these would havebeen permanently inscribed in the village landscape and social fabric. It stemsfrom both considerations that burial, both primary and secondary, was notconceptualised as qualitatively different from the rest of the day-to-dayaccomplishments carried out in the village, but just as one of theseaccomplishments – doubtless an important one. This strongly reinforces theimpression that Neolithic identity and social life would have revolved around anoverarching principle of co-residence within the bounded village (Robb 1994b;2007a). Importantly, the principle was ample enough to include the newly as wellas the more distant dead, whose incorporation into a village-centred cosmoswould have secured the well-being and orderly reproduction of the community.From village to cemetery: the late Neolithic and Copper AgeThe picture hitherto sketched gradually changed during the late and finalNeolithic (c. 4500–3600 cal. BC), when burial was increasingly performed atperipheral or otherwise distinct locales within the village as to signifyseparation from daily life. Moreover, mortuary rites became more complex andformalised, with special regard to secondary practices of bone manipulation andreburial. The first appearance of this long-term trend can be traced back to thelate Serra d’Alto phase in the advanced middle Neolithic (Pessina & Tiné 2008:287). In this period, small segregated burial areas were first established atsites such as Serra Cicora and Murgecchia, either at the edge of villages or,significantly, at abandoned settlement sites (Conati Barbaro 2007–08; Ingravallo2004; Lo Porto 1998). The earliest-known cemetery proper was also founded on theoutskirts of Pulo di Molfetta, a large open settlement in Apulia. Excavationscarried out at this site in the early 20th century brought to light over 50stone-lined tombs, in which a staggering variety of primary and secondaryinhumation rituals had been performed, and durable goods had occasionally beenplaced with the dead. Interestingly, certain tombs were found devoid of anyhuman remains. These might be interpreted as either cenotaphs or temporaryrepositories for burials that were later moved elsewhere (Mosso 1910; Radina2002).This trend gained momentum from the late 5th millennium BC. In the southernpeninsula, cemeteries were established away from domestic sites at MasseriaBellavista, Scoglio del Tonno and Cala Tramontana (the latter on the Tremitiislands), and also at Bronte in Sicily (Palma di Cesnola 1967; Privitera 2012;Quagliati 1906). The high frequency of secondary burials and the growingstandardisation of good assemblages witnessed at these sites openly anticipatecharacters that will become widespread in the Copper Age. The first hypogealchambers reminiscent of Copper Age rock-cut tombs also appeared in the advanced5th/early 4th millennia BC at a handful of sites including Arnesano, Serrad’Alto-Fondo Gravela and perhaps Scoglio del Tonno (Manfredini 2001; but seePessina & Tiné 2008: 289–91 for problems of interpretation).In the central peninsula, key evidence for this transitional phase has beenyielded by the large aggregation site at Ripoli. Here, a distinct cemetery areawas constructed in the unusual form of nine linear cavities cutting across thecentre of the village. At least 45 individuals were buried in them, their numberin each trench varying from one to 14. Skeates (1995) reconstructed a complexritual process that would have started with the deposition of the bodies, leftuncovered to decompose in the graves. Then, certain bodies would have beendisarticulated and eventually all trenches would have been filled up withselected artefacts and the remains of funerary feasts. However, this reading isdebated due to the scarce information available for the site, which wasinvestigated over 100 years ago (Grifoni 2003). Caves continued to be used forburial in the late 5th and early 4th millennia BC. Even at these sites, however,interment and bone manipulation rites were progressively moved away from thecave mouths where domestic life concentrated to be increasingly performed in thedeeper recesses. This pattern is particularly apparent at Grotta dei Piccioni inAbruzzo, where primary and secondary inhumation, skull deposition, and otherritual activities were all carried out at the bottom of the cave (Cremonesi1976).From about 3800 cal. BC, in the final Neolithic and early Copper Age, thelengthy process of separation of the dead from the living described above wasbrought to an end. Burial was finally moved out of domestic sites and cemeterieswere created in the landscape as separate and often secluded locales for theperformance of funerals and other mortuary rituals. Based on regionaldifference, burial was practised in rock-cut chamber tombs, uninhabited caves(or uninhabited parts of otherwise occupied caves) and, to a lesser extent,trench graves (Cocchi Genick 2009). Particularly informative in this respect isthe evidence provided by the so-called Rinaldone and Gaudo funerary traditions,which were first elaborated in this time period (Cazzella & Silvestrini 2005;Passariello et al. 2010). Whereas the former is found all over central Italywith special foci in the central Tyrrhenian region and the Marche lowlands, thelatter flourished in southwest Italy up to the lower Tiber valley (Carboni2002). Both traditions are typified by small rock-cut chamber tombs preceded byentrance shafts or short corridors, and sealed by removable slabs. The new tombstructure allowed mourners to access the grave in order to carry out reburialpractices and ancestor veneration rites (Fig. 2.5).[../images/fig2_5.jpg]Fig. 2.5. Rinaldone-style chamber tomb from Ponte San Pietro, west-central Italy(Miari 1995).The new mortuary programme emerging at the onset of the Copper Age wascharacterised by an unprecedented degree of ritual elaboration (Conti et al.1997; Dolfini 2004). Evidence from Rinaldone-style burial chambers, albeit notuniform, suggests that the ritual process was generally divided into thefollowing steps:1. Interment of a fleshed and often furnished individual in crouchedposition, normally placed on the left-hand side regardless of their gender;2. Manipulation of the dry bones, which were removed (partly or totally) fromthe grave and probably circulated within the cemetery;3. And reburial of selected bones (usually skull and long bones), which werestacked along the tomb walls or near the entrance with the remains of otherindividuals (Table 2.1).Table 2.1. The Copper Age burial programme as documented by Rinaldone-stylechamber tombs, central Italy.[../images/table2_1.jpg]Interestingly, the new burial process seems to have necessitated theintermediate step to be especially elaborate. This was marked by a mind-bogglingvariety of bone manipulation practices ranging from the mere removal of theskull from an otherwise articulated skeleton to the complete transgression ofthe bodily boundaries by means of disarticulation and, more occasionally, bonefragmentation. Goods were also removed from the grave at this stage to becirculated, fragmented, and occasionally re-deposited with secondary burials.Similar rituals were also performed in the chamber graves and entrance shafts ofthe Gaudo cemeteries (southwest Italy), although a greater stress was placedhere on disarticulation and bone handling/circulation (Bailo Modesti 2003; BailoModesti & Salerno 1998). Likewise, cemeteries were divided into clusters oftombs in which descent groups would have interred their deceased and veneratedtheir ancestors (Fig. 2.6). Such overarching similarities between Rinaldone andGaudo burial programmes suggest that, in most of the Italian peninsula, CopperAge mortuary practices would have followed a common tripartite structureinvolving the interment of the fleshed body, the manipulation and circulation ofthe dry bones after the flesh had naturally decayed, and the final reburial ofselected bones with other ancestral remains. Crucially, the fact that all stagesof this process are seemingly found in the extant burial record suggests thatthe Copper Age mortuary programme was not intended to be linear or equifinal,for not all individuals ended up being disarticulated, and those who did wererearranged in extremely diverse manners. It would thus appear that unlike burialand manipulation practices were applied to different individuals based on theirsocial identity and personhood as well as, presumably, the circumstances oftheir death. If we try to discern a meaningful pattern in the multifariousburial record of Copper Age Italy, an opposition is easily noticed between therelatively small number of individuals that were left undisturbed in the graveand the vast majority of the deceased, whose bodies were, to a smaller orgreater extent, transgressed and reworked (Dolfini 2006a; 2006b). The number ofpossible outcomes of bodily disarticulation practices is also noteworthy, andseems to greatly exceed the spectrum of choices available to Neolithic society.Gender and age were sometimes stressed in burial through the deposition ofstereotyped sets of goods. Typically, men were disposed of with flint,groundstone or copper-alloy tools and weapons while women and children wereaccompanied by small ornaments including necklaces, pins, and conical V-boredbuttons. To a lesser extent, gender and age were also expressed through bodyarrangement. In the Copper Age, however, the focus was not placed on bodyorientation as in the Neolithic, but on manipulation, since men were leftarticulated more often than women and children (Bailo Modesti & Salerno 1998:183; Dolfini 2006a; 2006b). Moreover, whereas gender-specific goods were mostlyplaced with articulated burials, disarticulated and selected remains were eitherleft unfurnished or were provided with gender-neutral goods such as copper awlsand fragmented pots. This seems to suggest that gender and age, as well aspresumably other elements of a person’s identity, had to be removed during theritual process in order to integrate the new dead into a non-individualised andperhaps undifferentiated community of the ancestors (Dolfini 2004; Skeates1995). However, in striking contrappunto to this widespread practice, thepersonal identity of a relatively small number of individuals, mostly adultmales, was carefully preserved by leaving their bodies not only undisturbed, butalso fully furnished with the complete panoply of goods with which they had beenburied in the first place.In parallel to the rise of the cemetery as a place to be exclusively devoted tothe performance of mortuary rites, the long-lived nucleated village seems todisappear from the Italian landscape, or at any rate to become rarer.Substantial villages are replaced by dispersed and often short-livedsettlements, isolated dwellings, and seasonally inhabited caves and open-airstations. This trend is apparent at several late Neolithic sites across thepeninsula, where sizeable habitation sites give way to rather insubstantialsettlements whose features often amount to a handful of pits, cobblestonefloors, and hearths (Anzidei et al. 2002; Grifoni et al. 2001; Manfredini et al.2005a; Moscoloni 1992). The trend continues well into the Copper Age at sitessuch as Quadrato di Torre Spaccata, Casale del Cavaliere, and Maccarese (Anzidei& Carboni 1995; Boccuccia et al. 2000; Manfredini 2002). Copper Age sites oftenlie close to one another on river terraces, and it is uncertain whether thisshould be interpreted as evidence of the same community moving to neighbouringunexploited soils or smaller groups dwelling nearby (Cazzella 1992; Gianni 1991;Moscoloni & Silvestrini 2005). In either case, however, the outcome is similar:from the late 5th millennium BC, and increasingly so during the 4th and 3rdmillennia BC, communities were generally smaller and villages left fainterfootprints in the landscape than they did in the early and middle Neolithic.[../images/fig2_6.jpg]Fig. 2.6. Outline of Copper Age mortuary practices as documented by Gaudo-stylechamber tombs, southwest Italy (Bailo Modesti & Salerno 1998, modified).Table 2.2.

Recent research hasnuanced this picture by showing that lowland alluvial plains and fertile rivervalleys were intensively cultivated, and villages in these areas were oftensubstantial and long-lived (Anzidei et al. 2011; Fugazzola Delpino et al. 2007;Laforgia & Boenzi 2011; Maniscalco & Robb 2011). A small number of villages werealso surrounded by walls, ditches and palisades, which are normally interpretedas defence structures (Cazzella 2003b; Cazzella & Moscoloni 1999; Cerqua 2011;Cipolloni Sampò 1988; Manfredini et al. 2005b). However, notwithstanding thepossibility that some communities might have continued to dwell together inlarge numbers during the Copper Age, some of the large upland sites includingConelle and Ortucchio might be interpreted as seasonally inhabited aggregationsites, where a dispersed population would have gathered to exchange livestockand goods, arrange marriages, and perhaps carry out youth initiation rites inwhich red deer and wild boar were hunted (Robb 2007a; Whitehouse 1992b).Moreover, some of the alleged defence works appear to have been maintained forvery short periods of time (e.g. Cerqua 2011), thus casting doubts over theiractual or intended function.The salient features of the long-term changes outlined in this section aresummarised in Table 2.2.E pluribus, unumThe modifications in settlement and burial patterns hitherto discussed lendthemselves to several possible interpretations. As we have seen above, the riseof corporate burial in the late Neolithic and Copper Age might be read as a newpolitical strategy aiming to express ownership or inheritance claims over landand other restricted resources (Pessina & Tiné 2008; Skeates 1995). While thisremains a perfectly possible scenario, it is not clear whether land was actuallya rare commodity in the sparsely inhabited Neolithic and Copper Age world,perhaps with the exception of a few densely populated areas in the Adriaticlowlands. Moreover, if burial was employed as a strategy for political control,we should ask ourselves why the sourcing locales of obsidian and greenstone –some of the most prized and most widely exchanged materials in the lateNeolithic world – were not protected by a ‘firewall of ancestors’, but layapparently open for anyone to exploit.Another long-standing tradition of studies argues that the richly furnished maleburials making their appearance in the Copper Age ought to be seen as the firstmarkers of social inequality. By displaying the prestigious tools and weaponsacquired through prowess in combat and control of long-distance exchange routes,tribal leaders and ‘Big Men’ would have expressed their power according to thenew ethos of the ‘prestige goods economy’ (Barker 1981; Cazzella 1992; 1998;2003a; Guidi 2000). However, if prestige was gained through the procurement ofexotic materials such as obsidian and greenstone, why did the far-reachingexchange networks of these goods flourish in egalitarian Neolithic society andcrash dramatically in supposedly unequal Copper Age, where emerging triballeaders would have needed them the most to justify power and social control? Thedemise of obsidian and greenstone exchange is often interpreted as theconsequence of the emerging ‘trade’ in metal, which would have become the new,pervasive symbol of social prominence. Yet, failing to recognise the unlikefunction and social role of obsidian and copper tools in Italian prehistoricsociety, this reading leaves much to be desired; it also underestimates the factthat, in Copper Age Italy, metal did not circulate as extensively as obsidianand greenstone (Dolfini 2010).I would propose here an alternative, heterodox explanation for the momentousshifts in settlement and burial patterns discussed in this paper. It is mycontention that this phenomenon does not indicate any radical change in thepolitical structure of prehistoric society. Rather, it marks a profoundmodification in the symbolic toolkit used by society to express individual andgroup identity as well as beliefs and cosmologies concerning the human body. Inother words, it is not a change in the underlying ‘meaning’ of burial that weare witnessing here, but a change in the medium chosen by society to representand reproduce itself. However, since social relations derive their meanings fromthe practices through which they are articulated, it would be wrong to presumethat changes in the expression of burial did not cause any change in its socialunderstanding. As we shall see in the remainder of the article, alterations tothe Neolithic burial programme rested upon a wholesale re-signification of thehuman body, which was turned into one of the core symbolic resources deployed bysociety to reproduce itself.In the early and middle Neolithic, the village acted as the principal locus forthe enactment of social life. Burial was performed within the bounded village asone of the many practices, both ritual and mundane, which helped to definesocial relations and a sense of being in the world. When affordedarchaeologically visible formal inhumation, the dead were laid, crouched and(mostly) unfurnished, in simple pits, stone-lined trenches or slab-built cists.Bodies were arranged according to loosely defined yet fairly recurrent normsdictating orientation and burial treatment, which would have responded to sharedideas concerning cosmology and identity including gender and age. Over time,most of the graves were disturbed and the dry bone dispersed, possibly duringthe performance of daily tasks. In a few cases, however, selected bodily remainswere formally reburied, either during one-off special ceremonies or as a part ofcalendrical rites.It would appear that the disturbance of the grave and the scattering of thebones responded to overarching cosmological principles dictating that all tracesof the individual identity be erased during the ritual process. In this way, theindividualised deceased were turned into a non-individualised ancestral presencethat would have guaranteed the well-being and orderly reproduction of thevillage community. A principle of group solidarity and continuity was expressedthrough the Neolithic burial programme, in which the community took precedenceover the individual (Shanks & Tilley 1982; Skeates 1995). The burying andscattering of human remains near houses, in ditches, and at other inhabitedlocales would have strongly contributed to the self-representation of the groupas a bounded social body, and a common sense of belonging would have emergedfrom dwelling in a space where, from living memory, the community had interred,manipulated, and reburied its dead. Importantly, these practices were fullyintegrated into the daily life of the village. Burying and commemorating thedead was just one of the many tasks that were carried out at domestic sitestogether with the building and burning of houses, the digging and filling ofditches, the erection of palisades and so on. In Neolithic Italy, burial was notconceptualised as qualitatively different from other social practices, but justas one of the possible media – doubtless an important one – that communities hadat their disposal for reproducing the core principle underpinning social life:co-residence in the bounded village.In the late Neolithic, and increasingly so in the Copper Age, the tie betweencoresidence and the common history of the group split apart (Robb 1994b: 49). Inmost of peninsular Italy, the long-lived enclosures that had so conspicuouslyembodied Neolithic life disappeared from the landscape, only to be replaced bysmaller and more scattered settlements, isolated houses, and seasonallyinhabited caves or open-air stations. Due to their insubstantial structures,their short occupation span and, above all, their failure to accommodate thewhole community within the same inhabited space, domestic sites lost theirprevious centrality as loci for the reproduction of group identity. Even forthose communities that continued to dwell in large villages, co-residence seemsto have lost its earlier importance, possibly due to an economic regime thatrequired a higher degree of seasonal mobility. Under these circumstances, a newmedium had to be found around which social relations could coalesce.Interestingly, late Neolithic society did not actually conjure the new mediumout of thin air, but – as human societies habitually do – picked it from thespectrum of cultural resources that were already at hand. It is perhapsunsurprising that the choice fell on burial due to its long-standing role as aprime means for ascribing group identity and structuring social interaction. Allthat was required in the new circumstances was to realign the old mortuaryrituals to the changing needs of increasingly mobile communities, and turn oneof the many media of social reproduction into the core medium around which groupidentity could newly crystallise. This was a process of cultural selection, notof outright invention: E pluribus, unum.The changing role of burial brought about a number of important modifications tothe enactment and social understanding of funerary practices. The first was theinvention of the cemetery, which emerged in the cultural landscape of lateNeolithic Italy as the principal locus for the performance of funerals andancestor rites. As we have seen above, this was concomitant to the slow butinexorable waning of the nucleated village as a cultural resource. It couldperhaps be said that the demise of the village necessitated the cemetery to beinvented insofar as smaller and more dispersed groups did require meaningfulplaces to gather periodically in order to bury their dead, commemorate theirancestors, and ultimately reinforce the common genealogic ties that the newlifestyle had loosened. Yet such a dramatic change in the topography of burialdid not rest upon a wholesale alteration in its meaning, but on an unprecedentedsurge in its importance as a medium for the reproduction of group identity andsocial relations. This is neatly indicated by the fact that the basic tenets ofthe Neolithic burial programme were carried through into the new era, albeit inan ‘augmented’ form. As previously, the dead were laid sideways in the grave andoriented or manipulated according to their gender, age, and presumably thecircumstances of their death. As previously, the loss of individual identitythrough disarticulation was recognised to be the chief avenue for incorporatingthe new dead into the collective cosmos of the ancestors. And just aspreviously, ‘special’ ancestors were singled out for individual remembrance andveneration by leaving their bodies undisturbed in the grave, although theimportance of this practice grew over time (Dolfini 2006a; 2006b).The second change concerns the structure and nature of mortuary practices.Primary and secondary burial rites grew increasingly complex in the Copper Age,to a degree that has no parallels in the Neolithic world. This phenomenon canperhaps be explained by considering that, since the ancestors had become thecore medium of social reproduction, a fairly simple funerary rite no longerresponded to the novel needs of Copper Age communities. Genealogy had to beplayed up in order to tie together the threads of a common history that the newrole of the village had thrown into jeopardy, and the ancestors, either real orconveniently ‘rediscovered’, were the obvious means for doing so (Robb 1994b;2007a). In the 4th and 3rd millennia BC, people increasingly defined themselvesby handling, circulating, breaking, selecting, mixing and reburying the physicalbodies of their ancestors in a mind-boggling array of ritual practices.Formally, such practices would have been justified by a richer and subtlercategorisation of the identity of the deceased (e.g. in terms of gender:Barfield 1998; Robb 2007a; Whitehouse 1992a; 1992b; 2001). At a deeper level,however, they were motivated by the novel desire and, indeed, social need tostress group identity and genealogic ties. In turn, the new mortuary ritesrequired a grave structure that could periodically be accessed by the mourners:the Copper Age chamber tomb was thus born. Nevertheless, the old order wasrecognisably preserved within the new; for the segmentary structure of Neolithicsociety as expressed by the C-ditched village compounds was recreated in thecemetery in the form of separate tomb clusters where kin-groups would haveburied their own dead and commemorated their own ancestors (Robb 1994b: 49).The final and perhaps deepest change lay in the social understanding of thehuman body. Following Robb (2002), I have argued above that Neolithic burial wasenacted according to an ideally linear programme dictating the articulated bodyto be disarticulated and dispersed amongst the living. However, linearity waslost in the growing complexity of Copper Age mortuary performances, as indeedwas the prior (ideal) equi-finality of the burial programme. Not only were nowbodies transgressed and fragmented in entirely new ways, but for the first timeit was also perfectly possible to ‘interrupt’ the disarticulation process beforeits ‘natural’ end marked by the complete reorganisation of the body and thescattering or reburial of selected remains. Yet none of the seeminglyinterrupted acts of bodily manipulation found in Copper Age chamber graves is tobe understood as an unfinished inhumation process. Rather, it must be recognisedthat all dead, be they articulated or reorganised, isolated or inextricablymixed together, selected or fragmented, underwent the ritually correct anddefinitive burial afforded by their personhood and identity (Dolfini 2006a: 61).It could be suggested that, in the Italian Copper Age, the body wasreconceptualised as a more partible and transgressible entity than it had beenpreviously, and that body parts and substances would have been given specificqualities and meanings (Chapman 2000; Chapman & Gaydarska 2007; Fowler 2004;2008; Jones 2005; Strathern 1988). Body parts could also be extracted from thedead to be employed in a range of interactions and ritual exchanges, and objectscould be paired up with them, and presumably circulated with them, in mutuallyreinforcing signification processes (Dolfini 2004; Lucas 1996). It is notinconceivable to think that such an extensive reconfiguration of the dead mightreflect broader changes in the social understanding of the living. At a time ofsweeping economic and social change a mighty effort was seemingly made torepresent the social body as unchanging by intensifying burial and ancestorrituals, and the tension between old and new order was thus naturalised byreference to the physical body of the dead. In this way the body, and inparticular the ancestral body, became the surface on which identity, and thesocial relations previously expressed by the nucleated village, could newly beinscribed.Concluding remarksIn this paper I have proposed an alternative reading for the dramatictransformations affecting prehistoric Italian society at the transition betweenNeolithic and Copper Age, in the late 5th and 4th millennia BC. In particular, Iclaimed that the momentous changes in settlement and burial patterns occurringin this time period need not indicate any radical modifications in the politicalstructure of society. Rather, they seem to mark a profound discontinuity in thesymbolic toolkit deployed by communities and kin-groups to express identity andsocial relations in a changing world. Since co-residence in the nucleatedvillage could no longer be used to express a common sense of belonging and beingin the world, a new medium had to be found to replace it. Perhapsunsurprisingly, the choice fell on burial, which had been employed since theearly Neolithic as a prime means for structuring social interaction. Thus, Iwould argue, the unprecedented surge in mortuary practices witnessed at thistime seems to reflect a change in the role of burial as a medium for expressingindividual and group identity, not a wholesale modification in its underlying‘meaning’.However, the new role fulfilled by burial triggered three important changes thatprogressively eroded, and ultimately altered, the underlying principles ofNeolithic social reproduction. The first is the invention of the cemetery, whichemerged in the cultural landscape of the late Neolithic as the principal locusfor funerals and ancestor rites; the second lies in the structure and nature ofmortuary practices, which grew increasingly complex and elaborate in order toreinforce the genealogic ties that the new, more mobile lifestyle would haveunwound; and the third is a general modification in the social configuration ofthe human body, which was reconceptualised as a more partible and permeableentity than it had been previously. Herein lies the most significant alterationin the meaning of mortuary practices, for new ideas of identity and personhoodwould have been naturalised through reference to the ancestral body. In a mightyeffort to represent a fast-changing society as unchanging, prehistoric Italiancommunities realigned the old mortuary practices to the new social needs, andinscribed on the human body the unresolved tension between the old and the neworder.AcknowledgmentsI wish to thank J.

Combining a detailed examination of a large andpreviously neglected dataset of Northumbrian Terminal Neolithic/Chalcolithic andEarly Bronze Age mortuary deposits, c. 2450–1500 BC, with a novel reading of vanGennep’s Rites of Passage, it argues that while those pre-liminal rites closestto the liminal phase generally have the most impact in shaping the mortuaryevidence, such deposits may also project desirable aspects of identity towardsthe post-liminal rites, and provide the dead with key media to assist in thoselatter rites. Drawing out an often-overlooked aspect of van Gennep’santhropological model, it argues that the work of the post-liminal incorporationof the dead into a new community may be deferred to non-living agents (thecommunity of the dead, deities, etc), and then explores the implications ofdifferences in such post-liminal practices for the Northumbrian Early Bronze Ageevidence. It argues that the often-acknowledged shift from ‘inhumation’ tocremation during the period was perhaps of lesser importance in terms ofunderstandings of the body, person and death than a contemporary shift fromisolated burials to the use of collective burial grounds where a community ofthe dead could physically incorporate the deceased during the mortuary ritescarried out by the living. It also places the change from inhumation tocremation and from isolated to communal burial places within the context ofenduring trends in the funerary rites that transformed the dead, in particularhighlighting key media deployed repeatedly throughout the period in effectingthe ritualised transformation of the dead. In so doing it maps out preciselywhat changed and what remained the same during hundreds of years of prehistoricmortuary practices.Keywords: burial grounds, cremation, Early Bronze Age, inhumation, mortuaryrites, Northumberland, rites of passageIntroductionA wealth of current research is focused on British TerminalNeolithic/Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age mortuary evidence.1 Ourunderstanding of the chronology of funerary practices and assemblages of thisperiod is being enhanced through programmes of radiocarbon dating (e.g. as partof the Beaker People Project directed by Mike Parker Pearson, and, for Scotland,through the Dating Cremated Bones project led by Alison Sheridan (2007a; 2007b))and has benefitted from a thorough reappraisal of the chronology of Beakerpottery by Stuart Needham (2005). Human remains are being examined in analysesof mobility patterns, diet and health (Montgomery et al. 2007; Jay & Richards2007; and see Sheridan 2008 for summary). Artefact assemblages are also beingre-analysed in detail, investigating contact over distance and considering theimplications of the scarcity, manner of deposition, association and distancefrom point of origin of the objects for Early Bronze Age identities (e.g.Needham & Woodward 2008), as well as considering what the artefact assemblagescan tell us about ritual activity (e.g. Woodward et al. 2005). Attempts are alsobeing made to refine the chronology of monuments, which were often the scene ofmortuary activity (e.g. Garwood 2007), and to explore the detailed sequences ofactivity at such monuments (e.g. Owoc 2001; 2005). At the same time,sophisticated theoretical approaches to the role of mortuary practices innegotiating social relations have been developed, and several authors haveattempted to examine the relational construction of Early Bronze Age identitythrough mortuary rites (e.g. Brück 2004; 2006; Fowler 2005; Jones 2002; 2008;Owoc 2001; 2005). These studies emphasise how persons emerge from differentstrategies in social relations (which deploy material culture in differingways), consider the metaphors involved in mortuary rites, and stress the natureof the mortuary context as a venue for ritualised transformation. There are alsocalls to consider the mortuary evidence in greater detail in order to movebeyond the idea that distinct periods of the Neolithic and Bronze Age can becharacterised by singular forms of mortuary practice (Fowler 2005; Gibson 2004;2007). Such approaches to bodies, persons, and mortuary practices have not yetbeen applied together in detailed regional analysis drawing on the emergingchronologies mentioned above.In order to build up a contextual appreciation of mortuary rites at a regionallevel I have been examining the evidence from Northumberland with many of theseanalytical and interpretative developments in mind. This area of Britain hasoften been neglected in national syntheses of Neolithic and Early Bronze Agearchaeology. Some recent research (e.g. the Ritual in Early Bronze Age GraveGoods project, directed by John Hunter; Woodward et al. 2005) considers evidencefrom some specific Northumbrian sites, but none is directed towards a detailedanalysis of this region. While levels of preservation vary significantly withinthe county, there is a history of research with reliable recording stretchingback into the mid nineteenth century. I have produced a database of informationfrom published records of excavations of Early Bronze Age mortuary deposits fromthe eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries, including a corpus of workby William Greenwell, and some unpublished material.2 The results analysed inthis chapter draw on information from 127 sites (Fig. 3.1),3 where a reasonableexcavation record exists for 298 separate mortuary deposits. This informationhas now been incorporated into a broader regional analysis elsewhere byincluding comparable evidence from Tyne and Wear and County Durham (Fowler2013a; 2013b), and these results will be considered elsewhere alongsidecontemporary evidence from southeast Scotland (Fowler & Wilkin in prep.). Aprogramme of osteoarchaeological re-analysis and some radiocarbon dating oflater prehistoric human remains currently in Tyne and Wear Museums collectionshas also just been completed, improving the resolution of the chronologicalpatterns discussed here (Gamble & Fowler 2013a; 2013b). This article wasinitially drafted before all of this work was completed, but subsequent analysesconfirm the picture of both the ritual transformation of the dead and thetransformation of mortuary rites themselves during the Early Bronze Age inNorthumberland.In this article I will characterise trends in Northumbrian mortuary rites c.2500–1500 BC. In so doing I will provide a contextual analysis of the decline in‘inhumation’4 practices and the growing dominance of the deposition of crematedremains since this is often taken as the key change in mortuary practice duringthe period. Certain artefacts often accompanied specific mortuary practices andthis provides some basis for a chronological scheme based on dating programmesand typological analyses of these artefacts and practices elsewhere in Britain.In Northumberland only between two and four burials included Beakers withcremated remains (some scraps of ‘calcined bones’ in the two cists at DilstonPark with respectively two and three Beakers (Gibson 1906), and clearly crematedremains in two of the cists at Low Hauxley (Waddington 2010)), the earliestBeaker burials (those before c. 2250 BC) were mainly those of adults, and themajority of crouched burials with Beaker pottery that date to c. 2250–1950 BCwere oriented east–west. Earlier Beaker burials, and those buried withcopper-alloy flat rivetted daggers, tended to remain as isolated burials whilelater burials of all kinds tended to occur in burial grounds such as cistcemeteries or sites marked with round mounds. The overall picture is one ofspecific practices associated with specific object types, and as the range ofburial practices became more diverse so did the range of objects from which thegrave accompaniments were chosen (though not the number of objects in any onegrave), until c. 1750–1500 BC when a more restricted range of artefacts wereplaced in pits with cremated remains. From c. 2200/2100 BC Food Vesselssometimes accompanied burials that were not cremated, sometimes accompanied orcontained cremated bone, and were contemporary with some Beaker burials. Someburial practices were locally distinctive, such as north–south burials with jetornaments, late Beaker pottery or Food Vessels in northern Northumberland afterc. 2100 BC, often at burial grounds that were monumentalised. From c. 2000 BCEnlarged Food Vessel Urns (or Vase Urns) and Collared Urns joined the mix, andthese were only found containing cremated remains, sometimes the mixed remainsof multiple individuals. I will argue that equally as important, if not more so,than the rising deposition of cremated remains from c. 2150 BC is anincreasingly tendency to combine the remains of the dead at a single locale oreven in the same vessel or cist. While ‘inhumation’ did largely give way duringthe period to cremation, which accentuated the visible transformation of thebody, this developed on and extended a trend of producing closer physicalrelations between the bodies of the dead during inhumations after c. 2200 BC.This in turn declined at the very end of the sequence. Detailed analysis alsosuggests continuities in some key features of the mortuary rites throughout muchof the period whether these involved remains that had or had not been crematedbefore deposition.[../images/fig3_1a.jpg][../images/fig3_1b.jpg]Fig. 3.1. Locations of the sites analysed within this study.In this analysis I explore the implications of van Gennep’s model of thestructure of rites of passage (from pre-liminal rites through liminal phases topost-liminal rites) by considering each Early Bronze Age mortuary deposit as theresult of a sequence of ritualised actions. I argue that while those pre-liminalrites closest to the liminal phase generally have the most impact in shaping themortuary evidence, such deposits also project desirable aspects of identitycited in the pre-liminal rites towards the post-liminal rites, and provide thedead with key media to assist in those latter rites. Drawing out anoften-overlooked aspect of van Gennep’s anthropological model, I argue that thework of the post-liminal incorporation of the dead into a new community may bedeferred to non-living agents (the community of the dead, deities, etc), andthen explore the implications of differences in such post-liminal practices forthe Northumbrian Early Bronze Age evidence. I will first examine patterns inmortuary rites where the remains of the dead are buried without being cremated,before analysing mortuary rites involving cremation. In each case I willconsider the fragmentary evidence for sequences of ritualised events from thepreparation of the body to the closing of the mortuary deposit. I will considerelements of continuity in these mortuary practices alongside the changes in thematerial result, experiences and effects these events produced. I argue that theoften-acknowledged shift from ‘inhumation’ to cremation during the period wasperhaps of lesser importance in terms of understandings of the body, person anddeath than a contemporary shift from isolated burials to the use of collectiveburial grounds where a community of the dead could physically incorporate thedeceased during the mortuary rites carried out by the living. I also place thechange from ‘inhumation’ to cremation and from isolated to communal burialplaces within the context of enduring trends in the funerary rites thattransformed the dead, in particular highlighting key media deployed repeatedlythroughout the period in effecting the ritualised transformation of the dead. Iwill suggest that certain media were repeatedly deployed in transforming thebody, resulting in presentations of idealised identities and desiredrelationships in the mortuary context, certain aspects of which changedrelatively little over time. In so doing I map out precisely what changed andwhat remained the same during hundreds of years of prehistoric mortuarypractices.Early Bronze Age mortuary practices as rites de passageThe perspective on mortuary rites adopted in this chapter is stronglyanthropological in basis, following van Gennep’s (1960) and Turner’s (1969)identifications of a tripartite structure to rites of passage. Van Gennep arguesthat each rite of passage has three phases: pre-liminal, liminal andpost-liminal. Turner argues that the pre-liminal phase involves the affirmationof existing identities and relationships (e.g. dressing the dead, visiting thebody) leading up to the separation of the person(s) undergoing the rite fromothers in the community. The identity presented during this affirmation relieson the perceptions of those among the community doing the affirming and,importantly, may stress the most desirable aspects of the identity of thedeceased since the dead are prepared for their post-liminal reincorporation intothe community of the dead, the afterlife, or whatever is hoped or expected to bethe next stage in existence (see also Fowler 2013c). For that reason, in theanalysis that follows I have resisted arguing that how the dead were preparedfor the grave tells us only about the pre-liminal rites: transformations made atthis stage, materials presented to the dead at this stage, prefigure theexpected and hoped-for post-liminal rites which might take place in theafterlife or among the dead. Thus, in the Northumbrian Early Bronze Ageanalysis, I consider that the media of each practice provides a material conduitlinking together all three phases of the ritual: the materials offered up fordeposition in pre-liminal rites were presented towards the next stage ofexistence and as such are more than just residues of the first stage of theritual. Incrasingly, such deposition arguably formed part of the post-liminalreincorporation of the dead.Following the separation of the living and the dead at the end of thepre-liminal phase, the identities of, and relationships between, mourners andthe deceased are further transformed during the liminal phase of the ritual.During this phase the deceased body is also usually physically transformed, forinstance through mummification, cremation or decay, though this may go unseen by(most of) the living as the deceased has been physically separated from them.Turner stresses that a sense of community or belonging (‘communitas’) bindsthose who experience the transformation together – this might cement a communityof mourners, but could also characterise the way that the dead are transformedin the same way as those who died before them or share the same burial groundand thus transfer the recently deceased into a community of the dead. Theliminal phase may be lengthy, meaning that identities may be in flux for sometime, including after the body has been buried. Certain activities may beprohibited during the liminal phase and these prohibitions may surround howmourners act with regards to the living as well as the recently deceased.The final, post-liminal phase of ritual activity involves the reincorporation ofthe persons undergoing the rite into a wider community (of the living and/or thedead) and the acknowledgement of their new identities and relationships. Yet thekey agents in the post-liminal reincorporation of the dead may be divinities,supernatural beings or a community of the dead (Fowler 2013c). For instance, insome belief systems the dead must be judged by divine agents before entering theafterlife, and this was certainly the case during the Bronze Age in Egypt;indeed, Van Gennep himself draws on the Ancient Egyptians as an example (vanGennep 1960: 157–59). Mummification, and the provision of the dead with apanoply of goods in the tomb, were directed towards this reincorporation by thedivinities for the dead, even though these practices took place before the deadwere fully separated from the living and the tomb was closed. Rites ofincorporation may also take place among the living, freeing widows or widowersfrom mourning obligations and restrictions for instance and bringing the wholecommunity of survivors together.The Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age mortuary practices under discussion inthis chapter can be seen as culturally-specific rites of passage, and changedover time. While we could argue that all of these rites sought to affirm,transform, and present a new identity for the dead as their place in the cosmoswas renegotiated, changes in practice over time are important. The symbols andspaces deployed in the rites, the techniques by which persons and bodies weretransformed, and the duration of the ritual process could all potentially havechanged over time, altering the experiences of mourners and the relationshipbetween the deceased and certain places, objects, and communities of the dead.For instance, the length of time that the liminal phase lasts might vary to theextent that the deceased may be incorporated into a new community soon afterdeath or this might be deferred (as arguably occurred in the Medieval Catholicconception of an afterlife following Resurrection and Judgement). The new statusthe dead attained is often (though not always) a desirable one: the dead areeither elevated to new planes of existence or exist alongside the living in anew and special form (Turner 1969: 166–69). Thus, the production of a desiredidentity is a key aspect of the transformations undertaken in rites of passage(cf. Fowler 2013c). Yet in order to interpret past mortuary rites meaningfullywe also need to consider the significance of symbols used and the place of thosesymbols as they move through or are introduced within a narrative sequence ofevents which includes acts of affirmation, transformation and reincorporationinto a community of living and/or dead persons (Turner 1967; 1969). As explainedabove, features of the archaeological remains studied here cannot always beneatly attributed to one stage or another in the ritual process, and manymaterially connected different phases of the process. Rituals are complex, andmay employ successive stages in which statements are made and then laterreflected on, recontextualised and revised. Thus, interpretations of EarlyBronze Age mortuary deposits have to be built contextually: we cannot simplyassume that the body as it is presented in the grave affirms identity in life,but need to consider how identities were transformed through the mortuarysequence. Below I focus on the decisions made in treating the dead that haveleft material traces, and what inferences can be drawn about mortuary ritualsfrom these traces. Changes in how various stages of the rite were conducted, inthe symbols used, or in how, say, an act like deposition might articulatepre-liminal separation, liminality and post-liminal reintegration, aresignificant in considering changes in how persons were transformed followingdeath. I have divided the evidence into the interment of uncremated and thencremated human remains in order to discuss the broad long-term trend in changingmortuary rites and assess the relative significance of this change in funerarypractice.Mortuary rites involving the interment of uncremated human remainsMost of the burials from the region that were not cremated date to c. 2450–1950BC, some to c. 1950–1750 BC (Fowler 2013a: chapter 4 [11_Chapter04.html]; Gamble& Fowler 2013a). Thirty-four mortuary deposits included Beaker pottery, whichwas mainly current in the region c. 2300–1900 BC,5 and 27 of these wereassociated with bones that had not been burnt. Forty burials of remains whichhad not been cremated included various types of Food Vessel, which were in usec. 2200–1700 BC. Twenty-two of these 73 burials were recorded as ‘probableinhumations’ where no bone had survived in the cist or grave, and it is possiblethat cremated bones found in the corners of the cists at Dilston Park (Gibson1906) and at Haugh Head (Collingwood & Cowen 1948) shared these cists, whichwere the size of cists usually containing crouched burials, with one or moreburials that have not survived.Preparing the body for the grave6There are numerous finds of personal ornaments in Early Bronze Age burialsacross northern Europe suggesting that the dead were often buried dressed. InNorthumberland there are only a few cases where corpses were buried wearingpersonal ornamentation that survived to the time of recovery. Those objectswhich have survived indicate that some features of dress may have varied by ageand sex. However, as explained below, it does not appear that hierarchicalstatus categories were frequently marked out for the dead, and I would suggestthat we need to consider a range of explanations for the presence of all ‘gravegoods’, including that these were deployed as key symbols at various stages inthe funerary narrative. Here I consider each type of artefact individually.An assemblage including a gold basket-shaped ornament (probably a hair-clasp butsometimes seen as an ‘ear-ring’) was recovered from centre of Kirkhaugh barrow(Maryon 1936). The area where the artefacts were found was covered with earth,while cairn stones comprised the sides and the very top of the monumentsuggesting that the body was placed on the land surface, possibly in an organiccontainer (e.g. wooden coffin) which was then covered, largely with stone slabs(Fig. 3.2). This is unusual as almost all the other Northumbrian mortuarydeposits in the dataset were found in graves or cists cut into the ground. Whilepoor preservation might account for the absence of bodies in the fabric of otherbarrows, there are very few artefacts and no personal ornaments from suchlocations that might alert us to the presence of such bodies. Kirkhaugh is theonly confirmed example in the region of a Beaker burial with a complexassemblage of grave goods: a flint barbed and tanged arrowhead, six worked flintflakes, two flint cores and ‘a number of’ unworked flakes, a fragment of awhetstone, part of a flat sandstone rubber, and a nodule of iron pyrites, aswell as an All Over Cord decorated Beaker crushed under a large stone (Maryon1936: 211; Cowen 1966: 219–22; Tait 1965: 16). The flint ‘saw’ (Maryon 1936:215) is a fabricator, probably used along with the lump of iron pyrites as a‘strike-a-light’.7 The fabricator, the arrowhead, several of the flakes and oneof the cores are of same blue–grey mottled flint. Perhaps the flint objects wereknapped nearby and the debris buried along with the artefacts during thefuneral, or perhaps the deceased carried the flakes as ‘blanks’. Specialistanalysis concluded that 18 flint objects were struck from a single piece offlint in grave 203 at Barrow Hills, Oxfordshire (Brück 2004: 317–18). Thatburial was also accompanied by a nodule of iron pyrites. The production and useof such tools might have formed an important part of the funerary sequence, anda vital accompaniment for the deceased. At Kirkhaugh it could be inferred thatthe deceased was provided with the means to hunt and cook in the next stage ofexistence. The Kirkhaugh burial connects with a burial tradition that waswidespread yet rare across Britain c. 2500–2250 BC, and one which was notapplied extensively throughout society in Northumberland.[../images/fig3_2.jpg]Fig. 3.2. Section through the Kirkhaugh barrow (redrawn from Mryon 1936: 210 bySheila Severn Newton).The other notable example of personal ornamentation is a complete necklace of atleast 100 jet beads (4 barrel-shaped, 4 flattened barrel-shaped, 92 discoid)found in a cist at Blawearie (Greenwell 1877: 419–20; Kinnes & Longworth 1985:103). No bone survived, but from the size of the cist it seems likely that abody was deposited in a crouched position wearing this necklace. The Blawearienecklace appears to comprise a full set of matching beads, but incompletenecklaces and small numbers of beads or even single beads have been found inNorthumberland. John Barrett (1994: 121–22), Anne Woodward (2002), and AndrewJones (2002) have all argued that some necklaces from this period were broken upand only sections placed in graves or cists. They suggest that necklaces mightbe taken apart and restrung, combining parts from different original necklacesin ways that might trace or construct biographical relations between persons. Insome cases necklaces were composed from beads of differing materials, as atShrewton Barrow 5J in Wiltshire (Barrett 1994: 121–22), and Brück (2004: 314–16)describes how bone, jet, and amber beads from different necklaces playeddifferent roles in a funeral by cremation at Bedd Branwen burial H on Anglesey.No necklaces or collections of beads composed of differing materials have beenfound in Northumberland, but there are deposits with one or a small number ofbeads which require explanation. I return to the use of beads in cremationdeposits later, but one jet or shale bead was found at Well House Farm cist(Gates 1981) and eight shale beads were found with the unburnt bones of a‘woman’ (a mid-nineteenth century analysis) and what sounds like a flat rivetedblade at Angerton (Cowen 1966). At Kyloe cist the middle third of a jet necklacewas missing (50 barrel-shaped beads and six spacer plates were recovered) whileonly about half of the sherds from a Bowl Food Vessel were recovered from thiscist (Brewis 1928; Newman 1976). The cist was discovered and opened by workmenquarrying the site and the beads had to be collected from various people who hadtaken them from the site, so poor recovery seems likely to account for thepartial remains (the remains of the Bowl Food Vessel also show both fresh andold breaks).It is important to consider the preservation and recovery of jet objects becausethis issue clearly affects our interpretation of the frequency and value ofthese items, as well as whether necklaces were deliberately fragmented duringmortuary practices. Alison Sheridan and Mary Davis (2002: 822–23) have shownthat some spacer-plate jet necklaces are composed only partly of true jet, withadded beads of cannel coal, and suggest this resulted from a history of necklacecuration and repair. They suggest that jet necklaces were prestigious itemsexported across northern Britain. The beads were fairly fragile, and individualbeads might be lost or broken – when this happened they were replaced with beadsmade of local materials. The description of the (now lost) Angerton beadssuggest seven spacer plates and a v-perforated button (Cowen 1966: 227) andthese might either represent exotic jet fixtures of a necklace otherwisecomposed of more local organic elements which did not survive to recovery orpoor recovery in which smaller beads were missed. Jet can become friable andfragments could easily be missed during nineteenth and earlier twentieth centuryexcavations where sieving was not practiced. On the other hand, the (probablycomplete) jet necklace from Blawearie survived even though no human bone did,and finds of one or a very small number of smaller beads in a burial seemgenuine reflections of what was deposited: it would seem unlikely thattaphonomic processes have claimed an entire necklace bar one to four beads.While it remains possible that some necklaces were pulled apart during funeralsand only some of the beads accompanied the corpse to the grave, for deposits ofcremated bone some beads may have dropped through the pyre during cremation tobe collected up with the remains (Sheridan 2010). Other beads might have beenretained by the living, commemorating the deceased and linking them in chains ofcontinuing relationships. Alternatively the living might have donated beads fromtheir necklaces to the dead as a symbol of their loss (Fowler 2004: 72–76), ormight have burst necklaces apart at the graveside, from which some beads orsections fell into the grave.It is impossible to know the sex of the person buried with the Blawearienecklace as no bone survives and the other instances where jet beads accompaniedburials suffer similar problems with bone preservation. Yet in Scotland andYorkshire jet necklaces are clearly associated with female burials (Sheridan &Davis 2002: 816; Pierpoint 1980: 224, 228). Necklaces (of varying materials)were perhaps worn in producing a certain kind of adult female identity, orperhaps thought to have apotropaic effects relevant to women’s bodies – indeedjewellery may serve to symbolically protect people (e.g. the Beng use ofnecklaces, bracelets and other strings of beads on infants – Gottlieb 2004:113–15, inter alia). In studying Medieval burials, Gilchrist (2008) suggeststhat various objects accompanying the dead acted as amulets designed to cureills or protect bodies for their resurrection, while burning or consumingcrushed jet was believed to cure afflicted female bodies in the Roman Period(Allason-Jones 1996: 15). Dressing the dead in special materials might have beenintended to have protective effects rather than or as well as designating someparticular status.In five cases bodies were accompanied by v-perforated jet buttons. An adultwoman was buried in a cist at Lilburn South Steads (West Lilburn) with a largeShepherd type 6a button with beading at the edge as well as a bronzeknife-dagger and sherds from a Short-Necked Beaker (Collingwood et al. 1946;Shepherd 2009: 359). When discovered the bones and the vessel were alreadybroken. Two jet buttons (Shepherd type 1 and 2) were found with Beaker sherdsnext to a disturbed grave at Chatton Sandyford (Jobey 1968; Shepherd 2009: 358).No bone survived here. Three Food Vessel burials which had not been crematedincluded jet buttons: bone survived in two cases and one was identified in thenineteenth century as an adult male, the other as possibly an adult female(Greenwell 1872; 1877; Shepherd 2009: 358–59). V-perforated jet buttonspotentially had several uses: Shepherd (2009: 346–48) identifies examples ofdress fasteners (especially as a toggle on a loop of material), necklacefasteners (e.g. for necklaces made of organic materials), and pouch fasteners.Any of these options are possible for the Northumbrian examples, and theirposition with respect to the body was not recorded. Shepherd (2009) reports fourcases of sets of buttons ranging from six to 20, though not all of these wereproduced as sets: one of the six buttons from Rameldry, although all of similarsize and shape, was made not of jet like the others but of lizardite (not foundin Yorkshire). The six buttons show varied wear patterns. It is thereforepossible that the set was assembled over time during life or from differentdonors at the grave (Baker et al. 2003). While there are pairs inNorthumberland, there are no cases where sets of buttons survive, and it doesnot appear that these were showy ornaments woven into clothes in large number.It seems further possible – though this cannot be substantiated – that buttonswere used (or re-used) as toggles to tie a shroud or hide around the body. Abone pin accompanied some uncremated8 bones in a cist, and may have held ashroud in place or may have been a dress fitting. Worked calfskin scraps wererecovered from two burials (Doddington cist, and the coffin burial in a cist atCartington: Dixon 1913; Greenwell 1877: 411), but it is unclear whether thesewere from clothing, shrouds, body coverings or other items. Ashbee (1960: 93)identifies shrouds wrapping a small number of burials across Britain, mostly incases where log coffins have also survived. A recently-excavated cist atLangwell Farm, Strath Oykel, included the remains of a woman wrapped in a cowhide and accompanied by a rod of hazel and some basketry; the remains wereradiocarbon dated to c. 2200–1880 BC (Lelong 2012). If shrouds or coverings werepresent then bodies were secluded during pre-liminal rites before or as theywere placed in the grave, but even if these bodies were placed clothed in thegrave then they were ‘wrapped’ when deposited.It seems that the majority of bodies were prepared for the grave wearinggarments with organic fixtures or fixed with small, unostentatious pins andbuttons. Some wore necklaces, but token beads were perhaps tucked in with otherbodies or fell into the deceased’s clothing, shrouds or graves as mourners brokenecklaces. Beads and buttons were valued objects, but perhaps also had personal,magical/medical and/or historical value. The button at Lilburn South Steads islarger than average, and complete necklaces were probably very eye-catching.Personal ornaments may have been associated with membership of particular genderand age categories, and may potentially have carried implications about socialrelations with people from distant places. Such categories of things andpersons, and the extent of social differentiation probably varied during theperiod and within the region (Fowler 2013a: chapter 6 [13_Chapter06.html]).There are few signs of other kinds of personal ornaments or dress items foundelsewhere in Britain: for instance, no stone bracers, belt-rings or belt-hookshave been found in the region. In common with the rest of Britain, copper alloyaxeheads were not placed with the dead. Three mortuary deposits which wereexcluded from my database due to a poverty of contextual information includedpersonal ornaments: a jet spacer plate from a cist on Simonside, two bronzebracelets from a cairn on Cooper’s Hill, two gold basket-shaped ornaments from abarrow near Alnwick. There are also a small number of these sites whichcontained flint or bronze knives and/or arrowheads since lost, and there arestray finds of personal ornaments from the Bronze Age reported from the county,including two large amber beads or ‘terminals’ from Simonside (Cowen 1966), and13 gold beads from Redesdale, but these may not have come from mortuarycontexts. It is notable that all but one of the jet ornaments were found innorthern Northumberland where jet buttons were found in three north–southoriented cists (along with Food Vessels), and a jet necklace in a fourth, whilejet buttons are also associated with one of the north–south late Beaker gravesat Chatton Sandyford (see below). Indeed, only two cists contained jet artefactswithout being oriented north–south, and one of those was northeast–southwest.Thus, if these objects were associated with distant contacts and/or prestigethen such identities were focussed around the Milfield Basin in areas rich inrock carvings and overlooking approaches to a complex of henge monuments(particularly from the south).Not everyone was buried during the Early Bronze Age in Britain, and it ispossible that burial practices in some periods were mainly reserved for adultmen, begging the question of what form the funerary rites for women andchildren, as well as other men, took (Brück 2003: 181). In Northumberland, allthe Beaker burials likely to date before c. 2000/1950 BC where the age of theindividual was recorded were of adults with one exception (Bluebell Inn,Seahouses). While some cists where no bone was recovered were 60 cm long orless, making it difficult to see how they could have contained entire adult’sbodies, none of these contained Beakers dating to before c. 1950 BC. In the 17cases where the age of the individual is recorded for burials with Food Vesselsfive are subadults. No dress ornaments have been recovered with their remains,but the same can be said for the vast majority of all the burials in the region.In some cases there were different or further steps in the preparation of thebody before deposition and not all British Early Bronze Age mortuary practicesresulted in the burial of an intact dressed body (Petersen 1972; Fowler 2005;Gibson 2004; 2007). Aside from cremation and possibly the charring of alreadydecayed body parts or bones, British mortuary practices include the burial ofbodies probably in states of decay and/or the burial of body parts rather thancomplete bodies (e.g. Horsbrugh in Peeblesshire, see Petersen et al. 1974), and,as Gibson (2007: 57) convincingly illustrates, exposure of the corpse to theelements prior to burial which in many cases would be hard to detect. There arerelatively few cases in Northumberland where curation, manipulation ordeliberate fragmentation of corpse or skeleton can be conclusively demonstrated,but both the preservation conditions and the preconceptions of nineteenth andearlier twentieth century excavators that burials were of whole bodiesimmediately following death need to be taken into account here. Both of thesefactors are likely to influence our view of the numerous cases where partialremains or no remains were recovered from graves, and we tend to perceive theseby default as single burials. A small quantity of fragmented bones from twocists at Dilston Park were described as ‘partially burnt’ (Gibson 1906: 142),and may have resulted from cremation of bodies or from the burning of bones.Scorching on bones suggests that other burials were subjected to burning afterthe flesh had decayed naturally and reports of burnt stones and soils at othersites suggest that burning took place within the cist (Gamble & Fowler 2013a).In some cases this occurred before mounds covered the burials (Fowler 2013a:152–53) – this will be discussed below as a feature of liminal or post-liminalrites or later activity at mortuary sites. The few clear examples of bodilyfragmentation in the Northumbrian corpus could all result from laterintercession with the grave rather than initial preparation of the body, butdisarticulation or attrition of the body before deposition is equally possibleand it is worth considering one example here. Bones from the lower half of abody were found in a cist at Allerwash, Newborough; the pelvis was placed wherethe skull should be in a crouched burial, with a tibia to the east of it and theother bones to the west (Fig. 3.3). The excavators state ‘[o]nly the lower halfof the skeleton was deposited, and at a time when it was already in a skeletalcondition’ (Newman & Miket 1973: 92). Osteological re-analysis of these remainstentatively concurs that the remains were likely deposited after decayingelsewhere and reveals the individual is more likely male than, as originallythought, female (Gamble & Fowler 2013a: 52). This burial, like several wherebodily integrity was compromised, was accompanied by a bronze dagger.[../images/fig3_3.jpg]Fig. 3.3. Allerwash cist, Newborough (redrawn from Newan & Miket 1973: 89 bySheila Severn Newton).Choosing the location for burialEarly sites seem to have been mainly single, isolated, cists. In some casescemeteries of cists developed before 2000 BC, and towards c. 2000 BC newmonuments were not always built following each death. Instead, existing siteswere commonly re-used, though there are some examples of isolated cist burialsthat may date after 2000 BC. After c. 2250 BC it was seemingly acceptable tobury successive bodies at the same locale, potentially some time after it wasfirst marked with a burial. Where cists were found without mounds or other cistsin the immediate vicinity, 32 contained remains that had not been cremated whileonly two contained cremations. Cists and graves containing burials where theremains were not cremated had very wide distribution across the landscape,though many were close to rivers or streams (Fowler 2013a: chapter 5[12_Chapter05.html]). The choice of location for the grave did not simply relateto geographical features, but also to historically meaningful places,particularly after c. 2250 BC. Some were placed in cemeteries with previousburials, and others were deposited at pre-existing monuments, especially afterc. 2100 BC, perhaps suggesting that the act of deposition had come to conjointhe separation of the deceased from the living and their incorporation with thedead more visibly than before. In a couple of cases successive burials occurredin the same cist. For instance, a large cist with an oversized cover slab atDour Hill was the scene of two successive burials: the body of a child abouteleven years old interred with a Vase Food Vessel and a burnt hazelnut shell wasseverely disturbed and so decayed that only tooth fragments remained from theindividual. The second deposit yielded skull and mandible fragments from aninfant six to nine months old, and sherds from a Bowl Food Vessel (Jobey &Weyman 1977).[../images/fig3_4.jpg]Fig. 3.4. Chatton Sandyford kerbed cairn (redrawn from Jobey 1968: fig. 2 bySheila Severn Newton).Two sites in northern Northumberland exemplify the complex history of burialsequences in relation to monuments after c. 2250 BC (sequences which also ofteninclude cremation deposits): Chatton Sandyford (Jobey 1968) and Blawearie(Hewitt & Beckinsall 1996). At Chatton Sandyford (Fig. 3.4) stakes were driveninto the ground and burning resulted in a dense lens of charcoal at the centreof the area. A grave was cut and filled here, and while it was later robbed anS-profile globular Beaker (probably dating to c. 2050–1850 BC) and twov-perforated jet buttons were found in disturbance next to the grave. A deepergrave was cut next to this one and partly through its mound, and this gravecontained a similar Beaker, but no bones survived. A third grave was dug 2 m tothe southeast of these two – this was robbed also, but contained sherds of aBeaker which probably dates to c. 2250–1950 BC. All three burials were coveredwith a round cairn, which rested against a platform ring with kerb of flatslabs. This ring may have predated some or all of the aforementioned activities.Two cremation deposits were later inserted into the cairn. While the sequence ofdeposition between burials 1 and 2 and burial 3 is unclear, the location waschosen repeatedly for burial and mound construction, forming a circumscribedcommunity of the dead.[../images/fig3_5.jpg]Fig. 3.5. Blawearie kerbed cairn (redrawn from Hewitt & Beckinsall 1996: 261 bySheila Severn Newton).At Blawearie (Fig. 3.5) a pit was dug, perhaps to remove the stump of a tree,and a second pit was of a size and shape to hold a large post. A kerbed roundcairn was constructed with this feature at its centre, creating a circularenclosure. Later (according to the excavators, though it seems equally possiblethat this predated the construction of the cairn) a pit was dug through thecentral pit and a cist inserted. Three of five later cists, one of whichcontained the jet necklace discussed earlier and a flint knife, another of whichheld a Vase Food Vessel, were built using slabs removed from the kerb of thecairn. Kerbstones were removed from the southwest of the kerb. A pit excavatedin the gap contained charcoal and burnt bone, and its sides were a strong redcolour, suggesting this was the scene of a cremation pyre or that bone was burntwithin this pit (cf. Gibson 2007: 58), and was then capped by a low cairn. Thus,while the construction of the kerb and cairn might have followed an initialcentral burial, the majority of deposition at the site involved later return toand alteration of a historically meaningful place. Furthermore, the place chosenfor the earliest burial may already have had specific meaning – the excavatorsargue that a large tree had stood in the area of the cairn and oak charcoal wasstrewn across the centre of the site before the first pits were dug (cf. thelocation of a ring ditch around a tree and the eventual location of Raundsbarrow 6 over the area centred on the tree (Harding & Healy 2007: 213–14)). AtBlawearie, the aggregation of a community of the dead within a stone kerb partlyfragmented that kerb, and deployed those kerb-stones in building containers forthe dead. The kerb was initially a boundary, perhaps circumscribing liminaltransformations. Fragments of the kerb connected the dead with one another andwith the kerb, simultaneously ending the pre-liminal phase of the mortuary ritefor those burials and setting up conditions for the reincorporation of thedeceased into a community of the dead in a post-liminal phase. Over time thesite itself moved from a place of liminal transformation to a locale associatedwith the transformed, ancestral dead.Both of these sites have a complex history, and burying the dead was only oneelement in that history. The pre-liminal rites therefore situated the deceasedin time and space before their liminal transformation, and increasingly thistime and place was relative to other dead persons and elaborate architecture.Owoc (2001; 2005) has suggested that cairns and barrows can be understood asprojects that incorporated human remains alongside other materials within a setof cosmologically sanctioned principles, rather than simply as mortuarymonuments (cf. chapters in Last 2007). While I focus here on the funeraryprocess, I agree with Owoc’s suggestion that funerals need to be put in abroader context of activity. For instance, at Chatton Sandyford the creation ofa cairn or barrow closed off the dead, but each grave had already been capped,suggesting that the cairn construction was part of some other narrativestructure encompassing these burials. One aspect of that narrative might havebeen the post-liminal reincorporation of the dead (collectively) into acommunity of the ancestral dead. This happened sometime after each of the firsttwo burials was covered with a cairn that separated them from the living, endinga phase in the funerary sequence. It is also possible that the architecture ofthese sites related to a particular (circular and cyclical) model of the cosmos.Thus, the narrative related individual death and mortuary transformation with agrowing sense of communal ancestry. While this may have supported the claims toimportance by certain lineages or other groups within the community, the overallnarrative is rather different from one concerned with the expression ofindividual power and status that archaeologists have often perceived whendescribing Early Bronze Age burials (cf. Brück 2004; Fowler 2005).Preparing the grave for the bodyThroughout Northumberland almost all of the cists were dug into the earth ratherthan free-standing, and far more cists are known than graves. Cist burials firstappeared early on in the sequence, probably before 2300 BC, developingcontemporaneously with the same practice across eastern Scotland – such ‘shortcists’ are far rarer in Yorkshire than in the northeast of England. The cistsare indeed short – most are between 0.80 m and 1.20 m in length – requiringthose burying the dead to squeeze them into place. The paving of cist floorsvaried: two were paved with pebbles – in one case these were embedded in clay. Aclay floor was found in another cist, while clay was also used to seal the joinsbetween slabs in at least five cists all of which were located fairly near toburns or rivers; three of these cists yielded preserved bronze knives/daggers,and if the clay joint lining had enhanced preservation in these cases this mightsuggest that more blades were buried than have survived. A bedding (or perhapswrapping?) of rushes was found in the Allerwash cist, and a layer of bracken wasrecovered in the Cartington coffin. In most cases, therefore, the grave wasclearly designed to encase the dead in stone and earth, and possibly wrap themin other materials, and place them below the level of the land-surface.Table 3.1. The orientation of cists and grave pits containing Beakers (n = 19)and Food Vessels (n = 20) in Northumberland. Beakers likely to post-date 1950 BCare marked *[../images/table3_1.jpg]Ten out of the 19 Beaker graves and cists where orientation was recorded wereoriented east–west (see Table 3.1), all of them dating to c. 2300–1950 BC, whilethree of the four Beaker burials where orientation is recorded that can beidentified on a typological basis as later than this exhibit other orientations.For Food Vessel burials eastwest orientations were favoured but north–south andnortheast–southwest and northwest–southeast orientations are also evident. Ingeneral, we could suggest that cist orientation varied more by period than bystyle of vessel, though we currently lack a firm enough chronology for FoodVessels to test this. Some variation may also relate to the practices oflocalised kin groups: all of the 14 cists and graves oriented north–south lie inthe north of the county. Pierpoint (1980: 247–48) also noticed regional patternsfor the placement of bodies in Food Vessel burials in Yorkshire.Placing the body in the graveConditions of preservation may mean that graves or bodies placed on the groundand then covered with barrows may have been overlooked in previous excavations,and it is also likely (based on the numbers found) that many of the dead werenot buried at all. But where we find burials, it appears that the dead were laidinto very small graves and short cists, usually crouched in an almost foetalposition. Of the 53 cases where uncremated human remains were recovered, 20 werespecifically described as crouched burials and the dimensions of the graves andcists suggests this was the case for the vast majority of the remains that werenot cremated prior to deposition.While most Beaker burials were laid on an east–west axis some were placed withheads to the east and some to the west. Burials with Beakers typologicallyidentified as being later than c. 2250 BC or with Food Vessels exhibited apreference for heads placed to the west end of the grave (see Table 3.2). Amongthe crouched burials where the bone was preserved and the placement of theBeaker was recorded, there was a preference for placing Beakers near to thehead. The number of recorded instances where the sex of the remains and theplacement of Beaker are recorded is only three, but the Beaker was placed behindthe head for two females and in front of the face for one male. Within the smallnumber of Food Vessel burials, for which accurate information on bodily positionand object location exists, three adult males lay with their heads to the westand a vessel near the head, while the only female for which information existsshares the orientation, but the vessel was placed at her feet. AlexandraTuckwell’s (1970; 1975) analysis of artefact positioning in East Yorkshiregraves, which deploys a far larger dataset, suggests that ceramics were mostlyplaced around the head, but she was unable to connect any patterns with sexualdifferentiation.Overall, crouched burials were most often positioned so as to face south in thegrave, whether the head lay to the east with the body lying on its left side(which seems to be more common for earlier burials) or to the west with the bodylying on its right side (as is more common in later burials). A southeasterlyorientation to the face accords with the direction of the sunrise during thepart of the year including the winter months and southwest to winter sunsets,while south is the position which gets most sun for most of any day. The deadwere arguably oriented with respect to these events, though in differing ways.While there is insufficient evidence for an analysis of difference inorientation by sex, such patterns as can be detected may be parallel with adistinction between male and female noted in Yorkshire, Aberdeenshire, and eastcentral Scotland (Tuckwell 1975: 101–2; Shepherd 1989; Wilkin 2009: 39–40). Thisdivision is, however, set within the larger pattern of shared orientation of theface to the south in each region.Table 3.2. Details of the orientation of the body in the grave, grave goods andside that the body was placed on where recorded, showing details of sex whereidentified (all are adults)[../images/table3_2.jpg]While most of the dead were provided with vessels, some were interred with otherobjects. Two women were interred with bronze blades (knife-daggers9) as werethree males (two flat riveted blades, one flat riveted knife-dagger), and threewith bodies for which sex was not identifiable. Some of the human remains buriedwith copper alloy daggers,10 show signs of attrition or disturbance. I havealready discussed the Allerwash partial burial. At Reaverhill cist only some ofthe bones of an adult male were recovered along with a bronze flat riveted blade– the site had been disturbed, though it is not clear when (Jobey et al. 1965:66), and some of the bones were scorched (Gamble & Fowler 2013a: 55–6). AtBowchester (Humbleton Farm) the individual buried with a flat riveted daggerexhibited two lesions through the parietal bone, with the jaw and left femuralso showing signs of disease (Short 1931). A body interred in North Charltoncist 2 was described as having a dagger lying on its chest (Tate 1891). Theseblades may or may not have been personal possessions of the deceased, but insome cases could also be artefacts placed in the grave during the separation ofthe dead from the living at the end of the pre-liminal phase of the ritual. Inother words, knives cut away the dead from the living. In other cases they mayhave been introduced during a later intercession with the body – perhaps if thefuneral was not considered sufficiently effective in severing ties with theliving and transforming the dead. In such cases they may have been effective inending the liminal phase of mortuary transformation.Scrapers were found with five burials and a cluster of four scrapers was foundnear to a further cist. The only sexed remains to be found with a scraper (twoscrapers, in fact, along with a Short-Necked Beaker (probably c. 2300–2100 BC)and five flint flakes) was a female buried in The Sneep cist (Hedley 1892).Scrapers may be used in working hides, and if hides were prepared to cover orshroud the dead, then these tools could have been associated with the mortuaryrite. Fragmented objects and materials were found in some graves: for instance,flint fragments were found with 13 burials. In four of these cases flintfragments accompanied flint knives or scrapers and could potentially be seen aswaste from artefact production on site, though this requires further analysis.In Cartington cist, a body was either dressed in stitched calfskin or kidskingarments or possibly ‘wrapped in the skin of a kid or calf’ (Grinsell 1953: 250)and placed in a crouched position on a layer of bracken in a log coffin(radiocarbon dated to 2340–2060 BC: Jobey 1984) along with sherds from a Beaker,a scraper and some flint fragments (Dixon 1913: 81–82). The coffin was loweredinto a cist which was then covered with ‘a course of arches’ and a stone cairn(Dixon 1913: 81). This deposit illustrates successive episodes of concealment orcontainment from wrapping the body in hide clothing or a shroud to placement ina shaped log coffin, lowering it into and sealing a stone chamber, and theerection of a cairn. In the process the body of the deceased was incrementallyremoved from contact with the living – but as the body became hidden from themthe deceased was presenced in the landscape through the capping stone cairntowards the end of the funerary sequence.There are a couple of cases where multiple bodies might have been buried in thesame feature at the same time, where bodies were added to existing graves (as atDour Hill, discussed above), or where bones from another body seem to have beenburied along with a corpse. The two cists at Dilston Park contained two andthree Beakers respectively with some partially burnt bone, while at Haugh Head aVase Food Vessel was tucked away in the northeast corner of the 1 m longeast–west oriented cist with two scraps of cremated bone. In these cases thecists were all large enough for crouched burials, and it is possible that theburnt bone accompanied uncremated remains which have since decayed. AtGrundstone Law a cist contained incomplete sets of bones from two bodies(Greenwell & Embleton 1862). A third body was laid out on the cover of the cistwhich was covered by a barrow – it is possible that some of the bones from thisindividual had intruded into the cist so it is difficult to confirm multipleburial, but the presence of the two bodies confirms at least successive burialand the burial in the cist reads as though it was not an intact body wheninterred. Thus, some bodies might have been laid out with parts of others andprojected together towards their post-liminal incorporation into a community ofthe dead.Ending the act of depositionThe bodies of the dead were perhaps on display in their grave or cist for aperiod of time, but graves were filled in and cists were covered with largestone slabs, secluding the dead. Earlier burials in cists were rarely coveredwith earth, sand or other similar materials, and the bodies were sealed in placesimply with a cover slab. Later burials, after c. 2150 BC, were more commonlyimmersed in the earth as cists were more often backfilled, again concealing thebodies and setting up different conditions for bodily transformation (Fowler2013a: chapter 6 [13_Chapter06.html]). In at least ten cases an episode ofburning occurred before a cist or grave containing a burial which had not beencremated was sealed. For instance, burnt planks covering burials are suggestedin two probable grave pits at Milfield North henge (Harding 1981), while atHowick cist 4 a ‘burnt residue’ was attached to the underside of the cover slaband the fill included reddened clay and charcoal (Waddington et al. 2005: 77),while several other excavators refer to fire-cracked stones, black soil and/orcharcoal in cists that either contained burials that had not been cremated orwhere no bone survived, and some of these were sealed by mounds in the EarlyBronze Age (Fowler 2013a: 152–53). Cists were typically capped with a singlelarge flat slab, finally secluding the deceased: between the heavy cover and thetight fit of the body in the cist, the burial architecture gives the impressionof holding the dead in place and preventing any possibility of their moving fromthat position. Indeed, cists (and cairns) might be interpreted as technologiesdevised to keep the dead in place, while also allowing for the potential tore-examine or remove the remains if necessary. Cist pits were backfilled withstones and earth. At Low Trewitt North Moor and Well House Farm cist thesestones and earth seem to have been burnt (Bate 1912; Gates 1981). Many cistswere covered with low mounds of stone, perhaps after an intervening period.Between the closing of the cist and the construction of the cairn at Dour Hillthe soil around the cist was burnt (Jobey & Weyman 1977: 204). If the earlierstages of the ritual involved some display of the dead, later phases involvedseclusion and separation, perhaps successive episodes of containment, andsometimes the severing of the dead from the living through various meansincluding knives and fire. These activities repeatedly and gradually separatedthe dead from the living at the onset and perhaps sometimes the conclusion ofthe liminal phase of the mortuary process.Returning to the grave?The possibility to monitor the remains of the dead was provided by burying themin cists with cover slabs and while it is difficult to say whether the dead wereexamined in this way, there are few instances where remains were interferedwith. Successive deposition was rare. As noted above, some of the dagger gravesshow signs of disturbance to the human remains within. Two of the long-bonesfrom the adult female body in the Lilburn South Steads cist were splitlongitudinally when found and the excavators report that the contents of thecist were jumbled up and the bones out of their correct anatomical positions(Collingwood & Cowen et al. 1946). The fact that no small bones were recoveredat Allerwash favours the interpretation that the remains were partial whendeposited, rather than that bones were removed from the grave (Gamble & Fowler2013a) – though it is possible that this was a ‘reburial’ of bones from anothergrave site. If bodies were secluded and their transformation was hidden ordeferred through the act of burial, then returning to a grave and intercedingwith the dead might have formed a special final phase in a mortuary processrestricted to only a few, or beliefs about certain events might have led peopleto return to graves in special cases.Mortuary rites involving the interment of cremated human remainsI now want to consider the mortuary rites surrounding deposits of burnt orcremated bone. It seems that the deposition of cremated remains did not occurfrequently between c. 2500 and c. 2250 BC. This does not mean that no cremationstook place, but that cremated bones were not usually deposited in cists orgraves nor even inserted into cairns or mounds during this period. Furtherdating is needed to know exactly when cremation deposition with Food Vesselsbegan in the region but it is possible this was contemporary with crouchedburials from either as early as c. 2250 BC or as late as c. 2100 BC. Cremationdeposits associated with various types of Food Vessel in the region have beenradiocarbon dated to from c. 2000–c. 1700 BC, while examples with reliable datesfrom Scotland and Yorkshire suggest that Food Vessels were current there from c.2200–2150 BC to c. 1700–1600 BC (see Sheridan 2004; 2007b).11 Collared Urndeposits have been dated to c. 2000–c. 1500 BC. Thirty-five cremation depositsfrom my study sample were interred with Food Vessels of various kinds, 13 withCollared Urns (two also with Accessory Vessels), three with Accessory Vesselsonly, and two with Cordoned Urns (both of which contained the remains ofchildren). Ceramic vessels were not present with 57 collections of crematedremains, though organic containers can be deduced from accounts of some ofthese. Six unurned cremation deposits have been dated and all of these are frombetween c. 2000 and c. 1600 BC, but it may be that some of the others not placedin cists date from the Middle Bronze Age (Brück, pers. comm.). Cists seem tohave housed cremated remains with or without vessels c. 2100–1750 BC (Fowler2013a: 155–59), after which cists were seldom constructed. It is interesting tocompare this continuity in the use of cists for both ‘inhumations’ andcremations with Middle Bronze Age central Europe, where there are examples ofcremated bones and grave goods laid out horizontally within graves in the sameway as earlier unburnt burials had been (Sørensen & Rebay 2008). Crematedremains do not seem to have been ‘laid out’ in this way in Northumberland, butthe use of short cists did endure for some time before giving way to the use ofround pits, some of which were lined with stone.There are important differences in the process, experience and result ofcremating the dead compared with burying an intact body, but despite thesedifferences, I will illustrate that similarities between cremation and‘inhumation’ rites were maintained in several ways. I will also illustrate thatthe shift to cremation was one part of an ongoing long-term process oftransformation in funerary practices that took place throughout the Early BronzeAge in the region and which increasingly combined the remains of the dead in thesame locale.Preparing the body for the pyreIt is possible that bodies were prepared for the pyre in a similar way to thoseprepared for the grave. Jet burns like coal so necklaces or buttons attached tothe body would largely be destroyed by a pyre (Sheridan, pers. comm.), and it ispossible that jet ornaments were more numerous than the surviving evidence wouldsuggest. While this does not diminish the fact that the raw material onlyoriginates in a small part of Yorkshire, and it seems very likely that jet washighly sought after, it may not be the case that wearing jet necklaces marked aparticular hierarchical status in Northumberland. If we envisage jet items asprestigious gifts we also need to remember that such prestige goods can bewidespread in communities using them, particularly where they are emblematic ofachieving an adult gendered identity.Bone pins were found burnt and broken in seven cases and one bronze pin or awlfragment was found. The pins may have fastened shrouds and/or garments. Otherobjects passed through the pyre: two flint knives were recorded as burnt, one ormore burnt flint fragments were described in nine cases, and a damagedbarbed-and-tanged arrowhead was found with the cremated remains of a 2–3 yearold child at Cheviot Walk Wood (Stopford et al. 1985: 123). The child wouldobviously not have been able to use this item: it may have been a gift and/or anemblem of a desired identity for the dead in a way comparable to the adult-sizedrings deposited with a 4–5 year old child at grave 919 in Barrow Hills,Oxfordshire (Brück 2004: 314). It is also possible that it had been shot intothe infant.Cremating the bodyThere is at present little information on Northumbrian Early Bronze Agecremation technology. Records of the types of wood used are scarce, though theyinclude ash, oak, cherry and hazel. Where such information is recorded someremains are described as thoroughly cremated, while others are described asscorched and blackened or poorly cremated. Cremation would have been a vivid anddramatic event (Downes 1999; Williams 2004), which transformed the body in avery visible and tangible way. As van Gennep points out, cremation rapidlydissolves the body and separates out different aspects of the person in an actthat separates the living from the dead but also different elements of the deadperson from each other: ‘[a]s for the destruction of the corpse itself (bycremation, premature putrefaction, etc.), its purpose is to separate thecomponents, the various bodies and souls’ (van Gennep 1960: 164). As Jane Downes(1999; 2005) has discussed, bodily materials are dramatically transformed andredistributed in the world through cremation practices. The soft components ofthe body are burnt away, sending elements of the person up into the sky assmoke. Bones may also be partially reduced to ash, and (where depositionoccurred) remaining bones were collected up in baskets, bags, boxes, or pots anddeposited in the earth. Thus, cremation divided up the body and directed bodilysubstances to different places. Cremation also transformed the dead corpse tocleaned bone rapidly, making the transformation of the dead visible much morequickly than with a crouched burial. It is possible, however, that bodies wereburnt some time after death (as suggested for one of the cremations atHorsburgh, Peebleshire: Petersen et al. 1974), and it is equally possible forbodies to be curated for some time prior to burial so neither processnecessarily involves a different duration in the mortuary process. While theexperience of cremation is clearly different to that of burial withoutcremation, the significance of this difference may lie in more in the memoriesand experiences of the living than in differing beliefs about the fate of thedead. It is also worth considering that, as Gibson (2007: 58) points out, thecremation of entire bodies on pyres is not the only way that ‘cremated’ bonemight enter the archaeological record: for instance, body parts or defleshedbones might be burnt within pits. But in most cases in Northumberland sufficientcombinations of bones and/or quantity of bone have been recovered to suggest thecremation of a relatively intact body.Collecting the remains and combining cremated bonesThe act of cremation might radically transform the body, finally separating thefleshed body of the deceased from the living, but further transformationsfollowed in cases where the bones of the deceased were interred in the ground.Charcoal was found along with bone among most cremations, so pyre debris was notcarefully sifted out from the bones during the collection of remains. A varietyof vessels were used to hold the bones and convey them to the grave. Almost allof the 35 Food Vessels found with cremated bones originally contained ratherthan just accompanied bones.Five Food Vessels held what were definitely the mixed remains of twoindividuals, and four of these were Enlarged Food Vessel Urns, or Vase Urns.Three of the 15 deposits with Collared Urns definitely held the cremated bonesof more than one individual. One cist (Spital Hill cairn 7 cist 2) containedcremated remains from more than one individual along with fire-reddened soil andfire-cracked stones, suggesting the burial of the remains of a nearby pyre(Dixon 1892: 27–29). Some pyre sites were probably used for several cremations,and some bones left behind from earlier cremations were scooped up when bonesfrom a later cremation were being collected. This may account for why only onefragment of 1 kg of cremated bone from Blawearie cairn 1 cist E was identifiedas from a child, while the rest was attributed to an adult (Hewitt & Beckensall1996: 268), for instance, though other explanations are possible (e.g. that thechild’s bone was curated by the adult prior to death). Differences in the colourand condition of cremated bones within a single deposit may suggest comminglingof bones from successive cremations, though these need not have taken place atthe same locale: for instance, the scorched and blackened bones of an adult incremation deposit 4 at Cheviot Walk Wood can be distinguished from thewell-cremated bones of a child in the same deposit (Stopford et al. 1985: 122).By contrast, the cremated bones from three adults and a child found in aCollared Urn at Kirkhill were ‘well intermixed when deposited in the urn’(Barlow & Wright in Miket 1974: 186): the four bodies might have been crematedtogether, or the bones from four separate cremations might have been broughttogether and commingled. Thirteen of the 21 multiple cremation deposits combinedadult and child remains, but as Petersen et al. (1974: 49) warn it would be mucheasier for excavators to detect this combination than the remains of more thanone child, or more than one adult. Thus, this pattern suggests the number ofmultiple cremation deposits is likely to be higher than has been recorded,rather than that the bones of children and adults were most often combinedduring or after cremation. Nonetheless, we can consider the kinds ofrelationships between two or more people whose bones shared a single urn –perhaps the connections between their bodies were more significant than theboundaries between them. The fact that multiple cremation deposits are far morecommon than multiple ‘inhumations’ also bolsters the idea that communities ofthe dead became more nucleated throughout the period. It may even suggest thatthe reincorporation of the deceased into a community of the dead was somethingthat began before burial occurred.It is hard to say how often some bones were deliberately left out of urns, orsets of bones divided up and deposited in more than one location, or how pyredebris was treated. Brück (2003; 2006) has suggested that cremated bones mighthave been split up and portions taken by different groups of mourners. This iscertainly possible though it would be extremely difficult to detect in theNorthumbrian corpus. The use of pyre debris – such as that found at Turf KnoweNorth (McKinley 1998) – also provides a potential avenue of future research(McKinley 1997; Downes 2005), but was often overlooked in past excavations.While Collared Urns frequently contained objects along with human remains, mostFood Vessel Urns did not (those that did most commonly held flint knives), whileEnlarged Food Vessel Urns never contained artefacts. Not all of the items placedin the urns were burnt, and some deposits were accompanied by other unburntobjects. In five cases where a flint knife accompanied cremated remains – and abone knife at Middle Gunnar Peak – it had clearly not been burnt. A flint knifewas found within the top of a layer of bones in an ‘urn’ at Spital Hill cairn 7cremation deposit 1 (Dixon 1892: 28). These knives were seemingly added afterthe dead had been transformed, after the remains had been gathered and eitherbefore they were deposited or, as seems likely for burials that were notcremated, during the act of deposition or terminating the deposition of remainsand marking the point at which those remains were covered up and removed fromany further contact. I would suggest that the addition of these knives after thebody was processed illustrates a similarity with ‘inhumation’ deposits,indicating a trend which continued throughout the period: knives or daggers cutaway the dead and/or were presented with the deceased towards whatever entitiesoversaw their incorporation into a community of the dead. While it can only bespeculation, it is possible that the burnt knives (and any bronze knives whichdid not survive the pyre) were also placed with the dead immediately prior tocremation, again as part of a ritual severing of the dead from the living.Selecting place of cremation and/or depositionWhile some cremation deposits were isolated burials covered with their owncairns, as at Birkside Fell (Tolan-Smith 2005), and some became the firstdeposit at a site that attracted further deposition of cremated remains, themajority of cremation deposits were placed at sites which had seen previousdeposition and were often inserted into existing cairns and barrows, at hengemonuments, or in pits or cists alongside other pits or cists in cemeteries. Someof these were cut into natural knolls as at Pace Hill (Stopford et al. 1985),while at Goatscrag cremations, two within Enlarged Food Vessel Urns, were buriedin a rock shelter (Burgess 1972). Most of the cairns and barrows containingcremation deposits show a complex history of use and re-use. For instance, atPitland Hills barrow 1 the barrow was a complex, possibly multi-phaseconstruction which covered a rock-cut cist with a crouched burial accompanied bya hammer-stone and Vase Food Vessel and a second grave with no surviving remainsor finds. Between these two cists were found a number of cup-marked stones. Theexcavator wrote ‘… where most of the cup-incised stones were found, the fires ofcremation and of the funeral feast had raged with great fierceness’ (Rome Hall1887: 280), and it was here that two cremation deposits, one child and oneadult, were found. The barrow yielded 17 cup-marked stones in total which mighthave been deposited in commemorative activities, perhaps involving moundconstruction, and/or as part of one or more funerals.Depositing the remainsFood Vessels containing cremated bones were largely recovered from cists andoccasionally in pits, some inverted, some upright. In one case a cremationdeposit in a Food Vessel at Pace Hill was accompanied by a jet necklace(Stopford et al. 1985: 125–26), of which Greenwell (1868: 196 n) writes ‘… anecklace of jet beads, of varied form, was found strung around the neck of anurn…’, while at Ford three jet beads and a jet button (Shepherd type 2) werefound near the rim of a Collared Urn containing the cremated bones of an adult(possibly female) and a burnt flint knife. Here necklaces, or parts of them,were placed around the neck of the urn, suggesting a conceptual equivalencebetween the human body and the vessel, which I return to below. Enlarged FoodVessel Urns are rare (only seven have been found), but exhibit a veryspecialised pattern of usage: all were placed, upside down, in pits at naturalplaces (rock outcrop, rock shelter) or within cairns and in one case on top ofan existing cist, but never in cists. Collared Urns were buried either invertedor upright in cists or pits. The shift from cists to burial only in urns likethese may result from a growing sense that the cremation itself, and containmentin the vessel, were sufficient to separate the dead from the living during andat the end of the liminal rites, and lend credence to the idea that depositionhad by now become a feature of post-liminal incorporation.Not all cremation deposits were contained in pots. Some heaps or tight dumps ofbone were probably placed in baskets, bags or other organic containers.Fifty-six (or 66%) of all mortuary deposits at cairns and barrows were locatedin the southerly quadrant of the site (i.e. between southeast and southwest),and 42 of these southerly deposits were cremations. Of these, 30 did not includeany ceramics. Thus, those remains not contained with a hard skin were especiallylikely to be placed in a southerly direction, which I would describe as anauspicious direction for the dead throughout the period due the shared choice ofthe south as the most common direction that bodies were laid to face in crouchedburials. The emphasis on the south continued well into the later part of theEarly Bronze Age with Collared Urn and Cordoned Urn cremation deposits fromcairns lying either at the centre of the site or in the southerly quadrant, andit is possible that at least some of the 30 unurned deposits date to even laterin the Bronze Age where the southerly quadrant of barrows were commonly used formortuary deposition (Ashbee 1960: 84–85; Brück pers. comm.). Locations fordeposition were therefore carefully chosen for cremated remains just as bodilyposition was meaningful for crouched burials, and according to a continuousfocus on southerly direction.Ending the act of depositionThe act of deposition often ended in a similar way as it had for ‘inhumations’,with the construction of a cairn or replacement of earth or stones over theburial deposit. Symbolic media of separation were sometimes also deployedtowards the end of the act of deposition. At Gains Law boulders covered the cistand a flint knife was found within this covering layer. At Birkside Fell a burntor burning plank of wood was placed over the mouth of the Collared Urn in a pitcontaining remains from two adults (Tolan-Smith 2005; Fig. 3.6). A cairn thencovered this. Cremated remains often accumulated at a site so that those cairnsand barrows over c. 3 m in diameter covered and attracted multiple deposits, andthe remains of one body seldom remained isolated from those of others. While insome cases pyre debris suggests that deposition immediately followed a localcremation, in other cases acts of deposition might be separated from the funeralby days or years, and monuments may have acted as foci for interactions with thelong dead, including via votive offerings of the cremated bone of the recentlydeceased.What changed, and what remained the same?What are the long-term patterns that we can deduce from these mortuary deposits?During the earlier part of the period rules of deposition were rigid, typifiedby infrequent, single and isolated Beaker burials, mainly of adults. From c.2250 BC to 1900 or perhaps 1800 BC there was greater diversity in mortuarypractices that ended in the deposition of remains: cists or graves exhibited awider variety of orientations with some local variation and some change overtime away from the predominance of east–west burial, children appear morefrequently in the burial record, and both cremated and unburnt bones weredeposited. Smaller cists were more common after c. 2150 BC, as were cistsbackfilled with soil. Cremation, which had perhaps been practiced during theearlier part of the period but not followed by deposition of remains, wasincreasingly applied to bodies that would then also receive burials in cists; ina rare case at Low Hauxley cremated remains in a cist were accompanied by aBeaker, and radiocarbon dating indicates this took place some time between 2010and 1875 BC (Waddington 2010). Cremation deposits were also placed in or withFood Vessels, perhaps from c. 2150 BC. Eventually during the early secondmillennium cists were abandoned, and urns containing the dead were enlarged.Within the diversity, then, there were chronologically and regionally distinctpatterns – such as the emergence of north–south burials in northernNorthumberland after c. 2200 BC – and even some rigid orthodoxies such as thespecific rules about placement of and the containment of cremated bone andartefacts in Enlarged Urn Food Vessels. It is possible that the change inemphasis from ‘inhumation’ to cremation took place quickly some time between2100 and 1900 BC, but there are examples of cremation and ‘inhumation’ fromthroughout that period and probably even later. There is a clear trend towardsthe nucleation of the dead after 2250 BC and especially between 2000 and 1700BC: first at cemeteries, cairns and barrows, and later by combining the remainsof the dead in single features or deposits. Some trends in the presentation andtransformation of the dead continued even when others changed. Funerals areorganised according to cosmological principles, and we can see some of theseprinciples forming a thread throughout most of the period, despite the changesoutlined here. In what follows I shall interpret these and other changesoutlined earlier in the chapter in terms of continuing yet mutating cosmologicalprinciples applied to understanding bodies, persons, and communities duringmortuary transformations. I will argue for sporadic but relatively gradualchange in varying aspects of mortuary rites through much of the period, andconsider the implications for the duration and nature of the liminal phase ofmortuary rites and the changing effects of post-liminal rites in particular.[../images/fig3_6.jpg]Fig. 3.6 Birkside Fell kerbed cairn: the location of cremation deposit; theCollared Urn cremation deposit in situ (redrawn from Tolan-Smith 2005: 58–60 bySheila Severn Newton).Why deposit human remains?In understanding these changes we need to ask a vital question: why bury theremains of the dead at all? In this chapter I have adopted the conventionalstance that most – if not necessarily all – of these deposits were produced asparts of funerals, but that does not explain why some were buried while otherswere not. As Gibson (2004; 2007) puts it, Beaker burials provide a ‘veneer’ tothe broader mortuary practices of much of the period many of which did notinvolve burying human remains. While I do not doubt that many more burials tookplace than have survived to be recovered so far, it seems likely that otherpeople must have died and had funerals but their remains were not buried.Thus, we need to explain the rather unusual activity of depositing theseremains, and consider whether differing explanations might best fit the evidencefrom different parts of the period. Conventionally, accounts of the period arguethat those buried were the social elites, though exactly what privileges (beyondsometimes acquiring objects with distant origins), roles, duties, andresponsibilities characterised those elites is seldom discussed. Rather thanbeing persons of high status in a hierarchical sense, we can envisage variouspossibilities for adults buried with Beakers before 2250 BC and perhaps some ofthose who remains were deposited from c. 2250 to 1500 BC. They might, forinstance, have held a specific social and/or religious role within the community(e.g. a role of guardianship), they might have followed a particular religion orsocial code (potentially entwined with a distinct sense of their origins oraffinities) and/or they might have been perceived as attaining a position ofancestry as they had children who reached adulthood before they died. Indeed,perhaps some cremated remains were only deposited after it was deemed that astate of ancestry had been attained, even if that was some time after the deathof the individual. Another possibility is that certain causes of death (bydisease or violence or deaths that were sudden and unexplained) rather thancertain identities necessitated the burial of bodies or purified bones – themost disturbing deaths requiring the deposition of the remains in elaborateceremonies, perhaps. Humphrey Case (2004: 204) offers a further interestingsuggestion: that burials were part of a ‘dialogue between the living and thedead’ in which the community were at pains ‘… to assert their participation inactivities desirable for the wellbeing of the group both living and dead…’.Although Case’s emphasis on single burials as celebrations of individualidentity for those of ‘elite’ status does not sit well with much of theNorthumbrian evidence, his argument that the concerns of the living can be seenin the treatment of the dead is extremely useful and I think that we can tracethose concerns through funerary practices in the Northumbrian Early Bronze Age.Before c. 2200 BC the dead were separated from the living during the act ofburial, and were often left isolated from the remains of other dead persons.Between c. 2200 and c. 2000 BC it was more likely that the dead were buried in alocale alongside the remains of other people, or that their remains would soonbe joined by others. The physical incorporation of the dead into a localcommunity was increasingly apparent. During this period and for centuries tofollow the components of the dead body were increasingly separated out, as wellas separated from the living, through the act of cremation. Cremation itself wasprobably a feature of the liminal phase of the rite of passage, transforming thebody and the person. Deposition may have become associated with thereincorporation of the dead into a new community, part of a post-liminal phaseof activity. This may have been so too for the earlier isolated crouchedburials, but these people were not incorporated into a local and physicalcommunity of the dead. Indeed, it is possible that post-liminal rites for earlycrouched burials were not carried out by the living in a way that left any traceon the grave site, or even that the living left such reincorporation tonon-human forces. Acts of funerary deposition were perhaps, like votivedeposits, intercessions between living and dead in which valued material wasremoved from the sphere of the living and given to the community of the dead.Furthermore, the construction of monuments over mortuary deposits extendedmortuary rituals through time and embedded them in space, providing visibleopportunities for the production of communities of the dead within thelandscape. Not only were the living increasingly involved in the post-liminalrites of the dead, those rites became sedimented in the unfolding histories ofeach monument. Whether or not those burying a corpse in a cist towards the endof the third millennium expected that person to be incorporated into a newcommunity by human agency or supernatural means, increasingly towards the outsetof and during the first quarter of the second millennium living humancommunities worked to ensure such reincorporation. As a whole we can perceivedifferent ways of relating to the dead in the changing mortuary practicesthroughout the period; burials were perhaps always a way of dealing with certaindeaths, but the length of time a complete funeral took and the ways it wasknitted together with other events – such as other funerals, or thetransformation of place – changed.Changing the direction of the dead, maintaining cosmological patternsBurying the dead fixed them in place. Early isolated single burials (i.e. earlyburials, especially Beaker burials) were buried alone in places that may havehad personal, historical, and/or religious or cosmological significance but werenot burial grounds. The use of certain mortuary technologies and materialculture might have tied burials like Kirkhaugh in with distant communities,alive and dead, more than with a local community of the dead, as became morecommon in later periods. All burials ended with the seclusion of the dead fromthe living, but for isolated burials this left any incorporation of the deadinto a new community unobserved. The dead were not united with the bodies ofothers who had died before them. If, as has often been suggested, these burialsdirected the dead towards an otherworld or afterlife along with gifts orpossessions to sustain them there, or for them to offer to the beings existingthere, then this incorporation of the dead into a new community either occurredin a time and place removed from the graveside, or the dead were understood tobe distributed throughout the landscape, perhaps reincorporated into the worldof the living (locally or more distantly – particularly if early Beakeridentities were associated with relatively ‘foreign’ origins). Later in theperiod two things changed: the dead were more likely to be placed in the samelocale as those who died before them, and their bodies were often visiblytransformed before deposition. I will consider the creation of a physicalcommunity of the dead in a later section, and here focus on how the bodies ofthe dead were transformed and directed through mortuary activity.Cremating the dead sent bodily substances into the sky as smoke and ash, andbones were collected up and deposited. This vertical dimension to thetransformation of the dead was an extension from the ‘downward’ movement of thedead in earlier burials (and it is worth considering that some of these wereplaced in upland locales or local prominences), suggesting communication withforces in the sky as well as under the earth. Since the body was no longerintact, bodies were not aligned in the grave in the same way as before. Yet,because burials increasingly took place at pre-existing circular sites like ringcairns, henges, or round cairns and barrows, direction could be expressed interms of where the deposit was placed in respect to the centre of the monument.It is difficult to detect any consistent patterning for crouched burials atround sites, though many were near the centre, and specific senses ofrelatedness may perhaps have played a part in such location. For crouchedburials patterns of bodily orientation within the grave are far clearer thanlocation with respect to the centre of circular sites. Cremation depositsfavoured the southern quadrant, just as crouched burials were arranged to facesouth within their graves. Both sets of practices presented the dead as facingthe sun for the longest part of the year: with crouched burials, the whole bodywas sent underground, but respecting this direction; with cremations flesh wasburnt away and bones placed underground, but oriented towards the sun. For bothburnt and unburnt remains the centre of a cairn or barrow was also a commonposition for deposition. The points where sun shines longest and where the sunfirst appeared and last disappeared in the bleakest months were the mostappropriate locations or orientations for the dead. Thus, a religious concernfor the path of the sun could be seen as emerging early in the period andcontinuing into the Middle Bronze Age (cf. Kaul 1998; Kristiansen & Larsson2005: fig. 167). We could even speculate that cremations and burials took placeat specific auspicious times of the day or even in some cases, year. Thus, acontinuity in cosmological principles is discernible.Changing media of funerary transformations, maintaining desirable socialrelationsGrave goods may be present for a range of reasons, but locating the materialculture of these mortuary deposits within the structure and sequence of mortuaryrites provides us with an important perspective with which to view some of theseobjects. Over 93% of all deposits included fewer than three objects. However, wehave to accept that many organic materials have not survived and thus some ofthe complexity and attendant symbolism of the mortuary rites have been lost.Working with what has survived, in some few cases the dead were accompanied withspecial collections of objects and some of these may have been made for thegrave or produced to be used in preparing the body, grave furniture, and grave,as seems likely at Kirkhaugh. The Kirkhaugh burial probably did cite a specifickind of prestigious identity for the dead, and much later in the period some ofthe burials with jet or bronze daggers in northern Northumberland may have beenpart of the emergence of a desired set of identities for a specific section ofthe community, which possibly drew on associations with the historical ritualcomplexes and rock art panels in this part of the county. These identities weresignificantly localised even though they drew on some materials, objects andmonument types that had distant origins and were shared with distant places.Other grave goods might have been deposited in order to cultivate an identitywhich was desired for the dead but not achieved in life, as may be the case withthe arrowhead placed with the cremated remains of a 2–3 year old child, whowould not have been able to use it. Some sexual differentiation is evident inthe use of jet necklaces, which generally seem to be associated with women. Insome cases objects may have been gifts to the dead, designed to maintainrelations beyond death and elicit further gifts from the dead in the future. Thebodies of the dead themselves may even be perceived as gifts, owed to divinepowers who had given them life and offered over to them following death.Some of the objects buried with the dead can be seen as emblems of desirableconduct, and as designating and ensuring the social efficacy of the dead person.This might include knives, scrapers, arrowheads, and other tools. Yet the mostcommon of all grave goods were ceramic vessels. This ubiquity suggests a closeaffinity between the human body and the ceramic vessel. There was a shift overthe long term from bodies accompanied by small vessels probably containing foodand/or drink, to the containment of cremated human remains in a larger vessel.Ceramics increasingly replaced the skin and flesh of the dead in containing thebones. Pots were important in the acts of consumption through which bodies werefed. Recent lipid analysis of British Beakers suggests that dairy products wereconsumed (Šoberl et al. 2009: 9), though it is not clear whether these were fromporridge-like meals or fermented milks. Šoberl et al. (2009), who also reportedthat Collared Urns found in funerary contexts exhibited significantaccumulations of lipid-rich residues, suggested these vessels were in use for along time in the domestic sphere before they were used to house the bones of thedead. We might suggest that a vessel which had ‘fed’ a person with vitalsubstances in life was in turn used to contain vital substance following death.The placement of beads around the neck of vessels containing cremated remains atPace Hill and Ford illustrate this equation of bodies with vessels. Arguablyceramic vessels acted as new, hard and enduring skins, replacing the corruptibleflesh which had been burnt away as the container of enduring human bone. Thatbone was then ‘fed’ into a community of the dead through special places, fed tothe ancestors just as the benevolence of the ancestors had provided the currentworld for the living and left them crops and animals (cf. Oestigaard’s (2000)interpretation of Iron Age Scandinavian cremations as sacrifices of cookedpersons to the gods).But while it might be tempting to perceive a move from inhumation-as-burial tocremation-as-offering (cf. Lucas 1996), we could equally suggest that theremains of the dead formed special offerings to other beings throughout theperiod. Ceramics were not the only containers of the dead. Almost all of theearlier burials were in cists, and the few that were not were probably in logcoffins or other organic containers. Brück (2004: 318–19) has interpreted thisemphasis on ‘wrapping and containment’ as potentially: protecting the dead andobjects associated with them (she provides examples from elsewhere in Britain ofobjects that were often sheathed, boxed or bagged); keeping secret from somemourners exactly what was being deposited; bringing together bundles of thingsthrough which relations could be traced; and/or weaving a sense of communitythrough these nested collections of contained objects in the grave. We couldalso add that this containment was successive, creating stages of gradualseparation of the living from the dead through the funerary rites. In somecases, as at Cartington, the dead might have been secluded in many successivestages during the pre-liminal rites. Cists and coffins gave way to ceramicvessels as containers of the dead (or aspects of the dead) over the long term ashow and when the dead were secluded and transformed in the funerary ritechanged. So, while in the earlier part of the period the offering was a discretebundle, later on the elements of the body were distributed to different locales,shared between the sky and the earth, and bones were used to build physicalcommunities of the dead. These are important differences. When set against thebackground of continued containment of the dead the move to cremation may denotesome shift in religious beliefs – for instance, the adoption or re-alignment ofa tripartite model of the cosmos (heavens, earth, underworld) into whichdifferent aspects of the dead person now had to be distributed, or a need tovisibly ensure the transformation of the dead which had previously been left tounseen forces – but by itself it need not necessarily constitute a majorrevision to understandings of personhood, the body, death and ancestry. Thespread of cremation may relate to a change in beliefs about the fate of the deador the structure of the cosmos or a change in how the dead were prepared forthis fate or in how it was demonstrated to the living that the dead wererelocated in this cosmos. The transformation of the dead was increasinglydemonstrable prior to burial.Some of the objects in the mortuary deposits were potentially used intransforming the dead by preparing the body for the grave or pyre: scrapers forpreparing hides, toggles and pins for tying shrouds. Flint knives and bronzedaggers were sometimes introduced late in the mortuary rite at the end of thepoint of contact between the living and the dead. It is possible that thepresence of knives, like that of burning planks covering the mortuary deposit,was a graphic statement of the separation of the living and the dead, ending onephase of the rite of passage and beginning the next. Symbols used in rites ofpassage, such as the vessel and the knife, probably had broader meanings derivedfrom their everyday features and uses. Knives may have been emblematic ofcutting ties but also of killing animals, preparing food and dividing it forsharing. Cutting is necessary to share food and thus sustain and renew the body.Knives were also used to cut away a part of the communal body, a person whoseremains were increasingly likely to be offered to a community of the dead. Painand grief might also then be associated with knives. The transformation of thedeceased, particularly those whose bodily substances had been divided, may havedrawn widely on this ambiguous motif. Burning was also often an important partof the mortuary process, either of the body or else lighting a fire above agrave or elsewhere before placing burnt residues in graves. Burning oftenpurifies and is emblematic of physical transformation: like cutting it isdestructive but also necessary for the preparation of food, reiterating theconnection between mortuary transformations and food preparation.Mortuary acts such as burning, containment, and severing may suggest an anxietyover contact with the dead and ritualised acts of separation in a complexemotive process which successively articulated remembering and forgetting whileidealising and transforming the identities of the dead. I would suggest that thesymbols used celebrated those relations people (and things) engaged inthroughout their lives. As well as pots and knives we could consider that cattlewere referred to through the hide shrouds or garments that encased the corpses,combining human and animal skins. Broken quernstone fragments were alsoincorporated into five cairns, citing the production of food or drink fromcereal crops. Many of the relations referred to throughout do not seem to berelations of dominance, competition, or aggression, which are the types ofrelations which have often been the focus of studies of Early Bronze Agemortuary deposits elsewhere (e.g. Heyd 2007). Preservation undoubtedly has afactor to play, but the dearth of arrowheads, copper-alloy axe heads (excludedfrom burials across the country) and battleaxe heads (of which there is only oneburied with human remains), and absence of bracers, belt-hooks, and otherobjects commonly explained as symbols of warriors or others of high statuscannot be explained by preservation alone. Either these objects were not part ofthe common repertoire of those buried in Northumberland in the Early Bronze Age,or such objects were excluded from burial. This is not to deny the importance ofhunting or fighting as social activities foundational to identity, but tohighlight their limited currency in the mortuary record. Overall I would suggestthat the Northumbrian mortuary rituals spoke more often of how the person wasembedded in the world and celebrated desirable social relations: cutting,cooking, drinking, giving, sharing, sociality. This did not change significantlythroughout the period.Changing communities of the deadPerhaps the most major change during the period was from isolated burials atvarious places in the landscapes to cemeteries and cairns used repeatedly fordeposition of human remains. This is evident with some of the later burials ofuncremated remains (e.g. Chatton Sandyford) as well as with cremations, and itseems likely that the accumulation of remains that were not cremated in a singleplace either pre-dated or was contemporary with the widespread use of cremation.This nucleation of burials created visible communities of the dead before andduring the same periods as there was an increase in commingling remains in asingle deposit, even within a single vessel. How could we characterise thosecommunities and what are the implications for understanding personhood?The increasing commingling or nucleation of the remains of the dead suggests away of tracing relations between the living and the dead that produced lineages,or at least groups, of ancestors. The identities of the living were perhapsincreasingly constructed in relation to such lineages or groups, and theirposition with respect to their ancestors was revised by placing their remainswithin the same burial sites. This deposition drew out their ancestralconnections after individual features of their personhood had commemorated andtransformed (cf. Bloch 1989; Fowler 2004: 79–100). We could argue that acollective sense of ancestry was produced through each funeral which firstacknowledged the relational identity of the deceased, enacted keytransformations upon the body and person, and elevated them to the status ofbelonging to a community of ancestors. These acts also transformed places asthey transformed the dead. At Pitland Hills earlier funeral grounds were used inlater cremations and turned into cairns. At Blawearie the kerb to the cairn wasdismantled and the stones used as cist cover slabs, while at Chatton Sandyfordtwo separate low mounds were eventually united under a single larger cairn,closing off the burial ground within a kerbed cairn. Later on cremation depositswere inserted, renewing connections with the ancestral dead. Not all of thesereworkings of burial grounds were necessarily expected by those who first buriedthe dead at these locales; they may have deferred the final transformation ofthe dead to other powers without imagining the roles their human successorswould play in the reincorporation of the dead.12 Turf Knowe North provides anexcellent example: here a burial cairn was seemingly ploughed over,rediscovered, reworked and re-used, and then ploughed over again in a long-termEarly Bronze Age sequence (Adams & Carne 1997).Early Bronze Age communities pursued a series of different strategies in thepresentation of the dead, placement in the landscape, congregation of the deadand monumentalisation of mortuary locales. In some regions clearly divergentstrategies have been identified. Peters (2000) suggests that the Stonehengelandscape was home to two communities: the locals who maintained discretemortuary traditions over the long term, and an elite community who buried theirdead with exotic goods in prominent monuments elevated above a ceremoniallandscape. Although some burial practices did become localised in some centuriesno such clear split is evident in Northumberland; rather there were changinglocal strategies in mortuary rites and in the construction of mortuary monuments(Fowler 2013a: 250–52). Perhaps cairns or barrows were constructed bycommunities at times when it was thought important to do so in making social,political and/or religious statements, or when senses of family (for instance)came to focus on the congregation of dead family members. Rather than perceivingburials without mounds or in inconspicuous locales or without knives ornecklaces as of lower status than those with mounds or prominent locations orsuch grave goods, we might consider that different strategies were followed asother choices were made. For example, the man subjected to bodily modificationand buried with a dagger at Allerwash, did not join a community of the dead, wasnot joined by later burials, and does not seem to have formed the basis for asignificant grave marker: his burial need not be seen as reflecting hierarchicalstatus, but may relate to other distinctions between the dead in which somebodies could be brought together, while certain bodies required a differenttreatment. Changing cosmological beliefs might also affect choice of landscapelocation (Field 1999), as might the creation of distinct senses of community(Edwards 2006) in certain sub-regions. Some communities, able to challenge anyclaims to elevated status, might shun the practice of burying single individualsunder prominent large mounds and favour other practices (cf. Skoglund 2008).Perhaps elevated hierarchical statuses were less important at funerals than abroader sense of community, and perhaps such statuses were infrequent andunstable in Early Bronze Age Northumberland. Overall, I would suggest thatchanges in mortuary practices can be understood as changes in how communities ofthe living related to communities of the dead and other beings through thefunerary transformation of the recently deceased. While this probably hadpolitical currency, we cannot assume that this politics was always one ofcompetitive hierarchical status acquisition and need also to consider beliefsabout ‘good’ and ‘bad’ deaths, religious codes and other cultural concerns.ConclusionI would suggest that in Early Bronze Age Northumberland some aspects of the formand role of mortuary rites stayed the same over time, even though there weresome significant changes in who was buried, how visibly and rapidly their bodieswere transformed, and whether they were buried singly or with the remains ofothers. Mortuary rites carefully separated the dead from the living whiletransforming them both. In providing a vehicle for such personal transformationsmortuary rites also referenced the desirable relations that connected up thesocial world and shaped each person. The notion of a community of the deadsharing the same place was stronger after c. 2100 BC than earlier, but therewere continuities over the long term too: for instance a consistent practice oforienting the dead facing towards the south, though in differing ways. Therewere also repeated instances of practices which, while they may not be verifiedas a dominant trend, nonetheless recurred over the long term, such as theintroduction of knives late in the mortuary sequence or the fact that while thedeposition of remains that had not been cremated gave way to cremation many ofthe key symbols of the rite were already present in the earlier period, such assetting fire to grave sites or placing burnt materials in cists. Materialculture in mortuary deposits may potentially relate to any of the phases of theritual process, and indeed the introduction of material media early on in theritual projected those media through to the later stages, so that acts in thepre-liminal rites set up conditions for the post-liminal reincorporation of thedead. Some objects were involved in the ritual transformation of the dead, butthe inclusion of these objects (and others, like necklaces) in graves may alsosuggest aspirations about desirable identities, social relations and practices.Throughout the period, many of the objects chosen seem related to the ability toprovide food; to share, process, and serve it. Vessels commonly accompanied thedead: earlier on as containers of food or drink, perhaps providing the dead withthe ability to share in the afterlife or in acknowledgement of debt to thedeceased and/or hope of a return gift; and later as containers of cremated bone,replacing a corruptible skin with an incorruptible one through the mortuaryprocess. In both practices the bodies of the dead themselves could have beenoffered up to divine beings with whom the living were locked in relations ofdebt and gift-giving. Thus, I have suggested that grave goods may have a rangeof roles and meanings from devices used to cite and produce identities to toolsused in acts of ritual transformation. They might be gifts or possessions, theymay have been associated with certain social practices and roles, and they mighthave had valued biographies or magical or apotropiac effects. Indeed, they maybe many or all of these things at once, and it would be a mistake to read themonly in one way. Nonetheless, while tracing changes in mortuary practices overtime, I have illustrated how many of the relationships produced throughpractices cited in the funerary rites can be seen as convivial and co-operativerather than competitive.I have also suggested that while the emergence of cremation is often seen as themost major change in the period, the consequences of cremating the dead are notnecessarily very different from burial without cremation. In both cases, beforethe rites of separation were concluded the deceased were presented with whatthey needed to assume a new identity and be incorporated into a new community ofthe dead. To that extent they were initially transformed by the community ofmourners during the pre-liminal rites. Yet successful reincorporation wasperhaps hoped for rather than certain, particularly earlier in the period whenthe dead were buried alone in the landscape. The assumption of a new statusmight have been completed or celebrated in activities that took place off-siteand at other times, or it might have been left in the hands of divine forces.Cremation need not necessarily have accelerated nor slowed the funeral sequenceas unburnt bodies could potentially be curated for as long as cremated bones, orlie in the ground awaiting others to join them before they could be incorporatedinto a close community of the dead; but cremation dramatised the transformationof the dead, making it visible to mourners. Cists fell out of use as the fleshof the dead was now burnt away and the bones contained by urns; there was noneed to hold bodies ‘in place’ with constricting chambers and heavy cover slabs,nor the potential to re-examine decaying remains. The deposition of the bonesmay have marked the assumption of the dead into a new status in a much moredirect and assured way than burial without cremation did. However, this is lessa feature of cremation-followed-by-depostion per se, and more a factor of thephenomena of burying remains in communal burial grounds: something that mighthave preceded the introduction of cremation-before-deposition, or might becontemporary with it. The production of nucleated communities of the dead incist cemeteries, cairns and barrows transformed the dead into members of acommunity of ancestors more visibly, physically and completely than before.These results illustrate the importance of considering mortuary rites as asequence of actions that transform social relations and identities. Theyillustrate the usefulness of approaches that perceive funerary rites astransformations to identity (rather than simply reflections of identity) and thevalue of applying recent typological and dating studies to even the olderrecords of excavations of Bronze Age mortuary deposits at a regional level.Characterising change and continuity through time is only possible byappreciating shifts in the form and content, the timing and effect of each phasein an overall sequence of mortuary rites. This may be difficult to observethrough the records of past excavations and may not be evident in some of thearchaeological remains that survive to be recovered, but sufficient informationdoes exist to make the detailed reconstruction of changing prehistoric mortuaryrites a priority in coming years. Building up such regional pictures willprovide the opportunity for more detailed analysis of the interaction betweenregions, and support a more rich and varied appreciation of changing ritualtransformations for the dead along with more subtle inferences about EuropeanEarly Bronze Age concepts of the body, person and community.AcknowledgmentsI would like to thank Lindsay Allason-Jones and Andrew Parkin for providinginformation on and access to artefacts held at the Great North Museum, and PeterCarne for information on the Turf Knowe excavations.

I haveretained the term Early Bronze Age in the title for this piece for the sake ofsimplicity. While there is little evidence for copper with these burials thereis good reason to see the burials here as part of wider changes in Britainassociated with ‘Chalcolithic’ or early Beaker burials. While this could bediscussed under the heading of a Terminal Neolithic, referring to the currenttext as a discussion of Neolithic and Early Bronze Age mortuary rites wouldclaim too much ground. Regardless of the problems with the term Chalcolithic, itseems necessary to acknowledge a distinctive set of practices emerging c.2450–2250 BC in Britain. All dates in this chapter are calibrated radiocarbonyears BC (cal. BC).2 A database of Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age mortuary deposits fromNorthumberland, Tyne and Wear and County Durham has been lodged on-line with theArchaeology Data Service (Fowler 2013b).3 A small number of recently-excavated sites with good preservation andhigh-quality records are currently excluded awaiting a complete set ofpost-excavation reports (e.g. Low Hauxley).4 The term inhumation implies burial in the earth, and as such it is animprecise term on at least two counts: first, cremated remains were also placedin the earth, and second, many cist burials were not backfilled with soil, sothat the remains were not in contact with earth at all. For that reason I shallrefer to burials except where the remains were directly covered with earth.5 Beaker vessels have been placed within date ranges based on the typologyof Needham (2005) and chronology from Needham (2005) and Healy (2012): fulldetails of the identification of vessels to type is provided elsewhere (Fowler2013a; 2013b). Based on typology only six of the Northumbrian Beakers fromexcavated deposits, one from Elsnook (Bosanquet 1933), one from Low Hauxley, andtwo from Chatton Sandyford (see below), and two from Milfield North henge(Harding 1981), match Needham’s (2005) late styles of Beaker, which probablydate to c. 2100–1850 cal BC (Healy 2012).6 I will use the term grave in this chapter to refer to an excavated graveor a cist used as a grave.7 Alison Sheridan suggested considering this may be a fabricator, and itcompares closely with one from Rudston barrow burial 6 (BM 79 12-9 1060, Kinnes& Longworth 1985: 76).8 This category here includes burials where the bones show signs ofscorching but the body was clearly laid in the grave as a crouched burial.9 Flat riveted daggers and blades probably date to between 2200 and 1900 BC(see Baker et al. 2003; Sheridan 2007b), knife-daggers probably had currencywithin the period c. 2200 BC to c. 1600 BC (see Sheridan 2007b).10 There are further examples of burials recorded with bronze daggers fromsites not included in the database due to poverty of information for comparativecontextual analysis (2), and stray finds of daggers from Northumberland (5).There are also 27 bronze daggers or knife-daggers known from SE Scotland (Bakeret al. 2003).11 Cremated bone from one Enlarged Food Vessel Urn from Turf Knowe North hasprovided a date of c. 2490–2200 cal BC, but this is far earlier than other datesassociated with Food Vessels, and the site is both complex and still beingprepared for publication.12 As noted in peer review of this chapter, there is potentially more thatcould be said about how the timing of site elaboration and the materials usedrelated to post-liminal rites. This might be best explored through barrows fromother regions (e.g. as explored by Owoc [2001; 2005]), however, as there isrelatively little detailed information on the materials used in Northumbrianbarrows and cairns. Some sequences of activity at specific sites, including someglimpses of the timing and material composition of mound elaboration innortheast England is explored elsewhere (Fowler 2013a: chapters 5[12_Chapter05.html] and 6 [13_Chapter06.html]).BibliographyAdams, M. & Carne, P. 1997: The Ingram and Upper Breamish Valley LandscapeProject, Interim Report 1997, Archaeological Services, University of Durham:Durham.Allason-Jones, L. 1996: Roman Jet in the Yorkshire Museum, Yorkshire Museum:York.Allen, J., Gardiner, J. & Sheridan, J.

Atthe site of Klin-Yar, it is possible to observe the evolution of graveconstruction and mortuary ritual across three cultural phases, from the LateBronze Age to the Early Middle Ages.This evolution comprises continuous elements as well as observable changes anddevelopments. Changing ideas about the afterlife and tensions between socialnorms and individual behaviour may have affected the changes. But the keyfactors behind the overall pattern of evolution appear to be a series ofinterlinked changes: immigration leading to economic change which, in turn, ledto social change; the latter was, at the same time, affected by the widergeo-political context of the region.This case study highlights two points: (1) causes of ritual change may often bestrongly interlinked, and it may therefore be misleading to look for a singleobvious cause; and (2) marked changes in the wider contexts may not always bereflected in pronounced changes in mortuary ritual.Keywords: Alans, burial ritual, Koban Culture, ritual change, SarmatiansThe archaeological study of change is one of the most fascinating areas of thediscipline because it rests on one of its strengths: the long-term perspectivewhich makes changes stand out more clearly than they would when observed withinthe context of a shorter period. But there are a number of problems associatedwith studying change. One is that we tend to think of ‘change’ in terms ofsudden and marked change whereas most change in human societies tends to beslow, gradual and cumulative – something which is often more in the nature ofevolution. In fact, changes over a long period appear more marked mainly becausethe long-term perspective has the effect of collapsing them into seeminglyshorter and more pronounced events.[../images/fig4_1.jpg]Fig. 4.1. Site map of Klin-Yar, with location of excavations 1994–96 (drawn byM. Mathews, Reading).This, in turn, is linked to the second problem. Archaeologists are better atobserving difference and studying variation, than at observing change andstudying processes of transformation. The reasons for this are twofold, and theyare rooted in the structure of the discipline and in the nature of thearchaeological evidence. The discipline is split into specialisms which havetraditionally been defined by chronology more than by any other factor, andspecialists in the one or the other period feel uneasy transgressing into otherperiods because of their lack of familiarity with evidence and debates there.The consequence is that phases of change and transition between thechronological blocks tend to be studied from one side or the other, or not atall, but rarely as a whole. The fragmentary and incomplete nature of thearchaeological evidence tends to exacerbate the problem. This evidence presentsus with a series of isolated ‘snapshots’ of past situations rather than acomplete ‘film’ of unfolding stories in the past. Thus, we infer processes oftransformation from differences between the ‘snapshots’, and causes of changefrom contextual information. Even where the ‘snapshots’ are reasonably close toone another, the chronological resolution of our dating evidence will often makeit difficult or even impossible to follow a transformation step by step; veryoften, it will be century by century, or if we are lucky, decade by decade.The specific subject of ritual change poses a third problem: to what extent canwe separate, or even distinguish, ritual change from other types of change? Canwe study ritual change on its own? In many societies, there appears to be a linkbetween funerary ritual and the type of economy (pers. comm. Tony Walter, Bath).Processualists have postulated that social organisation determines thecomplexity of mortuary rites (Binford 1971), which implies that social changemay, or should, entail ritual change. Political change has recently been thecause of ritual change in Russia where the collapse of the Soviet Union wasfollowed by a massive return of orthodox ritual in worship and burial (Merridale2000). And recent cases of migration in, or into, Europe have demonstrated thatmigrants often (though not always) bring their own styles of ritual with them,linking ritual change to population change (Jonker 1996).Some of the issues discussed above will be explored in this paper which looks ata case of ritual change within a single cemetery site over the best part of twomillennia, with a focus on processes of transformation and their causes.Particular attention will be paid to interrelated aspects of change in order tosee how ritual change may be interlinked with other changes in society. This, inturn, may help to identify the causal factors at work in the transformationalprocesses.Klin-Yar: site and evidenceKlin-Yar is located in the chalk and sandstone hills of the Russian NorthCaucasus, outside the old spa town of Kislovodsk in the region of Stavropol. Anarrow, steepsided sandstone plateau (called Paravos, or ‘The Locomotive’) hasproduced settlement traces of Late Bronze/Early Iron Age (Koban Culture) andEarly Medieval (Alanic) date. Further settlement areas of Koban and Alanic dateare located on the upper slopes around the plateau. Extensive burial groundswith Koban, Sarmatian and Alanic graves occupy the lower slopes (Fig. 4.1). Itis the presence of three cultural and chronological phases in the cemeterieswhich has made Klin-Yar a key site for regional archaeology, and it makes it anideal case for the study of change.Phase at Klin-YarDesignationPeriod/Absolute date1 Koban CultureLate BA/Early IA10th–4th century BC2 SarmatianLate IA/Roman IA2nd century BC–4th/5th century AD3 AlanicEarly Middle Ages4th/5th–8th century ADExcavations carried out before 1993 uncovered some 350 graves, most of themdating to the Late Bronze/Early Iron Age, but also about 100 Sarmatian andAlanic graves, providing one of the largest samples of undisturbed Alanicburials in the entire North Caucasus (the terms ‘Sarmatian’ and ‘Alanic’ areused here primarily as chronological, not as ethnic labels). Joint Anglo-Russianfieldwork in cemeteries III and IV undertaken by the Regional Heritage Unit‘Nasledie’ and the University of Reading added another 52 graves, with more than100 individuals (Härke & Belinsky 2000; 2008; Belinskij & Härke forthcoming).This new fieldwork also identified an elite plot of rich Late Sarmatian andEarly Alanic catacombs. The full extent of the Klin-Yar cemeteries can currentlyonly be guessed at, but it is probably somewhere between 1000 and 3000 graves.Cultural contacts shown in grave-goods are wide-ranging, from Central Asia toMesopotamia and Byzantium. In the Alanic Period, a branch of the Silk Road isthought to have led past Klin-Yar to the mountain passes of the Caucasus.[../images/fig4_2.jpg]Fig. 4.2. Plans of graves from the three phases represented in the Klin-Yarcemeteries: Koban Period (grave 362), Sarmatian (grave 365) and Alanic (grave360) (drawn by M. Mathews, Reading).In the first phase of the site, the Koban-Period inhabitants of Klin-Yarpractised inhumation with grave-goods in rectangular grave pits (Fig. 4.2).These pits were regularly cut, quite shallow, and sometimes stone-lined and/orcovered with flagstones. Each grave contained a single body, deposited crouchedon the side. Gender differences within the burial rite were marked. As a rule,males had been deposited on the right side, females on the left; this is part ofa long-standing East European tradition reaching back to the Late Neolithic(Häusler 2003; Sofaer-Derevenskij 1997). There was a limited range ofgrave-goods which, again, show marked differences between the genders. Maleswere buried with weapons (usually a spearhead) and tools (knife and whetstone),females with dress and body ornaments (headdress, glass or amber beads, bronzepins). One male adult burial (skeletal sex determination checked and confirmed)with female grave-goods (large bronze pin and nine glass beads) was also unusualin the deposition of the body which had been bunched up in a corner of thegrave, and in the placing of a pottery vessel underneath the bent left knee(grave 355) (Fig. 4.3); this may be one of the ‘shaman’ burials which haveoccasionally been suggested in cases of Koban-Period cemeteries (pers. comm. S.L. Dudarev, Armavir; Belinskij & Härke, forthcoming). The most frequent gravedeposit, common to both genders, was a single pottery vessel; this was foundwith the majority of Koban burials at Klin-Yar. Wealth was indicated by moreelaborate items within this range, such as a decorated axe in a male burial(grave 362) and bronze bracelets and a necklet in a female burial (grave 366).Previous excavations had produced some more exotic items, including Assyrianhelmets and Scythian artefacts, highlighting that Klin-Yar belongs to thecontact zone between the steppes to the north, and developed civilisations tothe south, of the Caucasus mountains.In the second (Sarmatian) phase, the local burial rite was characterised byinhumation in a small underground chamber (catacomb), usually with the bodyextended on the back and provided with some grave-goods (Fig. 4.2). The chamberwas accessed by a pit or a short corridor (dromos) which was in most casesaligned east–west; in a few cases, the ritual deposition of a horse ‘skin’(head-and-hooves) was observed on or in the dromos. The entrance to the chamberfrom the dromos was always blocked with large stones. Most Sarmatian chamberscontained only a single body, and many double burials were constructed bylinking single-burial chambers with a short dromos. In some cases of LateSarmatian catacombs, two bodies had been buried in the same chamber. In contrastto the preceding period, gender was signalled now only through grave-goods: somemales had been buried with weapons, many females with dress ornaments (earrings,beads) and a mirror; pottery vessels and horse sacrifice were gender-neutraldepositions. Within the narrow range of grave-goods, wealth indicators were fewand unspectacular; they included an iron long sword for males (e.g. grave 365),and gold ornaments for females (e.g. grave 379). The most notable feature of theSarmatian burial rite at this site was variation from grave to grave, and anabsence of standardisation.The Alanic ritual in the third phase was similar to the Sarmatian, but moreelaborate. The standard burial rite continued to be dressed inhumation, with anincreased range and quantity of grave-goods. The catacombs were larger anddeeper now and occasionally had additional features such as pits or niches;dromoi were longer and predominantly orientated around north–south, with theentrance at the northern end blocked with large stones (Fig. 4.2). In themajority of cases, Alanic catacombs contained more than one body, andoccasionally as many as four. There is clear evidence of re-opening of chambersand later deposition of bodies and grave-goods, suggesting that the catacombswere used as family or kin group vaults. This is highlighted by cases of largecatacombs with single bodies where space had been left for later depositions(e.g. in grave 371). Sacrificial depositions in or on the dromos became morefrequent and varied in the Alanic phase, frequently including pottery, lessoften weapons or parts of horse harness.[../images/fig4_3.jpg]Fig. 4.3. Photograph of the possible ‘shaman’ burial in Koban grave 355 (photoH. Härke).[../images/fig4_4.jpg]Fig. 4.4. Plan of horse ‘skin’ deposition 1/1995 next to the dromos of Alaniccatacomb 357 (drawn by M. Mathews, Reading).Gender associations of Alanic grave-goods are less easy to identify because ofmultiple burials and mixed inventories in the chambers, but items found on thebodies indicate that grave-goods were gendered along Sarmatian lines: males hadweapons, and boot and belt fittings, while females had been buried with dressornaments and textile bags. There was, however, some overlap, with a singleearring found in the cases of a couple of men, and a large knife or short swordfound next to, at least, one woman. Pottery, wooden household items and horseharness were found in the head and foot ends of chambers, possibly implying thatthey were gender-neutral objects. The most conspicuous indicator of wealth wasthe sacrificial deposit of an entire horse in the dromos; these cases wereconcentrated in the elite plot. Glass vessels, bronze cauldrons and Byzantinecoins (of late sixth/early seventh century date) were found only in the richestgraves at Klin-Yar (e.g. grave 360).[../images/fig4_5.jpg]Fig. 4.5. Skeleton of an adolescent (grave 385), a possible human sacrifice inthe topsoil above the dromos of Late Sarmatian catacomb 386 (photo H. Härke).In addition to the graves, there were some ritual features in the cemetery whichwere not always clearly associated with particular graves; virtually all of themappear to be of Sarmatian or Alanic date. One was a dromos without a chamber,but with a horse ‘skin’ deposition on top; this may have been intended as acenotaph. Three horse ‘skin’ depositions between the graves and a separate horseburial without a human body (grave 367) suggest the conduct of post-burialritual in cemetery III (Fig. 4.4). The most intriguing of these ritual featureswas the skeleton of an adolescent (grave 385) deposited in contorted positionabove the backfilled dromos of a Late Sarmatian catacomb (grave 386) (Fig. 4.5).This may well have been a human sacrifice although such cases are extremely rarein other Sarmatian and Alanic cemeteries of the region.Discussion: ritual change at Klin-YarThere are marked changes as well as clear continuities in the mortuary ritual atKlin-Yar. Features found across all three phases, over some two millennia, areinhumation rite and grave-goods custom. While, from an archaeologicalperspective, these are profound continuities, the list of observable changes isconsiderably longer.First, there was a development from Koban grave pits (phase 1) toSarmatian/Alanic underground chambers (catacombs; phases 2 and 3). Thiscoincided with a shift from single burial (phase 1) to multiple burial, first inthe shape of linked single-burial chambers (phase 2), then with several bodiesin one chamber (from late in phase 2, and throughout phase 3). Consecutivedouble burial, in turn, meant continued use and re-use of burial chambers,possibly as family or kinship vaults (from late in phase 2, and throughout phase3). Parallel to these three developments and innovations, it is possible toobserve, across all phases, an increasing complexity of funerary ritual ingraves until it reached a peak in the rich Alanic catacombs (phase 3). With thesacrificial depositions between the graves, we may also see the appearance ofcommemorative ritual at this site (from phase 2 or 3).Perhaps the most intriguing change, though, was a ‘pendulum’ change in theoverall ritual package from standardisation (phase 1, Koban Culture) to variety(phase 2, Sarmatian) and back to standardisation (phase 3, Alanic). Like all theother changes, this seems to have been a slow and gradual process, in each caseover decades or even centuries, with more marked transitions from phase 1 to 2,and more gradual, incremental developments from phase 2 to 3.The key question, as with all processes of change and transformation, relates tothe reasons and causes of the processes. The following discussion will attempt adeductive approach, looking at the possible causes of change, and thenconsidering which of the observed changes might be explained by them. This willinclude factors suggested by the editors of the present volume, as well as otherfactors which may be relevant in late prehistoric and early historic processesof change.Mortuary ritual is often thought to be determined by ideas about cosmology andthe afterlife; changing ideas should, therefore, affect the shape (or perhapsjust the meaning?) of ritual. Such change might well explain the abandonment ofthe crouched body position in Koban graves which is so strikingly reminiscent ofthe foetal position, but is also a sleeping position. Eschatological change mayalso be a factor in the appearance of burial chambers which could be thought ofas ‘underground houses’. The inhabitants of North Ossetia, generally accepted asthe direct descendants of the Alans of the North Caucasus and living a couple ofhundred kilometres to the east of Klin-Yar, put small brick models of housesinto their graves (Kalojev 2004). However, that may be a modern innovationbecause the religion of Iranian nomads (including Sarmatians and Alans) isgenerally thought to be linked to fire and the sun (Frye 1962), not to housesand underground spaces. The disposal of the dead in rural Iran today is byexposure at designated places and on purpose-built platforms (seen at Yazd in2004; pers. comm. Hubertus Härke, Vaasa).Personal preferences are always likely to have some impact on funerals, and thetension between social norms and individual behaviour is typical of funeraryritual in all societies (pers. comm. Tony Walter, Bath). This tension couldexplain the changing patterns of standardisation versus variety (the ‘pendulum’change) which can be observed at Klin-Yar. Perhaps, Sarmatians were greaterindividualists than Koban people and Alans, or to put it another way, thestandardising populations before and after the Sarmatians had a tighter socialcontrol.At Klin-Yar, population change appears to be closely linked to ritual change.The skeletal evidence suggests that the Sarmatians at this site are likely to beimmigrants from the southern Urals (possibly a male-only immigration) who mixedwith the native Koban population (Belinskij & Härke forthcoming). The Alans,too, were new arrivals in the region, introducing new male and femalephenotypes; there are differences in the stable isotope patterns of the Alanicpopulations buried in cemeteries III and IV, respectively, suggesting theexistence among the local Alans of, at least, two sub-groups of possiblydifferent origins (Belinskij & Härke forthcoming). Interestingly, though, thelimited Sarmatian immigration led to a more marked change in burial ritual thanthe apparently more extensive Alanic influx which was followed by gradual changeand a development of existing ritual themes. The presence of Alanic sub-groupsmight help to explain subtle differences in grave construction, grave-goods, andfunerary ritual between cemeteries III and IV as well as their separatelocations on either side of the rock formation.Economic change was associated with the population change, and the former maywell have been the primary factor of change. The native Koban people wereagriculturalists while the biological evidence of the Sarmatians suggests thelifestyle of horse nomads and the diet of livestock breeders (Belinskij & Härkeforthcoming). In the Alanic Period, the economy appears to have been mixed,including agriculture and herding. It is probably significant that settlementsof Koban and Alanic date have been found in the vicinity of the Klin-Yarcemeteries, but none of Sarmatian date. An a priori observation would be thatthe two sedentary populations (Koban and Alanic) had a more standardised ritualthan the nomadic population of the intervening Sarmatian Period. This may be assignificant as the fact that a ritual emphasis on horse sacrifice and horseburial appeared with the transition from Koban agriculturalists to Sarmatiannomads. With the next economic change, from the Sarmatian livestock economy tothe mixed economy of the Alans (but starting in the Late Sarmatian Period), wesee the emergence of family or kin group vaults and of commemorative ritual inthe cemeteries. Again, this link is probably significant because agriculturalsocieties tend to emphasise family links because these define land ownership andgive access to land. A final economic factor involved in ritual changes atKlin-Yar may be the Early Medieval branch of the Silk Road which ran along theNorth Caucasus, and passed through the Kislovodsk Basin in the seventh centuryAD (Ierusalimskaya 1992). This could have contributed to the exceptional burialwealth found at Klin-Yar in the first half of the seventh century.Economic factors seem to have engendered social change, with a noticeablygreater social differentiation in the Alanic Period (phase 3 at Klin-Yar). Thisis particularly visible in the elite plot of cemetery III which boasts aconcentration of wealth indicators: 14 horse and horse ‘skin’ depositions, threebronze cauldrons, four glass vessels, as well as the most elaborate undergroundarchitecture and the largest burial chambers at the site (Fig. 4.6). Greatersocial hierarchy was expressed in a more complex, but at the same time morestandardised, burial ritual, and possibly in human sacrifice (grave 385, cf.above). Gender was symbolised to some extent in the ritual of all three phasesat Klin-Yar (Härke 2000), but least of all (only by the few grave-goods) in thesecond, Sarmatian phase. This may be linked to social patterns ofIranian-speaking nomads, which are also signalled by the discovery of ‘amazon’burials elsewhere in Scythian and Sarmatian contexts (Guliaev 2003).Political change is often associated with economic and social change, be it ascause or consequence. Some grave-goods in rich Alanic catacombs, such asByzantine coins (in graves 341 and 363) and an Iranian glass vessel (in grave360), are a clear reflection of the position of the North Caucasus Alans betweenthe Byzantine and Iranian regional powers, and of the Alanic military servicefor both of them at various times (Savenko, in Belinskij & Härke forthcoming).Finally, the changing patterns of standardisation and variation in mortuaryritual across the three phases at Klin-Yar may well reflect differences betweensettled societies in the process of early state formation (perhaps in the KobanPeriod, and most likely in the Alanic), on the one hand, and nomadic immigrants(Sarmatians), on the other.Concluding remarksMany of the possible explanations discussed above make eminent sense inexplaining ritual change at Klin-Yar and elsewhere, but the key point surely isthat the possible causal factors are all strongly interlinked: immigrationbrought in new populations with different economies and possibly with a newreligion; economic change led to social change; and changes in the widerpolitical context reinforced social and economic change. This interlinkage isprobably in the nature of mortuary ritual which itself is complex and reflects amultitude of very different aspects, including ideas about afterlife andpollution, personal factors such as individual biographies and mourners’emotions, kinship and family links as well as social relations, status, andaccess to positions and land.[../images/fig4_6.jpg]Fig. 4.6. Analytical plan of the Sarmatian–Alanic elite plot in cemetery III ofKlin-Yar (drawn by M. Mathews, Reading).Sometimes even a short-term, dramatic change of behaviour and attitude in theencounter with death may not have an obvious single cause. The public mourningof Princess Diana in Britain, a country not previously known for public hysteriaon such occasions, is a case in point: sociologists of death are still debatingthe reasons for this entirely new phenomenon which surprised everyone at thetime, and nobody more so than the academic specialists (Walter 1999). If thisfocused look at the development of burial ritual at a single site over a longperiod of time tells us anything, it is probably that we should not be lookingfor single causes of gradual change, and perhaps not even of marked change, inmortuary behaviour.BibliographyBelinskij, A.

Rasmus BrandtFor Axel Seeberg (1931–2011) who taught me to ask questionsArnold van Gennep’s pioneering study on rites-de-passage more than a century ago(1908 [1960]) has only relatively recently been applied to Etruscan culturalstudies and, in particular, opened up new aspects and interpretations ofEtruscan funerary practices and iconography, as expressed in tomb paintings andsculpture. However, apart from definitions of funerary real and mental spaces,discussions on ancestral ideology, and occasional studies of one or more tombsand selected pictorial themes and details, no investigation has tried to applyvan Gennep’s model in order to understand in greater detail the preservedEtruscan tomb paintings in coherence. The present study is a meagre attempt toremedy somewhat this defect, and it was carried out with references to MaryDouglas’ observations on taboos, pollution, and purification (1966 [2005]) andto two additional important concepts in ritual studies: content and form.The investigation begins by returning to a central question in Etruscan tombpainting: the change in tomb iconology from merry revellers in the 6th/5thcenturies BC to monstrous nether world scenes in the 4th century BC and later.In the past, this marked change was interpreted from either a political or aneschatological point of view. However, with the discovery of a new tomb atTarquinia some 25 years ago, Tomba dei Demoni Azzurri, dated to 450–430 BC (orslightly later), these views have been somewhat modified. The aim of the presentpaper is thus to review some of the data on Etruscan painted tombs from theArchaic to Hellenistic times and discuss, with a view to van Gennep and Douglas,if the changes in iconology are due to a change in ritual content or only inform.2Keywords: Content, eschatology, Etruria, form, funerary rituals and practices,iconography, paintings, pollution, purification, rites-de-passage, sculpture,taboo.‘Access to ancient Greek society is severely limited by the quantity and natureof our sources. So the study of … Greek attitudes towards death present evengreater difficulties than is normally the case in the history of collectiverepresentations; and it is necessary to use as many types of evidence andmethodological tools as possible.’3So Christiane Sourvinou-Inwood wrote in 1981 about Greek attitudes towardsdeath. The situation of the sources available since then has not improvedconsiderably. If it is difficult to understand attitudes towards death inGreece, a cultural area for which we have both literary and archaeologicalsources, the situation in Etruria, where written sources are nearly absent or atbest secondary, collected and presented by non-Etruscan writers, is even worse.Thus it becomes more necessary ‘to use as many types of evidence andmethodological (and I should add theoretical) tools as possible.’The nether world – the Etruscan questionsTo understand the function and meaning of Etruscan funerary practices our mainsources lie in archaeology and art. For a long time a specific problem hastormented scholars: how to explain a profound iconological change occurring inEtruscan funerary art around the middle of the 4th century BC. At this time theArchaic and Classical presentations of merry scenes with banquets, athleticgames, and dancing taking place in this world move to presentations from thenether world,4 where we meet Aita5 (Hades), Phersipnai6 (Persephone), and uglydemons, the most frequent ones named Charu(n) and Vanth.7What was the reason for this iconological shift? Before trying to answer thequestion, let us take a very quick look at the historical situation in Etruriafrom the Late Archaic to the Hellenistic Period. At the beginning of this periodthe Etruscan dominance and/or influence in Italy was at its maximum extendingfrom its core area between the rivers Arno and Tiber (Fig. 5.1), northwards intothe Po valley and southwards into Campania. In 474 BC, off Cumae in the Bay ofNaples, the Etruscans lost in a sea battle against Syracuse, and thus alsogradually lost control over the shipping routes towards their home country. In396 BC the first Etruscan city, Veii, fell to Roman expansionist politics; atthe same time from the north Celts made incursions deep into Etruscan territory.In 351 BC, after seven years of atrocious conflict with Rome, Tarquinia signed a40 year truce, but at the time of its expiry in 311 BC the Romans were back.This was the beginning of a conquest policy, which in the course of a fewgenerations would see all Etruscan cities subjected to Roman political hegemony.The reason for the iconological change in Etruscan funerary art has for a longtime been proposed by two main lines of explanation:1. The political explanation: From an optimistic view of life, the Roman andCeltic incursions into Etruscan territory in the early 4th century BC broughtabout political instability and a general uncertainty about the future. Theintroduction of the scenes from the nether world was accordingly the result of ageneral pessimistic view of life spreading through the Etruscan society duringthis time and the following generations.82. The eschatological explanation: This connects the iconological change tothe introduction of new ideas about the afterlife into Etruria, especially asformulated by the expanding mystery cults, such as Pythagorism and Orphism.9 Theinfluence is said to have come to Etruria in particular from southern Italy,where, from the middle of the 4th century BC, appeared a series of funeraryvases depicting Underworld scenes with Hades, Persephone, and Orpheus.10Alternatively, the change in pictorial motifs is explained as ‘un radicalecambiamento nelle strutture mentali.’11[../images/fig5_1.jpg]Fig. 5.1. Topographical map of Etruria.[../images/fig5_2.jpg]Fig. 5.2. Tarquinia, T. dei Demoni Azzurri: a) entrance wall; b) left wall; c)right wall; d) rear wall (line drawings from Adinolfi et al. 2005a: 46, fig. 1(= a); Cataldi 1989:152, figs 108–10 (= b, d, c); with kind permission ofMinistero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali, Soprintendenza per i beniarcheologici dell’Etruria Meridionale, Museo di Villa Giulia).In 1985, a new painted tomb was discovered at Tarquinia, the T. dei DemoniAzzurri (phase 4), but unfortunately not well preserved in all its details (Figs5.2a–d):12Entrance wall (Fig. 5.2a): badly preserved; probably hunting scenes.13Left wall (Fig. 5.2b): From left (i.e from the entrance wall): A processionmoving right with two dancers (1–2) following in the footsteps of a man about toenter a two-horse chariot (or biga) (3); up front another dancer(?) with aforked branch in his right hand (4), together with a flute (5) and a kitharaplayer (6); a tree separates the procession from a small, young servant (7)standing by a kylikeion, or table with different kinds of wine vessels formixing and serving.14Rear wall (Fig. 5.2c): The kylikeion scene on the left wall mediates thetransition to the banquet scene on the rear wall; from left: a flute player (8),followed by four klinai, the first and the two last ones with male couples, thesecond one with a woman and a man (9–10); midway a young servant; trees in thebackground.15Right wall (Fig. 5.2d): This is the wall which has given the name to the tomb;from right (i.e. from the entrance wall): a winged demon climbs a rock (18),another (not winged) (17) sits with two bearded snakes in his hands looking backat the first demon. A third winged demon (16) pushes a woman (15) guided by thehand of a fourth one (14); they are met by a young boy (13) and a veiled woman(12). Behind the woman is a boat with a rudder and an unnamed person (11) onboard. This last scene bears a clear resemblance to the Greek Charon shippingdead souls to Hades across the river Styx, demonstrating well from where thisunique pictorial theme in Etruscan art was borrowed. We are in a hereaftersetting beyond the tomb.16On stylistic grounds, correlated with the date of the fragmentary remains ofobjects found in the grave and in the backfill of its entrance (the tomb hadalready been violated when excavated), the paintings have been dated to 450–430BC (or slightly later);17 this is some 2–3 generations earlier than other tombpaintings considered to show scenes from the nether world.18This tomb has quieted, but not fully silenced, the supporters of a politicalexplanation for the iconological change;19 for the supporters of theeschatological explanation nothing has changed, except for the date of theearliest influences of nether world mysteries from areas outside Etruria.What are the reasons for this iconological change in Etruscan funerary art? Arethey due to a ritual change, to changing rituals, or shall we look at thechange, not as a change in the Etruscan perception of life after death, butrather as a continuity?To answer this I shall apply two concepts to keep apart when studying materialculture in social contexts: content and form.20 Content is related to thecosmological ideas, myths, and aitia with which members of a society use toexplain social customs and phenomena. Form, on the other hand, is the way inwhich the content is presented. Content is less liable to be exposed to changethan form (thus being synchronic in character), and a change of form (beingdiachronic in character) does not necessarily indicate a change in content.Likewise, celebrations containing similar forms do not necessarily have the samecontent. However, by equating content and form one risks to give synchronicanswers to diachronic phenomena.21 My point of departure is thus not to lookprimarily on what impact external political situations and/or eschatologicalideas may have had on the Etruscans’ vision of death and afterlife, but ratherto look at the Etruscans’ visions of death as a social phenomenon and process towhich the surviving relatives gave expression.The content in the present funerary context are the ideas which the Etruscanshad about death and afterlife, in other words their eschatology. The form is theway in which the Etruscans expressed their ideas of death and afterlife infunerary material and practices, which in the present context means thepictorial themes in painted tombs, as, for example, dances, games, processions,banquets, erotic plays, etc., or, in other words, the funerary iconography.Similar themes can be found in contemporary funerary sculpture in the shape ofsarcophagi, ash urns, and grave markers and these will be referred to as thearguments are disclosed. The material to be examined here represents the ideasof the elite, but they are not necessarily much different from the beliefs ofthe other contemporary social groups of the same society, which through timeappropriated many of the elite’s forms of expression.22The purpose of this presentation is not to look at tomb paintings (and somesculpture) as isolated monuments, but to investigate if there is a common ideaor content, a kind of common denominator, behind the monuments which bind themall together – the guiding concepts in the presentation being ritual practicesand iconography.Tarquinia, with its great corpus of preserved tomb paintings, will be used as atest case, but tomb paintings were only one form through which eschatologicalideas were transmitted. The Etruscan cities had each its own way of expressingfunerary form, but if these different forms also expressed differenteschatological contents shall not be considered. However, the cities were notisolated nuclei without external contacts, I should therefore expect that thedifferences in form is not the result of major differences in the Etruscans’experiences of death, rather of local traditions and physical milieus. The fewtomb paintings found in other cities like Cerveteri, Chiusi, Orvieto, Veii,Vulci, and others (see Appendix A) (Fig. 5.1), follow all thematically theTarquinian model and may thus be used as an argument to sustain the postulation.Off to Greece – an iconographical connectionAll societies are bounded by a set of common rules, norms, and values; some arejuridical written in law codices and checked by established control bodies,others are ethical and maintained by common consent through controlling conceptslike honour, taboo, purity, etc. While the first can normally only be changed bythe same powers which implemented them, the others can change gradually bymanipulating and challenging the controlling concepts of the common consent – asort of social self-criticism, be that conscious or unconscious.As for taboos, for example, let us, within the argument of death, see how thishas changed over some generations within our own Western society. As a guide, Ishall use how death has been presented for over a century in crime stories onfilm and TV. In early films blood was in short supply at murder scenes. Theviewing public and the victim on the screen were respected and spared from undueviolence. With Arthur Penn’s film Bonnie and Clyde in 1967 the old taboo wasbroken. The final shoot-out of the two folk heroes was shown as realistically aspossible, and since then there has been no limit to how much blood has floodedthe Big Screen. However, the corpses as such were respected, no matter how muchviolence they had been exposed to. Today, when the TV set has become anever-present guest at the dinner table in many homes, in a number of soapoperas, you are invited into the forensic departments, where, in the name ofrealism and science, post-mortem examinations are served as the main side-dish.But this cinematic change in presenting the dead has not changed our visions ofdeath and the possible world beyond.In many ancient societies a presentation of the world beyond death may have beenconsidered a taboo. In the Greek society, for example, the nether world isdescribed by Homer in the 11th song in the Odyssey, but in the poem’s nearcontemporary Geometric Period, figural presentations of ceremonies of death areconfined to prothesis-and ekphora-scenes on grave markers in the shape ofamphorae and kraters.23 An early 6th century BC Corinthian kotyle showsHerakles, accompanied by Hermes, in a confrontation with Persephone and Hades,the last one running off towards the left, while the guardian dog Kerberos headsoff to the right.24 But this presentation of the Underworld is an exception. Itis not till the last quarter of the same century that figures of the Underworld,like Hades,25 Persephone (in her Underworld state),26 Kerberos,27 Sisyphos,28Thanatos,29 Hypnos,30 and Charon31 begin to appear with some frequency onAthenian black- and red-figure vases, though not all always in their Underworldhabitat. In the following century Charon in his boat takes the lead on a groupof white ground lekythoi produced in particular for funerary uses at home.32Furthermore, in southern Italy, at Lokri, in this early 5th century BC,terracotta plaques had also taken up the Underworld theme with Persephone on athrone alone or together with Hades receiving other gods and young girls.33 So,when Polygnotos painted his Nekyia in the Cnidian lesche at Delphi in the secondquarter of the 5th century BC,34 he built on an already established tradition,but his painting may have given new impetus to the theme even if, despite thefame of the murals, ‘there was no systematic dissemination of the Nekyia imagesinto the repertory of images used in Attic vase-painting’.35 The reason may bethat the painting was exhibited in a place far away from the important vaseproduction centres and could not easily be copied.However, it appears that the transition into the world beyond did not find muchenthusiasm with the Greeks. Having overcome the taboo of revealing the secretsof the other world the Athenian artists did not carry the theme any further.Charon’s presence in funerary art and the dead heroes became a short interlude.By the end of the 5th century BC the white lekythoi had been replaced bysculpted grave stones, which in the figural representations brought the funerarymotifs solidly back into the world of the living. It was only from the middle ofthe 4th century BC, with the Apulians in southern Italy, that the Underworldtheme would find further development. In a series of large amphora and volutekrater grave markers Hades and Persephone appear under a large white-paintednaiskos or temple-pavilion in the midst of many Greek heroes, including Orpheus,normally placed close to the reigning couple of the Underworld.36In T. dei Demoni Azzurri (phase 4) we recognised Charon and his boat, a motifcertainly borrowed from the Greek sphere, whether from the white lekythoi orthrough some other channels.37 The rocky landscape is a curiosity, but couldhave been inspired by Sisyphos’ punishment scenes, in which an Underworld rock(defining the borders of the otherworldly space) is present;38 the demonfurthest to the right even borrows the climbing posture from the punished Greekto underline the massive expanse of the borderline area. The central demon,without wings, has been identified with Eutynomos in Polygnotos’ Nekyia, thecorpse eating demon sitting on a vulture’s hide at the entrance to the GreekUnderworld – here transformed into a human figure with a vulture’s talon andbeak.39 In sum, elements are borrowed from Greek models, but they have beentransformed into what appears to be a pictorial world of the afterlife which ismainly Etruscan. One might suggest that the Greek pictorial world has functionedonly as a catalyst for changing the Etruscan world thereafter from an abstractidea into a more apprehensive image.So far the T. dei Demoni Azzurri is unique within the Etruscan funerarypictorial repertoire. In later presentations Charon – or Charu(n) – has left hisboat and exchanged the steering oar for a mallet, as shown in a few 5th centuryBC Felsinian grave stelae.40 The mallet was used to unbolt and bolt the doorinto the Underworld: thus the old ferryman has become its guardian.41 He worksalone or is accompanied by the female Vanth, who also often moves alone. Thethree nameless demons in the T. dei Demoni Azzurri may reappear among named orunnamed demons in other funerary contexts, and underline that the Etruscansimagined the other world peopled by ugly, more or less terrifying demons, whosepresence, as we shall see, was mainly to make sure the deceased should reachhis/her destination.Back to Etruria the liminal way – some further iconographical considerationsThe Etruscan pictorial world is characterised by a syncoptic or acronymisticnarrative style, which means that the number of iconographical elements areheavily reduced in order to impart a message to the viewer. This becomesespecially apparent when we now shall pass from Greek iconographical borrowingsand Etruscan syncoptic narrative styles to the transformation of the GreekUnderworld into the Etruscan apprehension of this otherworldly space. To do thiswe shall have to ask: What are the important pictorial themes in Etruscanfunerary art from the 6th and the 5th centuries BC, before the emergence of thenether world scenes? – No two tombs are alike in their combination of pictorialthemes, but seen together some singular pictorial motifs (here calledparameters) are more common than others, here listed chronologically as theyappear in the tomb paintings (for details, see Appendix B):A.Heraldic birds and animals, both real and mythical; animal battle scenes in aheraldic setting; Gorgoneia; ‘lararium’ type snakes.B.Subjects alluding to sea/water: boats/ships, dolphins, hippocamps, sea/watersnakes, Tritons, waves.C.Closed doors: squared or arched.D.Unconventional scenes: cornuto sign, bodily fluid emission scenes, eroticscenes, scenes with reference to laughter, phallus bird, purificationsacrifices, pygmies – and (in a Hellenistic grave) skeletons in boxes.E.Banquets, often accompanied by music (in both this world and the Underworld).F.Dances, most often accompanied by music.G.Scenes with blood, visible and potentially visible: Phersu, flogging, boxers,wrestlers, warriors, fights, and killings.H.Athletic games (excluding boxers and wrestlers: see parameter G), tug of war,and chariot races.I.Ritual objects: thymiateria and oversized kylikes.J.Horsemen (excluding mythical contexts and hunting scenes).K.Hunting scenes.L.Prothesis and related scenes.M.Weapon (or Pyrrhic) dances.What do these scenes refer to? – For some scholars the pictorial motifs inEtruscan funerary paintings refer to funerary rituals,42 in which case they mayrefer to rituals which took part after the moment of death, but before theinterment of the deceased, whether the body was inhumed or cremated. This meansat the moment when, following Arnold van Gennep’s model on passage rites, boththe deceased and the participants in the funerary ceremony found themselves inthe liminal phase of transition, between the phase of separation (the moment ofdeath) and the phase of reintegration (after the interment of the deceased).43In funerary rites this transitional phase was the most critical, during whichall participating members normally found themselves temporarily suspended fromnormal social life;44 they were in a border land in which strong powers anddangers were released and in which abnormal activities connected to dirt,obscenities, and lawlessness symbolically were just as relevant for theperformance of the rites as were more normal actions.45Societies reacted in different ways to this liminal period. An example close toour own time from Rome illustrates this well, as described by an eyewitness,when Pope Clemens IX died on December 9, 1669. At the announcement of death thebig Capitol bell started to peal and continued without interruption for threefull days and nights – until the Pope’s body had been transferred from theQuirinal, where he died, to St Peter’s. 46 In these days the situation in Romebecame ‘unsafe due to robbery, murder, and similar non deadly assaults, in thatno justice was held, nor malefactors arrested.’ Every person had to see to theirown protection till the bell stopped, when ‘the inquisition’ duly followed. Butwhatever protection was arranged, much mischief and many homicides occurred; atthis occasion three persons, in fact, were deliberately trampled to death byhorses.47According to van Gennep ‘those funeral rites which incorporate the deceased intothe world of the dead are most extensively elaborated and assigned the greatestimportance.’48 Since the Etruscans appear to have been much concerned about theafterlife, it may not come as a surprise that tomb paintings and sculpture referto this critical transitional phase. But what did the transitional ritualsconsist of, what was their significance, and how was this told in figurativeterms?The moment of death triggered a set of social mechanisms and funerary actions inwhich the deceased should be honoured according to his/her social standing andmerits. At the same time the corpse became a source of pollution, which had tobe counteracted with rituals of purification,49 and measures had to be taken inorder to help the deceased on his/her journey to the other world. Accordingly,in this liminal phase the funerary actions were of a threefold nature: honouringof the dead, alleviation of the deceased’s journey to the Underworld, andpurification of the funerary celebrants – at times the three kinds of actionsmay have overlapped.The parameters listed above may thus be divided into three funerary physical andmental spheres regarding the deceased. Of these parameters heraldic animals (A)and banquets (E) dominate on the rear wall, while the other parameters arespread out on the other three walls without following a strongly repetitivepattern:1. The celebration of the deceased: death, honour, and afterlife (parametersB, C, H, J, K, L, M)2. The liminal journey of the deceased: actions and counteractions(parameters A, D, F, G)3. The interment of the deceased: purification and reintegration (parametersE, I)The division is artificial; it was not organised as such in the minds of theEtruscans. The parameters and their meaning are separated into modern, virtualcompartments in an attempt to discover some sort of organisational pattern inthe use of the pictorial motifs – and through this pattern discover the Etruscanview on death and the meaning of their funerary practices as conveyed throughart expressions.The celebration of the deceased: death, honour, and afterlifeThe pictorial themes in this first group of parameters refer to the deceased(parameters K and L), to the celebrations of the deceased (parameters H and M),to the tomb (parameter C), and the journey to the Underworld (parameters B andJ).[../images/fig5_3.jpg]Fig. 5.3. Tarquinia, T. del Morente, rear wall (with kind permission ofMinistero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali, Soprintendenza per i beniarcheologici dell’Etruria Meridionale, Museo di Villa Giulia; photo no. 138666).The deceased and death: Hunting and prothesis (parameters K and L)On Greek Geometric funerary vases, prothesis- and ekphora-scenes dominated thepictorial repertoire, and prothesis-scenes were a recurring theme in Atticvase-painting similarly later.50 In the Archaic-Classical cippus base reliefsfrom Chiusi prothesis-scenes are not uncommon,51 but in tomb paintings they arerare. Only three examples are known, all from Tarquinia: T. del Morto (phase2:89), T. del Morente (phase 2:88) (Fig. 5.3), and T. del Letto Funebre (phase3:82). 52 Emotional expressions like wailing occur,53 but here it appears not tobe a theme of great interest and concern. The tomb paintings (and funeraryreliefs) demonstrate that the dead corpse was displayed in honourablecircumstances (on a kind of lit de parade), but apparently it was not the momentof death (or the presentation of the dead), nor the interment of the dead (neverpresented pictorially) which concerned the Etruscans most, rather what happenedin between these two events – in this funerary liminal phase. Though this doesnot mean that the deceased did not figure in funerary paintings and sculpture.We shall give more examples of their presence later.Hunting scenes have no immediate reference to funerary practices, but may referto the social status of the deceased, that is a person of the élite with whomhunting was not only an exciting game, but also an expression of socialadherence. Such pictorial scenes may thus be considered part of the honours paidto the deceased (cf. Fig. 5.2a).[../images/fig5_4.jpg]Fig. 5.4. Chiusi, T. della Scimmia, entrance wall, corner with right right wall(with kind permission of American Academy in Rome, Photographic Archive; photono. Moscioni 10534).Honour: Athletic games and weapon dances (parameters H and M)Funerary games in the shape of chariot races and athletic competitions mostlikely were introduced from Greece and performed in honour of the dead – apractice presumably reserved for the élite. It is assumed that such contestsmore had the character of celebrating the dead than being part of a funeraryliminal ideology.Likewise weapon dances – or Pyrrhic dances – were imported from Greece, orperhaps, more precisely, from Athens. In connection with the introduction ofdemocracy at Athens in the late 6th century BC, the city’s most importantreligious festival, the yearly Panathenaia, was reformed both in itsorganisation and programme. One reform was the introduction of Pyrrhic dances,performed as a competition between phylai – in this way tying the new politicaland administrative organisation to ritual performances. Attic black figure vasesdemonstrate that the Pyrrhic dances were not only performed during the yearlyfestival, but also at funerals.54 From here the new fashion may also havereached Etruria, though whether the Etruscans incorporated it only as a new,fashionable athletic game or transformed it into a meaningful element of theirfunerary liminal ideology, perhaps with reference to blood (see below), is atpresent difficult to decide (Fig. 5.4).[../images/fig5_5.jpg]Fig. 5.5. Tarquinia, T. degli Auguri, rear wall (with kind permission ofMinistero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali, Soprintendenza per i beniarcheologici dell’Etruria Meridionale, Museo di Villa Giulia; photo no.MAX7042).Afterlife I: False doors (parameter C)T. dei Demoni Azzurri (phase 4) was the earliest Etruscan tomb to depict anexplicit reference to the world of the dead, but it was not the first tomb torefer to a world beyond that of the living. It is generally agreed that paintedfalse doors of the dorica type (i.e. with marked, vertical door jambs andhorizontal lintel) on the tomb walls ‘symbolise the boundary between the worldsof the living and of the dead’55 (Fig. 5.5). The false door motif appearsalready in the earliest paintings from the first half of the 6th century BC atTarquinia, dies out in the second quarter of the following century, butreappears, now arched, in a new setting, from the second half of the 4th centuryBC.56 In its first phase, it is most often combined with scenes of dance andmusic (parameter F) or boxers/wrestlers and other kinds of fighting scenes(parameter G), often with blood running; in its second phase, the door isassociated with the nether world demons Charu(n) and Vanth. However, is itconceptually the same door? An answer shall be given later. For the time beingsuffice it to look at the false door as an entrance to the world beyond, anentrance which can only be entered after the time of death.Afterlife II: Water scenes and horsemen (parameters B and J)A long series of pictorial elements, either narratively or purely decoratively,allude to sea/water: boats/ships, dolphins, hippocamps, sea/water snakes,Tritons, waves (parameter B).57 These motifs are most often interpreted assymbols referring to the journey made by the deceased on his/her way to theUnderworld.58 The Greeks had to cross the river Styx to arrive at Hades;Acheron, giving name to the Acherontic Books (containing the sacra Acheruntia orthe Etruscan ‘Rituals of the Underworld’59), was the name of one of the majorrivers of the Etruscan Underworld. Apparently in both cultures the crossing ofwater was considered as part of the approach to the world of the dead, but theway a Greek or an Etruscan crossed these waters may not have been the same.These pictorial elements, referring to the hereafter liminal journey, presentedin a very syncoptic way, are the only ones which can be followed through everyphase of Etruscan tomb paintings from Archaic to Hellenistic times, thoughvarying in popularity from one period to another.60 In these scenes we havementally penetrated the false door (parameter C) and moved into the first stageof an Etruscan vision of life after death.For part of the liminal journey the dead were accompanied by one or morehorsemen (parameter J), ‘the traditional Etruscan allegorical representation ofthe voyage to the Underworld’,61 at times interpreted as the Dioscuri, theprotectors of travellers,62 or passage/door gods.63 This is well expressed in T.del Barone (phase 2: 44) (Fig. 5.6). On the rear wall (c) of the tomb isdepicted, flanked by two horsemen, a bearded man carrying a large kylix in hisout-stretched left hand, and with the right he accompanies a young flute player.In front of, but separated from them by a single-stemmed tree, stands a woman ina long dress with a veiled tutulus;64 she has raised both hands in some kind ofgreeting gesture. The music signals a sacred act with the very large kylix(parameter I) possibly referring to a funerary libation. The single stemmedtree(?) divides the space in two, as it can also be observed on a slightly laterbronze mirror where a tree distinguishes between outside and inside.65 Theveiled woman appears as the ‘object’ of the libation, but not as a livingperson; she has already crossed the border and it is offered to her in anotherworldly space. This central scene is in its turn separated from thehorsemen by branched trees, placing them in still a different funerary space.The horsemen reappear on both sidewalls: on the right wall (a) the two horsemenstand antithetically, each with his horse; on the left wall (b) they flank thedead tutulus woman already met on the rear wall (c). In their function asattendants of the deceased to the Underworld the walls can be read as threestages in a death journey narrative: the horsemen’s preparation for the journey(right wall); the moment of their departure together with the dead woman (leftwall); and the dead woman’s safe arrival in the Underworld, made possiblethrough the funerary rites and sealed with the duly performed sacrifices andlibations.66 If this interpretation is valid, already by the end of the 6thcentury BC in Etruria can be observed a vision of the deceased’s journey in theliminal space between this world and the Underworld, a world whichiconographically had not yet found its pictorial expression. However, the treesseparating the horsemen from the central scene on the rear wall signify that thehorsemen belong to the liminal space, not to the world of the living, nor to theUnderworld.The horsemen are thus attendants of the deceased. At times there are more thantwo appearing in a kind of procession, as visible in T. delle Iscrizioni (phase2:74) (Fig. 5.7) and T. dei Pigmei (phase 4:97). In none of these ‘processions’can the deceased be identified. We should therefore look at the horsemen only asattendants, symbolically representing the deceased on her/his liminal journey,and not search for the deceased among them.It may seem strange to see persons appearing in the same painting representingboth the deceased and the bereaved, but this constellation can be followed allthrough the Etruscan tomb paintings. In T. dei Giocolieri (phase 2:70), forexample, the person seated on a sella curulis, dressed in the regal togapurpurea, to the right on the rear wall, may by his attributes be identifiedwith the deceased person – perhaps a magistrate67 (Fig. 5.8). In T. degli Auguri(phase 2:42) a similarly dressed person on the right wall, accompanied by ayoung slave carrying his sella curulis (cf. Figs 5.5 & 5.13 left) may likewisebe the presentation of another deceased magistrate.68 In a world where eitherthe Underworld was still a taboo, or the society lacked a proper picture of it,the deceased is present overseeing that the funerary rites, made to help him onhis otherworldly journey, are held in a proper way. Later the deceased can befound in funerary processions, both as a charioteer and on foot, often carefullyguarded by the death demon Charu(n).69The liminal journey of the deceased: actions and counteractionsIn the first group of parameters we found references to the deceased’s socialstatus (and the honours which followed that) and to the journey of the dead,accompanied by horsemen towards the Underworld, made in a space beyond thisworld, marked by false doors. What happened in this journey of the dead the 6thand 5th century BC tomb paintings do not reveal – instead the paintings may showsome of the actions and counteractions the living funerary celebrants engaged into help the deceased on his/her journey, as already indicated.In the following I shall concentrate in particular on four pictorial themeslisted for the liminal journey: heraldic birds and animals (parameter A),unconventional scenes (parameter D), dancing (parameter F), and scenes referringto blood (parameter G) – in order to see what function they may have had in theset of actions the Etruscans established to counteract the dangers and fearsthey believed were set loose at the time of death.An important key to the reading of the tomb paintings in this light is T. dellaFustigazione (phase 3:67),70 in which heraldic animals, dancing, blood, and theunconventional are all present: In the pediment of both the entrance and rearwall are presented heraldic animal fights. The rear and the side walls all havea central false door flanked by various figures and figure scenes. On the rearwall the door is flanked on the left by a dancing kithara-player with an amphorastanding on the ground in front of him, on the right by a male dancer with alarge kylix in his right extended hand. Two boxers, ready to fight each other,flank the real door on the entrance wall, while on the left wall the false dooris flanked on the left by a dancer with a kylix held high above his head, and onthe right by a flute player. The right wall presents two erotic scenes (Fig.5.9): on the left a naked woman with tutulus(?) ‘embraces a young man amorously,while a bearded man tries to penetrate her from behind’71; on the right a nakedwoman, also with a tutulus(?) bends forward towards the hip region of ahalf-naked man with a satisfied smile (is she performing a fellatio?), while atthe same time she is beaten with a whip on a stick by a half-naked young man whoapproaches from behind and has placed his other hand on her buttocks. – Theheraldic animals and the dancing are easily recognisable, the blood isrepresented by the boxers and the flogged woman, and the unconventional scenesby the two erotic groups, of which the last one may even contain an element oflaughter.[../images/fig5_6.jpg]Fig. 5.6.

Figs 5.5, 5.8, 5.17, 5.24), Gorgoneia,and ‘lararium’ type snakes (Fig. 5.22) are the most numerous pictorial motifs inthe tomb paintings.72 They are nearly always to be found in the rear pediment ofthe tomb, perhaps the most important pictorial space – ‘similar to templepediments … apparently considered to be a superhuman, sacred space’.73 Heraldicanimals and birds figure often in Etruscan art from the Orientalising Period(from the 8th century BC onwards) borrowed from Greek and other Eastern sources.The Archaic presentation of them is often maintained in the tombs, as if tounderline their age and apotropaic powers.74 In their apotropaic powers theywere presumably considered both as guardians of the tomb and of the deceased,not only in a generic way, but perhaps in particular as protectors against thestrong transcendental powers and dangers released at the moment of death. Inthis way they helped the deceased on her/his journey to the Underworld.Counteraction I: Dancing (parameter F)The dancing scenes in Etruscan tombs are characterised by being individual forboth men and women, often underlined by separating trees: never do the dancerstouch each other, nor do they act in a concerted manner75 (Figs 5.10, 5.15,5.23b). Each dancer determines his/her own actions. The dances are ‘spirited,strenuous, even unrestrained’, with great gesticulations, but they often lackthe Dionysiac frenzies.76 All the same the Dionysiac label is often given tothese dances, whether directly or indirectly, by referring to the dancers askomasts (among whom women participated only occasionally).77 However, one mustbe careful when giving Greek terms to Etruscan scenes. Not all spirited,unrestrained dances are necessarily Dionysiac. In his analysis of the Chiusancippus base reliefs, Jean-René Jannot distinguished between two categories offunerary dances: those he named ‘a programme’ and free dances, each having itsown function within the funerary rituals.78 The tomb paintings may also beinserted into such a pattern; however, since my interpretative approach isslightly different from that of Jannot, I should like to make a distinctionbetween three possible contexts of dancing, in most cases accompanied by music:a barbiton, a flute, a kitharos, a lyre, or by a combination of two or moremusical instruments:1. Dionysiac komasts: In this group the merry revellers are all men and all,or most of them, carry their own vase used for containing, serving, or drinkingwine, as in T. delle Iscrizioni (phase 2:74) (see Fig. 5.19), but in no othertomb.2. Ritual performance: In many tombs one or occasionally two male dancerscarry a large kylix, most often close to the body (as on the rear wall of T. deiBaccanti (phase 2:43)) or on an out-stretched arm (as on the rear wall in T.5591 (phase 3:154)). It is carried out-stretched in the same way by the centralmale figure in T. del Barone (phase 2:44) (Fig. 5.5c), a scene which has noreference to drinking and dancing, but, as we saw above, rather to libation. Insuch scenes the accent is most likely more on the kylix as a ritual objectrather than as a merry-making drinking cup.793. Spirited, unrestrained dancing: Both male and females perform withoutdrinking vessels, the women at times having brought krotala, or castanetsalong.80 Here occurs an overlap with the ritual performers, as occasionally aspirited dancer carries the large kylix, perhaps the result of a narrativesyncoptic style, which has combined the spirited dance and the ritualperformance in one picture. It is interesting to note that none of the dancerson the Chiusian cippus base reliefs ever carry a wine vessel.[../images/fig5_10.jpg]Fig. 5.10. Tarquinia, T. dei Baccanti, left wall (with kind permission ofMinistero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali, Soprintendenza per i beniarcheologici dell’Etruria Meridionale, Museo di Villa Giulia; photo no. 8893D).If in this last group of dancing, wine does not play a central role, could it bethat the spritited dance was not performed to celebrate Dionysos, but hadanother particular function within the funerary ritual?Wine is not essential for spirited and unrestrained dancing; it can also becreated through the rhythm of the music, castanets, and a competitivetogetherness. In a funerary context dance could be used to express sorrow andwailing by pulling hair, scratching cheeks, tearing clothes, or chest beating,but this is not the case here.81 Dance could also be performed to ‘express adesire to turn … attention away from the contemplation of death, which holdsonly fear, sorrow, and uncertainty …’82, or in its bodily expression of motion,order and joy, it could be experienced as an antithesis to the ‘still, lifeless,polluting corpse.’83 However, in many societies, spirited dancing has also beenused to come in contact with transcendental forces. I therefore suggest, as atheory, that in Etruscan funerary practices the dance may have been consideredimportant because through the dance the performers could be brought into atrance, which in the next instance could bring them in contact with such forcesoutside their own body and cognitive world; forces which in one way or the othercould be warded off, or perhaps even manipulated to help the deceased on his/herjourney to the Underworld.84In the year 364 BC a plague broke out in Rome. Scenic entertainments wereinstituted as a last effort to appease the wrath of the gods. At this occasion,Livy (7.2) tells, also mimes (lat. ludiones), accompanied by flutes, werebrought in from Etruria to perform dances – ‘not ungraceful evolutions in theTuscan fashion’. Apparently Etruscans were famous for their dancing and theeffect it could have on transcendental forces.85Counteraction II: Scenes referring to blood (parameter G)According to the late Roman author Arnobius, in the Acherontic Books, theEtruscans promised ‘that by the blood of certain animals, divine souls (animae)become endowed with certain numinous spirits and they would be led away from thelaws of mortality.’86 In other words, a blood sacrifice was able to giveimmortality to dead souls.87No tomb painting displays an animal sacrifice,88 but on a funerary relief fromChiusi an ox/cow is brought forward to an altar, certainly in order to besacrificed (Fig. 5.11). The fire on the top of the altar is lit and next to itis placed a thymiaterion, or incense burner;89 incense was used forpurification, an important act in connection with sacrifices. – So whenthymiateria appear in Etruscan tombs (parameter I),90 most famous being the onein T. dei Giocolieri (phase 2:70) (Fig. 5.8),91 they refer symbolically tofunerary acts of purification (in which also a blood sacrifice could have beenperformed). What is actually portrayed in the painting of the T. dei Giocolieriis difficult to say, but an interesting guess would be that after purification,a game was instituted by which competitors tried to extinguish the purificationfire by throwing round objects – and perhaps a certain funerary privilege orattention was awarded the winner.92[../images/fig5_11.jpg]Fig. 5.11.

Tarquinia, T. degli Auguri, right wall (reconstruction drawing; withkind permission of American Academy in Rome, Photographic Archive; photo no.Moscioni 24133).If no animal blood sacrifice has been recorded in the tomb paintings, sceneswith the flowing of human blood are not infrequent, as in some scenes withwrestlers and boxers93 (Figs 5.12, 5.13, 5.23) in an erotic flogging scene (Fig.5.9),94 in ferocious games led by a masked person named Phersu (Fig. 5.13),95 towhich should be added also a late decapitation and combat scene.96 The armed,blood-running combats, visible in Lucanian tomb paintings from the 4th centuryBC (mainly), most likely belong to the same cognitive world.97 Could suchblood-thirsty scenes have served the same purpose as the animal sacrifices, togive immortality to the deceased’s soul?98 At death the blood stops running;flowing blood in a ritual context would thus be a symbol of life. Tertullian’sobservation that ‘… earlier, since it was believed that the spirits of the deadcould be appeased with human blood, they used at funerals to sacrifice prisonersof war or slaves of poor quality…’, may be a reflection of this kind ofthinking.99This may in the next instance explain why gladiatorial combats grew out offunerary games,100 and why such combats (munera) continued to be a returningingredient in later Roman funerary ceremonies and commemorative feasts for deadpersons. Their popularity among the public eventually turned these spectaclesinto shows arranged to attract political support (in some cases on the pretextof being funerary or commemorative), and over time lost their strong funeraryconnection.101 Instead the gladiator became an example of ‘male self-control inthe face of death’,102 and thus an old funerary ritual of life gradually changedinto a display of death, in which was created a tension between the fight asspectaculum and the fight as exemplum.103 The old tension between death and thelife-giving blood, procured through fighting, was thus buried.Counteractions III: Unconventional scenes (parameter D)The unconventional scenes, which appear to have reference to disorder andpollution, purification and apotropaic magic, I have divided into two genericgroups with reference to the body:1. SCENES REFERRING TO BODILY FUNCTIONS I: EROTIC AND BODILY FLUID EMISSIONSCENESErotic scenes may seem out of context in a funerary situation, but they doappear even if not frequently. The oldest Etruscan funerary item with referenceto sexual play is the Etrusco-Corinthian jug (630–600) found in a chamber tombat Tragliatella, inland from Cerveteri. In an incised frieze around the vaseappear two male-female copulation acts, one placed above the other – the exactmeaning much discussed.104 In tomb paintings sexual acts of various sorts aredocumented: in T. dei Tori (both a threesome with two males and one female and atwosome male-male copulation act) (phase 2:120) (Fig. 5.14); T. dellaFustigazione (two threesome acts with two males and a female, one with apossible anal penetration, the second with a possible fellatio-act) (phase 3:67)(Fig. 5.9); T. 4260 (badly damaged, but on the side walls traces of two- andthreesome erotic groups) (phase 3:156); and T. delle Bighe (among others, scenesof foreplay and copulation between young males) (phase 3:47). In T. delleLeonesse (phase 2:77) a young, black-haired woman, without tutulus, in light,translucent dress dances to the rhythm of her castanets up against a young,blond, naked man carrying a jug matching her movements (Fig. 5.15) – the sceneexudes of eroticism, but the erotic play is not so explicit as presented in theother paintings. With her left hand the woman makes a cornuto-sign, perhapswarding off evil. 105[../images/fig5_14.jpg]Fig. 5.14. Tarquinia, T. dei Tori: a) erotic scene from the rear wall (with kindpermission of Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali, Soprintendenza per ibeni archeologici dell’Etruria Meridionale, Museo di Villa Giulia; photo no.138714); b) erotic scene from the rear wall (with kind permission of AmericanAcademy in Rome, Photographic Archive; photo no. Moscioni 24120).[../images/fig5_15.jpg]Fig. 5.15. Tarquinia, T. delle Leonesse, rear wall, detail (with kind permissionof Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali, Soprintendenza per i beniarcheologici dell’Etruria Meridionale, Museo di Villa Giulia; photo no.IMG_0096).Mary Douglas in her discussion of pollution and taboo considered the body as amodel for any confined system, the body openings thus being the border areasconsidered vulnerable and exposed to danger.106 Therefore, copulations and theemission of bodily fluids can in metaphorical terms be considered astransgressions of the borders of the social and cultural order, causingpollution and disorder, which need to be repaired by acts of purification. Thestrange defecation scene in T. dei Giocolieri (phase 2:70) (Fig. 5.16) may beseen in the same context: having transgressed the borders of the body, thebodily wastes become a metaphorical picture of the pollution and disorder causedin the liminal area of the funerary process, when the social and cultural orderhas been abolished.107 On the right entrance wall to T. delle Iscrizioni (phase2:74), a white-haired man with a round belly, presented in the act of urinatinginto a low basin (Fig 5.17),108 might be explained along the same lines – theritual aspect of this act underlined by the ribbon tied around the head of theman’s penis.The thymiaterion used in T. dei Giocolieri (Fig. 5.8) could therefore well be anexpression of the purification acts implemented to repair the disorder in theliminal space caused by the border transgressions. However, the copulationscenes (Figs 5.9, 5.14) may at the same time refer to a transcendental dimensioncaused by orgasm. At that particular moment are released forces in the body,which bring the performers into a transcendental space outside him-/herself,where he/she may come in contact with transcendental forces with which the safejourney of the dead soul could be negotiated and defended. Orgasm, as well asdancing, are thus only two different ways of getting into contact with the otherworld; sometimes, as perhaps implied by the erotic dance in T. delle Leonesse(Fig. 5.15) the one may lead to the other, a phenomenon observed in primitivesocieties,109 and not unknown (in a secular way) in both a Roman LateRepublican110 and a modern disco culture. In such a setting the males sittingunder the stands in T. delle Bighe, shall perhaps not be interpreted asservants,111 but as males performing disorderly ritual acts in a funeraryliminal context.A further tomb, T. del Topolino (phase 2:119) may also belong to the sameconceptual world, but with a different twist: on the left side wall flies aphallus-bird (Fig. 5.18),112 a motif borrowed directly from Greek models.113 Thebird having an apotropaic function may have been included to ward off theliminal evils and dangers – the possible ejaculation of semen,114 a sign oforgasm, being an indirect reference to the transcendental space in which theseevils and dangers belonged.115However, it is wise to show some prudence in putting all scenes of apparentlysimilar content under the same interpretative umbrella. Each scene has to beevaluated in its proper pictorial context. Returning to T. delle Iscrizioni(phase 2:74) it cannot be excluded that the urinating scene described above mayhave had a completely different meaning. The white-haired man, facing left,raises his right hand in a gesture of greeting(?), in the left he carries a longstick with a split end (symbol of an official position?). Opposite him a nakedboy bends forward holding a short stick in each hand, giving the scene a furthernarrative content (Fig. 5.17). On the left entrance wall two naked men standgesticulating on either side of a round table, discuses hanging on the wall.Above the head of the urinating man is written his family name: Matve. The samefamily name, together with the first name Larth, appears above the head of thefront white-haired komast on the right wall, the only one carrying wreaths.116He is naked(?)117 and presented slightly isolated from the other komasts (alsothey are named through inscriptions) on the same wall (Fig. 5.19). The twowhite-haired persons appear to be the same, possibly the deceased. Carlo Ruspiin his drawing of the entrance wall did not notice the white-haired man’s fluidemission jet and he interpreted the object held by the naked boy in his lefthand, not as a stick, but as a fish.118 For this reason the two scenes on theentrance wall have been seen as part of a sacrificial act,119 a situation whichcannot be sustained anymore (and which, by the way, was never shown so directlyin tomb paintings). However, the scene, in its narrative context, may not beseen as part of a disorderly, liminal act either. Since the urine appears to becollected in a basin, should we perhaps rather see the scene as an expression ofa symbolic ceremonial act, in which the stress is not on the urination, ratheron the urine, which has a disinfecting property and since it belonged to thedeceased, could have been used with extra effect in some purification act in thecourse of the funerary practices?120[../images/fig5_16.jpg]Fig. 5.16.

SCENES REFERRING TO BODILY FUNCTIONS II: LAUGHTERDid the Etruscans laugh? Most likely so, but what made them laugh? That is aquestion containing many restrictive impediments of definition: the lack of acomic literature and of a more subtle knowledge of the Etruscan language, thereliance on visual media most of which come from funerary contexts, the lack ofa homogeneous people and culture, and finally, who makes the joke, the client orthe patron?121 The observations are right, but is a funerary context really animpediment to display humour?122 Perhaps it is just the context in which humourshall be sought.In Rome, actors dressed as satyrs could form part of the aristocratic funeralprocessions.123 They preceded the bier, mimicking and hence mocking the seriousmovements of the others in a dance called the sicinnis. What is more, comicmerriment formed part of at least one emperor’s funeral, as the one arranged forVespasian. As was the practice, a leading mime, in this case the archimimusFavor, donned the death mask of the emperor and mimicking, as is the practice,the deportment and speech of the dead man, [he] asked the imperial procuratorswho were there, in front of everyone, how much the funeral and procession hadcost. When he heard ‘10 million sesterces,’ he retorted, ‘Give me (i.e. Favorhimself) 100 and you can throw my (i.e. Vespasian’s) body into the Tiber’.124Parody and laughter was thus incorporated as an important element in the Romanritual practices surrounding the deceased in his liminal state of transition.Was it also so in an Etruscan context?[../images/fig5_17.jpg]Fig. 5.17.

Tarquinia, T. degli Auguri, left wall (reconstruction drawing; withkind permission of American Academy in Rome, Photographic Archive; photo no.Moscioni 24139).Laughter promotes solidarity and it releases stress and eases social andpersonal tensions,125 a situation not uncommon in funerary ceremonies. Throughlaughter you could conceal your real feelings and to the rest of the communityshow that you were in control of yourself. Such a control situation was, forexample, some years ago observed with great dismay in a Danish court murder caseregarding honour. A Pakistani father had organised his whole family, friends,and employees to track down his young daughter and boy-friend who had broughtshame on the family. During very sensitive witness hearings the public,including the accused persons and family, were brought to an adjoining chamberto follow the hearings via internal loudspeakers. In the eyes of the public,instead of guilt and penitence, the involved persons reacted incredibly to thehearings with laughter. This was their way to subdue real feelings and a way tosave face in the eyes of their own family and countrymen.126Laughter in funerary situations creates contradictory feelings; laughterimproves your mood in a moment of distress and could thus well be regarded as anappropriate liminal condition of emotional disorder. However, laughter is alsoanother bodily action in which you can lose control of your senses and come incontact with transcendental forces. Laughter could have had many functionswithin an Etruscan funerary context; the allusions to it made in their funeraryart may confirm this. The examples are few, but perhaps significant – moresituations may escape our attention, since the Etruscans’ sense of humour andbody language is still a field of study to be explored more closely.The most obvious theme appears in the T. dei Pigmei (phase 5:97),127 in whichpygmies fight large cranes (Fig. 5.20), a theme well known from Greek literatureand art,128 here presented as a hilarious fight between undersized, clumsyhumans and oversized birds. The motif appears at the end of the left wall in acrammed space above a loculus and thus fitted the wall well; it was insertedbetween a procession of six horsemen (starting on the entrance wall: parameterJ) and the rear wall banquet (parameter E). The pygmies lived at the end of theworld129 and could well have functioned as a trait d’union between a liminalfunerary escort and the banquet in the world beyond,130 but this does noteliminate the comic aspect of the fight, as also clearly present in contemporaryGreek presentations.131Fights, athletics, and acrobatics are a fertile field for puzzlement andlaughter, as, for example, the small acrobat squatting on the head of a bigcharioteer, who tries to control a biga in T. del Guerriero (phase 5:73). Thecontrol of the horses is taken over by another small acrobat, who sits on theback of one of the horses. Is this an athletic competition or a burlesque gamearranged to create laughter?Another example is taken from T. degli Auguri (phase 2:42). Here on the rightwall we have already met Phersu directing a ferocious game between a dog and aman with a covered head. On the left wall Phersu reappears, alone, next to a manrunning and two boxers facing each other. Running away with a raised, closedfist, but looking back, he imitates in an exaggerated, parodying manner both therunner and the opening gestures of the two boxers (Fig. 5.21).132 Mockery, ofwhich this is a very good example, is a common and primitive way of creatinglaughter and well known from later Roman political life.133 In T. del Pulcinella(phase 2:104), Phersu mimics in accentuated movements a runner and at Chiusi inT. della Scimmia (phase 3:25), pictured as a dwarf, he mimics a flute player,who stands opposite him and plays for a weapon dancer (Fig. 5.4).134 In T. delGallo (phase 5:68), a masked man in a fell-jacket dances with a woman; heimitates the unrestrained dance of a satyr, she that of a maenad. The mask isnot that of Phersu, rather (if the practice can originally by ascribed to someEtruscan funerary custom135) a death mask, donned a person to mimic theparticipants in the funerary ceremonies in the dance similar to that which theRomans called sicinnis, or to impersonate in a burlesque way the dead person, ashappened in Vespasian’s funerary procession just described above.A more sophisticated scene of imitation to create laughter may be a detail inthe rear wall motif in T. dei Vasi Dipinti (phase 2:123) (Fig. 5.22): Thepicture is dominated by a man-woman symposium scene; to the left, in smallerdimension is depicted a well-dressed young woman sitting on a diphros, or stool,dressed in the same way as the symposium lady in a long chiton, with a mantle, atutulus hair-dress, and large disc-shaped ear-rings. In her lap sits a nakedyoung man with a dove in his hand. The dove confirms the erotic character of thescene,136 but the situation is thrown upside down – normally a naked hetairawill court a man, but here a naked ‘gigolo’ appears to court a soberly dressedwoman. If this was the message, the first astonishment of the viewer most likelywould have turned into laughter.137Erotics and bodily necessities have always been a fertile field for expressingwittiness and humour, but here, as in the other cases of interpretationpresented above, it is difficult to draw a precise line between what is ritualand what is not; sometimes the two fields of interpretation overlap, sometimesit may not be a question of either-or, but rather of both-and. The defecatingman in T. dei Giocolieri (phase 2:70) (Fig. 5.16) is one such instance ofdifficult interpretation – the scene draws the smile from a modern viewer, butwas this the artist’s/patron’s intention with regard to their contemporaryviewers? And what about the urinating old man to the right of the entrance in T.delle Iscrizioni (phase 2:74) (Fig. 5.17)? In the right erotic scene in T. dellaFustigazione (phase 3:67) (Fig. 5.9b), in which the whipped, naked womanapparently performs a fellatio on the right male, his blissful, ‘transcendental’smile evokes a reciprocal smile from the modern viewer (and also from theancient one?). At the same time the naked woman appears as unclean, using hermouth in sexual play,138 and about to be penetrated from behind(?) by another. –Was humour also the purpose of one of the erotic scenes in T. dei Tori (phase2:120) (Fig. 5.14b)? Above the door into the right back chamber a human-headedbull charges towards a homoerotic couple – the anal penetrator turns round anddoes not see the approaching danger, while the penetrated, who sees it, tries tohide behind a slender tree, but is unable to move.139[../images/fig5_22.jpg]Fig. 5.22. Tarquinia, T. dei Vasi Dipinti, rear wall (water colour copy by L.Schultz; with kind permission of Deutsches Archäologisches Institut, Rome, photono. 2013.0207; photographer H. Behrens).Also the phallos-bird in T. del Topolino (Fig. 5.18), weighed down by heavytesticles and with a tuft of black hair where the erect penis meets the wings ofthe bird (an unusual creature in Etruscan art), may have called for a smile orlaughter. And we may also ask, if not for a humorous touch, what was thefunction of the mouse balancing on a branch to the left of the closed door onthe end wall. Further, three small, grey mice play(?) with a man lying on hisstomach in the pediment of the T. delle Olimpiadi, perhaps another humoroustouch without further significance.In this part of the presentation we have discussed a selected number of funeraryscenes as an integrated part of the funerary ceremonies connected to liminality,that is actions taken by the funerary participants in order to ease the journeyof the deceased towards the Underworld at a time when disorder and pollutionthreatened both the deceased and the society of the living. This could partly bedone through the flowing of blood as a means of offering immortality to the deadsoul. Another way was through spirited, unrestrained actions, dancing, laughter,and orgasm to get in contact with the deceased’s transcendental, liminal worldin order to negotiate with the sinister and dangerous forces which were activethere. But this liminal period of agonising social disorder and pollution couldnot last – it had to come to an end – and make sure that the deceased reachedhis/her goal. This was accomplished through acts of purification and ritualreintegration.The interment of the deceased: purification and reintegrationDeath in a Roman context was synonymous with pollution, both of the place inwhich it occurred and of the persons who came in contact with the dead body,both directly and indirectly (as, for example, through eye-contact). Manymeasures were taken to protect and purify both places and persons from thesocial exclusion and isolation that followed the contact with death. This mustcertainly also have been the case with the Etruscans, with their ideas (or thecontent) of death and pollution being similar, but the form in which they foundtheir expressions perhaps somewhat different. The acts of protection andpurification were adopted to neutralise the pollution, which appeared indifferent forms in the course of the transitional rites that characterised thefunerary process, their aim being both to help the soul of the dead person tofind its way to the world beyond and to restore the imbalance created in societyat the moment of death and to reintegrate the bereaved into society.140Two sorts of pictorial scenes referring to purification and reintegration can bedetected in the tomb paintings: the presence or the carrying of ritual objects(parameter I) and the banquet (parameter E). In addition, more pictorialelements (more or less hidden) in the tomb paintings may have carried referencesto purification even if not treated as separate parameters in the presentcontext. The many pictorial allusions to water (parameter B)141 referring to thejourney to the Underworld, including a passage of water, could well also havecontained a reference to purification, as water has a strong purifying power.Another element of purification was laurels, so often pictured in the tombpaintings, separating scenes and figures in their various tasks, in particularin connection with the liminal actions.142Purification: Ritual objects (parameter I)Ritual objects are few and far between. Only two objects reappear with somefrequency: thymiateria, or incense burners, and large kylikes.The thymiateria, used for purification in connection with animal sacrifices (cf.parameter G) and to repair the disorder in the liminal space caused by bordertransgressions (parameter D), have already been discussed above,143 but theyappear also in contexts with athletic/chariot games (T. delle Bighe (phase 3:47)and T. della Scimmia (phase 3:25), underlining the ritual character of thesefunerary ceremonials, and with banquets (T. del Biclinio (phase 4:46)).144 Inthe last tomb, the thymiaterion appears on the rear wall, to the left of a falsedoor, together with two trees and a servant, juxtaposing a servant and akylikeion with vases on the other side of the door. The kylikeion refers to abanquet, which in this grave is not painted on the rear, but on the side walls.The presence of the thymiaterion underlines the ritual aspect of the banquet, inwhich purification was part of the ritual – or, alternatively, it functioned asa symbol for the banquet being itself a funerary purification ritual. In T.Golini I (phase 6:32) at Orvieto, a thymiaterion is also placed on thekylikeion, again underlining the ritual character of the accompanying banquetscene, though this time the scene is not placed in this world, but in theUnderworld with Aita and Phersipnai present. It appears thus that thethymiaterion, as a ritual object could be used both in this and in theUnderworld (presumably symbolically referring to the purifications among themourners in the world of the living), but it is never found in the liminal spaceof the journey to the Underworld. Apparently during this critical part of thefunerary ceremonies no acts of purification were performed.[../images/fig5_23.jpg]Fig. 5.23. Tarquinia, T. dei Leopardi, a) left wall; b) right wall (with kindpermission of Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali, Soprintendenza per ibeni archeologici dell’Etruria Meridionale, Museo di Villa Giulia; photo no.224066 (a) and 224069 (b)).Kylikes are carried both in banquets and in dancing scenes, though in some casesthe kylix is presented oversized. Such large kylikes find their confrontation insome Tarquinian tombs from the late 6th century BC in the shape of a few Atticred-figure examples with a diameter of 0.37–0.52 m,145 that is about the doublesize of a normal drinking cup. They may have been included among the grave findsbecause of their ritual function, perhaps in connection with a wine offeringduring the deposition of the dead and before the closing of the grave.The kylix carried in the T. dei Leopardi (phase 3:81) is a good example tosupport this argument (Fig. 5.23a): on the left wall of the tomb, a kithara- anda fluteplayer are followed by four men carrying respectively a staff and analabastron, an open box (pyxis)146 and a low bowl or mirror, a jug and a bowl,and a ladle, some, if not all objects, serving ritual purposes. On the rightwall (Fig. 5.23b), a man carrying a large, black kylix, is followed by a fluteplayer, a lyre-player and two more persons, who are more walking than dancing.If seen together the two side walls refer to a funerary procession, most likelysacrificial, in which the kylix may indicate the imminent wine offering act ofpurification at the grave before it is closed.A similar argument was put forward in connection with the T. del Barone (phase2:44) when discussing the accompanying horsemen (parameter J):147 on the rearwall the central man with a large kylix in his out-stretched hand performed alibation act for the deceased woman confronting him (Fig. 5.6c) – or perhapsmore precisely, he made the final offering to his wife, before he rituallysealed the tomb, symbolically affirming that the dead soul had reached its finaldestination, the Underworld. When the grave was closed – the final act in theceremonies could be undertaken, the banquet.In a possible total of ten tombs,148 though in each case in a different setting,the large kylix is carried close to the body or stretched out, obliquely, or onedge; in the last case this is as if to underline that an action is about tobegin by filling the cup from a volute krater in front – or that the action hasalready been performed. Large kylixes are at times also used by the centralfigure at the depicted symposia, where they may appear as simple drinking cups,or, in a narrative syncoptic way, refer to a ritual act already performed beforethe funeral banquet, which in itself is another ritual act.A third ritual object, the double axe, often used to slaughter sacrificialanimals, should also be mentioned, but it appears perhaps only in two very earlytombs, T. della Nave at Cerveteri (phase 1:7) and T. Campana at Veii (phase1:176), and shall not be considered any further here.149Reintegration: Banquets (parameter E)The by far dominant pictorial theme in the Etruscan tomb paintings was heraldicanimals (parameter A), followed by the banquet, both occupying nearlyexclusively the rear wall of the tomb. In T. delle Leonesse (phase 2:77) thebanquet occupies the sidewalls, the rear wall reserved for an enormous bronzevolute krater, a symbol of the dead buried in an urn in the niche cut in thewall below.150 In T. del Biclinio (phase 4:46) the banqueters also occupy thesidewalls of the tomb, but here they are symbolically tied to the rear wallthrough the presence of a kylikeion.The banquet could consist of one or more klinai carrying male-female ormale-male couples, at times assisted by young servants, at times by musicians –and thus follows (with the exclusion of the male-female couple) more or less theoriginal Greek pictorial scheme. In the tombs, the banquet scenes started in thepedimental field of the rear wall, as can be seen in the phase 2 tombs T.Bartoccini (45), T. Tarantola (114), T. della Caccia e Pesca (50), T. delTopolino (119), T. 5039 (60), T. delle Olimpiadi (92), T. 5898 (167), T. delFrontoncino (66), and T. 4780 (157). However, in T. 1999 (141) around 510 BC,banquet scenes moved down to cover the entire wall below and remained there.151The ritual character of the banquet is demonstrated by T. del Biclinio, in whichthe rear wall scene with the kylikeion is balanced by a thymiaterion on theother side of the central, false door. In T. dei Leopardi (phase 3:81) thesacrificial procession on the side walls ends with the banquet scene on the rearwall (Fig. 5.24), demonstrating an interesting sequence of events, in which thefunerary sacrifices, generally of a purificatory character at the end of theceremonies, as revealed above, precede the banquet. The banquet scene thusappears as the final ritual act of the funerary ceremonies, and as the lastceremony it signals the end of the deceased’s liminal journey to the Underworld.Through this final ritual act the deceased has been received and reunited withhis ancestors in the world where Aita and Phersipnai reign. At the same time,the banquet functions as a reintegration of the bereaved into society, nowcleansed from the pollution absorbed in the liminal phase of the ceremonies.The banquet is thus the most important ritual act of the funerary ceremonies(see also Fig. 5.22). This explains the motif’s popularity and for the samereason, as the final funerary act, why it occupies the rear wall – and why italso decorated the lids of an endless number of sarcophagi and ash urns.152 Theother walls in the tomb, when a banquet scene is presented, portray sceneseither with reference to the deceased’s life and honours offered to him/her, orto liminal actions and counteractions, or both, hence the funerary ceremoniesleading up to the integration of the deceased in the Underworld and thereintegration of the living back into society.The banquet scene in its early period always belongs to this world,153 but withthe T. dei Demoni Azzurri (phase 4) a change appears. On the left wall ispresented a procession with three dancers, two musicians and, in the centralpart, a biga with a man about to enter (Fig. 5.2b). The biga, not being part ofa competition, most likely belongs to the deceased. Here, as in earlier tombs weparticipate in an action of this world (the dancers and musicians) in which thedeceased participates. On the right wall we are already in the world of thedeath journey, crowded with death demons and an encounter by the boat, whichcarries the deceased (here in the shape of a woman) to the Underworld (Fig.5.2d).154 The rear wall is occupied by a banquet, four klinai, three withman-man couples, the second from left with a man-woman couple, perhaps referringto the two deceased persons: the man in biga on the left wall and the woman bythe boat on the right wall (Fig. 5.2c). Both scenes on the side walls belong tothe liminal phase of the celebrations: on the left a procession for the deceasedman with dancing and music taking part in this world to help; on the right, thedeceased woman on her infernal journey. The final result of both actions is thebanquet. On the left wall the earthly liminal phase finishes with a finalbanquet (with the deceased couple present) to seal the tomb and cleanse theparticipants in the funeral of their final death pollution; on the right theliminal death journey finishes in the Underworld, where the arrival likewise iscelebrated by a banquet. The two banquets occur simultaneously, but according tothe side wall being read, the banquet depicted belonged either to one or theother world.[../images/fig5_24.jpg]Fig. 5.24. Tarquinia, T. dei Leopardi, rear wall (with kind permission ofMinistero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali, Soprintendenza per i beniarcheologici dell’Etruria Meridionale, Museo di Villa Giulia; photo no. 224067).This kind of dichotomous reading of the same scene is not unique. In theslightly later T. dei Pigmei (phase 5:97) on the entrance and the left wall arepresented six riders155 moving towards the rear wall with six banqueters, onlyinterrupted by a funny Geranomachia scene (battle between pygmies and cranes)(Fig. 5.20). This has been interpreted collectively as the deceased’sotherworldly journey; the Underworld could only be reached after having passedthe Land of the Pygmies.156 On the right wall a procession of magisterialcharacter moves towards the same rear wall. Both side wall scenes refer to theliminal phase of the funerary ceremonies: the one on the right wall to the worldof the living; the one on the left to the otherworldly journey of the deceased.According to which wall is read their goal is the same: the final purificatorybanquet for the living and the welcome banquet for the deceased, respectively.[../images/fig5_25.jpg]Fig. 5.25. Tarquinia, T. dell’Orco II, detail (with kind permission of Ministeroper i Beni e le Attività Culturali, Soprintendenza per i beni archeologicidell’Etruria Meridionale, Museo di Villa Giulia; photo no. 315).Less than a couple of generations later, just after the middle of the 4thcentury BC, the banquet scene has moved definitely to the Underworld with Aitaand Phersipnai participating in the celebrations, as visible in T. Golini I(phase 6: 32) and T. dell’Orco II (phase 6: 94) (Fig. 5.25). By this time a newpictorial world has emerged in the tomb paintings, a world whichiconographically has little or nothing to do with the earlier scenes.A new world – down underThe new pictorial world which emerges in Etruscan tomb paintings from around themiddle of the 4th century BC (even if some parameters have already appeared insingular examples previously) can be summarised as follows:N.Demons in various guises: as winged genii, Charu(n), Lasa?, Tuchulcha, or Vanth,though in most cases unnamed.O.Processions (see also parameter J: Horsemen): in a ritual setting, the deceasedin a chariot, magisterial processions.P.Encounters (reunions beyond this world).Q.The Underworld with Hades/Aita and Persephone/Phersipnai present.R.Underworld mythological figures.The motifs all carry a reference to the liminal world of the journey (parametersN–P) or to the Underworld itself (parameters Q–R). Most of the old pictorialthemes die out in the course of the 4th century BC; only a few, parameters B andC, linger on into the following two centuries (Tables 5.1 and 5.2): the waterscenes with a renewed vitality, while the doors appear in a new setting.The liminal journey I: Demons (parameter N)The most common and also characteristic motif in this new phase of tombpaintings are demons of various sorts, some named, some not. Their fluorit wasin the second half of the 4th and in the 3rd century BC and they vanished in thecourse of the 2nd century BC. However, winged demons have been recorded as earlyas in the second half of the 6th century BC, as in one of the terracotta plaquesof the Campana series from Cerveteri, but it was not till the following centurythat they appeared in a proper tomb context.157 In T. dei Demoni Azzurri (phase4) they appear for the first time in full measure: four in all, none of themnamed (Fig. 5.2d). One of them stands in a boat, like the Greek Charon, ready toship the deceased across the river Styx, but this is the only time a Greek modelis used for such an otherworldly scene.[../images/fig5_26.jpg]Fig. 5.26.

Distribution of Etruscan tomb paintings in numbers within each phase(1–8) according to the pictorial parameters (A–R).[../images/table5_1.jpg]Table 5.2. Distribution of Etruscan tomb paintings in percentages within eachphase (1–8) according to the pictorial parameters (A–R).[../images/table5_2.jpg]The fierce-looking Etruscan Charu(n) with a hawk-beak shaped nose and dressed ina short chiton, often winged, sometimes carrying snakes, seems to have borrowedhis name from the Greek model (Figs 5.26 and 5.28). In an early version, he wasdonned with a paddle/rudder,158 the symbol of the Greek ferryman, but in hisEtruscan function as gate keeper he soon changed this for a mallet used to boltand unbolt the gate to the Underworld. His female counterpart, the sweet-lookingVanth, is also dressed in a short chiton, boots, and carries torches to lightthe way for the deceased to the Underworld (Fig. 5.26). Her name appeared inwriting on an aryballos from Vulci from about 600 BC, but it is not till the 5thcentury BC that we find a first possible pictorial presentation of her presentedas a winged demon attending the seated or semi-reclining deceased in a Chiusinefunerary statue group.159Both Vanth and Charu(n) are shown, either alone flanking real or false doors inthe grave, or they accompany deceased persons whether present in the world ofthe living or in that of the infernal liminal space. A third demon, Tuchulcha,only named once in the T. dell’Orco II (phase 6:94), also fierce-looking likeCharu(n), is present in the Underworld of Aita and Phersipnai, but he appears tobe the only demon present in the Underworld. 160 Both Vanth and Charu(n), aswell as other demons, seem to be able to move both in the world of the livingand in the liminal infernal world, but they never appear in scenes of theUnderworld itself.161The liminal journey II: Processions (parameter O)Processions of some sort appear in various ways in the tomb paintings. An earlykind can be observed in T. dei Leopardi (phase 3:81) (Figs 5.23a–b), in whichmen and women carrying ritual objects move in a parallel way on both side wallstowards the banquet on the rear wall. This procession, singular of its kind, asobserved above, appears to be of a sacrificial character.In T. dei Demoni Azzurri (phase 4) on the left wall a man entering a biga isvisible (Fig. 5.2b). Its triumphal spirit anticipates a theme popular in laterEtruscan funerary art, though it is more or less contemporary with two othertombs showing a similar theme in Tarquinia, T. Francesca Giustiniani (phase4:65; on the rear wall) and T. Querciola I (phase 4:106; on the entrance wall,above the door). If the interpretation of these three tombs is right, in all thetombs the deceased is placed in the liminal phase of the funerary celebrationsamong scenes of dancers and musicians. The theme with a chariot can be followedthrough the 4th century BC in T. Golini I (phase 6:32), T. Golini II (phase6:33), and T. degli Hescanas (phase 6:34), but then disappears in favour ofprocessions on foot.162 In these paintings the biga is placed definitely in anotherworldly sphere; the liminal journey in two cases (T. Golini II and T. degliHescanas) underlined by the running wave border (parameter B) on the chariotitself.An early procession on foot can be witnessed in T. Golini II, where on the leftwall it is inserted between the biga on the left side of the door and a banquetat the end of the side wall. In the procession are officials (carrying theirsigns of office) and musicians, a composition followed up in later tombs andoften referred to as magisterial processions,163 perhaps including a eulogygiven in the forum to celebrate specially deserved members of the society. Insuch processions, but not present in the Golini tomb, the deceased isaccompanied by one or more death demons.[../images/fig5_27.jpg]Fig. 5.27. Tarquinia, T. del Tifone, right wall (reconstruction drawing; withkind permission of American Academy in Rome, Photographic Archive; photo no.Moscioni 24084).When the death demons disappear from the paintings, as in T. del Convegno (phase8:58) and in T. del Tifone (Fig. 5.27), the processus magistratualis has turnedfrom being a liminal procession, with reference to the infernal, to becoming acommemorative one in this world.164 The procession has been individualised, withthe deceased present as if alive, which he was symbolically in Roman funeraryprocessions where a member of the family carried his death-mask.165 The finalstage of this pictorial process is visible, for example, in the Late Republicanmarble relief from Amiternum which displays a funeral procession with thedeceased carried on a funeral coach.166 Hence, we are back to where we startedto trace the pictorial tradition, the ekphora on the Geometric vases in Athens.The liminal journey III: Encounters (parameter P) – with a return to the Falsedoors (parameter B)Scenes which I prefer to call encounters are despite their easy identificationperhaps one of the more enigmatic in Etruscan funerary art. They show peoplethat meet, normally in the presence of one or more death demons, named or not,most often recognised as Charu(n) with his mallet and Vanth with her torches.167In most cases the encounter happens in front of a closed, arched door.168 Theproblem, much discussed, regards whether the scenes portray a farewell situationbetween the deceased and bereaved relatives in this or in the infernal, liminalworld, or a reunion situation between the deceased and ancestors in the sameinfernal world.169 One answer to the question may lie in the identification ofthe closed, arched door.The doors in the tomb paintings rightly ‘symbolise the boundary between theworlds of the living and of the dead,’170 but the paintings show two kinds ofdoors: the traditional porta dorica with vertical door jambs and horizontallintel, a type which appeared already in the 6th and lasted into the 3rd centuryBC (Fig. 5.5); and the arched door having the shape of a city gate (Fig. 5.28),which appeared only in scenes of encounters from the 3rd century BC onwards. Dothese refer to different doors and, if so, to which of these did Charu(n) havethe ‘key’?The Etruscans operated with three spaces in their funerary ideology: the spaceof the living, the space of the infernal, liminal journey, and the Underworld ofAita and Phersipnai proper. The presence of the arched door may mean that theshape was chosen to distinguish it conceptually from the porta dorica, which inearlier tomb contexts had acquired a specific meaning. Since the Etruscanspictorially had no specific vision of the Underworld till after the middle ofthe 5th century BC, I would postulate that the porta dorica led to the spacewhich apparently was the most significant one for the Etruscans – the infernal,liminal space in which the deceased met the most serious challenges on the wayto the Underworld,171 in which the ancestors domiciled. The arched gate, whenthe visual idea of the Underworld began to develop, thus was chosen to mark theentrance to Aita’s reign. Charu(n), who could move in both the space of theliving and of the infernal, liminal journey, but not in the Underworld itself,had the ‘key’ to both doors.[../images/fig5_28.jpg]Fig. 5.28. Tarquinia, T. Querciola II (with kind permission of DeutschesArchölogisches Institut, Rome, photo no. D-DAI-ROM-83.1096).The scenes with arched doors were therefore linked to the second space, that ofthe infernal, liminal journey. While the deceased could still move and bepresent in the world of the living, the Etruscan tomb paintings give no explicitexample of the living moving about in infernal spaces. Thus, it is likely thatthe encounters be considered as a reunion between the deceased and his/herancestors. That would in a liminal way of thinking, as clearly demonstrated bythe tomb paintings, be the most reassuring result of the liminal actions andcounteractions taken by the bereaved to secure the deceased a safe arrival downunder.As Charu(n) also his companion Vanth could only move in the space of the livingand of the infernal, liminal journey. This is well expressed in the Hellenisticsarcophagus of Hasti Afunei: at the left end a female demon, named Culśu, exitsthe arched door of the Underworld while Vanth waits outside together with thenamed deceased who, after his death journey, here is reunited with hisancestors.172The Underworld: Aita and Phersipnai and mythological figures (parameters Q andR)The liminal phase of the funerary ceremonies in this world ended with a banquet(parameter E); for the deceased on his/her infernal journey it ended with aparallel banquet in the Underworld in the presence of Aita, Phersipnai, and theancestors. While the banquet of the living was a most popular motif (appearingat least 56 times on the tomb walls), in only two tombs is the proper Underworldpresented, in T. Golini I (phase 6:32) at Orvieto and in T. dell’Orco II (phase6:94) at Tarquinia (Fig. 5.25); furthermore, in only two tombs do we finddepicted mythological scenes from the Underworld: again in T. dell’Orco II (thedead heroes from Troy) and in T. François at Veii ((phase 6:178): the two heroesAmphiaros and Sisyphos). It seems therefore that the result of the funeraryceremonies was not the main concern for the bereaved, rather that the deceasedarrived there safely through the liminal journey.In a few instances (T. dei Demoni Azzurri (phase 4) (Fig. 5.2c) and T. deiPigmei (phase 4:97)) the banquet on the rear wall could be read as both thebanquet of the living and as that of the ancestors, depending on which side wallwas read: the one with motifs referring to this world, or the one with motifsreferring to the world beyond. In T. Golini II (phase 6:33) only two out of fivepreserved klinai have banqueters (the persons even named) preserved. The closeparallel in motifs with the slightly older T. Golini I makes it possible that onone of the remaining three klinai Aita and Phersipnai could have been present.Content: Continuity or change? A liminal conclusionReligious festivals are generally explained as an event of joy offering publicexcitement.173 Funerary rituals (like the religious festivals) are anorchestration of sentiments by actions, which bring the mourners from asituation of grief and gloom through emotional experiences of transcendentalcharacter to relief and joy in the concluding banquet. The deceased is put tofinal rest in the tomb and certainty has been achieved that he/she has arrivedsafely in the Underworld received by his/her ancestors.The basic model for the orchestration of sentiments, as extracted from theinterpretation of the parameters A–R, lies in the Etruscan apprehension of threefunerary spaces in which death and afterlife took place:1. The space of the living, i.e. this world, in which the death occurred andin which the funerary rituals and practices were performed. In addition to themourners, the deceased could also participate in this space, as well as thedeath demons Charun and Vanth, but not the ancestors.2. The liminal space beyond this world, i.e. the space in which the deceasedtravelled to reach the Underworld. In this space the deceased, Charun and Vanth,as well as ancestors of the deceased could participate, but not the bereavedrelatives.3. The space of the dead, i.e. the Underworld in which Aita and Phersipnaireigned. Here the deceased, ancestors, dead heroes and other dead persons couldparticipate, as well as demons like Tuchulcha and Culśu, but apparently notCharun and Vanth.From the moment of death to the arrival in the Underworld the movement of thedeceased through these three spaces adheres well to van Gennep’s three stagerites-de-passage model: phase of separation (the moment of death in this world),phase of transition (the liminal journey), and phase of reintegration (thearrival in the Underworld). These three steps coincided also with the funerarypractices performed by the bereaved relatives and friends, who at the moment ofdeath (phase of separation) started the prescribed funerary rituals (phase oftransition) which ended with the interment and sacrifices (phase ofreintegration).The travel in the liminal space, between the moment of death and the entranceinto the Underworld, was for the deceased the most critical phase when he/shewas exposed to the dangers of transcendental forces. The mourners, throughprescribed rituals containing dance, erotic plays, laughter, and spilling ofblood, could challenge and avenge these forces to help the deceased arrivesafely in the Underworld. Death caused pollution among the mourners, anunpleasant condition which had to be countered with acts of purification. Intheir polluted, transitional state the mourners were isolated from the communityand could behave out of the norms performing abnormal activities connected todirt, obscenities, and lawlessness, activities most, if not all, aimed athelping (with all means necessary) the deceased on his/her liminal passage. Thereintegration was celebrated, both among the mourners and for the deceased’sarrival in the Underworld, with a joyous banquet.The idea of a liminal space and the space of the dead did not arrive in Etruriathrough Pythagorism or Orphism spreading from southern Italy in the mid-4thcentury BC,174 when the pictorial presentation of these two spaces gainedpopularity. Nor did these ideas arrive through Greek channels a couple ofgenerations earlier with the T. dei Demoni Azzurri (Figs 5.2a–d); they werealready present in the minds of the Etruscans by the end of the 6th century BC,as well demonstrated by the T. del Barone (Figs 5.6a–c). Here we encounter forthe first time all three funerary spaces – that of the living in the man(husband) with the large kylix and the young flute-player, that of the liminalspace with the horsemen accompanying the deceased woman (wife), and that of thedead, the wife who receives from her husband the concluding (and reintegrating)funerary sacrifice, symbolised by the kylix. In this tomb, as well as in T.delle Iscrizioni the followers of the deceased are horsemen (Fig. 5.7), but incontemporary Etruscan vase-paintings they appear also as winged demons.175[../images/fig5_29.jpg]Fig. 5.29. Veii, T. Campana, rear wall (copied from L. Canina: L’antica città diVeii, Rome 1847, pl. 31).To this can be added two further pictorial observations, which may sustain theearly Etruscan idea of a nether world: 1) an aryballos from Vulci from about 600BC, which carries the inscription: I am the beautiful offering to Vanth – one ofthe nether world female demons;176 and 2) the near contemporary T. Campana atVeii.Flanking the door into the inner tomb chamber, the paintings in T. Campana aredivided into two pairs of superimposed panels (Fig. 5.29). Below on both sides:various real and imaginary animals. Above to the left: a seated panther turnedright, looking back; a naked rider moving towards the right. Above to the right:moving towards the left a man in waist cloth carrying a double-axe on his leftshoulder; behind him a horse with a small naked rider and a small pantherresting on the horse hindquarters; on the further side of the animal another manwalking holding high the reins of the horse, also he naked, and a dog. Thescenes have been interpreted both as Hephaistos’ return, as hunting, and as thejourney of the dead to the Underworld.177 – The real and imaginary animals aretypical of the Corinthian vase-painting, they have no reference to hunting norto Hephaistos, but may have had an apotropaic function (parameter A).178 Thedouble-axe carried by the front man top right does not belong to hunting, but itis one of Hephaistos’ attributes. However, the double-axe is also a ritualobject used for slaughtering animals at sacrifices (parameter I), an importantelement of funerary rituals.179 The two riders, if not hunters, nor followers ofHephaistos, may thus be an early reference to accompanying horsemen (parameterJ). In that case the tomb paintings match ideologically well theVanth-aryballos: here is presented an early scene of the deceased’s liminaljourney, the deceased being the man, the tallest of them all, walking on thefurther side of the horse in the top right panel.180[../images/fig5_30.jpg]Fig. 5.30. Florence, Archaeological Museum, funerary stele inv. 75840, fromVulci (with kind permission of La Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici dellaToscana – Firenze).This interpretation may be further sustained by a slightly later (early 6thcentury BC) grave marker from Vulci, now in Florence (Fig. 5.30).181 The steleis composed of three superimposed panels: in the top panel a man walks towardsthe left on the inside of a horse, holding the reins high, as in the T. Campanapainting – there as here perhaps the deceased accompanied by horsemen, heresymbolically present through the horse only (parameter J); in the middle panelis a sfinx turned right, most likely in the function as an apotropaic animal(parameter A); in the bottom panel a bird perches on ox-back, the ox (turnedleft) again perhaps carrying reference to the funerary sacrifice, as alreadywitnessed in a later Chiusan funerary relief.182To these monuments from the same early period may also be added an ivory chestfrom a tomb at Chiusi183 and two stone grave markers from Bologna,184 allshowing scenes with a person mounting/inside a chariot, by some interpreted asthe infernal journey. The interpretations may be questionable, but if right,from an ideological point of view, they are not anachronistic.At what time then did the Etruscans develop these ideas on the afterlife and aliminal space? At present the pictorial world can give no further clues.However, Arnold van Gennep sustained that in societies where travel made up apart of the afterlife ideas, the deceased’s:survivors are careful to equip him with all the necessary material objects –such as clothing, food, arms, and tools – as well as those of a magico-religiousnature – amulets, passwords, signs, etc. – which will assure him a safe journeyor crossing and a favourable reception…185At least as early as the Bronze Age, Villanovan (pre-Etruscan) graves containedequipment connected with the serving and drinking of liquids together with otherhousehold objects, jewellery, and weapons; some of the objects often inminiature form, some most likely carrying a strong symbolic meaning whether of areligious and/or social kind. This custom continued into the Etruscan Periodwith an ever increasing sumptuous quantity of the deposited objects. Thus thereare, according to van Gennep’s postulate above, good reasons to believe thatfrom an early date the Villanovans and the Etruscans already had the idea of anafterlife connected to a nether world journey after death. And we may add thatthe banquet service becoming more and more prominent in the Iron Age tombs maybe a reflection of the same or similar eschatological ideas as the banquetscenes in the Etruscan tomb paintings. Parallel with this development, in theIron Age, appear the first dwellings of the dead in the form ofterracotta/bronze houses (capanne) and subsequently the deceased person invarious representations (as terracotta and bronze figurines, on reliefs, incanopic urns, etc.) with and without mourners.186In addition, when the early, large tumuli graves appeared in Etruria in theearly 6th century BC (see especially at Cerveteri), it is noteworthy that manyof the first grave chambers were placed in the NW sector of the tumulus, or inthe quadrant of the heavenly space – as defined by the Etruscan templum, thesacred area of the augurs, formalised in the disciplina etrusca – which wasreserved for the gods of the nether world.187Together, all these elements strengthen the argument that the Etruscan idea ofan afterlife and an Underworld was not a 5th century BC Greek or a 4th centuryBC southern Italian import, but was an integral part of Etruscan mental andcultural life from an early non-clearly definable date. The appearance infunerary contexts of pictorial motifs with relevance to the world beyond life inthe 5th/4th centuries BC was thus not the result of the introduction of newideas about afterlife into Etruria; the motifs expressed continuity, not change.However, the viewpoint shifted from presenting the funerary rituals performed inthe world of the living for helping the deceased on his/her journey to theUnderworld to presenting the deceased’s journey in the liminal, infernal spaceitself. The afterlife content was the same, only the form in which it waspresented had changed.But why did the form change? Since the eschatological explanation, as presentedin the introduction, has no longer any sense, the change could perhaps be due tothe political instability and a general uncertainty about the future in Etruriafrom the early 4th century BC. However, to stay in the context of funeraryrituals and afterlife, another explanation needs to be considered – anexplanation which lies on the mental level and regards pictorial visualisationsand taboos. I would suggest that the Etruscans, if they had an idea of liminaljourneys and afterlife, either did not have a visual idea of what the liminalspace and the Underworld looked like (except that the journey required a passageof water – see parameter B), or that, if they did have a vision of the liminalspace and the Underworld, a depiction of them was considered a taboo, perhapsconnected with ominous outcomes.188 Under Greek influence in the second part of5th century BC, this taboo was challenged and gradually disappeared. Butcontrary to the situation in Greece, where Underworld scenes in a funerarycontext disappeared towards the end of the same century, in Etruria, they weretransformed into their own afterlife visions, gained popularity and by themiddle of the 4th century BC had become the most common pictorial motif infunerary art.The model presented here is an attempt to read Etruscan tomb paintings in theirentirety and it may well be expanded, as has also been done along the way, toother forms of Etruscan funerary art.189 The parameters A–R may likewise beextended to incorporate other pictorial motifs as our knowledge of the ideaslying at the base of Etruscan funerary art is further developed. Some may findthat I have interpreted some iconographical elements too narrowly in a funerarycontext, excluding the many possible Greek connections, especially to Greekdeities, assimilated into the Etruscan religious world or not. This has beendone on purpose, in order to see if there could be an Etruscan answer to themost often unchallenged Greek connections. The importance is to start theinterpretations within an Etruscan funerary context and mentality and from thereexpand, if necessary, to larger overviews incorporating other parts of theEtruscan society and history, not forgetting the initial context.190In his delightful and in many ways visionary book Etruscan Places, D. H.Lawrence, close to the end of the last chapter, wrote that ‘the Etruscans arenot a theory or a thesis. If they are anything, they are an experience. And theexperience is always spoilt. Museums, museums, museums, object-lessons riggedout to illustrate the unsound theories of archaeologists, crazy attempts toco-ordinate and get into a fixed order that which has no fixed order and willnot be co-ordinated! It is sickening! Why must all experience be systematised?Why must even the vanished Etruscan be reduced to a system? They never will be.’Lawrence may well be right – as a writer of fiction – but as archaeologists weshall never let experience end only as a personal sensation. Rather we shallthrough trial and error, continue to systemise and organise the material cultureof the past and put forward theories. Only in that way will we be able to expandour knowledge about a time that was. Through theories and resulting dialogues wemay open new insights into the world of the Etruscans, which perhaps was not soromantically disorderly as we might at first think.Appendix A: List of tombs containing motifs referring to parameters A-R[../images/ufig_1.jpg][../images/ufig_2.jpg][../images/ufig_3.jpg][../images/ufig_4.jpg]Appendix A – Notes 1 Steingräber 1985, dates the latest painted tombs to the 2nd c. BC, butthere is a tendency in later literature on Etruscan tomb paintings to push thislimit back into the 3rd c. BC (see, for example, Sacchetti 2000; Franzoni 2011).I have for the latest paintings maintained Steingräber’s dating, mainly tounderline that they belong to the latest phase of the paintings.2 The painting, in addition, contains a man and a man running with a bow,both of difficult interpretation and perhaps not relevant to the listedparameters.3 In addition: a ‘potnios theron’ between two lions (cf. also T.

Not being an Etruscologist by professionI had no up-to-date knowledge about l’état des affaires when I started writingit, but soon discovered that Torelli 1997a and 1997b (with an English off-springin 1999, which I shall use as the main reference) had already started to developa similar kind of thinking. In 2007, the year before our seminar in Oslo, thejournal Ostraka presented an issue with a series of articles on late Etruscanpainting, including an article by Fiorini 2007, in which he further developedTorelli’s initial ideas. The reader will find much agreement between ourrespective articles, but there are also some basic divergences, which seentogether will hopefully open up further discussions on the interpretation of theEtruscan tomb paintings. However, others have also been thinking along similarlines, as, for example: Spivey & Stoddart 1990: 110–20; Prayon 2004; Leighton2004: 113–21; Krauskopf 2006; Weber-Lehmann 2012. – I am most grateful to prof.Eric Hostetter and to the anonymous peer-reviewer for having read the ms. intypescript and for having presented some useful suggestions.2 At the end of the article, in Appendix A, is presented a simple catalogueof all the painted tombs of interest for the present arguments. The catalogue,arranged chronologically according to phases (8 in all), builds on Steingräber1985 (including his catalogue numbers) with the addition of a few tombsdiscovered later – The Italian names of the tombs will be used (T. = Tomba). Inthe running text all references to the tombs described by Steingräber 1985 willbe made by the phase + Steingräber’s cat. no., for example: T. degli Auguri(phase 2: 42); new tombs, not registered by Steingräber 1985, will only bereferred to by (phase), and in a footnote the main publications will be entered.3 Sourvinou-Inwood 1981: 15.4 I distinguish between ‘nether world’/‘the hereafter’ and ‘Underworld’; thefirst concepts refer generically to the infernal world, the other specificallyto the world in which Hades/Aita and Persephone/Phersipnai reign.5 Krauskopf 1988b; de Grummond 2006: 229.6 Mavleev 1994; de Grummond 2006: 229.7 For a generic description of them, see, for example, Jannot 1991; 1997;1998: 79–81; de Grummond 2006: 213–25.8 For an abridged research history on this question, see Krauskopf 1987:11–12, note 1; 2006: 73. Cf. also Roncalli 2000: 362; Weber-Lehmann 2004a: 125.9 Bremmer 2002: 11–26. The Orphic-Pythagorean influence in Etruscantomb-painting was first suggested by Weege 1921: 22–56, and contradicted(receiving little attention) by van Essen 1927: 41, 80–82. For an abridgedresearch history on this question, see Krauskopf 1987: 11, note 1; 2006: 73;Steingräber 2006: 191–94.

A Danish student, HolgerJacobæus, some years later, reported the same, specifying that the periodwithout law lasted from the time of the Pope’s death to the transfer of his bodyto St Peter’s (Maar 1910: 118).47 Lilienskold ms. 211r; see also Brandt 2002: 173–74. For a further, moderndescription of the disorders, see, for example, Boiteux 1997: 46–47, 49. Suchcustoms may go back to Early Medieval times (Paravicini-Bagliani 2000: 99–107,150–55) becoming a sort of passage rite, as suggested by Ginzburg 1987.48 Van Gennep 1908 [1960: 147].49 For issues of purification in general, see Douglas 1966 [2002]; in Greece,see, for example, Cole 2004: 30–37, 105–6; in Rome, see, for example, Brandt2012b: 153–54; 2014.50 Shapiro 1991.51 Jannot 1984a: 368–73.52 A possibly fourth scene can be observed in T. delle Iscrizioni (phase 2:74) where on the right wall, close to the entrance wall, a man directs a youngboy carrying branches; on the ground line, lying higher than all other groundlines in this tomb, thus signalling a scene of some importance, rest two sets oftwo pillows. The scene could thus refer to the lit de parade, where the pillowsrefer to the (two?) deceased person(s) (as in the T. del Letto Funebre) and theyoung boy carry branches to be used for the purification of the home after thedead(s) has/have been carried away.53 See at Tarquinia: T. degli Auguri (phase 2: 42), T. del Citaredo (phase 3:57), and T. del Pulcinella (phase 2: 104); cf. also Hostetter 1986: 42.

The paintings are partially blackened inthe most strategic areas, but the situation is made worse by the lack of aproper publication and an attempt to make a careful description of what actuallygoes on in this and the following scene.72 See Tables 5.1–5.2 on p. 144. – For the Gorgoneis and ‘lararium’ snakes inthe graves, see the distribution signalled in Appendix B. With ‘lararium’ snakesI mean snakes as often found in the lararia-paintings at Pompeii and otherplaces (see, for example, Brandt 2010), with a crest on the head and/or a‘beard’.

In a more abstract manner theyhave a function similar to that of the Etruscan demons: ‘they conduct men intothe Underworld’ – or perhaps not conducting, rather making the conductdifficult. Vergil’s presentation may be a fossilised picture of an earlierEtruscan view of undesirable real and abstract forces.85 Note, however, that these ludiones appear to be of a different kind thanthe initiated persons, who participated in the celebrations of Dionysos, asdescribed by Livy (39.8–18) in the famous Roman decree on the Bacchanalia of 186BC.86 Arnobius, Adversus Nationes 2.62; cf. de Grummond 2006: 209, who alsorefers to a similar idea expressed in Homer, Odyssey 11.34–50, when Odysseus‘slits the throat of sheep so that the blood may flow down into a pit and bedrunk by the souls in the Underworld. When they drink the blood, they are thenable to talk to Odysseus, that is, they are literally animated’ (cf. Burkert1985: 59–60). On blood sacrifice, see also von Vacano 1957: 30.87 See de Grummond 2006: 209–10. – On pure and impure blood in Greece, seeCole 2004: 137–40 passim.88 Note, however, that Cristofani 1987: 198, tried to restore the presence ofa ram or pig in Tomba dell’Orco II (phase 6: 94) at Tarquinia, a restorationsupported by Roncalli 1997: 44–45.89 Jannot 1984a: 23–25.5 (B, I, 5, b) (Louvre 3611 according to catalogue,wrongly numbered 3610 on illustration), fig. 105. On the accompanying relief (B,I, 5, a), fig. 106, another burning altar with a thymiaterion separates twobanquet scenes, one with reclining silens, the other with reclining young andold men. – As this article went to press I discovered that Jannot (2010: 70–71)now questions the authencity of the relief. However, the connection betweenthymiaterion and altar (where bloody sacrifices were performed) is notexceptional in an Etruscan context (on thymiateria and their use, see Ambrosini2002: 59–68 (text sources), 69–96 (images, also with altars)). – For Etruscansacrificial procedures in general, see Jannot 1998: 54–56. Cf. also Dionysius ofHalicarnassus, Roman Antiquities 7.72.13, for thymiateria carried in Romansacrificial processions (Jannot 1998: 58).90 Thymiateria are recorded in a game context in the following tombs: T. deiGiocolieri, Tarquinia (phase 2: 70), T. delle Bighe, Tarquinia (phase 3: 47; seealso Thuillier 1997b: 375, fig. 4 to the right; Ambrosini 2002: 69), T. dellaScimmia, Chiusi (phase 3: 25), T. del Biclinio, Tarquinia (phase 4: 46; see alsoDobrowolski 1989; Steingräber 2006: 162–63, recently dated to the second/thirdquarter of the 5th c. BC and not to the 4th c. BC). For an Underworldpresentation, see T.

François, Vulci (phase 6: 178): cf., for example, Buranelli 2004;Andreae 2004b; Weber-Lehmann 2005b).97 Pontrandolfo & Rouveret 1992, 54–58 and the histograms figs 45–46, p. 68.The Lucanian painted tombs from the Paestum area in S. Italy make up to some 80out of a total of c. 700 tombs excavated (p. 17). They were composed of stoneslabs and contained normally more than one motif. Armed combat scenes (‘duello’)was the most popular figurative motif, present in 33 tombs, with blood-streamingboxing scenes (‘pugilato’) as a good runner up, present in 22 tombs.98 As also suggested by Jannot 1998: 67.99 Tertullian, De spectaculis 12.100 Ville 1981: 1–19, esp. 9–19.101 On gladiatorial games, see, for example, Edwards 2007: 46–77.102 Bergmann 1999: 22.103 Edwards 2007: 53.104 Helbig 1966: 343–45.1529; Menichetti 1992: 27–29 (hieròs gámos); Haynes2000: 97–99; latest, see the discussion by van der Meer 2011: 71–74.105 From Chiusi, only one erotic scene – on a sarcophagus – is known: foursilens play with three naked women with tutuli; a standing copulation scenewhere she is carried high in the air, a fellatio-act, and a bed-lying copulationscene, all accompanied to the tunes of a double flute (Jannot 1984a: 23.5 (B, I,5, c), fig. 107 (Louvre 3603): ‘peu après 520’ (p. 302)). This relief, however,belonging to the same sarcophagus as the one referred to in note 89, is now alsoconsidered not to be authentic (Jannot 2010: 71).106 Douglas 1966 [2002]: 142, 150. I am grateful to Lene Os Johannessen (2010),for having drawn my attention to this part of Douglas’ thoughts. Cf. also Cole2004: 94, 101, 111–13: sexual activity as pollution in Greece.107 Torelli 1997a: 126, ‘scena scurrile di apotropaion, un gesto cioè destinatoa esorcizzare il male e i rischi di sventure’ (in 1997b: 67, the importantsecond part of the sentence was omitted). – The two heraldically black birds, intheir ominous apparition, placed next to the defecating scene may be read as awarning to the amused and confused onlookers of the seriousness of the liminalsituation, but they could also be considered as a sign to ward off the liminaldangers inherent in the defecating act.108 Moltesen & Weber-Lehmann 1992: 64, fig. 1.58; cf. also Prayon 2004: 62. Theman is described as ityphallic, but the downward directed position of his penisand the curved, continuous jet of bodily fluids give more the impression ofurinating rather than an act of ejaculation (when the semen will be ejected inthrusts).109 Metcalf & Huntington 1991: 54–59, 113, 117, 119, 184.110 Corbeill 1996: 135–39.111 As, for example, by Steingräber 1985: 297.112 See also the original, but questionable opinion of Cerchiai 2001, who givesthe pediments a Dionysiac interpretation and in the mouse sees an allusion toerotic pairing off.113 Keuls 1993: 76–77, 80: Attic phallic birds, interpreted merely as ‘a phallicjoke’.114 Moltesen & Weber Lehmann 1992: 65, followed by Prayon 2004: 63, note 63,suggest that the bird may be depicted in an act of ejaculation, while also acurved jet of fluids has suggestively here been discerned in the painting.115 If, however, the postulated beam should be interpreted as an act ofurinating (though a difficult action in an aroused state), the emission ofbodily fluids could again be interpreted as belonging to a disorderly act.116 Wreaths occur frequently in tomb contexts, carried or hanging from thehorizontal architectural feature lines above (cf. T. del Barone, Fig. 5.6), andmay have had a significance similar to that of garlands, later more common (ongarlands, see Serra Ridgway 2000: 307–9).117 So according to Carlo Ruspi’s drawing of the wall (Blanck & Weber-Lehmann1987: 63, fig. 4), but in the water colour painting presented in Moltesen &Weber Lehmann 1992: 65, fig. 1.59, he appears to carry a short garment aroundhis hips.118 For the drawings, see, for example, Blanck & Weber-Lehmann 1987: 67–68, figs9–10.119 As suggested by Steingräber 1985: 322 (‘Opferszene?’), and carried furtherby Torelli 1999: 152.120 Urine used as a disinfectant liquid in connection with wounds, blisters,bee-stings, and insect- and snakebites is generally known; in some culturesurine is also used as a potion for internal use to strengthen health. Urine is abodily fluid like blood, but in difference to blood which runs in a closedsystem, urine runs in an open system and is ejected. Both systems stop at death.We know next to nothing about the Etruscans view of the body, but the presenceof the deceased as urinating may contain reference to a belief in which theurine as a bodily fluid was essential to living and in that function included aspart of the funerary practices.121 Whitehead 1996: 9–13.122 Whitehead 1996: 12.123 Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities 7.72.12.124 Suetonius, Divus Vespasianus 19.2.

Massa-Pairault 1992:88, however, draws to attention representations of Aphrodite and Adone andinterprets the scene as a comment on felicitas.138 For a Roman situation, cf. Clarke 2007: 193–94, 196–98.139 As suggested by Whitehead 1996: 26–27.140 For some examples from the Roman world, see Bodel 1994 (inscription fromPuteoli); 2000: 135–44; Lindsay 2000: 154–60.

The connection with Apollo in this instance is not necessary,the purifying power of the laurel in a funerary context being more important.Fontaine 2009: 374–75, suggests that in T. d. Caccia e Pesca, in the first roomthe trees are not laurels but myrtles, associating the trees with Aphrodite andthe orgiastic dance, but the myrtle, at least in a Greek setting, has also afunerary and re-creative function (Furley 1981: 169; Brandt 2012a: 150), perhapsa more appropriate association in a funerary context.143 See pp. 125 [12_Chapter05.html#page_125]–26 [12_Chapter05.html#page_126],132 [12_Chapter05.html#page_132] and 130 [12_Chapter05.html#page_130] inconnection with T. dei Giocolieri (phase 2: 70); and Appendix B.144 Add also a relief base from Florence (Museo archeologico nazionale inv.86508), in which the incense burner is placed next to the kliné in a banquetscene: Jannot 1984a: 102, drawing B ad fig. 353; Ambrosini 2002: 74, fig. 6.145 CVA, III, I, pls 2–3, 4–5, 6–7146 For the pyxis, cf. also the box carried on the Florence relief base (seenote 144), both of ritual character147 See pp. 118 [12_Chapter05.html#page_118]–19 [12_Chapter05.html#page_119],and Appendix B.148 See parameter I, Appendix B.149 For a further note on T.

Note that in an earlier tomb (c. 520), T.delle Leonesse (phase 2: 77), the banquet is displayed on the side walls, asalso in T. 1000 (phase 2: 135), c. 500 BC.152 Krauskopf 2006: 70.153 Torelli 1999: 156, interprets the banquet scene in the lower frieze in T.delle Bighe (phase 3: 47) as belonging to the Underworld, which it can not do.The dancers, not being komasts, are not dancers accompanying the deceased, butdancers of this world performing acts in the liminal phase of the funeraryrituals to help the deceased on his/her way to the Underworld. The two friezesof the tomb do not necessarily distinguish between an earthly (the athleticgames above) and a sub-earthly space (the banquet and dancing) below, ratherbetween two phases in the liminal funerary practices: the phase of honours(above) and the phase of liminal actions (below).154 Note that on the left wall the deceased is male, on the right wall female.Could the tomb have been made for a married couple, the man representing thesocial status of the couple in this world, the woman encountering the ancestors(including an earlier dead son?) in the liminal world? – Prayon 2004: 48–49,note 19, seems unduly careful in his interpretation of the scene by the boat aseither a meeting scene or as one of farewell (cf. parameter P below). – See alsothe comments of Massa-Pairault 1992: 92.155 For riders/horsemen, see parameter J, pp. 118–19 above, and Appendix B.156 Harari 2005: 88.157 Krauskopf 1987: 19–20, 25–33.

Etruscanblack-figure hydria showing winged demons accompanying a dead couple (Bentz2008: 162–64.241).158 See note 40. – For a catalogue of Charun in Etruscan art, see latest Mavleev& Krauskopf 1986, with an updated version of presentations in tomb paintings bySacchetti 2000.159 Cristofani 1975: 42.12, pl. 29.1–2. – For presentations of Vanth, seePaschinger 1992; Boujibar 1997.160 Jannot 1993b: 79–80; Harari 1997.161 On the left entrance wall of T. dell’Orco II another demon with mallet ispresent, apparently in a Sisyphos scene. Sisyphos’ mountain represents theborder of the Underworld (cf. above p. 112 [12_Chapter05.html#page_112]) and thedemon’s presence by the entrance door may thus be seen as a liminal area inwhich he could move.162 Prayon 2004: 46–50, 58.163 Cf.

Though one important clarification may benecessary: in T. delle Iscrizioni there are three false doors all placedcentrally, one on the rear wall, one on each of the side walls. Between the dooron the left and the one on the rear wall, four horsemen and one person on footmove forward. This is balanced by a group of komasts, accompanying the deceased,moving in the same direction between the door on the right wall and that on therear one. The horsemen (parameter J) belong to the infernal, liminal world, thekomasts do not; however, through their dance, together with the deceased, theyact in the liminal sphere of the funerary ceremonies and thus counterbalance thehorsemen, but in this world.172 Krauskopf 2006: 67, fig. V.1 (with further references), wrongly defines thescene as a farewell between the deceased and living relatives.173 See, for example, des Bouvrie 2012: 56–57.174 Note that only twice do we find Hades and Persephone present in the largerepertoire of late Classic and Hellenistic paintings and sculpture, in T.dell’Orco II (phase 6: 94) and T. Golini I (phase 6: 32). In neither of thesenor other scenes from the Etruscan hereafter do we find the naiskos from theApulian vases present, nor Orpheus. On possible earlier Orphism, see Leighton2004: 117, 119, while on later Orphic and Pythagorean ideas of purification, seep. 165 [12_Chapter05.html#page_165].175 See, for example, a hydria in Bonn dated 525–500 BC: twice: three wingeddemons accompany a couple veiled wrapped in a large mantle (Bentz 2008:162–64.241).176 Boujibar 1997: 173 with references to the discussions on the aryballos.177 For earlier references, see Steingräber 1985: 382–83.

This raises aquestion, even if anachronistic, as we know the situation to-day, if the objectoriginally was not a doubleaxe, but a mallet – thus turning the double-axecarrier into a demon (parameter N), who we later know under the name of Charun.180 Cf. also Dohrn 1983: 133.181 Treasures 2004, 98.155 (Museo archeologico nazionale di Firenze, inv.75840).182 Cf. note 89. The bird is a curiosity to which I can give no answer – but theconnection between birds and auspices may be considered. The two black birds onthe left wall of T. dei Giocolieri, may perhaps belong to the same kind ofideological thinking. – Cf. also the Chiusan reliefs in Torelli (ed.) 2000: 564,no. 77, and Jannot 2010: 56–57, no. 5.183 Cristofani 1971b; Torelli 1997b: 134.184 Montanari in Montanari (ed.) 1987: 35–36, fig. 19a; M.

But was this really the case? This article gives asummary of the evidence for cremation as recorded in the ethnically complex AsiaMinor and discusses the reasons for its presence and introduction (or refusal),which can be linked to either religious, political, social, or personalexplanations; it will also be assessed if cremation was an indigenous or ‘Greek’rite in some parts of the region. The primary evidence, such as architecturaltomb features, burial containers and epigraphic evidence are used to reconstructthe chronological development and the geographical spread of this rite in AsiaMinor. This allows the delimitation of chronological phases and distributionpatterns of the cremation rite from the late 4th century BC to the 3rd centuryAD. These time limits define the onset and the end of a phase whenarchaeologically traceable cremation was practised, that is between theMacedonian conquest and the early Late Roman Empire. The chronological surveywill also discuss the possible impact of Persian religious beliefs on therituals practiced under Persian rule.Keywords: Asia Minor, cremation, funerary architecture and inscriptions,Hellenistic Period, inhumation, Macedonian, ostothecae, Persian, RomanThe opinion that cremation was not a Greek rite in the Roman Empire, and inparticular in Asia Minor, can be found in several of the general works oncremation and inhumation (Audin 1960: 526; Morris 1996: 52–53; Nock 1932: 337).This assumption is based on comments by ancient writers who referred tocremation as the ‘mos romanus’ and to inhumation as ‘mos graecus’ (e.g. Morris1996: 31, 52 after Tacitus, Annales 16.6, and Petronius, Satyricon 111.2).Superficial surveys of the archaeological record seemed to confirm thatassumption, showing overwhelming evidence for inhumation in the area as a whole.However, in a recent article, Marcello Spanu (2000: 174) justifiably drawsattention to the fact that cremation was practiced in Asia Minor to an unknownextent. This is of course no surprise for those scholars devoted to the study ofcinerary urns or funerary inscriptions, who have been aware of hundreds orrather thousands of finds confirming the practice of cremation in Asia Minor. Acloser look at the extensive evidence further confirms that the rites practicedin that area were subject to multiple regional and super-regional changes.[../images/fig6_1.jpg]Fig. 6.1. Find sites with evidence of cremation in Asia Minor (map based on ESRIworld terrain base)This article gives a summary of the evidence for cremation in order to establisha precise definition of its chronological and geographic distribution in theethnically complex Asia Minor. Such a framework is necessary to understandpossible causes of the significant changes from inhumation to cremation and viceversa. For this purpose a wide range of material has been covered and presentedin an appendix with distribution maps. The evidence was gathered from fourgroups of sources: cremations, inscriptions, receptacles (ostothecae), andarchitecture. The time limits from the late 4th century BC to the 3rd century ADwere chosen because they define the onset and the end of a phase whenarchaeologically traceable cremation was practiced. The time frame starts twocenturies before the inheritance of the Pergamene kingdom by the Romans in 133BC. This should allow us to clarify if cremation indeed was practiced as anindigenous or ‘Greek’ rite or just as a consequence of Roman domination.The study undertaken had to overcome major obstacles: very few publishedregional studies exist and most of the information had to be gathered from verydispersed sources. Lack of dates and the existence of hundreds of yetunpublished finds make such a study a sketchy and preliminary affair. The surveyonly included finds with a provenance. Furthermore, as the available dates werein most cases extracted directly from archaeological publications, it ispossible that some dating is erroneous. It should also be taken into accountthat many places may have had a much wider period of cremation, but that thefinds or the given dates only allow for a narrow timeframe. However, the largenumber of sites with cremation evidence (see Fig. 6.1 and Appendix) makescertain patterns clearly visible, regardless of a certain margin of error.SourcesCremationsEvidence for cremation, in the form of charred bones and ashes, is scarce inAsia Minor (see table; some data collected by Spanu 2000: 174). This ispartially due to the lack of excavations, as well as Medieval and moderndestruction of evidence in the necropoleis. Cinerary urns were placed on shelvesor benches along the walls in the numerous chamber-tombs (Schweyer 2002: 40;Söğüt 2001: 252), and hence, in such an exposed position, they were usuallyremoved or destroyed by tomb robbers. The receptacles, often of metal orceramic, did not have a specific shape or usually differ from utility pottery.Urns with explicit funerary inscriptions, such as those in Sardis areexceptional (Dedeoğlu & Malay 1991: 116–19). Consequently, most simple urnscannot be recognised as cremation containers when taken out of context.Similarly, the larger cinerary chests of stone, ostothecae, could easily beremoved and are usually found out of their original context (Rosenbaum et al.1967: 53).Six large-scale necropolis excavations and surveys can give an idea of howcommon cremation was compared to inhumation. In the necropolis of Myrina, 116graves were excavated dating to the 3rd–1st centuries BC (Pottier 1887: 107).Twelve of the graves contained between one and three cremations (Pottier 1887:78–100, nos. 39, 51, 69, 93, 95, 98, 101, 105, 108, 110, 113, 114). At least 164inhumations and 16 cremations, from the second half of the 4th century BC untilthe Early Imperial Period, were found in the west-gate necropolis of Assos(Freydank 2000: 103). The two datasets from Myrina and Assos indicate thatcremation was used in the Hellenistic Period in up to one tenth of the burialsat these sites. This relatively similar ratio should, however, not begeneralised. At Sagalassos, cremation in urns and cinerary chests was thepredominant or even exclusive rite in the Hellenistic Period, and inhumationgained importance in the Imperial Period (Köse 2005: 164–166). A comparabledevelopment through time can also be observed in the northeast necropolis ofLaodicea, where 32 cremation vessels have been found among 183 graves (Șimşek2011: 32–37). A rough browsing through the findings of the extensive excavationsin the northeast necropolis of Laodicea (Șimşek 2011: 347–805) shows that about70% of the graves of the mid-2nd to the mid-1st century BC are cremations, whileonly about 20–25% of the graves of the mid-1st century BC to the mid-1st centuryAD contained cremations. Later on cremations seemed to have been exceptions anddisappear in the course of the 2nd century AD. The ratio of the rites could alsovary greatly from location to location as the two sites Gordion and Pessinus candemonstrate. Located at a distance of only 50 km and dating roughly from theLate Hellenistic to the Early Byzantine Period the sites have revealed quitediffering ratios. Among several hundred graves found in Gordion only twocremations could be identified (Goldman 2007: 304), while excavations in nearbyPessinus uncovered 60 cremation and 78 inhumation graves (Devrecker et al. 2003:40).The finds presented in the maps and appendix show that cremation was practicedthroughout the period under consideration and in large parts of western,southern and central Anatolia. The range of rites is as broad as the ethniccomposition of Asia Minor. Cremation was carried out inside tombs, in cremationpits or a grave was dug under the pyre (Devrecker et al. 2003: 40–46; Goldman2007: 304; Pottier 1887: nos 98, 101). Indeed, cremated remains have been foundin simple cooking pots (Waelkens 1993: 41), luxurious ceramic (Forbeck 2005: 57,fig. 4) and bronze vessels (Akok 1948: fig. 10), in rock-cut pits (Çevik 1997;Çevik & Iplikçioğlu 2003; Peschlow 1990: 384, fig. 9–10) or marble ostothecae(Walker 1985: 55–56). Urns could be buried directly in the earth (Verzone1961–62: 637), in small cists (Newton 1862–63: 338) or placed in tomb monuments(Anderson 2007: 477–78). Cremated bones have also been placed in sarcophagi(Çelgin 1994: 164; İplikçioğlu et al. 1991: 25, no. 11; Nock 1932: 333;Stupperich 1996: 11), though it is impossible to estimate to what extent thiswas practiced, because of the lack of archaeological evidence. Cremated remainswere frequently placed in the same tomb as inhumations and may, if contemporary,provide proof that both rites were practiced within the same family (Kubinska1999: nos 30–33; Pottier 1887: no. 95; Șimşek 2011, 717–718).InscriptionsInscriptions mentioning ostothecae and kaustrai have been gathered by Kubinska(1999) and the catalogue adds substantially to the evidence. The term ὀστοθήκη(ostotheca) was applied to small receptacles which housed calcified bones andashes (Korkut 2006: 1). Uncertainties regarding the usage of ostothecae havebeen present until recently (Cormack 2004: 109, note 522). However, the lateststudies leave no doubt about their main function as receptacles for the remainsof cremations (Korkut 2006: 77; Kubinska 1999: passim; Köse 2005: 37–38). Insome cases, ostothecae could have been used as sarcophagi for children or forsecondary burials (Koch 1990: 154; Köse 2005: 38, note 208; see further: Koch2008). In Side (Inan 1963: 69) and Ephesus (Thomas & Içten 1999: 550; Thomas &Içten 2007: 338, note 27) ostothecae have been found containing non-crematedbones of several individuals, though the interments may also have occurredduring a secondary use of the chests (see similar find in Boeotian Akraiphnio:Flämig 2007: 81).The term καύστρα (kaustra) may have been used for the site of the pyre or theburial place of cremated bones, but in most cases it was probably a synonym forostotheca (Kubinska 1999: 55). A further term, λάρναξ (larnax), was used forcinerary urns and altars, as well as for sarcophagi or loculi (Kubinska 1968:52–55). Because of its wide applicability this term has not been consideredhere.Eight funerary epigrams, dating at least from the 2nd century BC to the 2ndcentury AD mention cremations directly or indirectly, and provide a few hints onwhy it was practiced (Merkelbach & Stauber 1998–2004: 03/06/04, 03/07/17,03/07/19, 05/03/05, 09/05/05, 09/05/12, 14/13/04, 16/52/02). Five of thesecremations mentioned were carried out abroad for the purpose of repatriating theashes. Two of these five inscriptions were found in the coastal city ofErythrae, which leaves little doubt that repatriation of the earthly remains mayhave been the main reason for the practice of cremation, particularly in placeswith mobile populations such as harbour towns. Repatriation is attested byfurther inscriptions, which describe the transfer of bones after theputrefaction of the soft tissue and the subsequent burial in a container(10/02/03, 10/03/02). A certain comfort in burial at home in contrast to thesorrow of being buried in foreign earth is omnipresent in Greek epigrams, andhence explains the importance of such repatriation (see, for example, Merkelbach& Stauber 1998–2004: 02/06/14, 02/13/03, 03/02/66, 06/01/01, 08/01/42, 08/07/07,08/01/45, 08/02/01, 09/09/16, 10/03/07, 14/16/03, 15/02/11, 16/23/14, 16/52/02).One inscription mentions that the deceased was burned to death in his house andhis ashes were placed in an urn (02/03/01). House fire was a constant threat inthe ancient world and such accidental cremations may have subsequently receiveda burial, which would be impossible to distinguish from planned cremations usingarchaeological methods. Because of repatriation and accidental cremation,isolated examples in Asia Minor should never be considered as evidence ofindigenous cremation rites.Receptacles (ostothecae)Ostothecae of circular or rectangular shape have been found at many sites inAsia Minor. Numerous occurrences have not been published, while new specimensappear constantly. The ostothecae used for the present analysis represent only afraction of what have been uncovered in Turkey.Although ostothecae are excellent cremation indicators it should be kept in mindthat cremations were also buried in other receptacles. The period of use ofostothecae does not necessarily indicate the exact period of cremation at asite. Assos, for example, has a tradition of cremation from the late 4th centuryBC until the Early Imperial Period, although ostothecae do not appear before thesecond half of the 2nd century BC (see, for example, Freydank 2000: 93).The simplest form of ostothecae are rock-cut shafts or pits. In Trebenna,circular rock-cut pits with conical lids (Çevik 1997: 138) have recently beenidentified as incineration receptacles dating to the 3rd century AD. Similarpits have also been discovered in other necropoleis of Asia Minor, but afunerary function is not always evident (Çokay-Kepçe 2006: 171, note 46; Diler2002: 64–65;). Rectangular rock-cut chests are known from Elaiussa Sebaste,Korykos, Kanytelleis, Adrasus, and Balboura (Equini Schneider 2003: 270),although they have been interpreted as charnel pits for the nearby tombs ratherthan as cinerary receptacles. If a quadrangular pit close to a rock-cutsarcophagus in Alinda served a similar purpose or indeed presents a cremationreceptacle is not clear (Özkaya & San 2003: 121).Besides the use of improvised receptacles, such as the reworked stone vessel inAlpu (Atasoy 1974: 258) and occasional terracotta chests (McLean 2002: 195–97),more luxurious stone ostothecae in the form of chests or vases, often withrelief decoration, were produced locally in many regions of Asia Minor (Koch1990: 154–62; 2010: 130–33) and even exported (e.g.: Koch 1990: 158). Productionof ostothecae began: in Pisidia and Rhodes during the Early Hellenistic Period;in Lydia and Ionia during the 2nd and 1st centuries BC; in Pamphylia and Ciliciaduring the Late Hellenistic and Imperial Period. In the 2nd century AD,craftsmen in Bithynia and Isauria/Lycaonia also developed their own ostothecatypes. In the middle of the 2nd century AD, the market for ostothecae wasseemingly so lucrative that the famous producer for luxurious sarcophagi, thequarries of Docimeium in Phrygia exported ostothecae (Koch 1990: 155; Waelkens1982: 50). While some of the early production areas had a decisive decline inthe 1st and 2nd centuries AD, some of the new centres appear to have peaked inproduction during the 2nd century AD, followed by a decline in the 3rd centuryAD. There is no evidence for the production of luxurious ostothecae after the3rd century AD.ArchitectureIn Sardis (Greenewalt 1977: 50) and Cnidus (Berns in press; Newton 1862–63:478), ostothecae were found standing in niches in the walls of tombs. Comparablearchitectural solutions for the placement of ostothecae can be observed inloculi and chamber tombs on Rhodes, with inhumations and cremations often placedin the same tomb monuments (Fraser 1977: 12, 52–53). These finds open up aninterpretation of similar constructions as niches for cremation receptacles. Asimilar function has been proposed for tombs in Hisarlik (Söğüt 2001: 251),Elaiussa Sebaste (Berns 2003: 109, 186–87, cat. 10A1; Durukan 2005: 110, 114,figs 7, 8; Durukan 2007: 151) and the niches and shelves in tombs or tomb yardsat several other places in Cilicia (Alföldi-Rosenbaum 1971: 100, note 53, 169;Korkut 2006: 78; Rosenbaum et al. 1967: 53; Söğüt 2001: 252–53). However, otherfindings suggest a careful and critical interpretation of such architectonicalfeatures is required, because niches may also have served other purposes, suchas for the placement of grave goods (Abbasoğlu 2001: 187; Söğüt 2001; 2002).Columbaria are a distinctly Roman architectural type. The partially rock-cutcolumbarium G15 in the N4 necropolis of Elaiussa Sebaste (Machatschek 1967: 56,112–13, pl. 37b) is unique in Cilicia. The walls contain about 60 small nicheswhere cinerary urns were immured with stucco and the large amount of nichesindicates that a collegium rather than a family had built and used the tomb.Furthermore, the architecture is so distinct from the tomb architecture of theregion, one would suspect that foreigners were responsible for the commission ofthis building. Columbaria were more common in Caria and along the West coast,such as in Miletus (Forbeck 2005: 58), as well as rock-cut examples from Ephesus(Wood 1877: 122) and Caunus (Diler 2002: 70–71). Rock-cut niches at severalsites on the Halicarnassus Peninsula may also have served the same purpose(Diler 2002: 71–72). In Sagalassos, arcosolium tombs from the late 2nd or early3rd century, hewn into steep cliffs, contained ostothecae partially constructedof slabs (Köse 2005: 146–47). Other forms include two-storied conical monumentsin the necropolis of Anemurium, which were too small to house inhumations(Alföldi-Rosenbaum 1971: 94–95, 122). Similarly, a monumental obelisk tomb inNicaea, according to its inscription, was constructed for a cremation, henceproving that cremations could be placed in any tomb type (Anthologia Palatina15.4–7).Social statusThere is very little evidence for social distinction being attributable tocremation in the Hellenistic Period. Cremation burials in Assos were for themost part very simple, though some were placed in more luxurious cinerary urns(Stupperich 1992: 9–10; Freydank 2000: 92–93). However, cremations in importantheroa (Miletus: Schörner 2007: 237–38, no. A 16; Termessos: Pekridou 1986:67–73) indicate that the rite was also practiced in the highest strata ofsociety.In Roman Asia Minor, no apparent social pattern explains why cremation waspracticed, since the rite occurs in very different social classes (Kubinska1999: 51–52). In Trebenna, ostothecae were most likely reserved for slaves andpoorer members of the family, while the head of the family was buried in asarcophagus (Çevik & Iplikçioğlu 2003: 151; Kubinska 1999: 46–47, no. 38). InEphesus and Smyrna, ostothecae were also used in connection with large funerarycomplexes, though it is not clear if they were reserved for particular groupswithin a household (Kubinska 1999: nos I 20–21, I 26–27). There is thepossibility that cremation could be reserved to particular age-groups as theexcavated cremations in Labraunda only comprise of adolescents and adults.However, this phenomenon could also have a taphonomic explanation (Henry &Ingvarsson-Sundström 2011: 194).Inscriptions connected to ostothecae mention the following professions: Anomenclator (IK 15,5: no. 1665), a dispensator of the emperor, a vicarius of adispensator, a scribe, a soldier (IK 16: nos 2255A, 2270, 2283, 2319), aspeculator (MAMA 1962: no. 558), a bath attendant (IK 22,1: no. 1227), the clerkof a tolling station (IK 49,1: no. 102), a possible fishing net mender (Swoboda,Keil & Knoll 1935: 59–60, no. 123), a veteran (SEG 55, 2005: no. 1497), acourier, a linen merchant and twice councillors (Kubinska 1999: nos I 1, I 14, I27, I 44). In the inscriptions of the councillors, however, it is made veryclear that the ostothecae were only one element within larger and probablysumptuous funerary complexes. Indeed, cremations ranged from being placed inmonumental tombs such as the tumulus in Lerdüge (Akok 1948: 854), torepresentative ostothecae that could claim a place among the sarcophagi in thenecropolis of Perge (Abbasoğlu 2011: 84–85, fig. 1), as well as mass burials ofthe poor’s cremated remains in Ephesus (cfr. Ephesus: Thomas & Içten 2007: 337).Consequently, although cremation was conducted by the different social classes,it seems that burials with only an ostotheca as a monument was practiced inpreference by people with modest incomes. Usually the grave goods and the tombmonument gives indications of the economic status of an individual or a family,not the rite (Korkut 2006: 44; Strocka 1978: 885–886). Although cremation wascertainly a more expensive solution for the treatment of the body itselfcompared to inhumation burials (Korkut 2006: 44; for Classical Athens, see DeSchutter 1989: 56; Humphreys 1980: 100), the ashes could subsequently be placedin very small containers and graves, or be disposed of otherwise. The purchaseof a burial place would in extreme cases be unnecessary and thus cremation couldcertainly be the best affordable solution for many of the poor.ChronologyThe Classical PeriodAfter the first half of the 5th century BC cremation is difficult to trace inthe archaeological record, despite its frequent use in the 7th, and its rare usein the 6th century BC (see Philipp 1981: 153) and it seems that it was rarelypracticed or completely abolished. A classical cremation is known from Assos(Stupperich 1996: 11); in Lycia, cremation was possibly practiced until thesecond half of the 5th century BC (Blakolmer 2005: 4–5; Hülden 2006: 29–30, 212,284; 2010: 6–7; Marksteiner 1994: 83–84). Although, there is evidence forcremation in Classical Sinope (IK 64: no. 74), the preliminary publication ofthe numerous cremation graves does not give enough chronological data forfurther analysis (Akurgal & Budde 1956: 4–5, 35). There have been foundClassical cremations in the necropolis of Ainos (Başaran et al. 2010: 152 andpassim) and two urnae from Nagidos further proof the rare practice of cremationin the early 4th century (Durugönül 2007: 33. 36, no. 14. 412). There is also anabrupt decline or even abolishment of cremation at Rhodian sites during the LateArchaic Period (Gates 1983: 41; Laurenzi 1936: 14), though the rite was stillpracticed rarely until the 5th century BC (Jacopi 1931: 17). The possibilityexists that the decrease in cremation was part of a super-regional developmentin the Aegean, since there was also a remarkable decline during the 5th centuryBC in Athens. However, the rite was still frequently practiced in 4th centuryAthens, particularly at lavish funerals (Houby-Nielsen 1998: 135–36), andremained common in Classical Olynthos (Robinson 1942: 144), necessitating thediscussion of another explanation.Cremation decreased at a time when the Persian conquerors established their ruleover Asia Minor and Rhodes. It has even been suggested that Zoroastrianism mayhave been a decisive factor for this remarkable development, though others havecontested whether the Achaemenid Persians were Zoroastrians at all (Jacobs 2001:87). However, Zoroaster’s god, Ahuramazda, played the major role in the officialreligious system of Darius the Great, and the Persians continued to venerateother gods only as far as they were compatible with Zoroastrian lore (Koch 1977:174–78). Audin (1960: 525–26) explained the beginning of the use of sarcophagiin Asia Minor with the Zoroastrian purity laws. Furthermore, Kolb and Thomsen(2005: 137) suspected Persian religion as a factor for the increase and finaldominance of inhumation in Lycia, particularly because of the otherwise obviousPersian influence on tomb architecture and decoration. The purity laws of theVendidad strictly forbade the contact of the corpse with fire and water toprevent pollution of the elements (Avesta Vendidad 7.25–27). The interdictionapplied to both Zoroastrians and other religions, and the violation of this law,according to the Vendidad, had to be punished with death (Grenet 1984: 32–33).Burial was also considered a serious transgression (Grenet 1984: 33), butobviously this purity law had little impact on the rites practiced in themultiethnic Achaemenid Empire (Basirov 2001: 103–104).The Lydian-Persian elite developed an eclectic mortuary behaviour that accountsfor a polyethnic society anxious to demonstrate a new unifying identity of theelite (Basirov 2001: 101–102; Baughan 2002/2004: 227–28; Cahill 1988: 500–501;Dusinberre 2003: 145–57). Indeed, a strong mutual exchange of architectural andcustomary features becomes evident in the tomb architecture and decoration ofthe dynastic elites of Classical Asia Minor (Cahill 1988: 499; Dusinberre 2003:133–45; Fedak 1990: 29–37; Henry 2009: 142–44, 160–61, 187; Jacobs 1987).Consequently, it seems possible that acceptance of the Persian abhorrence forcremation and the observance of some essential purity laws was necessary for theconstruction of such a hybrid society and for the success of political andcommercial processes between Persians and the local elite. The coast was onlytemporarily under Persian rule during the Classical Period and many poleisremained allies of Greek powers. However, it seems unlikely that Persian customsand constant contact with neighbours under Persian rule would not haveinfluenced the coastal towns. Similarly, the Persian religion is known to havebeen studied intensively by the Greeks of the Classical Period and further foundits way into Greek philosophical thought (e. g. Kingsley 1995; McEvilley 2002:172–73; Miller 2011: 63–70). A direct reference to Zoroastrian beliefs inconnection with cremation is given by a source ascribed to Xanthus of Lydia, ahistorian of the 5th century BC. He gives an account of the attempted executionof Croesus on a pyre by the hand of Cyrus. But fearing the darkening sky as asign, the participants recollected the lore of Zoroaster and abstained from theexecution. Xanthus explains further that Zoroaster had interdicted the burningof bodies or any other defiling of the fire (FrgHG 90 Nikolaos von Damaskus 68;Boyce 1982: 183). The knowledge of Zoroastrian purity laws distinguishes thetext from other versions of this narrative, which do not include any referenceto Persian beliefs (Bacchylides, Odes 3.31–62; Herodotus I.87; see: Evans 1978:34, 39). Unfortunately, the text of Xanthus may have been revised by Nikolaos(Erbse 1992: 23; Parke 1988: 60–61) and thus it cannot be certain if theconnection of Zoroaster, cremation and pollution of the fire was Xanthus’ owncomment on funerary customs and beliefs in Achaemenid Asia Minor or laterHellenistic knowledge. If Nicolaos’ reference to Zoroaster belongs to theoriginal source, then it is very likely that the awe for Zoroaster’s lore asdescribed reflects an attitude experienced by Xanthus in 5th century BC Lydia.Despite the suggestive arguments discussed, any impact of Zoroastrianism on thecremation rite in Asia Minor must remain hypothetical.Phase 1: Late 4th–2nd centuries BC (Figs 6.2 & 6.3)Cremation experienced a revival in several regions along the west coast of AsiaMinor and in Pisidia in the late 4th and early 3rd centuries BC. An ostotheca inBithynia confirms isolated cases of cremation, which in a period of constant warand intensive sea trade could very well originate from repatriated ashes.Cremation continues into the Hellenistic Period in the same areas, but evidenceoccurs at more sites.[../images/fig6_2.jpg]Fig. 6.2. Phase 1. Cremation in the late 4th–early 3rd centuries BC (map basedon ESRI world terrain base)[../images/fig6_3.jpg]Fig. 6.3. Phase 1. Cremation in the 3rd–2nd centuries BC (map based on ESRIworld terrain base)Two of the earliest cremations, both in Pisidia, are probably linked to theMacedonian incursions of Alexander the Great. The tomb with ostotheca inTermessos is ascribed to Alkestas, a commander in Alexander’s army (Çelgin 1994:158–160; Pekridou 1986: 121–27). Fourteen cinerary urns from a hasty mass burialin Sagalassos might have a connection with the Macedonian campaigns and clearlydate to that period (Waelkens et al. 1991: 212; Waelkens 1993: 41). Indeed, itis tempting to link the revival of cremation to the power shift after the defeatof the Persians.In the course of the Macedonian conquest and the following wars between theDiadochs, soldiers from Macedonia, Greece, and other parts of the Greco-Persianworld moved for decades through Asia Minor and would have practiced cremationthere, either because it was their indigenous rite or to make the transport ofmortal remains possible. The Macedonian cremation rite becomes popular in theroyal necropolis of Aigai in the 5th and 4th century BC and is the predominantrite in Hellenistic Macedonia (Barr-Sharrar 2008: 30; Chilidis 2012: 232–33;Kottaridou 1998: 114). Elite funerals were characterised by rich grave goods andspectacular funerary pyres, which may have been inspired by Homeric descriptionsof heroic funerals (Barr-Sharrar 2008: 30; Chilidis 2012: 244–49; Kottaridou1998: 113–16; Musgrave 1990a: 277; 1990b: 321). The impression with which theaudience of the Macedonian rite was left may certainly have stimulatedemulation. The cultural exchange under the rule of the Macedonians and Diadochspossibly also left its fingerprint on Pisidian funerary art. The Pisidianworkshops, which frequently decorated ostothecae with round ‘Macedonian’shields, are believed to have drawn their inspiration from Macedonian art(critically discussed in: Köse 2005: 49–54). Such influences have been explainedwith the presence of Macedonian settlements in Pisidia, particularly in theSagalassos area (Kosmetatou & Waelkens 1997: 289–90; Kosmetatou 2005: 221;compare Macedonian shields in the Hellenistic Gerdekkaya tomb in Phrygia:Kortanoğlu 2008). However, it is surprising that the power shift and subsequentDiadoch rule should have left such a deep impact on the Pisidians that theyadopted the cremation rite as their primary practice for the centuries to come.Only future archaeological finds can evaluate if cremation played a moredominant role in Pisidia in the Classical Period.Political and commercial contacts and an increased mobility in the EarlyHellenistic Period may have facilitated the spread and assimilation of funeraryrites along the western and southern coast. Cremation was practiced throughoutthe Hellenistic Period on Rhodes and the Peraia, the part of Asia Minor ruled byRhodes, where the earliest ostotheca, belonging to a citizen of Kasara, is datedto the first half of the 3rd century BC. At that time Rhodes had developed intoone of the most prosperous harbours for overseas trade through its fruitfulcommercial ties with Alexandria (Van Dessel & Hauben 1977: 335–37), which mayhave contributed to the assimilation or spread of rites. Proof for the impact ofAlexandria on burial customs in Asia Minor are so-called Hadra hydriai. Thetypical Alexandrinian rite to place the ashes of Greeks in Hadra hydriaiimported from Crete (Breccia 1933: 18–19; Dunand and Lichtenberg 1995: 3223,3251; Forti 1992; Nock 1932: 327–28; Venit 2002: 11, 12, 24) was adopted onRhodes during that period (Giannikoure 1996–1997: 256), and is furtherdocumented by a cremation in a Hadra hydria from Early Hellenistic Miletus(Forbeck 2005: 57 fig. 4). Hadra hydriai were also used in the Cilician citiesNagidos (Durugönül 2007: 41, no. 32. 412) and Kelenderis (Zoroğlu 2000: 115,132) probably during the Ptolemaic occupation of the Cilician coast.The distribution of cremation remained quite stable during the 3rd and the firsttwo thirds of the 2nd centuries BC (Fig. 6.3), with the heartlands in southernCaria, Rhodes and Pisidia. Early ostothecae appear in Lydia already before theorganisation of the province Asia in 129 BC. Indeed, the substantial finds alongthe western coast suggest that cremation may have occurred at even more places,but which lack archaeological finds.Phase 2: Late 2nd century BC–early Imperial Period (Fig. 6.4)In the late Hellenistic and the Early Imperial Period, the use of ostothecaetakes off in Ionia, Lydia, and Pamphylia. The increase in monuments linked tocremation occurs particularly after the establishment of the Roman provinceAsia, though there is little evidence for long distance distribution. However,in the early 1st century BC, cremation graves also appear in Pessinus as thefirst site of what later would become the Roman province Galatia.Phase 3: 1st–3rd centuries AD (Fig. 6.5)There is evidence for cremation in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD in new areas ofAsia Minor: Bithynia (2nd century AD; Koch 1990: 155–56; 2010: 131)); Isauriaand Lycaonia (probably 2nd–3rd centuries AD; Doğanay 2010: 43–47; Koch 1990:160–61; 2010: 132), and Galatia/east Phrygia (see Appendix). Cremation continuesand spreads within Ionia, to new parts of Caria (Late Hellenistic–2nd centuryAD: Koch 2010: 131), Lydia, Pamphylia, and Cilicia Trachea (see Appendix).Isolated examples also occur from sites in Paphlagonia, Cilicia, and Cappadocia;in addition a few examples are attested from Lycia, most of them probably fromthe Imperial Period, though it remains uncertain if cremation had a longertradition there or began in the Imperial Period. Evidence from Ağva indicatesthat cremation may have been practiced in the Pisidian-Lycian borderland in the3rd century BC or earlier (Özoral 1980: 95–96, 98).In the case of Ephesus, inscriptions have revealed that more than 50% of theostothecae were used by Roman citizens or freedmen (Thomas & Içten 1999: 550,552; 2007: 339–342). Some ostothecae even bear bilingual or Latin inscriptions(Thomas & Içten 1999: 552, note 23). It has been suggested that the increase inthe use of ostothecae in Ephesus in phase 2 should be seen as the adoption orreflection of Roman funerary practices (Thomas & Içten 2007: 338). Ostothecae inSmyrna (IK 23: nos 366, 383, 472) and Laodicea (IK 49: nos 102, 117) alsosupport the assumption that burial in ostothecae may have been particularlycommon among Westerners or ‘Romanised’ slaves in administrative positions. There-introduction of cremation in Early Imperial Miletus (Forbeck 2005: 59) may bea further indicator of Western influence. It is notable that several of thecolumbaria in Asia Minor were found in Miletus and Ephesus.[../images/fig6_4.jpg]Fig. 6.4. Phase 2. Cremation in the late 2nd century BC–early Imperial Period(map based on ESRI world terrain base)At two sites in Greece the practice of cremation can also be seen as a directresult of an acculturation process. At Cenchreai (Rife 2007), the eastern portof Corinth, thirty chamber tombs built in the Early Imperial Period wererecorded with niches for both inhumations and cremations. The cremated wereupper class Greeks who adopted the rite, probably under Western influence. InGreece, cremation seems to have been common in important centres and coloniesduring the 1st century AD, with strong links to the West: Corinth, Patras, andNicopolis (Flämig 2007: 89; Ubelaker & Rife 2007: 40). Cremation was alsointroduced due to the emulation of Western customs during the reign of Augustuson Samothrace, where it was practiced for only about half a century (Dusenbery1998: 22–24). Indeed, at both Corinth and Samothrace cremation was not a ritepracticed before the 1st century BC.However, the obvious impact of the Roman presence on cremation and the use ofostothecae is restricted to areas along the west coast of Asia Minor. The fewpublished examples from Isauria/Lycaonia gathered for this article are hardlyrepresentative (numerous examples of cinerary containers were not presented onthe map or in the Appendix: Bean & Mitford 1970: 98, 100, 106, 108, 110, 119,136–37, 141, 144, 148; Doğanay 2010: 43, 45, 47), as very few inscriptionsmention possible Westerners (Kubinska 1999: I 44; Swoboda, Keil & Knoll 1935:30, no. 66), and it would seem that the percentage is much lower than in theexamples from Ionia. The 251 recently published ostothecae from Pamphylia andCilicia are rarely inscribed and none bears a Latin name (Korkut 2006: 86–105).The owner of one of the early ostothecae in Sardis, dated from before theorganization of the Roman province Asia in 129 BC, bears a Latin name, but he isapparently the son of a Greek (Malay 1994: no. 439). Of 64 inscribed ostothecaewith certain provenance from Lydia (Akyürek Şahin & Onur 2008; Dedeoğlu & Malay1994; Malay 1994; 1999; Malay & Petzl 2005; Malay & Ricl 2006; examples from theCayster Valley have not been considered here), there is only one examplebelonging with all probability to a Westerner. It must remain open if the onsetof the use of ostothecae could somehow be linked to Roman dominance in Lydia andsimilarly if the use of ostothecae starts at the same time as the practice ofcremation. A late 2nd or 1st century BC family tomb in Sardis, containing ninecremated relatives with Greek names, indicates that cremation was awell-established tradition by that time (Dedeoğlu & Malay 1991; Malay 1994:440–48).A direct impact of Roman art on the shape or decoration of incinerationreceptacles in Asia Minor has certainly occurred. The use of ostothecae in AsiaMinor is much older than the quite similar cinerary urns in Rome and both groupsfollow local traditions (Sinn 1987: 11). However, a new Roman type of ostothecaeappears in Early Imperial Sagalassos and demonstrates that Roman funerary artbecame fashionable and added to the variety of local products (Köse 2002:120–21; 2005: 164). It has also been argued that the sudden and successfuldecoration with garlands on the Ephesian ostothecae, produced since the secondhalf of the 1st century BC, was introduced by Roman citizens living in Ephesus(Cormack 1997: 148; Thomas & Içten 1999: 552–53). Indeed, cinerary urns withgarland decoration were mass-produced in Rome from the middle Augustan Period(Sinn 1987: 23, 57). The influential workshops of Ephesus contributed to thespread of garland decoration to other areas (Köse 2005: 82–83). However, thedevelopment of garland decoration in Pamphylia is considered independent ofRoman decorative systems (cfr. Korkut 2006: 16).[../images/fig6_5.jpg]Fig. 6.5. Phase 3. Cremation from the 1st–3rd centuries AD (map based on ESRIworld terrain base)As a conclusion, the decisive impact that Romans, their freedmen and slaves hadon the practice of cremation and the decoration of burial containers is onlytraceable in the coastal towns of Ionia. From here Roman funerary art spreadeastwards to, for example, Sagalassos. The use of ostothecae seems to havespread from the west to the east and from the coast inland via Pamphylia toCilicia and Lycaonia, and from Bithynia to Galatia. The most obvious explanationfor the pattern observed in phases 2 and particularly 3 is that the spread isnot an indigenous development independent of the new political situation, but anadoption of coastal fashions facilitated by the improved security and economicrealities of the Pax Romana and the enormous increase of mobility. Mobility bothvoluntary and involuntary has contributed significantly to the transfer ofritual practices in the Roman Empire (Chaniotis 2009: 20). The Western influencein Pisdia, where cremation was practiced and ostothecae were produced longbefore any intense contact with the Roman West, is of course only superficial.However, it should be asked if the regions where the use of ostothecae emergedduring the Roman administration had a tradition for cremation earlier or if therite was adopted? There is of course also the possibility that cremation in someof these regions was an older rite, which was only monumentalised through theuse of ostothecae. Nevertheless, it is likely that particular groups of thelocal populations adopted the cremation rite under the influence of new trends.If these groups were aware of the indirect Western impact on their practices,however, remains uncertain. It was probably often rather an emulation of trendsin neighbouring regions that led to the use of ostothecae in connection withcremation. The ostothecae show particular local styles and the inscriptions donot reveal a strong Western presence. Possibly comparable is the diffusion ofthe Roman rosalia ritual which conquered the provinces East probably spreadingfrom the Balkans (Chaniotis 2009: 21).The pattern of distribution in Galatia, East Phrygia, and along the Pontic coastdoes not pose any particular interpretation problems. The only site withextensive evidence, Pessinus, is also the site with the oldest finds. AtPessinus, cremation was already practiced before the annexation of Galatia in 25BC, with the type of tomb showing some similarities with Celtic rites (Devrekeret al. 2003: 343; compare also a cremation tomb with Mid-Latène fibula in Assos,Stupperich 1996: 11). The cremations in Alpu and Gordion date to the 1st centuryAD, while ostothecae and inscriptions in Ancyra and Synnada provide evidence forcremation at least in the 2nd century AD. All five sites, in addition to one ofthe main production centres for ostothecae, Docimeium, are situated along one ofthe major traffic roads, identified by some scholars as the “royal highway”(Levick 1967: 10), or the road leading from Ancyra via Dorylaeum to the Bosporus(Mitchell 1995: 129); the cities Amastris, Heraclea Pontica, and Sinope wereimportant trading ports. Cultural contacts along the roads and the coast,movement of merchants, establishing garrisons, settlement of foreigners duringthe reconstruction of Pessinus and Ancyra under Augustus (Mitchell 1995: 87) andthe foundation of Caesar’s colonies in Heraclea Pontica and Sinope (MacMullen2000: 9), contributed to the distribution pattern observed there. For example,the inscriptions mentioning ostothecae from Ancyra use formulae according to theBithynian habit (Kubinska 1999: 51), which makes it likely that migratingBithynians spread their funerary customs to other regions.Phase 4: 3rd century AD (Fig. 6.6)Evidence for cremation in the 3rd century AD is scarce. However, this isprobably much more due to inadequate dating than lack of evidence. Indeed, anincrease in the practice of cremation is evident at Trebenna (Çevik &Iplikçioğlu 2003: 151). In Ephesus, Sagalassos and Pamphylia, the production oruse of ostothecae and other cinerary receptacles lasts until the middle of the3rd century AD or even later (Korkut 2006: 83; Köse 2005: 147; Thomas & Içten1999: 552). Many of the Isaurian/Lycaonian ostothecae most probably date to the3rd century AD, but lack detailed studies (Koch 2010: 132). In one cemetery inPessinus, 23 inhumations and 24 cremations were found dating from the 3rd to thelate 5th centuries AD (Lambrechts 1969: 127–31). The amount of sites, however,has obviously decreased from the previous period, based on the finds ofostothecae. Indeed, ostothecae production comes to a halt in many areas in thelate 2nd century AD. Large production centres such as Docimeium had stoppedproduction already around AD 170 (Koch 1990: 155), probably because of adecrease in demand. There is also the possibility that the market was saturatedand that a continuous production was unnecessary due to the reuse of oldostothecae. However, lack of cremation evidence and late 3rd century ADinscriptions add to the impression that this practice was indeed receding inlarge parts of Asia Minor after the 2nd century AD.It is tempting to link such a possible decline to the general reduction ofcremation in the west of the Empire, where inhumation gained more importance inthe course of the 2nd century AD and became the primary rite in the 3rd centuryAD. The development in the West has been discussed extensively in order toidentify the cause(s) for the increase of inhumation and the successfulintroduction of sarcophagi shortly after AD 100. The latest debate asserts thatno particular reason can be identified (Koch & Sichtermann 1982: 27–30; Morris1996: 31–68; Schrumpf 2006: 70–77) from the written sources. For the time beingneither religious nor ideological causes can be directly linked to changes fromcremation to inhumation in the Roman Empire before the 4th century AD (Scheid2007: 19) and vice versa. The assumption is that the shift in Rome was theresult of social fashion (Morris 1996: 33; Nock 1932: 357–59; Schrumpf 2006:76). The change from cremation to inhumation may have had its onset under theFlavian emperors, who increasingly recruited senators from inhumating areas ofItaly and the Greek East to fill the seats emptied by the civil war (Schrumpf2006: 75–76). Recently, more archaeological evidence has become available forinhumation in Rome in the 1st century AD to show that the shift in funeraryrites in the early 2nd century AD was less abrupt, than previously assumed(Steinby 2003: 28–34; Taglietti 2001: 150).[../images/fig6_6.jpg]Fig. 6.6. Phase 4. Cremation in the 3rd century AD (map based on ESRI worldterrain base)Personal freedom in the choice of the burial rite is supported by the literarysources. Greek accounts from the 2nd century AD–Athenaeus and Lucian – indicatethat the selection could have been entirely personal and sometimes made freelyby the relatives (Robinson 1942: 149). For the following short discussion bothLatin and Greek sources have to be considered because of the extremely meagerliterary evidence. This is surprising considering that inhumation replacedcremation almost completely and millions of people changed their funerary habitsradically in the course of only 150 years. In the 1870s, thousands ofcontributions were published for or against cremation during the debate aroundits introduction in Germany (Thalmann 1978: 9, 13–15). In the Roman Empire,however, there was seemingly no noteworthy debate on this issue. The differencebetween the two periods may be that European cremationists of the 19th centuryhad to overcome a religious dogma that had determined funerary rites for farover one millennium and thus felt an enormous pressure to defend their cause.Such a religious consensus simply did not exist in the multi-religious RomanEmpire, and consequently a discussion was unnecessary.There was obviously no philosophical objection against any burial rite.Lucretius argues that the treatment of the body after death is of no importancefor the dead because death would mean the end of self (De rerum natura3.870–93). Lucin sees the body dissolve into the cycle of nature independentlyof any funerary treatment (Pharsalia 7.27–28). These Epicurean and Stoic notionsmay not have applied to everybody at that time, but may be representative of aconsiderable part of Roman society. The Stoic notion is further interpreted byMinucius Felix, a 2nd or 3rd century AD Christian writer (Octavia 34.10). Hebelieves that even though the corpse is transformed by whatever funerary rite ortreatment after death into whatever element, it will still exist for God, who isthe preserver of the elements. Minucius mentions further that the Christiansprefer the old tradition of inhumation, additionally hinting at the resurrectionof the body at the last judgment (Octavia 34.11–12). The characterization ofinhumation as a tradition can also be found in the Syriac version of Aristides’Apology (14). He praises the Jews for burying their dead because this isagreeable to god and a tradition from their forefathers.From the other sources we may extract two more arguments against cremation. Thefirst is the pity and respect for the corpse, which is particularly evident inthe Early Christian sources (Rebillard 2009: 84–85; Volp 2002: 187–88).Tertullian writes that the body may exercise a reduced activity after death,basing his argument on Democritus’ observation of corpses growing hair and nailsafter death and the possibility of revivication exemplified by Plato’s Er (DeAnima 51.2–4). He adds that many choose not to cremate because of these remainsof life in the corpse and/or because of respect for the body that does notdeserve such a harsh treatment (see also Turcan 1958: 341). Pity for the body isnot a new or even Christian argument; the 1st century AD description of a manwho did not cremate his wife because he could not bear the smell and noise ofthe cremation process already points to such emotions (Statius Silvae5.1.225–28). Everybody who reads the vivid ancient reports on cremations (Noy2000) will understand that the extreme transformation of the burning body couldhave been a traumatic experience for the audience and evoked a strong sensationof pity. This may indeed have been a factor for the decision for a “peacefulend” (Bynum 1995: 53; Davies 2011: 50).According to Philostratus Vitae Sophistarum, the Sophist, Apollonius, acontemporary of Septimius Severus, allegedly held the declamation ‘Callias triesto dissuade the Athenians from burning the dead’ (602). In the passage,Apollonius argues that fire is an ethereal element linked to the divine ratherthan to the underworld, which would be polluted by the corpse. The Greeks hadtheir own tradition of rituals including purification with fire (Burkert 1970:3–7), which places Apollonius’ argument in an understandable context. However, aHadrianic funerary inscription from Nicaea contains the contradictory argumentthat the burning of the corpse by fire was by others considered an act ofpurification (Anthologia Palatina 15.6). Apollonius’ notion of the divinecharacter of fire might rather have been inspired by Pythagorean philosophy andit has to be considered whether the argument reflected Apollonius’ own belief.According to the meager written sources (Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia35.160), inhumation was part of the Pythagorean funerary rite (Kahn 2001: 88,90). There are further indications that the sect indeed tried to avoid pollutionof the fire (Diogenes Laertius, Lives 8.17), probably under the influence ofZoroastrian lore (Miller 2011: 65–66). Apollonius might also have drawn hisinspiration directly from Persian (Turcan 1958: 337–40) or Hellenistic sourcesdiscussing the Persian abhorrence of cremation (Dioscorides, Anthologia Palatina7.162). The fascination of the sophists with Zoroaster is already attested somehundred years earlier in the oration 36 of the Bithynian Dio Chrysostomos.Whatever his sources, Apollonius must have been very clear about the religiousconnotation of the argument.This does not necessarily mean that Apollonius was agitating against cremationor that he acted as the follower of a religious sect. The declamation wasprobably held ex tempore and in this case the topic would be proposed by theaudience. Indeed, Apollonius possibly had a repertoire of excellent argumentsagainst inhumation if the audience had chosen to hear that instead.Nevertheless, it should be assumed that this argument against cremation wasconsidered a good one at that time and it cannot be excluded that Apolloniuseven used a popular idea for the persuasiveness of his declamation. It was theprofession of the sophistic teachers in their function as speakers andembassies, at the highest level of Roman politics, to persuade the audience oftheir declamations, both with an elaborate rhetoric style and a powerfulargumentation. Apollonios probably held this speech at the Academy in Athenswhere he held a chair for political oratory. The declamation was not only heardof by a considerable part of the richest and most influential intellectuals inthe Greek world, but the oral and written transmission of such teachings alsospread philosophical ideas to all the Greek intellectuals. Thus, it could haveinfluenced the decision for the funerary rite of the listeners and readers.The examples cited above show that diametric ideas like pity for the deceased orthe pollutive nature of the corpse may have been used against cremation. It isclear that there were a variety of personal, religious, and philosophicalreasons for the choice of a funerary rite and no consensus that actuated thedecrease in cremation. This strongly suggests that the decline was not anisolated ritual change, originating directly from a single or multiplesource(s), but only one symptom of a much wider psychological shift.Cremation offered an abrupt separation from the deceased and an omission of theputrefaction process. Dio Chrysostomos (Oration 4.32) mentions as a particularattribute of cremation that it dissolves the corpse completely except for theteeth, a characteristic that Pliny the Elder (Naturalis Historia 36.27) hadshortly before imputed to sarcophagi from Assos and Lycia. It seems that theradical consumption of the corpse by fire was a desirable effect for those whopracticed cremation. Inhumation, however, would extend the period of separation.Hence, even if the corpse was placed in a sealed tomb, a sarcophagus or a grave,the awareness of the presence of the body, which had been seen intact at thefuneral, must have made the separation feel less finite. The prolongation ofseparation gave the possibility of prolonged mourning, particularly when thedeceased had been placed in a tomb or sarcophagus. The preference for anextended separation process and the increasing respect for the body, asextracted from the written sources, may be connected to the heightened concernfor a lasting monument and epigraphic commemoration in the 2nd century AD.Analyses of funerary inscriptions have established an unprecedented increase ofLatin inscriptions in the 2nd century AD in the Roman Empire, peaking around AD200 (MacMullen 1982: 241–46; Morris 1996: 167–68). A second analysis of theinscriptions from Lydia, most of them epitaphs, reached a comparable result, butwith a peak in the reign of Marcus Aurelius (MacMullen 1986). In Paphlagonia,the chronological distribution is also comparable (French 1991; Højte 2006:tables 1–2, 4). MacMullen (1982: 246) gives the following hypothesis: ‘… people…counted on their world still continuing in existence for a long time to come, soas to make nearly permanent memorials worthwhile’. Indeed, the extreme increasecan only be the result of a heightened desire for a lasting memory.The enormous increase in sarcophagi in 2nd century AD Asia Minor points in thesame direction. Only a few received a lasting or individual monument in earlyImperial Asia Minor and most were probably interred in family monuments or insimple graves. The stelae and ostothecae used at that time were too easy toremove, which is shown by the fact that they are rarely found in their originalcontext. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, large parts of the population incertain regions acquired sarcophagi, which by their weight and size alone couldguarantee a long lasting memorial. Sarcophagi would have been a considerableexpense, but at the same time could serve for multiple interments (for exampleAsgari & Firatli 1978: 34), while the burial spot would not cost more than asimple shaft grave. Because of the possibility of a lasting memorial and theseadditional benefits, more people may have been inclined to save money for theirown burial during their lifetime or spend large sums on deceased relatives thanwas the case before the 2nd century AD. This further implies that money wasrather spent on the funerary monument, than on a sumptuous funeral including thepyre.Concluding remarksCremation had a renaissance during and subsequent to the Macedonian incursions,after its almost complete abolishment under Persian rule. An impact of Persianreligion on the practice of cremation in the 6th and 5th centuries BC ispossible but must remain hypothetical. However, the comeback of cremation afterthe Macedonian conquest in the late 4th century BC certainly reflects theadaption and emulation of foreign customs enabled by new cultural and economiccontacts under Macedonian and Ptolemaic rule. The rite spread from regions inwestern and southern Asia Minor to large parts of western Anatolia during theHellenistic and Roman Imperial Periods, but regional differences are evident.Emulation was probably a decisive factor behind the long distance spread of theuse of ostothecae in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD. The distribution pattern inGalatia and Paphlagonia makes migration the most plausible factor for the spreadof cremation under the Pax Romana. Even though the distribution patterns andepigraphic evidence for some regions clearly show an increased spread ofcremation, the Roman rule appears not to have caused a significant ritual changefor the area as a whole. Cremation was practiced side by side with inhumationand often was a matter of practical considerations, personal preferences(Ubelaker & Rife 2007: 41), traditions or even fashions. Indeed, it isimpossible to trace any discrimination of cremation between the late 4th centuryBC and the 3rd century AD. Hence, it seems that the two rites were not seen assomething contrary, but rather as just two options in the multifaceted range ofmortuary rites available in Asia Minor.The evidence gathered for this summary demonstrates, indeed, that cremation wasa ‘Greek’ rite in Asia Minor or maybe rather an Ionian, Pisidian, Rhodian,Carian rite, and so forth. Cremation was practiced in Pisidia and Rhodes for aperiod of 500–600 years, and thus longer than for example in Rome. However, on asuper-regional level inhumation was much more common than cremation at least inthe Imperial Period. An uncritical and unsystematic search in the PackhardHumanities database gives over 800 mentions of the term σορὸς (sarcophagus) ininscriptions from Asia Minor, most of them from the Imperial Period.Additionally, there are hundreds of inscriptions, mentioning other terms forsarcophagi, for example, σοματοθήκη, ἀνγεῖον, πυαλίς, πύελος (collected inKubinska 1968: 32–57). A comparison with the 60 inscriptions mentioning ὀστοθήκηand καύστρα (Kubinska 1999: passim) makes the overriding dominance of inhumationin the epigraphic record very clear. Such preeminence was already visible in theHellenistic necropoleis of Assos and Myrina.AppendixIn the table below are summarised the cremations discussed in the text.Abbreviations used in the table: Hel= Hellenistic; Imp = Roman Imperial; E =Early; L = Late; 1/2 = first half; 2/2 = second half; 2/4 = second quarter; 1/3third quarter; Aug = Augustan.

Burial practice in this period is oftenperceived by scholars as conservative, reflecting greater continuity ofindigenous Iron Age tradition than other aspects of life under Roman rule. Thispaper argues that this characterisation is flawed, since it underestimateschange and, more importantly, evaluates burial practice in isolation, makinginsufficient use of the contextual evidence available to interpret Roman Periodmortuary rituals. Taking its cue from the study of prehistoric burials,particular attention is given to the identity for the dead constructed byparticipants during the funerary ritual from the objects placed with the body orits cremated remains. These recurring symbols embody and evoke an urbanesociability that epitomises ‘Roman’-style savoir faire as much, if not more,than adherence to local tradition.Keywords: Belgica, Britain, funerary assemblages, Gallia, mortuary ritual, Romanburial, Roman savoir-faireThe interpretation of funerary assemblages from Rome’s northwest provincesprovides the subject matter for this article. I focus in particular on thoseassemblages with abundant grave goods, sometimes of prestigious character, whichare considered to accompany the burials of the elite dead, urban magistrates andvilla-owners. Interpretation of the burial practice of which these are theresidue has emphasised their continuity with pre-Roman Iron Age tradition. This‘traditional’ character has often been taken to signify that burial customschange less than others after incorporation within the Roman world, or even thatthey manifest resistance to Rome. This, I will argue, is misleading, since theseburials demonstrate continuity only when considered in isolation: reading themagainst the changed material and social world around them allows a differentperspective. In re-reading these assemblages, I hope to draw attention to therichness of evidence for burial rituals from the Roman world for acontextualised study of burial practice, since it scarcely features in thebroader literature in the archaeology of death (Parker Pearson 1999). Unlikesome other types of data, such as public buildings or villas, limited use ofburial evidence has also been made for characterising provincial Romansocieties: in the study of Roman Britain, for example burial data have playedlittle role in the ‘Romanisation’ debate (James & Millett 2001; Millett 1990).This is particularly striking when compared to the importance of funeraryarchaeology for the study of those periods preceding and succeeding the Romancenturies. I hope therefore to use this case study to follow up Ian Morris’(1992) advocacy of the potential for contextualised reading of burial practiceto enhance understanding of provincial societies.The paper first outlines changing burial rituals in the northwest provinces ofthe Empire from the Late Iron Age to the 3rd century AD, with a particular focuson characterising the funerary rituals traditionally associated with elites. Thecharacterisation of Roman Period rituals uses examples from southern Britain andeastern Belgium and the Netherlands. The individual assemblages discussed aredescribed and referenced in Tables 7.1 and 7.2. I review previousinterpretations and outline an alternative perspective, drawing on recentstudies of burial practice beyond the Classical world. Contextual information,especially comparison with other contexts of deposition, allows us to‘calibrate’ the burial of the dead as a focus of display and as a medium fornegotiating power relations, but also to consider the capacity of the objectsplaced with the remains of the dead to evoke other areas of social practice.These allusions and connotations can be reconstructed through comparison withnon-funerary archaeological and textual sources. While multiple readings werepossible, I argue that from the mise-en-scène in the grave, in particular theobjects placed with the dead, many participants in the burial ritual couldconstruct an identity for the dead as epitomising ‘Roman’ cultivation and savoirfaire.‘Princely’ burials of the 1st century BC and early 2nd century AD, Britain andnorthern GaulDuring the Iron Age in northwest Europe burial practice is only intermittentlyvisible to archaeologists. From the late 2nd century BC a mosaic of regionalfunerary traditions can however be documented, of which the most widespread isthe so-called ‘North Gallic culture’, discontinuously distributed acrossnorthern Gaul and southeastern Britain, where it is known as the‘Aylesford-Swarling’ tradition. This is a cremation tradition in which burialswere accompanied by a range of grave goods, most commonly wheel-turned ceramicsand dress accessories (Fitzpatrick 2000; 2007; Roymans 1990). In some areas inthe 1st century BC, for example the Aisne and Moselle valleys andEssex/Herfordshire, burial hierarchies have been identified on the basis ofmajor differences in the number and range of artefacts buried or consumed on thepyre (Haselgrove 1987). The earliest examples of tombs with very substantialburial assemblages (termed ‘Welwyn’ burials in Britain after a key type-site),are first manifested in the early 1st century BC, for example at Baldock inHertfordshire (c. 100–50 BC) and Clemency in Luxembourg (c. 80–60 BC). Examplesdescribed in Table 7.1 illustrate their development on either side of theChannel up to the early 1st century AD: despite the absorption of northern Gaulinto the Roman Empire several decades before Britain, burial rituals appear tohave changed in tandem.Hearth furniture and vessels for storing, serving and consuming food and drinkdominate these assemblages. The former includes cauldrons, suspension chains,and iron firedogs, the latter copper alloy and copper alloy-bound buckets,tankards and drinking horns, as well as ceramics made locally and elsewherewithin northwest Europe, especially terra nigra and terra rubra from c. 15–10BC. Mediterranean imports include silver, copper alloy, Arretine andoccasionally glass vessels associated with serving and drinking wine. Dressel 1Aand later 1B wine amphorae, predominantly from west central Italy, are found insome graves in numbers: later the repertoire is extended by amphorae fromsouthern France and Tarraconensis, the latter containing fish sauce. Animalbones from burials and their environs comprise the principal direct evidence forfoodstuffs consumed by the participants and/or burnt on the pyre.Weapons buried with the dead include panoplies and individual items. Spears andshields (represented by their bosses) are the most common, but rarer items werealso deposited, for example visors from parade armour (Feugère 1996). Someburials also contain horse gear and, occasionally, evidence for the depositionof vehicles or their parts. In Britain copper alloy mirrors decorated in La Tènestyle are sometimes documented in burials in this tradition, primarily, but notexclusively with women (Joy 2010). Other items documented include gaming pieces,laid out on the game board in the ‘doctor’s’ burial at Stanway (Essex), bearclaws from cremation of the deceased in a bearskin (for example at Baldock,Clemency, Welwyn Garden City, and Folly Lane), a carved bier from Folly Lane,medical and divining equipment. Excavations of tomb settings shows deposition ofgrave goods to be part of a longer ritual sequence, which also saw destructionof objects on the pyre and in post-burial ceremonies, sometimes inmonumentalised settings. The latter are perhaps most spectacularly attested inthe massive ditched enclosures and funerary chambers at Stanway and Folly Lane.These tombs have been central to writing the social and cultural history of LateIron Age northwest Europe. Once primarily discussed as indicators of migration,attention shifted during the 1980s to exploring the socio-political dimension ofthe funerary ceremonies of which these are the residue. In an influential paperColin Haselgrove argued (1987) that innovation in burial practice in northernGaul represents a realignment of Gallic elite behaviour on Roman models afterthe Caesarean conquest:‘At burial sites such as Goeblingen-Nospelt the message is re-iterated ineverything from large-scale wine consumption to the cremation rite: the powerand continued success of the ruling groups was indissolubly linked to the Romanalliance.’ (Haselgrove 1987: 116).John Creighton (2006) has also seen (in the British examples) an emphaticstatement of connections to Rome in these funerary ceremonies, arguing thathostages and ambassadors returned to Britain with a new form of politicaltheatre to legitimate their position. Others have argued that the emphasis onRomanisation may be exaggerated or misplaced. Fitzpatrick (2000; 2007) proposesthat exotic artefacts and foodstuffs were assimilated within an existingfeasting culture in different ways across northwest Europe. Pitts’ (2005) recentanalysis of pot forms and capacities suggests that beer rather thanwine-drinking remained the focus of feasting; only with such evidence can thelimited and problematic textual documentation for beer drinking be complemented(Nelson 2005: 38–67). Others argue that the external or exotic connectionsdisplayed in these ceremonies are those within north-west Europe, rather than tothe Mediterranean (Crummy et al. 2007; Haselgrove 1996: 174–75). It is perhapsnot helpful to choose definitively between a Roman and a local aspect, since thereading may well vary according to the context of the participant, with aspecifically ‘Roman’ value to some objects or ceremonies only being available tosome. Burial with arms may derive from local martial culture, but take onadditional meaning where individuals have served under Roman leaders as clientsor in the auxilia (Feugère 1996).Whatever their cultural resonance, the special character of these objects seemsindisputable, as does their restricted circulation, since they are rarely foundin settlement deposits. Arguably the objects deposited in the grave were bothobjects of gift exchange in their own right and evoke the other occasions inwhich these objects were made and exchanged, for example the gift giving,especially the feasting documented in the Classical authors such as Posidonius(Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae IV 151–2; Gosden & Garrow 2012: 196–255). Someobjects may have served as symbols of office or priestly status, their userequiring restricted knowledge: for example the enigmatic rods associated withthe medical equipment and gaming pieces in the ‘doctor’s’ tomb at Stanway areargued to have had a possible role in divination. However, the particular statusof the buried individuals, whether that be ‘princely’ (Fürstengräber) or ‘noble’(Adelsgräber), is less significant than the central place of burial ceremoniesin contesting successions (Haselgrove 1987: 117), particularly perhaps wheremonumentalised burials cluster near central places, as atCamulodunum-Colchester. The near contemporary tomb of Caecilia Metella on theAppian Way outside Rome reminds us that the burial of politically insignificantindividuals could be exploited to project group ambition (Gerding 2002).Display in funerary ritual in the 1st–3rd centuries AD, Britain and northernGaulAs already indicated there is no radical break in funerary traditions in thedecades after the Roman conquest on either side of the English Channel. Insteadthe further development of existing trends can be documented, including a longterm increase in the proportion of the dead being afforded an archaeologicallyvisible burial. The reconfiguration of settlement space, especially aroundtowns, further distanced the dead from the living. Lining the roads that radiatefrom towns, urban cemeteries are regularly attested in chartered towns such asSt Albans and Tongres, reflecting the requirements of city foundation chartersattested elsewhere in the Empire, for example for Urso, a Caesarian colony insouthern Spain (Lex Ursonensis 73–74). The same is true of agglomérationssecondaires, such as Baldock (Hertfordshire) or Wederath (Rheinland-Pfalz) andin farms and villas too the dead were similarly placed on the periphery ofsettlement space. The relative infrequency of intercutting between gravessuggests that many were marked. Perhaps the most obvious funerary innovation isthe commissioning of stone monuments bearing inscriptions or carved image tomark a small number of burials. In Britain they are scarce outside garrisoncommunities, even in London and other major towns (Hope 1997), but in easternGallia Belgica, especially among the Treveri they are as abundant and diverse asthose in any provincial setting and the rich sculptural decoration as well asextensive epigraphic habit gives unique insights into provincial culture(Wightman 1985: 164–5; Freigang 1997). Elsewhere barrows, usually in ruralsettings, are the commonest monument, abundant in southeast England, easternBelgium and on the Moselle (Wigg 1993).Rituals too show a substantial degree of continuity. In the early Roman Period(1st and 2nd centuries AD) the dead were usually cremated but non-infantinhumation was also widely practised prior to becoming the norm during the 3rdcentury AD: its wide distribution makes it difficult to attach specific ethnicexplanations to its occurrence (Jones 1987; Faber et al. 2004). The cremationtradition varies: in a minority of burials, for example, the same pit served aspyre and grave – the bustum (Struck 1993). The evidence for pyre rituals islimited, though well-studied pyre debris suggests that objects were oftendestroyed in substantial quantities by burning (see below).After cremation the remains of the dead were usually collected and buried in avariety of containers, typically a pottery jar. In some cases pyre debris,including charcoal, further cremated bone and artefact fragments was also placedin the burial or buried with the remains of the dead unsorted(Brandschuttgräber). A complex typology has evolved to describe the varied modesof incorporating pyre debris in the grave, but its terms are not consistentlyapplied and without full documentation it may not be possible to distinguishbetween burials, pyre sites, and other deposits of pyre debris or the residue ofcommemorative ceremonies (Bechert 1980; Scheid ed. 2008; Weekes 2008).Grave goods were frequently placed with the dead, especially table ceramics(Table 7.2: Figs 7.1–7.4). These have received the majority of scholarlyattention, their cataloguing comprising a major component of cemeterypublications, and they form the backbone of Roman provincial museum collections.As in the later Iron Age there is considerable regional variability in thequantity and type of grave goods deposited. This variability is only partlyunderstood, the major survey for northern Gaul having been published more than40 years ago (Van Doorsaeler 1967), whilst two decades have elapsed sincePhilpott’s (1991) synthesis of Romano-British burial. As in the Iron Age, wheregrave goods are commonly deposited it is possible to identify a hierarchy amongburials, at the apex of which a small number of burials with very substantialgrave good assemblages. Some of these are associated with monuments, especiallybarrows (Jones 1987; Struck 2000; Wigg 1993). Evidence for pre-interment ritualsreminds us that deposition on the pyre could be an alternative or complementarystage in the deposition or destruction of objects. This aspect of funeraryrituals is not yet well understood (see above), but can be illustrated in therange of pyre and feasting deposits from Belgium (Table 7.2, especiallyHelshoven and Berlingen) and in the remnants of a spectacular barbecue fromBiberist-Spitalhof (Solothurn, Switzerland). In this instance a late secondcentury cremation burial contained the burnt remains of at least 333 ceramicvessels, molten glass and metal, and foodstuffs including carbonised lentils,grain, and fruit and at least seven pigs and a cow (Schucany & Delage 2006:113–30). The instructions to burn hunting equipment and textiles in theextensive will of a second century AD Gallic aristocrat recorded in a Medievalmanuscript the so-called ‘Testament of the Lingon’ indicate that other itemswere sometimes destroyed on the pyre (Woolf 1998: 167). Burnt fragments ofwriting equipment in a tomb at Nersingen (Ulm, Bavaria) provide anarchaeological illustration of this (Ambs and Faber 1998).[../images/fig7_1.jpg]Fig. 7.1. Plan of a Flavian Period cremation burial (2) from Winchester GrangeRoad. The shaded area indicates the location of the cremated bone (after Biddle1967, 232, fig. 5; G = glass vessel, M = metal vessel). For assemblage see Table7.2.[../images/fig7_2.jpg]Fig. 7.2. Reconstruction of Winchester Grange Road burial 2, Winchester Museum.The cremated bone was found beside and on the shale tray. Gaming pieces andother small items were placed in the SW corner of the grave (bottom left)(Reproduced with kind permission of Winchester City Council).These large grave good assemblages will be the focus of the rest of the paper.Their characterisation (Table 7.2) is based on two sample areas, southeastBritain and eastern Belgium and the south Netherlands. In the former areaexamples are taken from the civitates of the Catuvellauni and Belgae, inparticular the environs of St Albans/Verulamium (Hertfordshire) andWinchester/Venta Belgarum (Hampshire). There is a direct continuity here withthe (British) Late Iron Age burials discussed above. Philpott’s (1991) synthesisof Romano-British burial practice includes extensive discussion from theterritory of the Catuvellauni, while Millett (1987) focuses on the Hampshireburial tradition. The sample area in Belgica comprises Belgian and Dutch Limburgand Brabant, especially the central area of the civitas of the Tungri bisectedby the Cologne-Bavai road. Here the tradition of rich burial rarely pre-datesthe later 1st century AD. Some of the most spectacular assemblages cannot bereconstructed in detail because of poor documentation, but their contents aresummarised and lavishly illustrated by Mariën (1980: 243–308). Examples listedin Table 7.2 are selected from more recent excavations: results from projectsundertaken in the 1970s and 1980s are discussed by Roosens (1976) and van denHurk (1984), while de Groot (2006) reports a key assemblage excavated in 2003and notes other recent work. The following discussion draws on these and otherexamples to characterise the recurring aspects of these grave groups underapproximate functional headings (dining, bathing, hunting or ritual). While thisis a typical approach to these grave assemblages (Nuber 1972; van den Hurk1984), it should be noted that the function of specific objects is not securelyestablished in all cases, as Cool’s (2006) discussion of Roman dining equipmentillustrates. Many objects were also used in multiple settings, for example thejug and pan set at the sacrifice or the meal, cosmetic gear at home or thebaths. The relationship between objects, their purpose and their symbolicsignificance will be evaluated after this description.In both sample areas the deposition of substantial grave groups continues fromthe first into the early third centuries AD. In Britain the cremated remains ofthe dead are more likely to have been deposited in perishable containers, eitherbags or wooden boxes, of which the fittings sometimes survive, such as casketswith lionhead studs from Essex and Hertfordshire (Philpott 1991: 12–16). Stoneor metal cists or glass containers also commonly served as containers for theseburials. In Belgica massive stone coffins of a size sufficient to contain anunburnt body are sometimes used for cremation, most famously the Simpelveldsarcophagus with its unique carved interior surface (de Groot 2006: 55, 116).Ceramics account for the vast majority of grave goods, especially dishes, bowls,and cups for consumption of food and drink, often in terra sigillata. Vesselsfor food preparation or storage are represented in small numbers and unlikeearlier burials amphorae were infrequently deposited, usually in singleinstances. Examples in Table 7.2 illustrate the frequently consistent ratiobetween numbers of different vessel forms. A nine or 12 piece ‘service’ for anindividual is sometimes proposed, but numbers of pots vary widely and somedining ware, especially decorated terra sigillata bowls, is absent from burialassemblages (Martin-Kilcher 1976: 84–87). Whether this ‘service’ represents theequipment of a single or multiple diners also cannot be known: larger numbers ofvessels would however have provided for more than a single individual, forexample in the pyre debris from Biberist-Spitalhof discussed above.Glass vessels were more frequently found in these larger assemblages than inother burials, jugs and bottles for storing and serving liquids being thecommonest forms (van Lith & Randsborg 1985). Multiple deposits are sometimes ofidentical types, for example boxed square glass bottles at Helshoven. Later inthe 2nd century AD they also comprise ‘services’ of cups and plates for eatingand drinking, as at Esch and Bocholtz (Massart 2001).Iconographic evidence shows that the paired copper alloy jugs and handled pansfound in many of these assemblages were used for hand washing at a meal orsacrifice: some graves substitute glass or ceramic vessels in these forms (Nuber1972). Other less common metal vessels include double handled jugs, drinkingcups, and shallow pans (‘bath saucers’) as well as strainers. Among other diningitems are knives and spoons, the latter in bone, copper alloy, and occasionallysilver, as at Cortil-Noirmont and Bocholtz.Furniture and lighting equipment were also often deposited in these graves.After the early 1st century AD ivory- and bone-inlaid couches, as documented atFolly Lane were rarely used for cremation (Eckardt 1999: 77), but folding seatsof the type documented at Bocholtz have been found in other second century tombsin Belgica and Britain (de Groot 2006: 112–13). These are conventionallyinterpreted as sellae curules (portable seats symbolising holding ormagistracies or civic honour), or sellae castrenses (portable seats indicatingmilitary rank), but both have a common origin in a domestic form and it does notseem possible to differentiate between the latter and signifiers of rank (Nuber1972: 171–72). Tripods from St Albans and Bois-et-Borsu probably supported traysof food (cf. Nuber 1984). Lighting equipment is frequently attested, mostcommonly ceramic lamps, less often iron or copper alloy lamps or candelabras.Many items related to the manipulation of physical appearance (cf. Crummy &Eckardt 2008). As well as mirrors, sometimes plain, as at Stansted, less oftendecorated, as at Simpelveld, the panoply of items for modifying personalappearance include razors, tweezers, nail cleaners, ear scoops, as well aspalettes and mortars for grinding cosmetic powders or medicines. Glass unguentbottles containing cosmetics and perfumes (and spatulas for extracting them)regularly occur amongst these assemblages, though they are also to be found inless-well furnished burials. Among the dress-related items copper alloy broochesare found widely among provincial Roman tombs. Precious metal jewellery is rarebut documented in a small number of burials, often of juveniles or young adultsacross the Roman west (Rottloff 1995). Some individuals were dressed or shod infabrics incorporating gold thread. Both instances are illustrated at Southfleet,Kent, where gold thread survived on leather shoes in a 2nd century cremationburial and a child burial was accompanied by a gold necklace, ring andsnake-headed bracelets of 3rd century AD date.Other artefacts served as equipment for leisure or labour. Bathing gear,primarily strigils and glass or metal oil flasks and perfume bottles, isrestricted to these larger assemblages. The metal examples are sometimes richlyfigured: the Bocholtz flask takes the form of a bust of Antinous while theHerstal example bore relief images of lovers and philosophers (Braun 2001).Gaming pieces, usually in glass, but occasionally in other materials, forexample amber at Cortil-Noirmont, are recorded in varying numbers andcombinations, placed in a bag or scattered across the tomb floor (Schädler 2007:366). Of writing implements styli are the most commonly attested, sometimes withsilver-inlay (Simpelveld). Less common are spatulas and inkwells, while smallknives and rulers like those found at Berlingen may also be writing-related(Ambs & Faber 1998: 441–44; Bozic & Feugère 2004). After the mid-1st century ADburial of weapons was largely given up in Britain, but spears, axes, and daggerswere sometimes deposited in Dutch and Belgian tombs (Nicolay 2007: 199–206). Thedaggers are sometimes identified as parazonia, i.e. parade swords worn by Romanarmy officers, but they do not correspond well with the limited textual andartistic evidence for these (Devijver & van Wonterghem 1990: 95–96). These armsmay have served for hunting or combat. Horse harness and vehicles or their partsare also better documented in Belgica (de Groot 2006: 43, 104). Other tools werevery occasionally deposited with the dead, medical instruments being the mostwidely distributed (Künzl 1982).[../images/fig7_3.jpg]Fig. 7.3. Plan of the grave pit at Bocholtz, Limburg, Netherlands. The crematedbone was placed in the stone chest (501). For assemblage see Table 7.2 (withkind permission of T. de Groot, Rijksdienst voor Archeologie, Cultuurlandschapen Monumenten, Amersfoort).[../images/fig7_4.jpg]Fig. 7.4. Reconstruction of the grave pit at Bocholtz, Limburg, Netherlands(with kind permission of T. de Groot, Rijksdienst voor Archeologie,Cultuurlandschap en Monumenten, Amersfoort).The Dutch and Belgian tombs are richer in exceptional items than those fromBritain. Instances include the portrait cameo of Augustus deposited in a 2ndcentury grave from Tienen, knife handles, distaffs and figures in amber, and,exceptionally, a piece of amber carved in the form of a shell with reliefdecoration showing a Capricorn carrying a vessel between its front paws. A rockcrystal lizard and ring were deposited in the same tomb group as the amber shellfrom Cortil-Noirmont (Mariën 1980). Occasionally inscriptions explicitlyindicate that objects have been given as gifts, for example the dedicationIunoni meae on the Simpelveld ring, although we do not know if the deceased wasthe original recipient (Zinn 1997). At Tienen and in other cases objects weresometimes several decades or centuries old when deposited and it seems likelythat their ‘biographies’ may be significant in their selection to accompany thedead (cf. Gosden & Garrow 2012).No single arrangement of objects within the tomb can be identified and it isoften not possible from older excavations to differentiate objects placed indirect association with the grave and those above it (Gaeng & Metzler 2008). AtBerlingen grave goods were packed tightly and with little apparent order in awooden case, but at Bocholtz they were spaced in groups in and around the stonechest containing the cremated bone as well as elsewhere in the timber chamber.Spatial grouping of artefacts sometimes relates to function: at Esch, forexample, pairs of jugs and bowls were regularly placed above the timber chestscontaining the cremated remains, while at Bocholtz washing gear (a metal jug,bowl, and bath flask) was placed in the east corner of the tomb chamber (Figs7.3–7.4). Yet in the same tomb other washing gear was placed elsewhere in thegrave, strigils in its north corner with weapons, and a further jug and pan withglass eating and drinking vessels in the south. Ceramic and glass vessels werestacked, boxed or laid out, sometimes on trays of wood, shale or pewter withanimal remains sometimes placed on them, pig being the most common species (Cool2006: 82–84) (Figs 7.1–7.2). The disposition is suggestive of place settings,but the variability must, for the moment at least, frustrate reconstruction oftable layout (contra Cool 2006: 193–97) and it is not certain that vessels werein simultaneous use. Disappearance of perishable items, especially food,textiles, or wooden items poses an obstacle, not only to understanding layoutbut also to whether and how some items were wrapped.Interpreting the civilised deadThe post-conquest tombs, like burial practice in general, have played a somewhatmarginal role in the study of the Roman Period (see above). Individual types ofgrave goods have often been considered in isolation as a key source of evidencefor artefact chronology, typology, and function, since burials often offer themost complete examples. As such, museums often display them in isolation fromtheir funerary context to illustrate Roman lifestyle. Nevertheless burialrituals have attracted some interest as evidence for social and cultural changeunder the Empire. Robert Philpott’s (1991) emphasis on the continuity of IronAge traditions and beliefs in Roman burial rituals in Britain exemplifies anenduring view of burial practice in the early Roman northwest. Change isprimarily conceded in the materials used within the rituals, rather than in theessentials of their performance and their significance: it has been widelyproposed that burial practice is not fully ‘Romanised’ until the spread ofinhumation from the late 2nd century AD (van Doorsaeler 1967: 67; Morris 1992:68; Wightman 1985: 188). Other scholars have given this characterisation greatertheoretical weight by connecting it to general models for cultural change, i.e.to the Romanisation debate. Greg Woolf’s (1998: 247) proposal for a ‘formative’phase in the adoption of Roman culture, primarily by (male) elites engaged inurban public life and manifested in the creation of Roman-style publicbuildings, leaves other areas, including burials, as cultural ‘backwaters’. Thisposition is explicitly articulated by Nicola Terrenato (1998: 24), in whoseformulation oppositions of public and private, male and female, and home andtomb differentiate areas at the interface with Roman power and culture fromthose which are not. In this view change to burial practice comes later andserves to differentiate within provincial society more than to demonstratecultural community with Roman incomers. Taking up the cudgels of an olderargument, Manuela Struck (1995) has argued that the apparent endurance of IronAge burial practice and the limited adoption of Roman customs may even indicatecultural resistance in Britain and elsewhere.This emphasis on continuity does not however take sufficiently intoconsideration significant changes in the form of the ritual itself, for examplethe disappearance of hearth furniture or amphorae from the funerary repertoireor the reduced frequency of weapon burial. More to the point though, it takeslimited account of contextual information to interpret the assemblages, inparticular of the rich archaeological and documentary evidence for thecirculation of these artefacts and their social contexts. Paradoxically moreattention has been given to the very limited evidence for the afterlife beliefsthat may be indicated by these rituals (Morris 1992).Parker-Pearson (1993; 1999) has proposed that through comparison of settlement,votive and funerary contexts it is possible to assess burial as a sphere ofdisplay in comparison to other arenas. I noted above that the many objectsplaced in Late Iron Age tombs derived from socially restricted exchanges,especially gift-giving. The special status of these artefacts and their rarityin other contexts, as well as the creation of monumental complexes in which toperform sometimes protracted burial ceremonies, indicate the central role ofburial in the reproduction of social relations, especially amongst competingelites. The significance of burial from the mid-1st to early 3rd century AD isnot so clear cut as in the preceding period. With incorporation in the Romanworld other contexts have attracted more attention as the media in which eliteshave competed, especially, from the Augustan Period, urban public buildings, andlater, town and rural housing. Within burial assemblages, some of the mostnumerically significant elements, such as terra sigillata and glass, occurwidely on contemporary settlements as well as generally in burial practice. Ittherefore seems unlikely that these were derived from restricted circuits ofexchange, although the frequency of terra sigillata and glass is higher in thesegraves than in others (van Lith & Randsborg 1985) and as a proportion of anassemblage it is often higher than on settlement sites. Some grave goods mayalso have been badges of civic or military rank, and thus also restricted incirculation, but these identifications can be challenged (see above). A limitedgroup of objects, for example the Tienen cameo or rock crystal or amberfigurines, would have been restricted to a class integrated within circuits ofelite gift-giving and able to commission or buy artefacts in materials whichcounted as luxuries even at an imperial level. Taken together with the monumentswith which they are sometimes associated, the assemblages outlined above suggestthat burial should not be ignored as an arena for display and the negotiation ofstatus into the mid-Roman Period. In the absence of epigraphic evidence thestatus of competing groups is not clear. However, inscriptions from othersubstantial funerary monuments in the Roman northwest commemorating individualssuch as veteran milites, merchants, or freedmen suggest that they need not havebeen restricted to civic elites.To focus on the tomb as a conspicuous removal from circulation of objects orgreater or lesser prestige by destruction or deposition does not, however,explain why burial display should take this particular form. It ignores themise-en-scène created by the burial ritual, in which the identity given to thedeceased is shaped by the associations prompted among the participants by thecombination of symbols placed with the body. In examining British Bronze Age‘Beaker’ burials Julian Thomas (1991: 40) argues that the short-lived burialceremony derived its effect from the presentation of highly stereotyped imagesof the dead ‘in which particular identities for the deceased had to be producedand fixed in the minds of the onlookers’. This ‘fixing’ was achieved bysignifiers whose connotations resonated beyond burial to other contexts, in thecase of Beaker burials feasting and warfare. Paul Treherne’s (1995: 124) studyof prehistoric European male weapon burials develops this perspective further.He proposes that the groomed male corpse, furnished with artefacts related topersonal care, such as shears or razors, and weapons responds to the ‘Angst’ ofdeath by presenting the epitome of heroic male virtue, at the same timereinforcing the status of that virtue. Thus the display of the dead gives accessto areas of social reproduction beyond the mortuary sphere. Others havedeveloped a similar argument in relation to early Medieval burials (e.g.Williams 2006: 118–20). That visual symbols were prompts to ‘reading’ identitiesfor the deceased, is of course also a commonplace in study of Romancommemorative monuments. An understanding of funerary art as Selbstdarstellung,a representation of identity through portraiture, other symbols and text, hasallowed insights into group ideologies, particularly of non-elites: monuments totraders or craftspeople for example, often of freed status, present legitimatefamilies supported by economic activity whose instruments and processes are alsorepresented and celebrated (Zanker 1975). This paper proposes that thepresentation of the dead in the grave can be approached in a similar way.For prehistoric societies evidence for other contexts against which to assessthe reading of burial is often lacking, but the Roman Period burial assemblagescan be much more fully contextualised. The overwhelming emphasis of graveassemblages lies on objects related to the consumption of food and drink. Thecommodities consumed are rarely represented, perhaps as a function ofpreservation. The disappearance of amphorae suggests that prestige relies lesson access to commodities such as wine, which by the later 1st century AD wasmuch more widely available. Instead an increasingly elaborate etiquette ofconsumption lies behind the proliferation of vessel forms and materials, withmany vessels required for one or more courses implying the savoir-fairenecessary to correct use of these vessels. Depictions of Dionysiac scenes oncopper alloy vessels are also appropriate to the symposium setting.Another area of allusion is the manipulation of physical appearance. Here againthe grave goods, in particular the multiplication of gear related to bath houseroutines, washing before eating or sacrifice, depilating and the application ofcosmetics and perfumes embody an increasing complexity in this area. Dress itemsand jewellery are sporadically attested and it is impossible to know how thedead would have been dressed for cremation or burial. Funerary monuments fromGermany and Gallia Belgica suggest the continuity of local dress styles for menand women and these may be more trustworthy than literary commonplaces whichsuggest the widespread adoption of the toga; even in Rome textual evidencesuggests an increasing restriction of the latter to ceremonial occasions fromthe 1st century AD onwards (Freigang 1997; Stone 1994).Other activities are evoked which might be grouped under the heading of otium,i.e. of relaxation, dignified leisure and sociability. The dining and bathingalready discussed can be included under this rubric, as can the gamingrepresented by the glass gaming pieces. Beyond the ability to write (in Latin)the writing equipment might allude to paideia, literary cultivation andparticipation in epistolary culture (Bowman and Woolf 1996). In contrast to IronAge tombs, reference to martial achievements symbolised by arms is less frequentin Roman Period graves: when present they may evoke the hunt rather than combat.Seats may mark civic honour or military status, but this can be challenged (seeabove). As in funerary monuments and grave goods from Gallia Belgica, thegeneration of wealthy economic power may be symbolized in for example writingequipment, with potential use for accounting and inventorising. In generalhowever funerary assemblages comprise symbols of consumption rather thanproduction of wealth.The references to dining, grooming of the body and to varied forms ofsociability are, at one level, common to funerary culture across much ofEuropean prehistory and the early historic period. They are generic signifiersof an elite lifestyle with a substantial leisure component, i.e. of conspicuousconsumption demonstrating the ability of a leisured class to devote substantialresources to non-productive activity (Veblen 1902). There is, however, a moreculturally specific perspective from which the recurring associations in thegrave goods can be read, using evidence from Roman textual sources, whichindicate how conduct in public and private settings marks possession of thevirtues and cultural expertise necessary to assert membership of a Roman elite(Toner 1995). The Laus Pisonis, a short verse panegyric of unknown authorshipdated to the 1st century AD for a male member of the Piso family, perhaps GaiusCalpurnius Piso, consul in AD 57, provides an illustration (Wight Duff & Duff1982). The qualities it praises include not only ancestral glory, participationin public affairs, especially forensic eloquence and amicitia to clients, butalso accomplishments in the sphere of otium, including athleticism in the bathhouse palaestra, and, in a long excursus, skill in board games, especially gamesof strategy with ‘glass soldiers’ (milites vitrei; Laus Pisonis 193).Closer to Britain, the historian Tacitus reports changes in elite behaviouramong the Britons at the prompting of the governor, his father-in-law, Agricola:‘… little by little the Britons went astray into alluring vices: to thepromenade, the bath, the well-appointed dinner table (porticus et balnea etconviviorum elegantiam). The natives gave the name of humanitas to this factorof their slavery’ (Agricola 21.3).From the Britons’ perspective at least, this behaviour is emblematic ofhumanitas, their new lifestyles expressed metaphorically and metonymically byreference to public and domestic spaces and pastimes (the porticus may refer tocolonnaded urban streets or peristyles within houses). Humanitas, oftentranslated as ‘civilisation’ or ‘culture’, includes both intellectualcultivation and sophistication in lifestyle, separating Roman from barbarian andelite from non-elite (Woolf 1998: 54–60). Savoir faire in public life and inotium is emblematic of humanitas, even if reworked for ironic effect by Tacitus.The burial assemblages can be read to have the same emblematic character: therecurring symbols in this mise-en-scène evoke the same involvement in civic lifeand sociability, the dead embodying and presenting to the living the qualitiesthat differentiate by class and culture. In analysis of grave assemblagesscholars have sometimes tried to differentiate between the property of thedeceased and gifts to them by the living (van den Hurk 1984; Roosens 1976). Notonly is this impossible to apply in practice, but it also neglects the strongsimilarities between grave assemblages and relative lack of idiosyncrasy: therecurring symbols associated with the dead evoke and reinforce highlyconventionalised qualities. Grave goods of the type discussed have often beenseen as evoking domestic space in tombs considered as eternal homes for thedeceased (e.g. ‘Spiegelbild eines Wohnzimmers’: Roosens 1976: 149). However, ifthe house is evoked, it is as interface where patronage and friendship wereextended in the salutatio and dinner party (Wallace-Hadrill 1988). The range ofallusions in funerary assemblages is, however, wider than this, to a civicroutine that takes in public as well as private space.Against this ‘Roman’ reading it may be objected that deposition of grave goodsin large quantities is not a Roman custom, although we might note (see above)that the ‘Iron Age’ tradition had only developed in the last century beforeconquest by Rome. Certainly the tradition considered here is evolutionary, witha gradual change in grave good assemblages over decades which continued tocontain objects evocative of an indigenous milieu, for example the carnyx andvehicle fittings of the Folly Lane burial. Its strength was perhaps that itcould be read either as traditional or as innovative depending on theperspective of the participant. The same argument has been made to explain thepopularity of the barrow/tumulus as funerary monument in the Roman northwest(Wigg 1993). However, to label the burial practice represented by these gravegood assemblages as ‘non-Roman’ is to adopt a metropolitan definition of Romanculture. The rituals I have described from Britain and Belgica are widelypractised across central and northern Europe. Similar examples could have beengiven from other parts of Gaul, Germany and along the Danube, often, likeBelgica, without local pre-Roman antecedents: Nuber’s (1972: Beilage 1) map ofcopper alloy jug and pan sets from burials in Roman Europe illustrates thegeneral distribution of such assemblages. Common social practice across theEmpire need not only radiate from Rome, but develop within the interaction ofprovincial elites. But in any case rather than privileging either ‘Roman’ or‘non-Roman’ readings of this burial practice, we might better seek polyvalencyin the potential for variant ‘Roman’ readings. The passage from Tacitus’Agricola cited above, as well as other textual sources, remind us of negativeconstructions which might be put on behaviours symbolised in burial and thatexcessive indulgence at the convivium or bath house might signal physical andmoral debilitation rather than cultivation (Toner 1995).Concluding remarksThis paper has argued for more significant change than previously allowed for inburial practice in Rome’s northwest provinces to the early 3rd century AD. Thecommon emphasis on continuity has been argued to be misplaced. Burial traditionsevolved during this period rather than changing radically, but the cumulativeeffect of changes in burial ritual and, more importantly, its context allows adifferent interpretation to be advanced. The combined resonance of the symbolsassociated with the dead and of the behaviours and values linked to these iswith Roman-style urbanity and cultivation. The association with the deadasserted the status of these behaviours as norms for the living, though thepossibility of variant ‘readings’ has also been noted. It has also been arguedthat the significance of burial as a sphere of display has been under-estimated,even if this is not as clear-cut as in the Late Iron Age. My approach wasinfluenced by approaches to burial evidence outside the Classical world, but isanalogous in some respects to reading Roman funerary art as a representation ofidentity (Selbstdarstellung).Several important aspects have of course received insufficient attention. I havegiven little attention to variability within the group of burials discussed andchronological and spatial nuances have been downplayed in order to assess thegeneral interpretative position. The relationship with broader contemporaryburial practice, from which these assemblages are not sharply differentiated,also requires further consideration. Key dimensions of social identity have notbeen considered, especially age and gender. Osteological evidence indicates thatthat both men and women were buried in the style discussed above but theimplications of this, or indeed of gender-related variation in general in Romanburial practice have received limited attention. There is very significant scopeto investigate further the selection of objects for burial from the materialculture in circulation in this period, not only in terms of form or fabric ofceramics, for example, but also other aspects like colour or iconography and toconsider the exchange mechanisms through which these items circulated beforetheir deposition with the dead. My argument has emphasised the genericsignificance of these objects, but as for Late Iron Age graves, as recentlyargued by Gosden and Garrow (2012), it is equally likely that the history ofindividual objects (for example older or inscribed objects) and their previouscirculation evoked the specific social relationships that gave meaning to theceremony. The spatial organisation of cremation graves, has also received littleattention compared to later Roman inhumations. Nonetheless I hope this articlehas shown how the evidence of Roman burial rituals can be further exploited toaddress developing interests in funerary archaeology, not only because of therichness of the record of the burials themselves, but also because of theextensive evidence for context in which they can be situated.AcknowledgementsThis paper presents aspects of an argument that is more specifically rehearsed,with particular reference to a broader body of data from Britain, in my doctoralthesis (1999), currently in preparation for publication.

Different cultural identities were expressed through burialcustoms among Illyrians and Romans respectively in the earliest period of Romanrule, and later mainly through the iconography of grave stelae and sarcophagi.The variation in cultural identities in Illyria, especially in the ImperialPeriod, probably reflects a similarly rich spectrum of religious beliefs andtherefore also different burial rituals. Numerous grave stelae from Dalmatiaillustrate the combination of indigenous iconography and Roman epigraphictradition, which was a hybrid result of the encounters between Illyrian andRoman funerary cultures. Hybrid elements reveal that memories of the indigenouspast were transformative and individually manageable cultural values. Over time,however, burial customs changed into a predominantly ‘Roman’ style, as also seenin other parts of the Roman Empire, but they were not ‘standardised’. In thefollowing it is argued that the changes and adjustments in burial rituals thattook place during the ‘Romanisation’ of Dalmatia allowed for new expressions ofindividual ideas about the afterlife.Keywords: burial ritual, changes, cultural encounters, Dalmatia, hybridmemories, Illyria.In the Imperial Period, the cultural identities of Illyria/Dalmatia underwentconsiderable changes. The various groups adhered to different cults, which arereflected in the heterogeneous funerary material of the province. The variety inthe material remains indicate that the burial practices, including the rituals,were of rather local character. From the last decades of the first century BCand throughout the first decades of the 1st century AD, different culturalidentities were expressed in funerary contexts through distinctively differentburial customs among Illyrians and Romans. From the 1st century AD onwardscultural identities were expressed mainly through grave stelae, followed bysarcophagi. We cannot discern the full details of the burial rituals themselves,but the evidence does allow us to glean a great deal about the cultural identityof the deceased.Illyria and Illyricum were the names used for the western Balkans until most ofthe area was reorganised as the Roman province of Dalmatia in AD 9 (Wilkes 1969:74–75). The various indigenous groups in Illyria have often been given thegeneric label ‘Illyrians,’ but there were several cultural differences betweenthe different tribes. Syntheses of the different burial customs and rituals inthe western Balkans and their interrelationship have been rare, apart from brieftreatments by John Wilkes (1992: 241–53) and Aleksandar Štipčević (1977:229–42), and a thoroughly anti-‘Romanisation’ interpretation by AleksandarJovanović (1984). More recently, the results of investigations of changes inlocal burial customs over an extended time span have become available (e.g.Girardi Jurkić 2002).‘Romanisation’ and change of burial practicesThe burial evidence indicates that various, heterogeneous local customs werestill present in Dalmatia in the Imperial Period (cf. Štipčević 1977: 230).Local, traditional and ‘Romanised’ rituals were preformed parallel to eachother. Although the Roman traits seem to dominate, the archaeological materialshows that a full homogenisation was never completed. What appears as‘Romanised’ has in many cases elements of a pre-Roman tradition, and the‘standardised’ result was a blend of indigenous elements and cultural traitsfrom different parts of the Roman world. This blend of cultural traits is bestdescribed through the post-colonial term hybridity, which defines culturalelements and traits such as pattern and iconographic renderings which arerevealed or ‘frozen’ in a given moment in the unavoidable, continuous process ofchange (Bhaba 1994: 2–5). Cultures are never static but in perpetual change, andthe term hybridity is here used on examples which demonstrate cultural changesin transformation. The hybridities which were expressed in the Illyrian-Romanfunerary iconography indicate the presence of ‘collective memories’ of theIllyrian past blended with Roman traditions. ‘Collective memories’ areunderstood as formative elements for group identities, such as the Illyriantribal identities by the time of the Roman takeover. Maurice Halbwachs (1925)was the first to use the term ‘collective memories’. To Halbwachs, ‘collectivememories’ were always social constructs defined by time and space (1992: 38–39).In the last decades, his theory has become much used in studies of places wherememories of a certain past are manifested in hybrid forms within a givengeographical area (Nora 1984: 1–2 for the introduction of the phrase lieux demémoires or ‘spaces of memory’). The use of pre-Roman elements in the culturalpractices and iconography of Dalmatia was not necessarily on a conscious levelbut rather the opposite: ‘hybrid memories’ are usually understood as expressionsof persistent ideas and beliefs which survive the encounter with others. Burialrituals in Early Roman Dalmatia includes several blended cultural traits, whichare best explained through the term ‘hybrid memories.’The different indigenous burial customs and rituals, which existed side by sideat the beginning of the Roman immigration, and the ways by which they weretransformed, provide a complicated blend of local cult- and burial-practices,which are here perceived as carriers of traditions and markers of groupidentities during a period of political and cultural transformation.During the Imperial Period, when the burial customs in Dalmatia became morehomogenised, with cremation burials marked by inscribed grave stelae dominatingcompletely, each individual had more options for expressing his or her ownindividual ideas and beliefs. Seen in relation to the post-colonial research(following Said 1978), which is generally considered applicable to studies of‘Romanisation’ processes (Cooper & Webster 1996; Huskinson 2000: 1), UlrichBeck’s statement that standardisation is a parallel form to individualisation iscentral (1986: 210): The rituals and material expressions of the memory of anindividual, perceived through his or her grave, correspond to the burial trendsintroduced by the dominating powers. Concurrently, local features occur in theburials and express a cultural substratum which is not necessarily an expressionof resistance, but merely preservation of an older tradition.Despite the ritual changes, which took place when the Romans imposed theirburial customs on the indigenous populations, there seems to have beencontinuity in some perceptions of death. This continuity informs us aboutbeliefs, which differ from the mainstream ideas of the dominating power. Thehybridities in the grave materials in Roman Dalmatia mirror the encountersbetween the heterogeneous pre-Roman inhabitants and the immigrant groups fromvarious parts of the Empire.The most thorough changes took place during the encounters between theindigenous populations and Italic and other settlers from the Empire in the 1stcentury BC and the 1st and 2nd centuries AD. The ritual changes and exchange ofideas which were caused by the negotiations between immigrating soldiers and the‘Romanised’ inhabitants, in particular in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, were ofa more subtle character, but of significance in the negotiation between thedifferent cultural groups and their burial customs and ideas about theafterlife. Interpretations of specific meanings of shape and decoration providecontextualisation (Hodder 2000: 96) and connection between the mortuary ritualsand the social organisation (Parker Pearson 2000: 246).DiversityFrom the Bronze Age and until the 3rd century BC, the size and location of theIllyrian tumuli indicated the social status of the buried. The social elite andaristocracy in this period demonstrated their power through the monumentality oftheir graves (Earl 1987: 279), but the actual relations of power were not alwaysnecessarily expressed (Parker Pearson 2000: 249). Despite the many variations inthe burial traditions in Illyria from the Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age andthe Roman annexation it is possible to distinguish two main customs: inhumationgraves beneath tumuli and cremation burials in rectangular urns (Štipčević 1977:230).[../images/fig8_1.jpg]Fig. 8.1. Map with clusters of Illyrian burial mounds in South-Illyria (M.Prusac. Graphics by Gerd Kielland at Geoatlas/Kart&grafikk, Oslo).[../images/fig8_2.jpg]Fig. 8.2. Illyrian tumulus, at Ograđ, Croatia (photo: M. Prusac).The Illyrian tumuli are generally located along the main communication arteriesand near settlements (Fig. 8.1). A circle of stones outlined the graves. On top,large quantities of stone formed the mound. The mounds contain inhumation graveswith the bodies outstretched on their backs or in a crouching position in stoneslab coffins. The presence of tumuli with both outstretched bodies and bodies incrouching position indicates that parallel rituals were probably undertakencontemporaneously by groups with different social or cultural identities. TheIllyrian graves which contained bodies in crouching position are often markedout by smaller tumuli which contained only one grave, such as, for example, atBaćina and Ograđ, both in Croatia, in the vicinity of the Bosnia-Herzegovianborder (Fig. 8.2). The tumuli and Roman grave markers in the Late HellenisticNeretva Valley, a divided funerary landscape, reflect the clear distinctionbetween the Illyrian and Roman cultural identities despite the proximity of thesettlements and their close connections.Apart from the rare occurrence of ‘princely’ graves such as the one in Stična,Slovenia, there are little, if any, grave goods present in the Illyrian tumulito indicate social status or the organisation of the communities, or todistinguish between male and female (Wilkes 1992: 241). The few examples thathave produced grave goods were generally large mounds, which probably indicateelite warrior status and perhaps a kind of ‘hero’ status, although they carry nomarkers of identity. The few equipped graves often include several secondaryburials inserted into the mound in a regular arrangement, probably containingcompanion warriors.The grave goods share a number of Iron Age symbols, which traditionally havebeen interpreted as solar cult signs, such as the spiral, wheel, serpent, birds,and female dancing figures. These symbols remain popular in grave iconographythroughout the Roman Period and into the Middle Ages. Vast numbers of massivestone sarcophagi, ‘štećci’ (alternatively ‘štećaci’), with crudely carvediconographic renderings of such symbols, mainly in Herzegovina, suggest a strongcontinuity of local symbolic language. The encounters with Roman cultureinfluenced the style and design in a way which makes the renderings of suchsymbols and figures manifestations of cultural hybridities in the material.Lost rites and the problem of reconstructing themThe Illyrian burial rituals are largely unknown and the available material istoo scarce to allow for valid reconstruction, but some general observations canbe made on the basis of the archaeological remains and a few examples of gravecontexts which provide more information than others.At Atenica near Čačak in Serbia there is a rare example of a large ‘princely’grave, which contained grave goods such as imported Greek pottery and glassbeads. A construction that was interpreted as a small shrine was also includedin the grave (Štipčević 1977: 231; Wilkes 1992: 105). The purpose of the shrineis unknown, but its presence seems to indicate a more institutionalised burialritual than most in Illyria, at least among the ruling classes.The majority of the Illyrian tumuli have yielded very little material exceptpottery shards, which suggest a ritual breaking of clay vessels on the mound – apractice which is known to have been performed throughout the Prehistoric Period(Marović 1980; Štipčević 1977: 231). It is possible that wine, which gained afoothold among the Illyrians in the Hellenistic Period (Lindhagen 2009), wasincluded in the ritual, and that the fragments of amphorae, which have beenfound on the surface of the tumuli along the river Neretva, derive from burialrituals (Basler et al. 1988: 298, no. 24.161). In this context, the interestingfinds from Desilo (southwestern Bosnia-Herzegovina near the Croatian border, notfar from the Roman site Vid/Narona) should be mentioned. In a small lake, vastamounts of amphora fragments and amphora stoppers (c. 800) together with animalbones and pottery were found together with the remains of Illyrian boats,everything blackened by fire. It is possible that these finds further testify tothe importance of wine drinking in Illyrian ritual.It has been suggested, based on the frequent occurrence of ornamentation onfunerary stone coffins, that the Illyrians performed a ritual dance during theburial ceremony (Štipčević 1977: 230). This is of course difficult to prove, butthe continuity in the much-used dance motif in funerary art indicates thattraditional dance was maintained in Illyria-Dalmatia during the Roman Period aswell. Iconographical renderings such as the Japodian urn from Ribić (Fig 8.3),indicate that in the 5th century BC there was a connection between a ritualdance and the consumption of intoxicating beverages. As Rasmus Brandtdemonstrates, the combination of consuming intoxicating beverages and ecstaticritual dance was common in funerary practices in Etruria (Brandt, this volume).The Etrurians descended from the Villanova culture which we know negotiatedculturally with the Illyrians, and among European Iron Age populations ingeneral there was more or less frequent contact and negotiation of culturalpractices.When foes become friends: from diversity to ‘standardisation’?Considering the blend of indigenous groups, the variation in burial customsduring the Roman Period is not surprising. Although the practice of tumuliburials continued as late as into the second century in the more distant areas,cremation according to Roman burial tradition became the dominant way ofdepositing the dead in the 1st century AD (Wilkes 1992: 242–43). The gravestelae became popular in Dalmatia at the same time as the simple, Romancremation urns began to dominate. However, it should not be excluded that somegroups may still have practiced inhumation and marked the graves with stelae. Itseems, nevertheless, that the stelae in Dalmatia, as in most parts of the RomanEmpire, were erected in connection with cremation burials.During the 1st century BC, the Greek colonists on the islands off the Illyriancoast still performed their traditional burial rites. The Roman settlers alongthe coast and in the emerging centres followed the Roman way of burying theirdead, which in this period had many features in common with the Greek orHellenistic grave customs. In the indigenous communities, the combination ofindigenous iconography and grave inscription illustrates a hybrid result of theencounters between Illyrian, Greek, and Roman burial cultures (Rendić-Miočević1967: 139–56). Local customs did not disappear easily and grave urns of thetypical ‘Japodian’ style as well as the ‘Liburnian’ and south Illyrian gravemarkers, or cippi, continued to be used during the Roman Period; not even thetumuli were completely out of fashion yet (Rendić-Miočević 1961: 144;Sergejevski 1949–1950: 45–93; Rendić-Miočević 1961). The options for burial typewere many and there is no clear pattern for how and why a certain choice ofburial was made.[../images/fig8_3.jpg]Fig. 8.3. Japodian cremation urn (drawing after Wilkes 1992 fig. 1992b).Burial practice soon became quite uniform once under the sway of the RomanEmpire. The most important variations appear in the iconography of the gravestelae. The iconography reflects rituals and attitudes towards the afterlife anddifferences within society, social and cultural. In many cases, however, it isdifficult to discern the origin of the different practices, as the general imagesoon contained impulses from many parts of the Roman Empire. In the provincesthe interpretation of form and ritual content on the basis of iconography iscomplicated, as there was a transformation from indigenous practices to the more‘standardised’ Roman customs, which in turn caused ritual changes. In addition,large numbers of slaves, soldiers and military veterans immigrated from everycorner of the Empire, bringing their own traditions and rituals along.It is possible to distinguish the more Roman mainstream style and iconography onthe stelae of the colonies from the more crude expressions of the localworkshops, which traditionally have been referred to as ‘provincial’ monuments.These stelae are, however, not merely low quality imitations of the‘Stadtrömische’ grave stelae, but indications of the beliefs about afterlife inthis part of the Roman Empire. They carry symbols which had cultural andreligious significance for these areas and its inhabitants. The differingcontainers and iconographic expressions seem to be reflections of localvariations.From the site of the Roman colony Narona (Vid) near Metković on the Dalmatiancoast, simple cremation urns (Figs 8.4a–b), tituli, cippi, and grave stelae witharchitectonic and military elements are all represented through severalexamples. Further south along the coast, at the site of Butua (Budva) inMontenegro, cinerary urns with indigenous symbols have been found side by sidewith the more ‘mainstream’ Roman cylindrical urns. In the same contexts, therewere small conical tombstones interpreted as grave markers (Wilkes 1992: 243;Rendić-Miočević 1966: 151 with attempted reconstruction).In the 1st and 2nd centuries there was another practice with hut-like, erectcippi with conical roofs, among the Liburnian branch of the Illyrians, situatedin the northern part of Illyria (Wilkes 1992: 243; Cambi 2005: 58). Thevariations in burial practice seem to rely on trends and local tastes ratherthan being indications of diverging ideas about death and the afterlife orritual changes. Often it seems that the burials were marked with what was athand, with a somewhat casual result. This is in itself an interestingobservation, as the heterogeneity in the grave markers indicates that the burialrituals were of individual, negotiable and hybrid character during the firstcenturies of Roman rule in Dalmatia. The general image seems to reflect multiplechoices rather than a clear-cut shift in tradition caused by the immigratinggroups.The find contexts of the various cinerary containers (compare Figs 8.4a–b) arelocated close to slightly earlier indigenous settlements and burial mounds, andit is common to find Roman cemeteries adjacent to Illyrian mounds. Thisindicates both population continuity and a break with tradition from thebeginning of the Imperial Period. The landscape, with a chain of mountainslimiting the settlement areas to valleys and plains, caused the Roman immigrantsto settle in areas that were already inhabited by indigenous groups. The Romansettlers with time blended with the indigenous populations; intermarriagebetween Roman soldiers and local women was common from the middle of the 2ndcentury onwards (Wilkes 1969: 317). By then the distinctions between the tombsof people of indigenous descent and those of immigrant descent had almostdisappeared, although cultural differences remained between the iconographicexpressions on the grave markers in the urban coastal areas and those in themore remote inland settlements. In these remote areas the frequent use ofsymbols, which can be traced back to pre-Roman times, suggests that pre-Romancultural traits survived more exclusively and unblended than along the coast[../images/fig8_4.jpg]Fig. 8.4. Roman cremation urns. Vid, Archaeological Museum (Narona) (photo: M.Prusac).In the second half of the 2nd century AD, there was a dramatic change in Romanburial customs, from cremation of the dead and the use of cremation urns withgrave reliefs to inhumation, often in sarcophagi of stone. This change oftradition happened in Dalmatia, as elsewhere in the Roman Empire (e.g. Cambi2005: 107–8). Examples from Rome suggest that the changes in the burialpractices from cremation to inhumation pertained merely to the form, and not theritual content, which may partly explain why the production of grave reliefscould continue so freely (Morris 1992: 33). Sarcophagi were expensive, and withsome exceptions, the grave reliefs continued to be used as markers on simpleinhumation graves until Late Antiquity. In this period, sarcophagi becamepopular along the coast and in particular at Salona, where a local sarcophagusstyle emerged, influenced by eastern Greek workshops. The accumulation of simplestone sarcophagi beneath the floors of churches and along the roadside ischaracteristic of the burial practices of Dalmatia in the Early ChristianPeriod.There is no doubt that the uniformity and standardisation of both burial customsand rituals increased with the arrival of Christianity from the fourth centuryonwards. However, within the boundaries of the seemingly homogeneous ChristianRoman Empire and one single religion, there also would have been great variationbetween different social strata and geographical areas.The ritual significance of funerary artThe grave reliefs remained in use throughout the 2nd and 3rd centuries. In thehinterlands of the larger coastal towns the ‘Romanised’ motifs flourished infunerary art. In the remote mountain settlements the local iconography dominatedand often included pre-Roman deities such as versions of a triad of mothergoddesses, or nymphs, and solar and fertility symbols (e.g. Basler 1966: 151).The symbols which appear in the Illyrian-Roman stelae are known from large partsof Iron Age Europe, but they seem to have been more persistent in the interiorof Dalmatia, perhaps due to the inaccessible terrain of the mountainouslandscape, which isolated the inhabitants from foreign cultural influence. Theexamples abound. In the funerary reliefs from Zenica and from Opačić nearGlamoč, both in Bosnia-Herzegovina, from the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, there areseveral examples of non-Roman traits (e.g. Cambi 2005: 39, 202). Swastikas,spirals and wheels are rendered in a crude style. These symbols, which aretraditionally interpreted as solar signs, appear most frequently in theIllyrian-Roman funerary art.In the example from Zenica the swastikas which can be interpreted as solarsymbols are rendered in the garment of one of the four depicted, which representthe deceased (Fig. 8.5). This relief is particularly interesting as it has beenargued, on the basis of stylistic interpretations, that it may referencepre-Roman woodcarving art (e.g. Abramić 1928: 53; Sergejvski 1943: 163;1949–1950: 86–87; Rendić-Miočević 1955: 7; Benac & Pašalić 1966: 265; Prusac2007: 265; in comparison, see Cambi 1968: 133–34).Such symbols, which can be traced back to pre-Roman times, appear frequently ingrave reliefs in Dalmatia during the Roman Period. They are not unique to theIllyrians and many of them had probably already been imported from the Aegeanduring the Bronze Age (Harding 1976; Štipčević 1977: 186), but the survival ofthese elements in the Roman Period are interesting because they suggest ritualadaption to new burial forms among groups with local traditions. The pre-Romansymbols in the Romanised grave forms are examples of hybrid memories whichindicate that there was a change in form, but a certain continuity in pre-Romanideas and beliefs.The votive reliefs of Roman Dalmatia show a similar pattern of hybridisation.Here, the popularity of the cult of the nymphs, a version of the matronae (Herz2003: 144), suggests that the tradition was ancient, already in Roman times(Fig. 8.6). The translatio romano of these female deities shows continuity inlocal beliefs at the same time as they clearly exemplify the adjustment to Romeas the dominating power, and the ‘Romanised’ versions of nymphs can thus beperceived as examples of hybrid memories.The arrival of Others: shared symbols – different meaningsNew rituals and beliefs in the afterlife came with the arrival of soldiers fromthe eastern parts of the Empire. The soldiers observed the customs of the hostcommunity and reconstructed a required selection of rules for practical conduct(Schutz 1944: 503–7). Migration theories often consider the social consequencesof the hybrid customs of the immigrants as a kind of identity creation (Barth1969). When the newcomers changed their positioning towards the locals, a‘we-relationship’ emerged (Naum 2008: 264–67). Within the ‘standardised’ Romanworld, there were great opportunities for ‘we-relationships.’ This is visible inthe funerary iconography, which mirrors conformity to social practices andritual adjustment together with the wish to be remembered (D’Ambra 1998: 114).Soldier veterans composed one such group of the population in Dalmatia which tosome extent sought to conform to social practices. Grave monuments erected inmemory of immigrant soldiers appear in large numbers in Dalmatia from thebeginning of the 1st century AD and throughout the 2nd century, particularly atSalona and Narona and at the castra of Tilurium and Bigeste (Figs 8.7–8.8). Themajority of these reliefs commemorate military veterans from the Legio VII. Thereliefs are decorated with architectural elements carved in a regional style,and their iconographic details and the cultural identity of the commemoratedsoldiers have received a lot of interest (Sanader 2003; Paškvalin 1985b; Medini1984; Dodig 1985; Cambi 1993: 154–56; Waelkens 1986: 17; Hoffmann 1905: 54–59;see Cambi 2003: 511 note 5 for several others). The discussion is mainly aboutthe extent to which the reliefs indicate a presence of individuals from theEast. Sculpted heads which appear on the gable of the reliefs have beeninterpreted as representations of the mythological figure Attis, the lover ofthe mother goddess from the Near East, Cybele. Belief in resurrection was animportant feature in the myth of Attis (Vermaseren 1977). The cult of Cybele andAttis thus conveyed the popular message of life after death, which attractedsoldiers in particular, who were constantly faced with the danger of losingtheir lives in battle.[../images/fig8_5.jpg]Fig. 8.5. Grave stele from Zenica in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Sarajevo, ZemaljskiMuzej, courtesy of Adnan Busuladžić.[../images/fig8_6.jpg]Fig. 8.6. Cult relief with nymphs from Opačić near Glamoč, inBosnia-Herzegovina. Sarajevo, Zemaljski Muzej, courtesy of Adnan Busuladžić.In the beginning the Romans were sceptical about the fertility cult of Cybeleand its adherents. The rites of the cult included the castration of priests,which in Roman eyes was an utterly barbaric custom. However, through the largenumber of eastern soldiers in the Roman army, the cult of Cybele gainedimportance during the 3rd century AD. It became fused with more traditionalRoman mother goddess cults, such as that of Magna Mater.The cult of Cybele is important here, because it found some of its most loyalworshippers among the members of the Legio VII, the veterans of which settled atBigeste near Narona (Medini 1984: 107–27; Hofmann 1905: 54–59). Theidentification of Attis in the soldier reliefs of the Legio VII is congruentwith identifications of the lion heads and lion protomes as symbols used in thecult of Cybele (Paškvalin 1985: 119–23). Some scholars argue, however, that twoother figures in these reliefs, previously also interpreted as Attis, areinstead Roman barbarian captives from the East, as they are generallyrepresented in couples, and in a state of mourning (Cambi 2003, esp. 520; seealso, Cambi 2005: 52–55). It is worth questioning whether the figures had asingle meaning, or if they could be perceived in more than one way. To thecommon Roman soldier they could symbolise captives at the same time as theycould be understood as references to the Cybele-Attis cult by its followers. Thedifferent interpretations would depend on the cultural references of thebeholder and an individual’s experiences at the time of encountering ‘theOther’.It has been argued that these funerary reliefs may have been made in oneparticular workshop, probably at Tilurium, a plausible argument with regard tothe style and technique in which they are executed (Cambi 2003: 512; Sanader2003: 510; Cambi 2005: 55). The view that they are not to be interpreted inrelation to the many eastern soldiers in Dalmatia is untenable though, as thepresence of soldiers from Asia Minor is well testified here through epigraphicevidence (Alföldy 1965: 136; also, Dodig 2003: 365–66). The argument is equallyunfounded that they would not be comparable because the doors of the reliefsdiffer from those on monuments in Asia Minor. Both style and iconography weretransformed when introduced to new areas, in the same way as cultic rituals (cf.Cambi 2003: 511–12). The fact that similar doors, with lion protomes, exist onsarcophagi from the second century AD from Salona proves neither that theyrepresent a local tradition nor an external influence (cf. Cambi 2005: 92 fig.130). The bronze figurines of Attis from the areas of Humac and Muć, and analtar from Klis which refers to a sanctuary of Cybele, confirm the presence ofthe cult of Cybele among soldiers here (Vermaseren 1977: 142–43).Two of the three inscriptions known from these reliefs leave no doubt that thedeceased were from the East, clearly expressing that their hometowns wereAmblada and Pessinus (Vermaseren 1977: 511 with reference to Hoffmann 1905:56–57 and CIL 3.9726 and 9737 for Pessinus and Amblada respectively). A directinfluence from Pessinus, the place of origin of the cult of Cybele, may bepossible, as it is well known that Syrian soldiers in foreign lands remainedloyal to their goddess (Vermaseren 1977: 142; see also Cumont 19). The thirdinscription indicates that one soldier came from Hispania Tarraconensis (Cambi2003: 511), but this cannot prove that this kind of grave stelae emergedindependently of the eastern soldiers. Rather, it was common for soldiers topractice the cults of the areas where they stayed (Mellor 1992: 390), and thissoldier, more precisely of the Cohors I Bracaraugustorum, may have adapted tolocal cult practices. Considering the significance of eastern cults in militarycommunities, there is no reason why a western soldier could not have veneratedan eastern god. The connection between the Phrygian figures and the lions in afunerary context can only be an allusion to life after death and to theimportant message of rebirth transmitted by the Cybele cult. It is difficult notto assume that soldiers from Asia Minor were commonly followers of the Cybelecult, and that an individual from Pessinus, the city of origin of Cybele, musthave related to Cybele’s lions and Attis as at least one of maybe severalinterpretations of the stele. After all, ambiguity and polysemy was not new inthe Roman world (Elsner 1995: 191), nor was manipulation of iconography tocreate contrasting or common identities (Berry & Lawrence 1998: 8).Some groups, which maintained more local traditional cult practices withelements handed down over time in the renderings of pre-Roman symbols, wereprobably also particularly open to eastern cults brought there by the soldiers,such as that of Cybele and Mithras. Like the cult of Cybele, that of Mithrasflourished in the Balkans from the 3rd century AD onwards because of the strongmilitary presence in the area (Mellor 1992: 39; Rendić-Miočević 1982: 121–40).Hybrid memories and blended burial customsAt the outset, during the 1st century AD, distinctly different burial customschanged into more uniform practices and rituals of a ‘Romanised’ character. Themonumental tumuli which earlier had expressed the status of the deceased weregradually abandoned on behalf of smaller grave markers with iconography. Therewas a shift in focus from the demonstration of social status and control of thelandscape into the demonstration of social position in urban societies. Throughthe iconography introduced by Greek and Roman culture, the indigenous and‘Romanised’ groups could express their ideas in a common iconographic language,often combined with traditional symbols. References to indigenous beliefs andrituals were used side by side with, and often expressed through, a Romaniconographic language.The iconography reveals some of the ideas and beliefs connected with afterlife,since it often refers to solar and fertility cults, sometimes connected withversions of a mother goddess cult. The indigenous solar and mother goddess cultsevidently found new expressions through Greek and Roman art, resulting in hybridrepresentations. The ‘Romanised’ or ‘Roman provincial’ grave stelae representthe general ‘trend’, which was the burial practice of the dominating power; astructuralising and standardising element.[../images/fig8_7.jpg]Fig. 8.7. Military grave stele, of Quintus Metius. From Salona. Split,Archaeological museum, courtesy of the museum. (Photo: Tonci Šešer).[../images/fig8_8.jpg]Fig. 8.8. Military grave stele, of Quintus Metius. From Salona. Split,Archaeological museum. Courtesy of the museum. (Photo: Tonci Šešer).The Roman tradition provided the indigenous groups with multiple possibilitiesin the choice of ornamentation. The local and individual freedom discernible infunerary art reveals continuity in pre-Roman beliefs. These elements could,however, carry different connotations to different groups. Various ideas couldmeet in shared symbols. The differences expressed social identities betweenlocal groups, whereas shared symbols indicate negotiation and translation. Thus,the hybrid memories, which are represented in the grave material, reveal acombination of ideas which at the outset were contrasting and sometimes conveyedby force of arms, but which gradually, after the Roman annexation, reflected apeaceful exchange of beliefs and negotiation of common features. On a largerscale, the Roman burial customs reflect the central power of Rome in Dalmatia,whereas on a smaller scale local memories continued, and immigrants broughttheir own variants of the ‘Romanised’ burial tradition. Dominance, influence andnegotiation between different groups about shared interests changed the burialrituals into a more equal form with an unequal content (Parker Pearson 2000:247).ConclusionsWe know very little in detail of the burial rituals performed in Dalmatia in theLate Illyrian and Roman Periods. The many Illyrian tumuli are relatively muteregarding burial ritual, yet they often tell us more than burials of the RomanPeriod; very few intact graves are known from the period of cremation graves(mid-1st to mid-2nd century AD), only their grave markers. Even the laterinhumation graves tell us little in this regard, since Romans did not expresstheir rituals in their burials to the same extent as the Illyrians. However,important information can nevertheless be gathered from the grave stelae of theRoman Period. In the first stage, the various burial customs clearly expressvery distinct and different burial rituals among the Illyrian inhabitants on theone hand and the Italic settlers on the other. They coexisted in this firststage of contact, but Illyrian burial customs disappear in the course of the 1stcentury AD, and more uniform ‘Roman’ burial customs become ubiquitous. Thestandardisation of the eclectic Roman world offered opportunities for moreindividual choices to be made. By the 3rd century AD the funerary iconographyhad become a suitable point of reference for all, despite the diverse social andcultural groups involved. While it may have appeared uniform at one level, thefunerary iconography had multiple meanings and could be read or understood indifferent ways, thus satisfying the needs of a broad range of peoples.The inhabitants of the province Dalmatia encompassed a vast spectrum of culturalidentities; from the rural inhabitants in the distant hinterland with theirstill vivid memory of past Illyrian traditions to the immigrant soldiers fromdifferent corners of the Empire with their specific religious traditions. Theburial custom of the Roman Empire was on the surface uniform everywhere.Naturally, this does not mean that the burial rituals were identical everywhere,since its inhabitants had so many different religious and cultural identities.It is safe to presume that religious beliefs differed quite markedly from the‘Roman Illyrian’ peasant of the hinterland to the Italic urban magistrate andthe Asian or Spanish legionnaire, although all were inhabitants of the provinceDalmatia in the Roman Empire and shared similar burial customs. With suchdifferent religious and cultural identities it is probable that the ritualscarried out in connection with burial were diverse and differed from each other.BibliographyAbramić, M. 1928: ‘Nekoliko skulptura antiknih božanstva‘, Vjesnik zaarheologiju i historiju dalmatinsku 50: 52–61.Alföldy, G. 1965: Bevölkerung und Gesellschft der Römischen Provinz Dalmatien,Akadémiai Kiadó: Budapest.Barth, F. 1969: Ethnic Groups and Boundaries.

This hypothesis isbased on the delicate conjunction of archaeological and textual data.Keywords: Banquet, commemoration; Early Christianity, North Africa, sacrifice.Funerary meals in the Graeco-Roman world seem to be one of those rituals that donot change. Attested abundantly from the 1st century BCE, they are stillmentioned by Christian sources in the 5th or 6th century and even beyond. RamsayMacMullen claimed that ‘for hundreds of years, the pagan cult of the dead was acommon part of Christianity’.1 He was walking in the footsteps of Paul-AlbertFévrier, who called the attention of scholars to a variety of evidence thatattested the practice of funerary meals by Christians in the 3rd century.2 Aftera long period during which any continuity between pagan and Christian practiceswas denied,3 it was salutary to emphasise the similarities, and today nobodywould argue against such a continuity.4 However, historians and archaeologiststended to understand these rites in the light of the classical evidence and toconflate written and archaeological evidence of the 1st century with those oflater periods.5 Dealing with the Merovingian Period, Bonnie Effros underlinedthe danger of such an approach and proposed instead to focus exclusively on theearly Medieval Christian communities in Gaul.6 However, late antique Christianwriters did compare the practices of their fellow Christians to what theyusually describe as ’pagan‘ practices. Despite the difficulties involved, it istherefore worth trying to determine if commemorating rites changed between the2nd century and the 5th. My own choice of North Africa as a test case isdictated by the availability of both written and archaeological evidence.Dining with the dead in the 1st and 2nd centuriesWe need first to outline the rituals as they are known from 1st and 2nd centuryevidence. The best starting point is the reconstitution recently proposed byJohn Scheid.7 Even if our focus is on the commemoration of the dead,8 we willconsider first the funerals to which the commemorative rites are strictlyparallel.9On the day of the funerals, the Romans performed the sacrifice of a sow to Ceresnext to the tomb.10 The meat was then shared between the goddess, who receivedthe exta, the dead, whose share was burned on the pyre, and the relatives, whoate together the remaining meat next to the tomb. Apuleius (c. 125–180), in theFlorida, shed important light on this ritual when he relates how the famousdoctor Asclepiades revived an apparently dead man:He immediately shouted out that the man was alive and that they should thereforedo away with the torches, that the fire should be scattered far and wide, thatthe pyre should be demolished, and that they should take the funeral banquetfrom the tomb back to the table.11The funeral meal thus reverted into an ordinary meal.12 Apuleius indirectlyattests that a table was set up next to the grave and that the living and thedead ate their respective share of the sacrifice.13 This meal was known as thesilicernium at the end of the Republic.14Eight days later, on the novemdialis, the Romans performed a sacrifice to theManes at the grave.15 It was a sacrifice in holocaust in which the offering wascompletely burned. We also know that a banquet concluded the period ofmourning.16 Its location and even its date seem to have varied according to theimportance of the dead and the family,17 but Petronius in the Satyricon atteststhat it could be celebrated at the grave. A guest of Trimalchio, who arrivedlate to the dinner, explains where he had spent the first part of his evening:Scissa was having a funeral feast on the ninth day for her poor dear slave, whomshe set free on his deathbed. […] anyhow it was a pleasant affair, even if wedid have to pour half our drinks over his lamented bones.18John Scheid tentatively suggests that this banquet was associated with asacrifice to the Lares.19 What matters most, however, is that the banquet thatconcludes the funerals serves to separate the dead and the living. The food thatthe living eat at the banquet is different from the offerings sacrificed inholocaust to the Manes of the dead.20According to John Scheid’s reconstitution, the rituals commemorating the deadwere parallel to the rituals for funerals. There was an individual commemorationof the dead, the parentatio, that took place on the anniversary of the death.The ritual is known through the decrees that describe the funeral honors for theheirs of Augustus, in particular the Pisan decrees for Lucius.21 It wascustomary to perform a sacrifice in holocaust to the Manes of the dead at thegrave every year, and no banquet followed.There was also a collective commemoration of the dead, each year in February.22It was a period of ten days, starting with the Parentalia on February 13,followed by the Feralia eight days later on 21 February and completed on the22nd by the Caristia. Parentalia and Feralia appeared to have been used for eachother quite often in our sources, creating some confusion. Our understanding ofthe Parentalia depends on Virgil’s description of the commemoration of Anchises’death in Aeneid 5.42–105 and Ovid’s description of the Feralia in Fasti2.533–570. Two elements are clearly attested on the Feralia: a sacrifice to theManes of the dead and a banquet at the grave.23 The following day, on theCaristia, another banquet was celebrated at home.24 John Scheid tentativelyproposes that a sacrifice to the Lares was done before the banquet of theFeralia.25 Thus the parallel with the funerals would be total.In 1st and 2nd century evidence, two kinds of rites are therefore attested atthe grave for the commemoration of the dead: food offerings to the dead that aresacrificed in holocaust and banquets of the living that were probably alsoincluded in a sacrificial context.Dining with the dead from the 3rd to the 5th centuryWritten evidence on funerary meals after the 2nd century are all Christian,making it difficult to trace any changes without simultaneously considering theimpact of Christian practice.According to Church historians, in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, funerary mealswere forbidden to Christians because of their pagan character, but they came tobe tolerated with the mass conversions following the conversion of Constantine,until a few clerics put an end to the practice in the second half of the 4thcentury.26 The same evidence is always mentioned: Tertullian’s affirmation inthe De spectaculis that Christians do not sacrifice to the gods nor give anyfood to the dead, and that they do not eat from sacrifice or offerings to thedead;27 Augustine’s letter in which he says that ‘when peace came to the Church,a mass of pagans who wished to come to Christianity were held back because theirfeast days with their idols used to be spent in an abundance of eating anddrinking’ and that ‘[his] predecessors thought it was opportune to toleratethese habits temporarily’;28 and finally the story of Augustine’s mother,Monica, compelled in Milan to abandon her African custom to bring offerings ofpottage, bread, and wine to the tombs of martyrs.29 I have argued elsewhereagainst such an account that depends too much on Augustine’s own ‘piece ofclerical euhemerism’, as Peter Brown had called it.30 Christian bishops at theend of the fourth century did not attempt to forbid funerary meals in general.Their reform was limited to martyr tombs and they left out of their sphere ofcontrol the private commemorative practices, especially as most of the dead whomattered for the people were not Christian.31Tertullian makes several allusions to the pagan commemorative rites and alwaysexhorts Christians not to perform them.32 However, we cannot assume thatChristians followed his recommendations and more often than not the confidenceof his tone betrays the fact that at least some Christians were taking part inthese rituals whether in remembrance of their own dead or in remembrance of thedead of their neighbors and friends.33 The verb parentare and the nounparentatio are used to describe these rites and few details are given.34Tertullian establishes a strong parallel between the sacrifice to the gods andthe parentatio, or sacrifice to the dead, but he also mentions the banquet. Thusin the De spectaculis, he says: ‘we pay no sacrifice; we pay no funeral rite.No, and we do not eat of what is offered in sacrificial or funeral rite, because“we cannot eat of the Lord’s supper and the supper of the demons”’ (1 Cor 10:21).35 In the De testimonio animae, Tertullian does not mention the sacrifice,but describes a banquet at the grave: ‘You call them in repose if you areventuring outside the gate to the tombs with dainty dishes and delicacies toentertain yourself in the name of the dead or if you are returning somewhatinebriated from the tombs. But I am demanding your sober opinion. You refer tothem as miserable when you are speaking from your own perspective, when you areat a distance from them. You really cannot find fault with the state of the deadwhen you are reclining and carousing as if in their actual presence. You have toextol those on whose account you are at the moment living festively.’36 Thepolemical intention certainly influences this description, but we can note thatnot only there is no allusion to a sacrifice, but that the meal is brought fromhome to the grave.37 It is only in a figurative way that Tertullian implies thatthis meal was shared with the dead: what matters is that it takes place near oron the grave.We should probably not put too much weight on such testimonies, but it is worthnoting that in the only text where he is not interested in stressing that thegods are in fact divinised dead (by emphasising that their cult and the cult ofthe dead are one and the same), Tertullian does not associate the commemorationof the dead with a sacrificial context.Cyprian may allude to funerary meals in Letter 67 addressed to the Christians ofLegio, Asturica and Emerita in Spain. Cyprian accuses the bishop Martialis, inaddition to obtaining a certificate of sacrifice, of being ‘a habitué of theshameful and obscene banquets of a pagan collegium’.38 As Martialis is alsoaccused of having buried his sons in the funerary monument of the collegium, wecan assume that some of these banquets were funerary meals, which were veryoften part of the activities of the collegia. Cyprian does not explicitlyassociate these banquets with idolatry, but denounces their excesses andimmorality.39 We should note, however, that the purpose of the excursus is toshow that Martialis was living more like a pagan than like a Christian, up tothe point of sacrificing during the persecution.The testimony of Augustine is less ambiguous: when he mentions funerary meals,he does not associate them with sacrifices. In the Confessions, Augustinerecords that in Milan his mother Monica was stopped by the doorkeeper as she wasbringing pottage, bread, and wine to the tombs of the martyrs as she wasaccustomed to do in Africa. She complied, explains Augustine:once she had ascertained, that Ambrose, illustrious preacher and exemplar ofpiety as he was, had forbidden the celebration of these rites even by those whoconducted them with restraint, lest any opportunity might be given to drunkardsto indulge in excess, and also because these quasi parentalia were so close kinto the superstitious practices of the pagans.40The main concern of Ambrose is very clearly the risk of intemperance as isconfirmed by mentions of funerary meals in his own works.41 The mention thatthis practice resembles the parentalia – but only resembles them – could betaken as an indication that the Christian practice differs from the pagan one asno sacrifice was performed, but it might also only be due to Augustine’sapologetic concerns about his mother that pervade all this anecdote.42 It makesit difficult to use this incident as a testimony of actual practices.Augustine’s description of what Monica was used to do in Africa is thus allabout her temperance and restraint:She would bring her basket containing the festive fare which it fell to her totaste first and then distribute; but she would then set out no more than onesmall cup, mixed to suit her abstemious palate, and from that she would only sipfor courtesy’s sake. If it happened that there were many tombs of the dead to behonored in this manner she would carry round the same single cup and set itforth in each place. She thus served to her relatives extremely sparingallowances of the wine, which was not only heavily diluted, but by this time nomore than lukewarm. What she sought to promote at these gatherings was piety,not intemperance.43Despite this strong bias, a few details can be usefully pointed out. First,there is no reason to assume that in Africa Monica visited only the tombs ofmartyrs. The presence of some relatives rather suggests that she intended tohonor the memory of her family’s dead. Second, there is no trace of a sacrifice,or even of offerings brought to the dead. She was sharing with her relatives’food and drink brought from home at the grave of each departed she wanted tohonor.Other texts of Augustine attest similar practices. In a sermon preached in410–412, he rails against the dying rich who, giving little thought tosalvation, rejoice to be surrounded by children and grandchildren, for,according to verse 12 of Psalm 48, ‘they will remember his name’:‘These will invoke their names in their own lands.’ What does that mean? Theywill carry bread and wine to the tombs, and there call upon the names of thedead. Just think how fervently the name of that rich man in the gospel must havebeen invoked after his death! People would have been getting drunk at hismonument, yet not a drop found its way below to his burning tongue. Thecelebrants are providing a treat for their own bellies, not for the spirits oftheir ancestors. Nothing reaches the spirits of the dead except what they didfor themselves while they were alive; if they did no good in their lifetime,nothing will avail them when they are dead.44The parable of the rich man (Luke 16: 19–31) was mentioned by Augustine earlierin his sermon to emphasise the vanity of funerals and explains the reference tothe impossibility of the rich man to quench his thirst. It should probably notbe taken as a testimony for the practice of libations to the dead. The bread andthe wine were for the living gathered around the grave for the commemoration oftheir departed parent.In another sermon preached in the same years, Augustine explicitly mentions theparentalia:When we’re dead, even if our parents, or dear ones, or relatives bring thingsalong to our graves, they will bring them for themselves, the living, not forus, the dead. Scripture too, in fact, has mocked such practices, when it saysabout people who are insensible to good things that are presented to them, ‘Asif you were to lay a banquet’, it says, “around a dead person’ (Sir 30: 18) …It’s obvious that this doesn’t benefit to the dead, and that it’s a custom ofthe pagans, and that it doesn’t flow from the channel of justice derived fromour fathers the patriarchs; we read about their funerals being celebrated; wedon’t read of parentalia being offered for them.45Augustine underlines that these rites are useless, but does not denounce them asa form of sacrifice. The allusion to the parentalia is an attack against thoseChristians who seek to defend funerary meals by citing the verse from Tobit:‘Break your bread and pour out your wine on the tombs of the just’ (Tob. 4: 17).Augustine rejects the literal interpretation and explains, in veiled terms,because not all of his listeners were baptised, that the bread and wine had tobe understood allegorically as the Eucharist. If the mention of the parentaliain the Confessions was ambiguous, in this sermon, it seems to be just a labelthat the bishop uses to give authority to his claim that Christians reform theirhabits,46 and therefore it does not say anything about what non-Christiansactually did in their celebration of the parentalia.There is an interesting inscription from Aïn-Kebira, in Mauretania Sitifiensis,dated 299 CE, that says:To the memory of Aelia Secundula. We all already have sent a lot of worthythings for the funeral of our mother Secundula and, above the place where sherests, we have decided to put up a stone table, where we will together rememberall the things that she did. When the food has been brought and the cups havebeen filled and the cushions have been laid around, then in order to heal thepainful wound, until late in the evening we will discuss gladly and with praisesour honorable mother – and the old lady will sleep. Now she who nourished uslies here in eternal sobriety. She lived 72 years. Provincial year 260. Erectedby Statulenia Julia.47It is difficult to determine the exact location of the mensa in relation to thetomb, but the bringing of food to the tomb, the meal of the living and theevocation of the deceased is a striking parallel to what Augustine describes inhis sermons and sometimes calls parentalia. The Christian character of theinscription cannot be unambiguously established,48 and this suggests that theform of ritual for the parentalia here described might not be specific toChristians, but one shared with the non-Christians. It puts the emphasis on ameal of the living as an occasion for remembrance of the dead rather than onofferings made to the dead.If these texts offer a valid testimony, it appears that, by the end of thefourth century at the latest, bishops alluded to the parentalia withoutreferring to a sacrifice and that the ritual was now just a meal of the livingat the grave.49 The bishops deem the practice useless, but not contrary toChristianity. It consists of bringing food and drink to the tomb and sharingpart of it on the spot with relatives and friends.[../images/fig9_1.jpg]Fig. 9.1. Pupput, Cupula tombs 257, 1117, and 306 (drawings by F. Giomblanco, inBen Abed & Griesheimer 2004: 319).Material installations for the cult of the dead in North-African necropoleisfrom the 2nd to the 5th centuryIf we now turn to the material installations for the cult of the dead evinced inNorth-African necropoleis, there is some evidence that between the 2nd and the5th century material installations for the sacrifice to the dead disappeared, tobe replaced by installations for the banquet of the living. Before spelling outthe difficulties attached to this conjunction between material and textualevidence, we need to review the archaeological data.50In the necropolis located to the west of the ancient city of Tipasa (Algeria),some areas have been in use continuously from the 2nd to the 5th century andthus provide us with a rare situation in which we can see a change in thematerial installations for the cult of the dead.51 This evidence is focused on‘ensemble II’ and its 5 enclosures.52 The earliest enclosure (area 2) comprisedsome 30 cupula tombs of the common North-African type (Fig. 9.1),53 generallyequipped with an offering table and also, in most cases, with a libationconduit. These tombs have been dated to the second and early third century.54Unfortunately the area around the tombs and the surface of the mensae are notdocumented in the publication, but we can probably assume that these mensae wereused to burn offerings to the dead.55 A masonry base (80 × 80 cm) built betweentombs 4 and 5 has been interpreted as an intermediary type between the offeringtable attached to the tomb and the 4th and 5th century mensa-tomb that we willdescribe next. The table accordingly could have been used for the offerings tothe dead, but also for the banquet of the living, the guests being seated on thebasis of the cupula tombs that are around it.56 However, the structure is toobadly preserved and too poorly documented for any conclusive interpretation.In area 3 we find both the cupula tombs and the so-called mensa-tombs. A verycommon type of mensa-tomb is represented by tomb 2.57 On top of the tomb itselfis built a rectangular masonry base of 3.13 × 2.50 m with a semi-circulardepression in the centre of one side. The mensa-tomb therefore comprised boththe reclining couches and the table itself. This type of installation is wellrepresented in other Tipasa cemeteries.58 More impressive is the installationassociated with tomb 11.59 The monument occupies some 65 square metres and isconstituted of the following elements (Fig. 9.2): a U-shape masonry base of 6.6× 6 m with a rectangular depression on the east side. The mensa is 80 cm high.The depression opens up on a rectangular room (5.5 × 3.4 m); along its northernside, a bench; a well was built on the southern side. Two sarcophagi (12 and 13on the map) have been placed at some later point in the depression – a basin, tothe southeast of the mensa, was providing water for cleaning the floor of theroom and also through a canalisation for the cleaning of the surface of themensa.Even if absolute dating is not available, the mensa-tombs are clearly morerecent than the cupula tombs of the enclosure.60 There are many more mensa-tombsin the necropolis, all dated to the fourth and fifth century.61 While the mensaein area 1 of ‘ensemble I’ are Christian,62 there is no evidence that the mensaein other areae are.63 There are mensae in other cemeteries at Tipasa, but nonehas been fully published.64 They date for the most part to the fourth and fifthcenturies and are usually built on top of sarcophagi.65[../images/fig9_2.jpg]Fig. 9.2. Tipasa-Matarès, Mensa-tomb 11, ‘ensemble II, area’ (copied fromBouchenaki 1975: fig. 10).The western necropolis of Caesarea Mauretaniae (Cherchel, Algeria) is not aswell documented.66 In one sector, sector II, cupula tombs with offering tablesand mensae are found side by side,67 but only one mensa and its associated tombhave been excavated and published according to modern standards.68 The mensa hasthe shape of a triclinium and covers a cremation. The grave-goods place the tombin the second half of the 2nd century.69 This mensa is thus the oldest onearcheologically attested in North Africa. For Leveau, this proves that this typeof installation is originally pagan, and not Christian.70 There is very likelyanother mensa in the same sector, but no data were recoverable about it.71 Inthe absence of a systematic excavation of the cemeteries of Caesarea, it isimpossible to determine if there was a shift from one type of installation tothe other.The necropolis of Pupput (Hammamet, Tunisia) is not fully excavated yet, but aninterim report is dedicated to the tables for food offerings.72 Out of a totalof 1,393 tombs excavated in 2000, 156 offering tables have been discovered(11%). They are mainly associated with cupula housing primary cremations: up to22% of these tombs are equipped with an offering table. In most cases it isattached to one of the short sides of the tomb and typically where the head ofthe deceased is placed. These rectangular bases are usually 50–60 by 40 cm. Thesurface is very often burned and ashes and charcoal have been found in theground around them, as well as a significant number of broken dishes attestingto the practice of libations. It is worth noting that libation conduits areotherwise rare at Pupput: five for a total of 1,393 tombs. The offering tables,which were quite common in the first half of the 2nd century, disappeared ratherquickly at the beginning of the 3rd.73 As the authors of the report conclude,they were thus associated with a Roman or a recently ‘Romanised’ population.74So far only one semi-circular installation for banqueting has been unearthed infaçade of a mausoleum, but it is not yet published.75At Leptiminus (Lamtah, Tunisia), a Roman cemetery was excavated in 1989, 1990and 1991 on the north side of an aqueduct. Out of a total of 189 recordedburials, 48 have been fully excavated.76 The cemetery was first laid out in thelater second century and was mainly used during the 3rd and early 4th century.It was then buried in rubbish deposits in the later 4th and 5th centuries andhas been partially destructed in modern time by the construction of lime kilns.There are also evidence of destruction and/or desecration of the tombs in LateAntiquity. That explains why the living layers were not preserved and that noevidence for commemorative rites could be recovered, except a few offeringtables attached to cupula tombs.77 The surface of the offering tables did notbear any trace of burning, but I am not sure that this is significant. Nomensa-tomb has been found.There are thus only a few cemeteries where we can compare installations for thecult of the dead from the 2nd to the 5th century. The change evinced at Tipasain the western necropolis from offering tables to dinner tables cannot beconfirmed directly in any other site. On the other hand no archaeological datainvalidates the hypothesis of a more general shift. Moreover, there is someindirect evidence that such a shift took place. First, Lea Stirling has wellestablished that the cupula tomb disappeared after the 3rd century.78 The cupulatomb flourished during the 2nd and 3rd centuries as its shape was particularlywell suited to marking and covering bodies laid out either for cremation in situor for burial. There are some later examples, but they are much rarer. With themalso disappeared the attached offering tables. Second, the use of the term mensaon epitaphs to designate the tomb itself dates to the end of the 3rd century inMauretania where Paul-Albert Février was able to study a series of well-datedinscriptions.79 Finally, there is an undeniable multiplication of mensae inlater and Christian contexts in Africa and elsewhere in the Mediterranean world.Paul-Albert Février already pointed to this in his report on the cult of thedead at the Christian Archeology Congress of 1975 in Rome.80Concluding remarksNorth-African material installations for the cult of the dead show that thebanquet becomes the focus of attention during the 3rd century, at the expense ofthe sacrifice to the dead. At the same time, written evidence abundantly atteststhat the banquet for the commemoration of the dead is an important act of piety,in a context in which sacrifices are unlikely to be performed. Without moreexcavations carried out with scientific methods, we do not have enough evidenceto draw any definitive conclusions. Analysis of residues on the surfaces of theoffering tables and the mensa-tombs, for instance, or the recovery of faunal andbotanical remains on and around the tombs could bring important information onthe rituals of commemoration.81The conjunction of archaeological and textual data, though difficult toelaborate, presents us with convincing enough evidence to formulate thehypothesis that an important change in the ritual commemoration of the deadtakes place during the third century. I think it is important to emphasise thatthis shift does not seem to be the result of a Christianisation of death nordoes it seem to emerge from the context of new eschatological or cosmologicalcircumstances. It takes place more or less at the same time as inhumation isreplacing cremation as the dominant mode of disposing of the body in NorthAfrica as in the rest of the Roman Empire. This latter change now tends to beexplained as a shift in trends. I recently proposed that it should also berelated to a new concern for the body.82 Future explanations will have to takeinto account both changes and to look at all the other aspects of the relationsof the living and the dead.Notes1 MacMullen 1997: 111.2 Février 1978 [1996].3 For a good example of this attitude, see Leclercq 1907. Some scholars hadsuggested that the Christians who were commemorating their dead as the paganswere Donatists: Doignon 1969; Marrou 1949.4 For a status quaestionis, see Jensen 2008.5 A good example of this tendency is Giuntella, Borghetti & Stiaffini 1985;see a severe review by Duval 1986–1987.6 Effros 2002: 71.7 Scheid 2005: 161–209; see Lindsay 1998 for a general overview.8 It must be emphasised right at the start that it is quite impossible todetermine if the material installations were used for the funerals, thecommemorative rites or both.9 Cf. Scheid 1984.10 Cicero: Laws 2.55, 57; Festus, 296–98 Lindsay. See Scheid 2005: 167–74.11 Apuleius: Florida 19. 6: Confestim exclamauit uiuere hominem: procul igiturfaces abigerent, procul ignes amolirentur, rogum demolirentur, cenam feralem atumulo ad mensam referrent. English translation by J. Hilton, in Apuleius,Rhetorical works, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001, 172.12 Scheid 2005: 169–70; see the commentary in Huninck 2001: 200.13 Asclepiades died at an advanced age at the end of the 1st century and wasactive in Rome where the anecdote probably took place (see Huninck 2001: 198).The anecdote is related by Pliny (Natural History 26.12–15), but the details onthe pyre and the food offerings are from Apuleius (see Harrison 2000: 126). Sowe can consider it valid testimony for the middle of the 2nd century.14 Scheid 2005: 170–72.15 See Porphyrio (3rd c.) on Horace: Epodes 17.48 (ed. F. Hauthal, Berlin,1894, 535): nam nouemdiale dicitur sacrificium, quod mortuis fit nona die, quasepulti sunt. On this sacrifice, Scheid 2005: 175–77; on the period of eightdays, see Belayche 1995.16 Scheid 2005: 175, wrongly indicates that Porphyrio mentions a cenanouendialis. The expression is found in Tacitus: Annals 6.5.1 on which seeBragantini 1991: 219–21. She contends that nouendialis is used as a substantiveand that the passage in Tacitus means ‘this banquet is like a funerary banquet’and not ‘this is a funerary banquet’. On a similar use of nouendiale as asubstantive, see Petronius: Satyricon 65.17 Scheid 2005: 175.18 Petronius: Satyricon 65: Scissa lautum nouendiale servo suo misellofaciebat, quem mortuum manu miserat.

See Marotta d’Agata 1980 fora commentary and, more generally on this ritual, Scheid 2005: 193–200.22 I leave aside the Lemuria, celebrated in May, as the rituals took place athome, and not at the grave. See Danka 1976 with Scheid 1984: 134–36.23 Virgil: Aeneid 5.75–99: sacrifice of Aeneas to the Manes of Anchises;100–104: preparations for the banquet of the Trojans.24 Ovid: Fasti 2.571–638.25 Scheid 2005: 182, based on Virgil: Aeneid 5.63–64 where the banquet of theTrojans is anticipated by Aeneas’ gift of bulls to them and his asking them toinvite the Penates to their banquet. However, he adds: ‘C’est possible, mais onpeut tout aussi bien supposer que la famille apportait au cimetière desoffrandes végétales. Dans ce cas, les célébrants consacraient des alimentsspécifiques aux Mânes de la personne défunte, ou ils lui sacrifiaient unevictime; avec d’autres aliments, qui ne faisaient pas partie de l’offrandeprécédente, et n’avaient donc pas été consacrés aux Mânes, ils préparaientensuite un repas.’26 For North Africa, see Quasten 1940; Saxer 1980; Kotila 1992; cf. Jensen2008.27 Tertullian: De spectaculis 13: see below.28 Augustine: Epistula 29. 9.29 Augustine, Confessions 6.2.2.30 Brown 1981: 29.31 Rebillard 2005.32 Saxer 1980: 47–52 reviews the different texts.33 In De idololatria 16, Tertullian makes the difference between performingpagan rites and attending them because of social or familial obligation andconcedes that it is fine just to attend even a sacrifice. This text is quoted bySaxer 1980: 51, but not given the right relevance.34 See Saxer 1980: 47–50.35 Tertullian: De spectaculis 13: Non sacrificamus, non parentamus.

Nam in conuiuio eorum quasipraesentibus et conrecumbentibus sortem suam exprobrare non possis.37 This does not exclude the possibility of a sacrifice to the Lares at home,but shows that the emphasis is on the meal at the grave itself.38 Cyprian: Ep. 67.6.2: gentilium turpia et lutulenta conuiuia in collegio diufrequentata.

Diehl in his collection ofInscriptiones Latinae Christianae veteres, the Christian character of theinscription has usually not been discussed, but Février 1964: 129 expressed someserious reservations, comforted by his study of all the dated inscriptions fromMauretania.49 A confirmation that sacrifice was not involved can be found in theApostolic Constitutions (8.44), written in the area of Antioch around 380:priests who are invited to participate to commemorations of the dead are askedto eat and drink with moderation. Of course all sacrifices were officiallyforbidden by imperial laws since 391, but, as we know, such an interdiction wasquite impossible to enforce.50 I did not include in this review cemeteries excavated in the 19th or early20th century because of the difficulties that their interpretation presents.51 See Bouchenaki 1975.52 The ‘ensemble II’, as the other ones, has arbitrary limits; the enclosures,or areae, are delimited by walls.53 Cupula tomb have a half-barrel shaped top, placed on a rectangular basis:see Stirling 2007.54 Bouchenaki 1975: 80–95. The dates are established by the grave-goods.55 See the case of Pupput, infra, where it is archaeologically documented.56 Bouchenaki 1975: 84, 95.

These changes coincided with the significant growth ofChristianity in this geographical space. Recent research on Paleochristianbasilicas and associated necropoleis and graves in Scythia Minor and MoesiaSecunda has reopened the discussions on the processes behind the creation of aChristian topography in relation to Greek-Roman towns in this peripheral area ofthe old Empire. Since the relationship between churches and graves is importantfor understanding early Christian re-use of urban space, the archaeologicalfunerary material has been organised into two major groups: graves found intraecclesiam versus extra ecclesiam. By considering the development of a Christianlandscape and the related social Christian topography, the analysis demonstratesthe existence of two rather centripetal processes. Firstly, cemeterial churchesappear to have been established exclusively outside the city walls in connectionwith or without existing necropoleis, before the graves move inside the walls inassociation with new or already established churches. Secondly, burials startoutside the church walls and move progressively inside and towards the sanctuaryof the church. A peculiar category, geographically limited to Scythia Minor,comprises the graves of martyrs. This study indicates a gradual development of aspecific Christian space, followed by the crystallisation of a local traditionof relic worship.Keywords: Centripetal processes, extra ecclesiam graves, intra ecclesiam graves,martyr graves, Moesia Secunda, Paleochristian churches, re-use of urban space,Scythia Minor.Burials, all inhumations, inside and in proximity to Paleochristian churches,represent an interesting manifestation of the spiritual life of Christiancommunities in Late Antiquity. By studying this phenomenon, one can obtainprecious information concerning the topography of funerary areas in the 4th–6thcenturies AD, the funerary practices, as well as the successive changes in theperception of the ecclesiastic architectural context that included burial sites,whether isolated or organised into cemeteries. An analysis of graves andchurches in relation to each other will further the understanding of theprocesses operating behind the transformation of the ancient polis/urbs into aChristian city (Dagron 1977: especially pp. 11–19; Dagron 1991; Ivison 1996;Bonnet & Privati 2000; Karagiorgou 2001: especially pp. 194–96, concerning theburial sites of Thebes; Rebillard 2003; Snively 2006).We shall focus on a limited number of Christian monuments and their relatedgraves, nowadays located in Dobrudja (southeastern Romania and northeasternBulgaria, which covers an area bordered by the Black Sea to the east, the BalkanMountains to the south, and the Danube River to the north, respectively. Thisarea corresponds to the territory, once comprising the provinces of Scythia(so-called Minor) and Moesia Secunda, which were part of the diocese Thracia andthe Prefecture of the Orient (Fig. 10.1). The comparative study of graves andrelated Paleochristian churches, in a pre-defined provincial area, allows us torecreate the use of funerary customs or practices in a wider geographical areaby placing into a similar perspective the finds from neighbouring regions,especially Eastern Illyricum (Snively 1984; Sodini & Kolokotsas 1984: 211–41,for a theoretical approach concerning inhumations in or around Christianbasilicas; Văleva 1989; Aleksova 1997: passim; Snively 1998; Marki 2002).Archaeological research has in the course of the 20th century managed to draw aquite precise image of the process behind the merging of burials withecclesiastic contexts during the Early Byzantine Period in different regions ofthe Late Empire. Thus, the fusion of graves with churches or the development ofnecropoleis in their vicinity can be followed in: pars Occidentis (Reekmans1968; Cortesi 1982; Duval 1988: 100–6; Mérel-Brandenburg 1995; Solier 1995;Picard 1998: 197–254; Guyon 2000: especially pp. 392–94, n. 13; Meneghini &Santangeli Valenzani 1994); Greece (Laskaris1991); North Africa (Christern 1976:81–85, 271–73, fig. 38, pls 1, 5a, c; Février 1987: 919–23; Bonacasa Carra 1989:especially pp. 1921–22, figs 9–12; Duval 1982: passim; Stevens 1993: 55; Ennabli1997: 7–11, fig. 3; Leone 2002; Stevens, Kalinowski, van der Leest et al. 2005:557–77, figs 12.1, 12.3), and the Christian East (Macridy 1912: 37, fig. 5;Lassus 1938; Donceel-Voûte 1988: 21–23, 78, 80, 138, 298, figs 4, 46, 107, 280;Falla Castelfranchi 1989; Goldfus 1997: passim; Piccirillo & Alliata 1998:413–24; Ribak 2007: 41–43, appendix 2, 107–14; Grossmann 2002: 127–36).However, the research on the appearance and spread of burials in an ecclesiasticcontext in the 4th–6th centuries AD describes a phenomenon in obvious oppositionto the reality drawn by written sources. As G. Dagron (1977: 11–19) stressedover three decades ago, the Roman juridical tradition and practice, codified inthe middle of the 5th century BC by the Lex Duodecim Tabularum, forbade the dead– considered to be impure – the right of intra urbem burial and reserved forthem extra urban locations, at least until the end of antiquity or to the reignof Theodosius the Great and beyond (Picard 1988: 1–8; 1998: especially pp.312–16; Saradi 2006: 432–39). From then on, we witness a change from theestablished tradition to a new reality: the slow and sporadic accession ofburials into the city (Cantino Wataghin 1999; Costambeys 2002; Capponi &Ghilardi 2002; di Gennaro & Griesbach 2003; Nieddu 2003). This change ofmentality is confirmed by the position of the legislators, as visible in theCodex Iustinianus 1.2.2 from the 6th century AD, which formally forbade anyburial in apostolorum vel martyrium sedem (see Corpus iuris civilis ed. Krueger1959: 12), though did not clearly ban burials inside towns. To the strongopposition adopted by the laic authorities against intra muros inhumations, wemust add the catechistic and homiletic literature, which emphasises that only apure soul can find its rest inside a church (see the discourse of St Gregory theGreat: Dialogues 4.52.2, 176–77:1[…] quos grauia peccata non deprimunt, hoc prodest mortuis si in ecclesiissepeliantur, quod eorum proximi, quotiens ad eadem sacra loca conueniunt,suorum, quorum sepulcra aspiciunt, recordantur et pro eis Domino preces fundunt.Nam quos peccata grauia deprimunt, non ad absolutionem potius quam ad maioremdamnationis cumulus eorum corpora in ecclesiis ponuntur […]).[../images/fig10_1.jpg]Fig. 10.1 The map of the geographic distribution of Paleochristian churches withgraves in Scythia Minor and Moesia Secunda (map prepared by I. Achim and D.Iacovache 2009).In the geographical area of the Danubian provinces in the diocese of Thracia,namely Scythia so-called Minor and Moesia Secunda, the problem of burials in anecclesiastic context has never been the subject of either a detailed or asynthetic study. This lacuna is explained partly by the state of thearchaeological research, and partly by insufficient or incomplete fieldexcavations of Christian monuments. We owe to J.-P. Sodini (1986), the firstattempt to classify the ‘privileged graves’ in the Christian East, as well as adetailed discussion on burials associated with churches, which he presented inhis publication of the results of excavations at Aliki (Sodini & Kolokotsas1984: 219–38). The archaeological information available has since been augmentedboth with examples which were not discussed by Sodini, as well as by more recentarchaeological discoveries. Such new findings in Romania and Bulgaria (namely inthe ancient provinces of Scythia and Moesia Secunda) have led to theidentification and field exploration of a series of Christian monuments withgraves in their vicinity or even inside the churches.We are therefore in a better position to investigate the complex process ofChristianisation of the ancient cities in Scythia and Moesia Secunda. In spiteof its incomplete character, archaeological information available on the historyand evolution of urban structures in the Danubian sector of the diocese Thraciaallows us to follow the slow crystallisation of a Christian landscape, specificto this peripheral area of the Roman world. We witness the progressive insertionof Christian churches into urbanism, as well as the symbolic redefining of cultbuilding as an architectural context into which relics or martyrial gravesstarted to be associated. Indeed, such a process followed patterns/traditionsvisible in other parts of the Empire. At the same time, the constant concern fordefining the sacred space was doubled by the invention of a new type ofChristian sensibility that permitted the admission, even if only in certaincases, of the dead intra urbem. This relatively sporadic phenomenon in the LowerDanube area during the 4th–6th centuries AD indicates the gradual change of thecity’s image (by desacralising the urban space) and the development of a newsocial Christian topography (by creating a hierarchy of the dead in terms of theburial place reserved for them). For the discussions which follow, two majorcategories of burials can be clearly recognised and examined: extra ecclesiamand intra ecclesiam graves. The division may seem arbitrary with some scholars,but it is used with purpose in order to arrange the available data in someclearly distinguishable categories which may also be useful for distinguishingpossible topographical developments.Extra ecclesiam gravesWhen considering extra ecclesiam graves in connection with churches, two mainsub-groups can be defined: the first sub-group contains churches which‘attracted’ contemporary necropoleis around them; the second sub-group is madeup of isolated graves or small groups of burials in the proximity of churches ortheir annexes.The first sub-group: Basilicas around which necropoleis were formedTo this sub-group belong three churches surrounded by contemporary necropoleis(Table 10.1): the cemeterial church on the northeastern hill at Adamclisi(ancient Tropaeum Traiani, Constanța County, Romania); the extra-mural basilicaat Istria (ancient Histria, Constanța County, Romania), and; the extra muralchurch at Švištov (ancient Novae, Bulgaria). The presence of graves near thesethree churches automatically classified them as cemeterial basilicas.At Adamclisi, the so-called basilica coemeterialis was built several hundredmeters north of the city, on the highest point of a hill, where a significantnumber of graves (dating from the Early Roman Period up to the 6th century AD)were identified (Table 10.1, No. 1). A series of Roman and Roman-Byzantinegraves were also noted on the hills northeast and east of the defensive wall ofthe ancient city. It is remarkable that, from a topographical point of view, inthe entire area north and east of the ancient city of Tropaeum Traiani,necropoleis seem to have developed in the same defined areas during both theRoman and Roman-Byzantine Periods; on the hill north of the city,Roman-Byzantine burials appear to be directly connected to the Christianbasilica.The graves were dug on terraces in order to use the hilly scenery efficiently,occurring with no obvious structural pattern, north, south and west of thebasilica, which contains as yet an unexcavated crypt for relics. Only a seriesof monumental Roman graves with cradle vaults were identified (west and south ofthe basilica), one of which was partially destroyed by the construction of thebasilica’s atrium. Salvage excavations during the last three decades of the 20thcentury showed the bi-ritual character of the necropoleis at Adamclisi, betweenthe 2nd and the middle of the 3rd centuries AD, when both inhumation andcremation rites were practiced (Panaitescu 1976; Constantin et al. 2007: 265, n.60).Table 10.1. Extra ecclesiam graves. Subgroup 1: Basilicas around whichnecropoleis were formed.[../images/table10_1a.jpg][../images/table10_1b.jpg][../images/table10_1c.jpg]The partial and unsystematic archaeological research conducted in the area ofthe basilica coemeterialis at Adamclisi does not provide any further cluesconcerning the necropolis that developed around the church. Even so, thepresence of a crypt for relics in the sanctuary of the basilica could indicatean ad sanctos burial. Future archaeological excavations will not be able todissociate research on the basilica coemeterialis and the burials in itsproximity, from the funerary discoveries on the plateau in front of the city’swestern gate, where a second extra muros Christian basilica was identifiedduring the last decades of the 20th century.The extra muros basilica at Istria presents an even more complex archaeologicalsituation (Table 10.1, No. 2). The drastic reduction of the urban area from theEarly Roman to the Roman-Byzantine Period made it possible to build thisChristian monument in a suburban area, only 200 m west of the post-Gothicdefence wall, a structure dated to the second half of the 3rd century AD(Suceveanu 2007: 88–90, pls 54–55). As in the case at Adamclisi, the extra murosbasilica at Istria was built on ground previously used, during the 4th centuryand first decades of the 5th century AD, for a necropolis (which for conveniencehere shall be referred to as necropolis I). The funerary function of thisChristian monument is uncertain for its first two phases (according toRusu-Bolindeț & Bădescu 2003–2005: 111–12, the first phase is dated to the endof the 5th century AD and beginning of the 6th century AD, and the second phasebeing dated to the middle/second half of the 6th century AD), but during itsthird phase (dated to the last decades of the 6th century AD and the beginningof the 7th century AD) the basilica ‘attracted’ in its immediate proximity anecropolis whose period of function lasted up to the beginning of the 7thcentury AD (which also for convenience here shall be referred to as necropolisII).After the post-Gothic defence wall was built, thus reducing the size of theRoman town, the area between the latter and the Early Roman defence wall wascovered by extra-mural dwellings that gradually changed this area’s formermonumental character. In addition, archaeological research conducted up to thepresent indicates that, as early as the last quarter of the 4th century AD,burials started to fill this area between the two defence walls, expanding easttowards the new defence wall and the ditches in front of it (Ștefan 1976: 45,48, 50–51, nn. 48–51, 70, fig. 2); Suceveanu 2007: 97, n. 54, pl. 56). Thisprocess marked a breach from the urban topography at Istria during the ClassicalRoman Period. During the 1st–3rd centuries AD, the area covered by necropoleis –barrow and flat (inhumation) cemeteries – was limited to the plateau west of the2nd century AD defence wall, thus strictly following the polis/necropolisdelimitation (Ștefan 1975: 54–55, n. 40, fig. 3). Both cremation and inhumationrites were used, but inhumation was already preferred by the 1st–2nd centuriesAD (Oța & Domăneanțu 2010: 393–400, especially p. 394). Primary and secondarybarrow burials gradually stopped and, towards the end of the 3rd century AD, thenecropolis became entirely a flat cemetery (Ștefan 1975: 54).The 4th–5th centuries AD necropolis which preceded the foundation of the extramuros basilica was a flat cemetery. The present archaeological investigationsconclude that no graves belonging to the necropolis II, contemporary with thebasilica, were ever placed inside it (Fig. 10.2). The few graves identified byE. Popescu (1994: 312), during excavations in the 1950s inside the basilica,belong to necropolis I and lie beneath its pavement. The largest proportion ofthe graves in the two necropoleis were concentrated at the sides of thebasilica, especially north and east of the apse (Nubar 1971a: 199–215, fig. 1).The courtyard that extends eastwards from the apse contained graves belonging toboth necropoleis (see above) and included the apsed annex in the church’snortheastern corner. This eastern courtyard has no direct parallels in religiousarchitecture in Scythia or in a larger regional context. A similar funeraryprecinct was uncovered at Knossos (Crete), where the 5th century AD cemeterychurch, discovered near the University of Medicine, was surrounded by aperibolos, defined as campo santo (Megaw 1984: 321–29, figs 1–5, especially fig.5; Varalis 1999: 197–99, fig. 1). This elaborate structure also contained twentyossuaries and a large Roman funerary monument. In Rome, the cemeterial basilicaof Saints Marcellinus and Peter has an enclosure (precint) to the north,containing a number of mausoleums, as well as a courtyard with a portico to thesouth (Guyon, Strueber & Manacorda 1981; Guyon 2002: 1157–73, figs 6–7).[../images/fig10_2.jpg]Fig. 10.2.

The extra muros basilica and the surrounding necropolises(after Nubar 1971b: 335–47, fig. 2).Even if no intra ecclesiam burial was documented, a special emplacement can beseen in Grave 58 (which belongs to necropolis II), and is located immediatelyeast of the apse of the basilica. Its particular position in the topography ofnecropolis II and the golden clothes’ accessories discovered in the grave (Fig.10.3) suggest that the deceased was a person of a high social status in thelocal community. The inventory of Grave 58 belongs to a group of similardiscoveries in the Lower Danube region and Thracia, namely a territory occupiedby Goth federates from the second half of the 5th century to the first half ofthe 7th century AD (Kazanski 1991: 137/plate). The animal style decoration ofthe belts discovered in the grave has caused major debate in terms of whether toconnect it to a Late Roman influence or an Early Avar innovation specific to theEmpire’s periphery (Kidd & Pekarskaya 1995).Grave 58 has a direct parallel with the episcopal basilica at Istria, the onlydifference being that in this latter case the graves are isolated and attractedtowards an intra muros basilica (see Table 10.2, No. 2). In this context, shouldalso be considered: a double burial – found east of the apse – of theStamata/Amygdaleza Basilica, in Attica (Greece) (Gkine-Tsophopoulou 1995); twograves identified in the Povlja Basilica in Dalmazia (Ostojić 1963: 144–45, fig.1; Chevalier 1996, 1: 296 and 2: pl. xlviii/2), and; the collective cist grave(ossuary) discovered at Vaste nel Salento Basilica in Italy, datable to thesecond half of the 6th century AD (see D’Andria, Mastronuzzi & Melissano 2006:271–72, figs 22, 27).[../images/fig10_3.jpg]Fig. 10.3. Istria. The extra muros basilica, gold objects from the inventory ofgrave 58 (from the photo archive of the National History Museum of Romania,Bucharest, inventory nos.: 9527–9528/buckles; 9531-9532/appliqué; 9529-9530/beltends).In spite of the scarce archaeological information from the two necropoleis,identified near the extra muros basilica at Istria, several remarks can be made:the orientation of the graves is variable, with only a minority (i.e. graves instone/brick cists or with stone walls) being oriented more notably W–E or SW–NE;in graves with a W–E orientation the corpse was laid in a dorsal position, withthe legs parallel to each other and the hands placed on the pelvis; gravescontaining pottery, coins, and clothes’ accessories are relatively rare; foodofferings are rather frequent in graves of necropolis I. Three double burialswere also identified (M18, M23 and M73), as well as several cases where gravesof necropolis II, contemporary with the basilica, superposed graves fromnecropolis I. Adults seem to have represented the majority of the graves, thoughchild burials in limited numbers have been recorded in both necropoleis.Children were buried either in amphorae (necropolis I, M68: Nubar 1971a: 203),or in stone cists (necropolis II, M38: Nubar 1971a: 203, 209). The practice ofinhumating infants in amphorae is attested at a provincial scale during the4th–5th centuries AD in the necropoleis at Slava Rusă, Tulcea County, andMangalia, Constanța County (see Soficaru 2007: 304, nn. 89–90). At Istria, asyet child graves appear not to have had a preferential location; on thecontrary, they seem to have been integrated in a arbitrary way in a funeraryspace reserved for adults. In a single, recently documented case, (M14/09located south of the basilica: Rusu Bolindeț et al. 2010: 88–89), afrontoparietal skull deformation was recorded, a practice specific to Germanicor other barbarian populations (Buora 2010: 190).The third example in this sub-group is the extra mural basilica at Švištov(Table 10.1, No. 3). In this particular case, the necropolis, groupedexclusively on its northern side, was occupied by an important building withperistyle up to the middle of the 3rd century AD (Fig. 10.4), and identified asthe residence of the legatus legionis I Italicae (see Ivanov 1997: 569, nn.382–84, fig. 32a). There is no sign that the area of the extra muros basilica atŠvištov had previously been used for funerary purposes. Unlike the extra murosbasilicas at Adamclisi and Istria, the extra muros church at Švištov combinesthe use of extra ecclesiam and intra ecclesiam graves. The co-existence of thetwo categories of graves indicates an incontestable bipolarity of the cultcomplex and an obvious tendency to redefine the Christian funerary space in the5th–6th centuries AD at Švištov. The presence of a smaller number of gravesinside this extra muros basilica confers to the monument a symbolic ambivalence:a cult building and a place of burial for a (privileged?) minority at the sametime. In the absence of any epigraphic information, the architecturalcharacteristics of the intra ecclesiam graves – in brick cists – seem to atleast indicate a different social status of the deceased when compared to thatof the people buried in the necropolis near the basilica. Moreover, thedifferent topographic situation of the intra ecclesiam burials indicates acertain concern for the hierarchy of graves in the building’s internal space: asacred topography, in which it seems impossible to contest that the gravelocated in the apse had the largest symbolic value.The basilica was built sometime during the first half of the 5th century AD, asdetermined using coins discovered from the reigns of the Emperors Arcadius,Honorius and Theodosius II. During its second phase – also dated by coins, fromthe end of the 5th to the second half of the 6th centuries AD – the church’snarthex was enlarged and divided into three compartments, each corresponding tothe nave and aisles (Ivanov 1997: 574, n. 394, fig. 32b). Based on the availablearchaeological documentation, we agree with M. Čičikova’s theory (1997: 61) thatthe necropolis significantly developed in the second half of the 5th century AD,but for now we cannot establish if the necropolis appeared during the initiallyphase of the basilica. Nevertheless, the necropolis lying north of the basilicais attributed to a Germanic population (Dimitrov 1995: 703, pls 89c–e), asrevealed by a limited number of gold jewels and clothes’ accessories discoveredin some of the graves: a bracelet with thick ends (a comparable object of silveris recorded at Ficarolo, in Italy, see Bierbrauer 1994: 46–47, fig. 5/1), abee-type fibula (see the similar fibula from Domagnano, San Marino, Giunta 1984:53–96, fig. 16), and an eagle shaped fibula. This last type of fibula is anobject characteristic of a certain Ostrogothic female costume, popular in Italyand in the provinces of Illyricum at the end of the 5th century and the firsthalf of the 6th century AD (Kazanski 1991: 136/plate; also see Bierbrauer 1984:449–50, figs 379–80/fibulae from the hoard of Domagnano, San Marino).Nevertheless, the fibula discovered at Švištov is typologically similar to otherpieces found in the area of the San Valentino basilica on via Flaminia, in Rome(Salvetti 1994: 523–32; Nieddu 2003: 580–81, n. 118, fig. 19).[../images/fig10_4.jpg]Fig. 10.4. Švištov. The extra muros basilica, plans of the church, thenecropolis and the distribution of the intra ecclesiam graves (after Čičikova1997: 64, figs. III/2–3).The second sub-group: Isolated graves or small groups of graves near churchesA second sub-group of extra ecclesiam graves contains examples of churches that‘attracted’ in their immediate vicinity isolated or small groups of graves,which could exceptionally be sheltered by an annex of the cult building (Table10.2). This is the case of the basilica C at Adamclisi, the cathedral at Istria(both of them in Constanța County, Romania), and the main church of thecathedral complex at Švištov. The extra mural church at Cernavodă (ancientAxiopolis, also in Constanța County, Romania) can be added as a fourth example.Three of the four churches that attracted isolated graves in their proximity areintra muros monuments (Basilica C at Adamclisi, the cathedral at Istria, and themain church of the Episcopal complex at Švištov), and two of these wereidentified as cathedrals of the city. From a topographical point of view, thegraves identified there seem to spread in a random manner around the churches,both east of the apse, as well as along their northern and southern flanks.Thus, at Istria, three graves east of the apse and a fourth to its north can beassociated with the Episcopal basilica (Table 10.2, No. 2; Fig. 10.5). Similarlyat Miletus, several burials were found east of the apse of the great basilica(see Müller-Wiener 2005: 366–71, fig. 2). At the Great Basilica in the Episcopalcomplex at Švištov, an isolated grave and an independent chapel identified witha martyrium were discovered along its southern flank (Fig. 10.6).If at Istria the graves are rather modest (simple-pit graves, with bones insitu), at Švištov, the tomb placed in the external southwestern corner of thesouthern aisle is an elaborate masonry structure that rigorously respects theorientation of the basilica and is perfectly aligned to its southern peripheralwall (Table 10.2, No. 3). At Louloudies, in Greece, a double monumental tomb islocated in a similar topographical position, near the southwestern corner of thebasilica’s narthex. As at Švištov, the tomb is built in masonry and covered by acradle vault (Marki 1997a: 19–24, figs 1–10). A second grave at Švištov wasplaced in an independent space, namely an apsed chapel built east of thesouthern aisle. A. Biernacki (2005: 58–59, figs 5C–D) has tentatively identifiedthe chapel as a martyrium, but firm evidence is lacking. The chapel communicatesdirectly with the southern aisle and also with the outside, but no burial hasbeen found on site. A similar chapel was built in Church A II 1, a cemeterialchurch, in Anemurium (Cilicia) around 400 AD (Russell 1979: 184–45; Hellenkemper1990: cols 270–273, fig. 36 a–e). Besides the initial grave in the southeasternchapel, a series of other graves were placed there after the church had beenabandoned at the end of the 7th century AD.[../images/fig10_5.jpg]Fig. 10.5. Istria. The episcopal basilica, plan of the church and distributionof graves around the monument. (Courtesy of Al. Suceveanu).Table 10.2. Extra ecclesiam graves. Subgroup 2: Isolated graves or small groupsof graves es near churches.[../images/table10_2a.jpg][../images/table10_2b.jpg][../images/fig10_6.jpg]Fig. 10.6. Švištov. The cathedral, plan of the complex on various progressivephases of evolution (after Biernacki 2005: 57, figs 3A–B).The situation of basilica C at Adamclisi is singular (Table 10.2, No. 1; Fig.10.7). It is the only known case in the area under scrutiny in which an intramuros basilica is protected by a peribolos with graves inside; the graves weregrouped on the southern side and only sporadically on the eastern side of thebasilica. New archaeological excavations are needed in order to find out moreabout the characteristics and the exact chronology of the necropolis developingoutside the basilica. In the absence of conclusive data, we can only supposethat the graves were attracted to the basilica by the crypt for relics which wasidentified in the nave.From a chronological point of view, at Švištov, the graves associated with theGreat Basilica in the cathedral complex are dated to the basilica’s first threephases, which correspond to the 5th and the beginning of the 6th centuries AD.After this period and during the building’s later phases, the martyrium chapel,east of the southern aisle, stopped functioning and the eastern side of thebasilica was profoundly modified by the addition of the lateral apses that flankthe main apse (first half of the 6th century AD). At Istria, however, the graveswere dated on stratigraphical observations to the second half of the 6th centuryAD, a chronology that corresponds to the second phase of the basilica. The onlygrave dated to the first half of the 7th century AD discovered there suggests asporadic funerary use of the site in the period after the basilica had beenabandoned.Another special situation is that of the extra mural church at Cernavodă (Table10.2, No. 4). In this case, a grave belonging to a member of the provincialaristocracy – Anthousa, daughter of comes Gibastes, as written on an epitaphdiscovered there – was installed in a chapel added to the southern face of thechurch (Fig. 10.8). The placement of this funerary chapel finds a directparallel in the southern church at Hemmaberg (Glaser 1991: 56–58, n. 86, figs 2,7).A second inscription discovered in the ruins of the nave reveals the name of aChristian, Euphrasius, and could constitute in Scythia a rare example of an adsanctos burial documented epigraphically (Fig. 10.9). The text mentions thatEuphrasius was entrusted to the martyrs Cyril, Kindeus, and Tasius. The lastperson’s name is most probably a corrupted form of Dasius, a martyr who died forthe Christian faith at Durostorum (Pillinger 1988: 39–40, 49–50, n. 71, 130–39,fig. 3). Apart from the graves of Anthousa and Euphrasius, other burials arementioned in the same area by the topographer P. Polonic (see the referenceindicated in Table 10.2, No. 4) at the beginning of 20th century. Due toincomplete archaeological investigations, we can only presume that the gravesidentified near this small church at Cernavodă were all ad sanctos burials,placed under the protection of the martyrs mentioned by the inscription ofEuphrasius, and probably patrons of the church.[../images/fig10_7.jpg]Fig. 10.7.

The extra mural church, the inscription of Euphrasius(from the photo archive of the National History Museum of Romania, Bucharest,inventory no. 18 881).Intra ecclesiam gravesThe second major category of graves to be discussed here are the intra ecclesiamones (Table 10.3). Archaeological excavations have identified only a relativelysmall number of such burials in Scythia and Moesia Secunda. There may be morereasons for this, as probably confirmed by field research on Christian monumentsnorth of the Balkans. One fact is certain: both civilian and ecclesiasticauthorities controlled the placement of the burials inside the city and insidethe churches. A significant testimony of this is offered by an African funeraryinscription: Rogata, mother of the deacon Tiberinus, was buried in the centre ofthe northern aisle of Alexander’s Church in Tipasa expermissu/Alexandri/episcopi (Leschi 1957: 373), a monument dated to the late5th/6th centuries AD.The archaeological reports on the intra ecclesiam graves seem to imply that thegraves were placed inside the church without any certain rules. In bothprovinces, the Christian epigraphy is rather poor and offers just a few clues onthe identity of the individuals granted permission to be buried inside thechurches.Moving from west to east inside the architectural space of the churches, thenarthex seems to be the area least used for funerary purposes. At present, thereare practically no graves placed in the narthex in Scythia. In Moesia Secunda,on the other hand, there is one well-documented case, namely the extra muralbasilica in Švištov, where a grave was placed in the southern chamber of thenarthex (Table 10.3, No. 1; Fig. 10.4). The positioning of a grave with a modestarchitecture in the entrance area of the basilica should most likely be datedafter the primitive narthex had been replaced by a three-chambered narthex, anarchitectural modification that – according to M. Čičikova (1997: 61–62, fig.III/3) – took place during the first half of the 6th century AD.The apparent lack of burials inside the narthex in Scythia and Moesia Secundastands in contrast to the situation documented in the neighbouring regions ofEastern Illyricum (Nikolajević 1980: 366–67; on the subject of ‘commonmartyrium’ see also Donceel-Voûte 1998: 122–24, fig. 15/3), and Thracia, whereburials were more frequently located in the western area of the church,therefore also in the narthex. For the 5th–6th centuries AD, graves inside thenarthex have been documented, for example in: Serbia, at Caričin Grad, Church B(Guyon & Cardi 1984: 40–44, figs 38–43, pl. iii), at Jelica, Churches A(Milinković 2001: 111–13, figs 30, 32) and B (Milinković 2001: 114–17, figs33–34), and in the cemetery church in Niš (Milošević 2006: 173–86, especiallypp. 179–82, figs 2, 11); the little church in Ljutibrod, Bulgaria (Djingov &Mašov 1985: 41–43, fig. 3), and; Thracia, at Kran (Tabakova-Čanova & Ovčarov1975: 46, fig. 6).If the funerary use of the narthex proved sporadic in Scythia and MoesiaSecunda, burials in the space of the quadratum populi were more frequent. Thiscategory of burials is also defined by the absence of rules regarding theirposition. Even so, the disproportion between the number of graves located in theaisles (less numerous) and those in the nave is striking.As in the case of the narthex, the aisles seem to have had a reduced funeraryrole, limited to only three examples in the area of our two provinces.Concomitantly, we notice a certain polarisation of the position of graves insidethe aisles, namely at their extremities. Thus, one grave was placed at thewestern end of the northern aisle at Pirinč Tepe, near Varna (Table 10.3, No. 2;Fig. 10.10) and at Švištov, in the extra mural basilica (Table 10.3, No. 3; Fig.10.4). The simultaneous use of both aisles is exceptional, as the only such caseis that of the basilica extra muros at Švištov. Here, apart from the grave inthe northern aisle, a second was dug near the sanctuary area, at the eastern endof the southern aisle (Table 10.3, No. 4; Fig. 10.4). Its architecture issimilar to that used for the grave located in the apse of the church. Thedeceased, whose remains disappeared at an unknown date, was most probably laidin a coffin made of perishable material, of which only the metal parts werepreserved.During the 5th–6th centuries AD, in the Aegean and Balkan regions, the aislesplayed a more important funerary role than in Scythia and Moesia Secunda andseem to have been more frequently used as burial places reserved for the clergy,even if not as a rule. At Stobi, in Macedonia, inside the Episcopal Church, theonly grave found until now is located at the eastern end of the southern aisle.The grave at Stobi, contemporary with the second phase of the monument, built atthe beginning of the 6th century AD by Bishop Philip, contained the remains ofone individual, dressed in a rich costume and wearing leather sandals (Aleksova1986: 19–20; Sodini 1986: 233–34). The eastern ends of the aisles in the extramural basilica in Philippi (Macedonia) were reserved for the clergy: Paul,priest and also doctor, was buried inside grave A, located in the northern aisleof the church (Pelekanides 1977: 369–70, 379–80, fig. 9, pls 28, 37); twopriests, Faustinus and Donatus, were buried in the southern aisle, inside graveB (Pelekanides 1977: 370–72, fig. 9, pls 29, 38). In Hissar (ancientDiocletianopolis, in Thracia) in the Basilica 3 – dedicated to Saint Stephanus –a certain Theodoros was buried in the eastern end of the northern aisle as theidentity of the grave’s occupant was revealed by the text of his Greek epitaph(Ivanova 1937: 217, 223–24, 226–29, figs 198, 206). A 6th century AD double tombwith vault, erected in masonry, was inserted in the centre of the southern naveof the basilica of Arethousa, near Thessaloniki (Adam-Velene 1995: 354–55, figs2–4, pl. 1), while at Eressos (in Lesbos) a grave occupies the eastern extremityof the southern nave (Orlandos 1929: 31, fig. 30). As in the case of the extramuros basilica in Švištov, the Episcopal complex at Louloudies – near Pydna, inGreece – sheltered, during its second phase (dated to the second half of the 6thcentury AD) a grave at the western extremity of the northern aisle and twoothers at the eastern extremity of the southern aisle, while other burials wereconcentrated around the monument (Marki 1997b: 293–94, fig. 1; 2001: 19–25, 82,figs 2, 8–9). The Basilica D from Byllis (Albania) housed – in the centre of thenorthern aisle – a cradle vaulted tomb (Chevalier et al. 2003: 161, figs 3, 6).[../images/fig10_10.jpg]Fig. 10.10. Pirinč Tepe. The basilica, plan (after Škorpil & Škorpil 1910:15–21).If graves inside the narthex and the aisles are rare, the presence of graves inthe nave is, on the other hand, much better documented in the geographical areaunder scrutiny. Intriguingly, no graves were located at the entrance of thenave. One also notices an increased tendency to place the graves in the easternend of the nave, exceptionally inside the apse and much more frequently in thevicinity of the sanctuary. When graves are discovered near the sanctuary wenotice that they are constantly placed in line with the axis of the church. Evenso, the grave discovered in the eastern extremity of the nave of basilica no. 1,located in sector 12, near the Eastern Gate at Švištov (Table 10.3, No. 5; Fig.10.11) seems to elude the usual pattern followed by churches in Scythia andMoesia Secunda. In this particular case, the grave was placed south of the axis,towards the southern colonnade of the nave and seeming to ignore any concern foran axial location. The monument’s poor state of conservation and insufficientarchaeological documentation do not allow us to determine the exact position ofthe grave in relation to the enclosure of the sanctuary, whose western extensionand limits are not known. A grave in a similar position was discovered in theEressos basilica at Lesbos (Orlandos 1929: 31, fig. 30).The presence of graves in the apse is exceptional. In the entire area consideredonly one example was discovered in the extra mural basilica at Švištov (Table10.3, No. 6; Fig. 10.4). The grave, well built as a brick cist, is probablyamong the most elaborate in the entire necropolis that developed around thebasilica. The disappearance of any trace of pavement inside the apse makes itimpossible to comment on the grave-Eucharistic altar relationship. The axialposition, precisely in the centre of the apse, seems to underline the particularconcern that the person in charge of the burial had to make it well visible.Unlike the grave in the southern aisle of the same church, the burial in theapse does not preserve any indication of the use of a coffin. No artefact wasdiscovered inside the grave and in the absence of any other evidence, be itarchaeological or epigraphic, the identity of its occupant could not bedetermined. M. Čičikova (1997: 59) suggests that the grave could have beendestined for a local martyr, perhaps to Saint Louppos, mentioned by TheophylactSimocatta, Hist. 7.2.17, 249. In neighbouring Serbia, in Ulpiana, Kosovo, asimilar position can be noted for a grave that comprised a lead sarcophagus(Nikolajević 1978: 688–89, 693, figs 12–13). According to Nikolajević, the gravehoused the bones of two local martyrs, Florus and Laurus, later venerated inConstantinopolis. Another similar example is recorded in the S Basilica at SidiJdidi, Tunis (Ben-Abed-Ben Khader et al. 2004: 87–108, especially pp. 87–95,figs 47–48, 50–51). The grave was placed in the centre of the apse, at a momentsubsequent to the first phase of the mosaic pavement covering this space. Themosaic epitaph, which covers the grave, indicates that its occupant was acertain Cyprianus, presbyter. Other examples of graves in the apse are found inthe area of the Diaporit basilica, in Butrint, Albania (Bowden, Hodges, Lako etal. 2002: 216, figs 12, 17–18).[../images/fig10_11.jpg]Fig. 10.11. Švištov. The basilica no 1, located in sector 12, near the EasternGate, plan (after Biernacki 2005: 55, fig. 2A).In and around Varna (ancient Odessos, Bulgaria) a group of three graves wasdiscovered, placed in an axial position at the western limit of the sanctuaryenclosure (Table 10.3). It is regrettable that these discoveries, made severaldecades ago, have not yet been published in detail. Moreover, theirarchaeological publication does not clearly indicate them as privileged graves,crypts, or martyrial graves. Two of these graves were identified in churches inthe territory of the bishopric of Odessos (a single nave church in Džanavar Tepeand a basilica in Škorpilovci), while the third was discovered in an intra murosbuilding (a basilica in Varna, near the crossing of the streets A. Gačev, TsarSimeon, and Kozloduj).At Džanavar Tepe, the tomb, located at the western limit of the sanctuaryenclosure, was partially superposed by the latter and at the same time by thepulpit (Table 10.3, No. 7; Fig. 10.12). The burial has a direct connection tothe loculus where relics were preserved inside the sanctuary. In the well-builttomb the remains of two individuals were laid in separate coffins. As far as thefunerary rite is concerned, S. Bojadjiev (1995: 70–71, figs 2, 4–5) – one of thescholars who analysed the monument – indicated that the bones in the smallercoffin were wrapped in a golden embroidery. This practice is actually attestedat Džanavar Tepe, where, in the loculus located in the apse, a group of threereliquaries set one inside the other was discovered: a marble reliquarycontained a second of silver which housed a third reliquary made of gold. Thelatter was wrapped in a yellow silk cloth (Minčev 2003: 15–18, especially p.17).Should we admit that this tomb’s occupant was given special permission to beburied near the relics preserved in the sanctuary? New interpretations of thefunerary use of the ecclesiastic context at Džanavar Tepe seem to be suggestedby the discovery of four inhumation graves immediately east of the the church’seastern façade (Minčev & Tenekedjiev 2010: 277–79, fig. 1). Until their exactchronology is established we can only stress, along with the other investigatorsinvolved, that the pits are oriented approximately E–W and that their walls werebuilt using Roman bricks. No further graves were recorded inside this church.The basilica of Siagu, in Tunisia, illustrates this association of a grave witha deposit of relics, both incorporated in the area of the sanctuary. However, atSiagu the grave is located behind the loculus for relics, on the axis of theapse (see Duval 1984–1985: 173–74, figs 2–3). The basilica on the September 3rdStreet in Thessaloniki (Marki 2006: 97–98, fig. 35) provides the nearest analogyfor this singular intra ecclesiam tomb, as it has the same position in thechurch vis-à-vis the western limit of the sanctuary enclosure.Unlike the grave at Džanavar Tepe, the one at Škorpilovci is remarkable throughits distinctive elements (Table 10.3, No. 8; Fig. 10.13): al fresco decoration;accessibility by a western staircase that probably opened into the nave; theeastern niche could have served for rituals associated with the tomb (worship?).According to A. Minčev (2003: 24–25, cat. no. 10 a–d, figs 10 a–d), the marblereliquary with a lid provided with an orifice (used for taking out contactrelics), discovered by chance at the mouth of River Škorpilovska, could be apart of the grave’s inventory. The association of relics with a simple grave, intheory inaccessible after burial, is attested in neighbouring regions by thediscovery of a silver reliquary in grave no. 3 of the Saint Sophia Basilica inSofia (see Filow 1913: 70–72, figs 57–59, pl. 8/1–4; Duval 1988: 126–29). As faras the chronology of the basilica is concerned, Minčev proposed the end of the5th and beginning of the 6th centuries AD, based on architecturalcharacteristics and the style of the pavimental mosaics. The dating of the graveis a more delicate problem; J. Văleva (2001: 171, fig. 7) has proposed a timespan ranging between the 4th and the 5th centuries AD. The dates put forward bythe two scholars could hypothetically constitute an argument in favour of thehypothesis that the grave in the nave preceded the basilica, which was laterbuilt precisely above to shelter this primitive funerary structure.[../images/fig10_12.jpg]Fig. 10.12.

The basilica located on the crossroad A. Gačev, Tsar Simeon,and Kozloduj streets, the inscription which blocked the entrance of the gravelocated in the vicinity of the sanctuary (Varna Regional History Museum,inventory no.: II 5018; photo I. Achim 2008).The basilica discovered near the crossing of the streets A. Gačev, Tsar Simeon,and Kozloduj in Varna – in the southwestern part of the late antique city –constitutes the third example of graves from this series (Table 10.3, No. 9;Fig. 10.14). The grave is inaccessible, its entrance blocked by a marble slabwith a metrical Latin inscription. The text has eight lines and its connectionwith a grave is testified twice by the use of the terms tumulus and sepulchrum,terms not unusual in a late antique context. The term tumulus appears, forexample, in the text of a 6th century AD Christian inscription from Tomis(Popescu 1976: 65–66, no. 30, 1 = Barnea 1977b: 56, no. 23, fig. 11). Under theform tumolo this word is also mentioned in the epitaph of Dessideratusdiscovered at Kobern-Gondorf, Germany, now in the Rheinisches Landesmuseum, Bonn(Schmitz 2004: 57, fig. 4), and on the gravestone inscription of Leo, in thecemetery of St Gereon in Cologne (Schmitz 2004: 55, fig. 3). The term sepulchrumis mentioned – in a corrupted form – by two late antique inscriptions inBulgaria (Beševliev 1964: 32, no. 47.3, fig. 45/Ratiaria, sepulhro; and on pp.177–78, no. 246.1–2, fig. 264/unknown place of discovery, sepulhcrus). InRomania, the Christian epigraphy provides an example of the use of this term inthe text of a Latin inscription from Rasova (Popescu 1976: 201–3, no. 191.4). InNorth Africa, at Cherchel, a dedicatory inscription in verses was also notedfrom a cemetery, where the term is used in plural form (sepulchra) (Duval 1982:1, 380–83, no. 179, fig. 248).Finally, the last category to be discussed here is that of funerary or martyrialstructures located in the eastern extremity of the churches (Table 10.3, Nos10–15). This series of monumental structures or hypogea, located invariablyunder the pavement of the apse and sanctuary, forms a homogenous group of sixexamples found exclusively in the territory of Scythia. All examples included inthis series have constantly been presented in the archaeological literature asmartyrial crypts which, due to their considerable dimensions, could containentire bodies of one or several venerated persons (martyrs and saints) (Barnea1981: 489–97, figs 1–8). At a provincial scale, the starting point of this kindof hypogea integrated in the sanctuary seems to be the ecclesiastic metropolisTomis (at present the city of Constanța, Romania), from where it was exported toother centres in the province. Four of the six churches that make up this groupare intra muros buildings; the other two are outside and at a considerabledistance from the urban centre.The basilica at Piatra Frecăței (ancient Beroe, Tulcea County, Romania), whichis unfortunately insufficiently excavated, is an extra muros structure built inthe area of a previous Roman necropolis (Petre 1987, 104–6; Baumann 2000,247–48, pl. 2; 2006, 826–27, pls 21.2–4) (Table 10.3, No. 10). The tomb,mentioned as a crypt by the author of the discovery, was initially locatedprobably inside a commemorative architectural context (an apsed, single-navedhall dated to the 4th–5th centuries AD). During the 6th century AD, thisprimitive building, which focused on the burial structure, was extended andtransformed into a three-aisled church surrounded by a cemetery. Thus, thepre-existing grave was included in the apse and nave of the basilica (Fig.10.15). The tomb has the appearance of a room with a cradle vault, accessible(as in the case of the monuments in the Varna region) through a west-facingstaircase which opened into the nave and contained multiple inhumations at thetime of discovery.Other examples in this series are recorded at Constanța (ancient Tomis,Romania), the administrative and religious capital of Scythia. Six intra muroschurches mark the Christian topography of the Proto-Byzantine city, but noChristian cult building was identified outside the urban centre. Three of thesix churches known at present in Constanța have hypogea integrated in thesanctuary: the large (Fig. 10.16) and the small basilicas in the city’s westerndistrict (Table 10.3, Nos 11–12) and the basilica discovered in the courtyard ofthe M. Eminescu High School (Table 10.3, No. 13; Fig. 10.17). If we consider thetopographical position inside the church, we can say that all these hypogeaoccupied the area covering the apse and part of the nave in front of it.However, their architecture and decoration vary according to the taste andresources of the persons who ordered their construction, as well as to specificcult necessities. A certain monumental tendency can be noticed in the hypogeaintegrated in sanctuaries in Constanța. The large dimensions and sometimesexcessive internal division of all these subterranean constructions support thesupposition that all were used for multiple-inhumations. The occupants mighthave been local martyrs, as widely attested by hagiographic sources at Tomis,whose remains could have been moved into the city. We can therefore witness asymbolic fusion of the relics with the church and, at the same time, asignificant development of the cult of martyrs in the area of the provincialcapital. In this context, the access to the above-mentioned structures (whichall have access staircases) could indicate the establishment of regionalpilgrimage itineraries.[../images/fig10_15.jpg]Fig. 10.15.

EminescuHighschool, plan and view over the crypt (from the National History andArchaeology Museum, Constanţa).This typical tradition of the province of Scythia has recently been confirmed bythe Episcopal Basilica discovered in Murighiol (ancient Halmyris, Tulcea County,Romania) (Table 10.3, No. 14; Fig. 10.18). Here, a martyrs’ grave, according toM. Zahariade (2009: 141–50, figs 13–21), was associated with the intra murosbasilica as early as its first phase, dated to the first half of the 4th centuryAD. The martyrs’ grave has the appearance of a room with a cradle vault, whichfinds a direct provincial analogy at Piatra Frecăței, with the only differencebeing that at Murighiol two masonry benches were built, on which the bodies werelaid. This funerary structure (crypt) is accessible through a dromos on thewestern side and was decorated al fresco. A Greek inscription surrounded byeight concentric circles was written in black paint on the eastern wall of thefunerary chamber. The text mentions twice the word martys. Inside the hypogeumwere recorded several ceramic artifacts and a lamp hook. A Romanian laboratory(Mirițoiu & Soficaru 2003: 531–80; 2001–2003 (2007): 169–90), undertook theanthropological examination of the two skeletons discovered both disarticulatedin the main chamber, which indicates a double, probably secondary burial (twomale adults, one in his sixties and the other 30–40 years old). For bothindividuals, the skulls were missing, the younger one showing signs of havingbeen beheaded; in addition, both individuals revealed evidence of perimortemviolence. All this, corroborated with the hagiographic sources, has lead to theidentification of the two individuals buried in the basilica at Murighiol as thelocal martyrs Epictet and Astion, executed at Halmyris on July 8th AD 290. Alongwith the remains of the two martyrs were identified a series of disparate bonesbelonging to both adults and infants, as well as animals. The hypogeum was alsoused for funerary purposes after the abandonment of the cult monument, as shownby an inhumation in the dromos (an adult female in a crouched position, with twolamps set near the body – Zahariade 2009: 141, fig. 13).[../images/fig10_18.jpg]Fig. 10.18. Murighiol. The episcopal basilica, view over the eastern side of thenave and crypt (courtesy of M. Zahariade 2002).The last example of martyrs’ graves, being probably one of the most interestingof the category discussed here, is the martyrium in Niculițel, in theterritorium of ancient Noviodunum (nowadays Isaccea, Tulcea County) (Table 10.3,No. 15; Fig. 10.19). In this particular case, the person who paid for themonument used a different architectural scenario from that of the other hypogeaknown in Scythia: the martyrium, placed in the basement of the sanctuary, wasassociated with a rural basilica, built above and at the same time with amonumental grave. The monumental tomb contained the remains of six individuals(two of them unknown and buried in the lower chamber). This unusual situationcould be the result of the basilica being probably built on the site of apreexisting martyrs’ grave, which did not attract other ad sanctos burials inits vicinity. V. H. Baumann (2004: 90–128, 153–74, pls 1–9) supposed that, whenthe church was erected, the two unknown martyrs’ remains were placed in acommemorative architectural structure whose traces were conserved west of themartyrium included in the sanctuary. These two martyrs were moved from thisoriginal burial site into the lower chamber of the martyrium; the primitivemartyrial grave was later included into the basilica’s sanctuary, near itswestern end. When the church was built, the partially burned remains of the twomartyrs (45–55 year old adult males) were laid into the monumental tomb with acupola, together with four other martyrs: Zotikos, Attalos, Kamasis, andPhilippos. These four martyres Christou were placed in dorsal decubitus, in acollective coffin, into the upper chamber of the martyrium. The state ofpreservation of their skeletons, discovered in anatomical position, suggeststhat the four were buried at the same moment, which excludes a supposedrelocation – inside the church – of the bodies from another pre-existing grave.Two of the skeletons bear traces of perimortem violence (Charlier 2009: 83, 86,fig. 21). An interesting detail is that the entrance into the martyrium wasblocked with a reused limestone slab on which the Greek letter ‘Chi’ was incised(Popescu 1976: 276–78, no. 267). This detail indicates that the martyrs’ gravewas isolated and sealed under the floor level of the sanctuary, and remainedinaccessible.[../images/fig10_19.jpg]Fig. 10.19. Niculiţel. Plan of the basilica and the martyrium under the level ofthe sanctuary (after Baumann 2004, pls. 4–5).Concluding observationsThe data presented in this contribution is based on a collection of informationgathered through publications and excavation reports covering many decades. Thedisparity of information presented, mainly due to the authors’ variousmethodological approaches and aims, makes it often difficult to get sets ofcomparable data to be used in a coherent analysis. The purpose of this articlehas been to collect the data available in order to prepare a better foundationfor further studies. In fact, much more detailed studies are necessary in orderto reconsider this archaeological evidence and its significance in understandingburial customs in the new Christian cities. Despite this unsatisfactorysituation a certain image, even if partial, can be sketched with precaution.In Scythia and Moesia Secunda – as for the rest of the Empire – the 5th centuryAD seems to be the crucial period when the first burials started to move fromthe outside into the area of the city, even if during the Proto-Byzantine Periodfunerary areas were still located beyond the city ramparts. The penetration ofgraves inside the walls was a relatively isolated phenomenon, specific forhighly urbanised centres. If we consider the case of Istria, where the urbantopography is well-studied, archaeological research has already shown that thesuburban space between the new post-Gothic defence wall (dated around the middleof the 3rd century AD) and the classical Roman defence wall further westconstantly reinvented itself throughout the 4th–6th centuries AD. On one hand,we witness the extension of the necropoleis eastwards, towards the post-Gothicdefence wall, but without having a definitive funerary use for this space. Onthe other hand, the land around the post-Gothic defence wall was also used fordwellings, and graves were dug as early as the 4th century AD in and around thealready ruined (Suceveanu 1982: 36–39, 86–92) Thermae 2 complex (located west ofthe extra muros basilica).However, parallel with this situation, an increasing association can be notedbetween burials and churches, be they Eucharistic or cemeterial ones. Thearchaeological contribution is crucial, yet it alone cannot provide the answersto all the problems raised by the Christian topography (Périn 1987: 9–17;Fiocchi Nicolai 2002: 159–60, n. 6; 2003), whether by the location and innerorganisation of cemeteries, or by the association between a church and isolatedgraves. As C. Snively (2003: 61) noticed, the deliberate and symbolic fusionbetween burial and church is affiliated to a series of Christian monuments ofexceptional theological and architectural value: St Peter’s Church in Rome(Deichmann 1982; Krautheimer 1980: 26–28, 86; de Blaauw 1994: 2, 451–55, 470–79,493–503; Brandt 2001: 110–11; Brandenburg 2005: 91–102, pl. xi); St Paul’sChurch in Rome (Brandenburg 2005–2006; Filippi 2005–2006); the Church of theHoly Sepulcher in Jerusalem (Krautheimer 1967; 1993: 512–19; Corbo 1982: 39–117,pl. 3; David 2000), and; the Apostoleion in Constantinople (Krautheimer 1964;Dagron 1974: 405; Mango 1990). In the area of Scythia and Moesia Secunda, theprocess of moving martyrial relics inside the city seems to have already startedduring the 4th century AD, probably under the influence of models from the HolyLand, Constantinople or Rome.In some cases, however, the presence of isolated burials does not seem to beconnected to the cemeterial use or funerary function of the church. As a generalrule, the churches in Scythia and Moesia Secunda did not play the role of propercemeteries, unlike the North African ones (Février 1965: 38–39, 55, 145–52, figs5, 22; Duval 1971–1973, II: 331–38; Yasin 2002: 96–120), the Hispanic ones(Ulbert 1978: 20–44, fig. 11: the basilica of Casa Herrera, Mérida; pp. 86–87,figs 32, 35: the basilica of San Pedro de Alcántara, Córdoba; p. 91, fig. 38:the basilica of El Germo, Córdoba), and the ‘a deambulatorio’ basilicas in Rome(Krautheimer 1960; La Rocca 2002). However, if cemeterial churches are notconsidered, during the 5th and 6th centuries AD, the presence of graves insideor around ecclesiastical monuments continued to represent a rare, specialsituation in Scythia and Moesia Secunda. This reality, barely visible anddifficult to decipher, suggests a powerful distinction among the dead, based ona Christian sociology that developed slowly. From this point of view, thelocation of the graves became an important criterion in order to classify anddifferentiate the deceased (Delahaye 1998: especially pp. 716–17). The diversityof grave forms – from simple graves to more elaborate ones (namely tile graves,burials in stone cists or elaborate constructions involving masonry) –corresponds to a multitude of possible locations.According to the presently available archaeological data there appears to havebeen no intermediary stage between the burial of the dead outside the city wallsand those buried inside, in association with the churches. The cemeterialbasilicas are a minority and seem to appear exceptional in areas of previousnecropoleis. The adjacent necropolis grows mainly outside the cult monuments,especially on their flanks. At Švištov, where the necropolis around the extramuros basilica seems to have developed at the same time with the neighbouringecclesiastic context, we can suppose the cemetery was mostly Christian. This maybe supported by the dominant E–W orientation of the graves and the considerabledecrease, even if not complete disappearance, of the funerary inventory. In thiscase the church contained graves only occasionally. This controlled andselective process illustrates best the particular status of the graves locatedin eminent positions very close to or inside the cemeterial churches. Once more,this particular feature is outlined by the direct and indissoluble relationbetween the cult place and the burial place. When the burial was a martyrialgrave, it became subordinated to the cult monument (Pani Ermini 1989: 837–67).From the outer to the inner space of the basilica, the graves were distributedwithout a certain topographical pattern in relation to the ecclesiasticmonument; however, the ‘topographical’ repartition of the graves inside oraround the church demonstrates a permanent centripetal tendency. Thus, fromoutside to the inside, the graves converged more and more towards the basilica’ssanctuary, and in this process became more and more elaborate as they approachedthe central ritual area of the church. Relics are not considered in thiscontext, as they seem to be exceptions having penetrated earlier inside theurban area, as witnessed by the case at Murighiol (ancient Halmyris).An attempt to classify such graves in or around the churches on social criteriaappears more delicate. Christian funerary inscriptions from our two regions arefew in number and limited in content, making it difficult to reveal if theprivileged position of the burial is based on ‘holiness’ criteria or just on thedeceased’s position as a layman. At Istria, the inventory of the grave locatedeast of the apse of the extra muros basilica seems to indicate the high socialrank of the deceased, possibly an influential member of the local community.Even in the absence of any epigraphic indication, the presumed externalmartyrium of the cathedral in Švištov might be interpreted as a privilegedburial (tomb), maybe of the founding bishop (see the specific elements for theidentification of a martyrial chapel proposed by Donceel-Voûte 1995).In Scythia, a number of large underground structures shelter the remains ofcertain martyrs, whose bodies were moved from their original graves. Thepresence of martyrial installations, which in this particular geographical areaseem to be invariably located intra ecclesiam, in the eastern part of thechurch, within the sanctuary (Brandenburg 1995), indicates in fact thecrystallisation of a local martyrial relics worship tradition and, at the sametime, a change in the function of the building, admirably theoreticised by C.Sotinel (2005: 411–34). The association of relics with the ecclesiastic contextadds to the Eucharistic dimension of the church a commemorative function thatsupposes the celebration of the martyr’s commemorative mass on his dies natalisand the pilgrimage at a regional scale. This phenomenon of liturgicalfragmentation has been well studied at the Roman Christian basilicas (Bauer1999: 385–93, 399–401; Emerick 2005: 50–55, figs 6–9), and it is illustrated bymany cemetery churches in Rome, among them San Lorenzo fuori le mura (Geertman1995; 2002).Finally, we have already seen that, in the Danubian provinces of the EasternEmpire, the creation of a Christian topography and urbanism seems to have beenrather a linear process, with extra mural churches first occupying Romannecropoleis, followed by the churches quickly attracting new burials when movinginside the city walls. The traditional Roman city became a city of Christians,even if it remained profoundly attached to the traditional Roman civil values.This is clearly indicated by the large amount of (ordinary) interments in thecemeteries outside the ramparts and only a minority of singular tombs absorbedduring the 4th–6th centuries AD into the city and associated with Christianmonuments. Such observations lead to a closing question: could the church-gravedichotomy discussed here have been considered a testimony of these urbancommunities’ attachment to the monumental heritage and the material image oftheir cities, which they wanted to remain unaltered, or was this reality causedby a conservative opposition to the Christian faith in this peripheral region ofthe troubled Empire?AcknowledgementsThe author is very grateful to Adela Bâltâc, Corina Borş, Dana Iacovache(National History Museum of Romania, Bucharest), Valentin Bottez (University ofBucharest), Costin Băjenaru (National History and Archaeology Museum, Constanța)for their invaluable help and support.

These cemeteries havepreviously been studied within the confines of a nationalist culture-historicarchaeological tradition that stresses their relationship with pre-RomanIllyrian burial practice, rather than seeing them as part of a wider phenomenonof Early Medieval furnished burial. This paper focuses in particular on thediversity of burial practice that can be observed in the Komani cemeteries andargues that this diversity reflects the uncertainties and anxieties thataccompanied the adoption of new practices in a rapidly changing world. It isfurther argued that, while we can never fully understand the multiplicity ofmeanings attached to burials from archaeological evidence alone, the complexmultiple meanings attached to the commemoration of death in contemporary andhistoric contexts compel us to be aware of the complex social nuances thatsurround the burial ritual.Keywords: Albania, anxiety, grave goods, Komani cemeteries, status,transformation.The commemoration of death is an area of extraordinary complexity. Funeraryrituals and memorials to the dead send out a multiplicity of messages. The waythat these messages are received and indeed what messages are received variesaccording to the recipient and the circumstances in which they are encounteringthe funeral or memorial.The memorials to Dodi al Fayed and Diana, Princess of Wales, in Harrodsdepartment store in London are an interesting example of this, inspiringreverence, sadness, pity or derision depending on the point of view of theonlooker. For Mohammed al Fayed, who erected them, they are a representation ofgrief at the loss of his son, but at the same time they embody his attempt tocreate a permanent link with the British establishment, which has denied himcitizenship and, according to him at least, murdered the subjects of thememorial. The now unbreakable link with Diana has thus been used by al Fayed aspart of his perpetual campaign for greater legitimacy within the UK. For others,however, they are extraordinary pieces of kitsch, emphasising al Fayed’sultimate failure to understand the cultural values of the British social elitethat he aspires to join.Our ability to read this multiplicity of meanings from the Harrods memorialsdepends on the fact that we can contextualise them – we know the historicalcircumstances in which they were created and the personalities involved.However, in prehistoric contexts or in circumstances in which historic data islimited or altogether absent, how can we glean these multiple meanings from thearchaeological data? Is it legitimate to even try?When dealing with funerary remains, we have certain advantages. We can usuallyassume that, when death occurred in circumstances where burial or disposal ofthe remains could take place according to customary practice, the actions thattook place in relation to the corpse would be deliberate actions. These actionswere intended to explicitly or implicitly convey certain messages about the deadperson, their relationship to those who were burying them, and the way in whichthe deceased and those who were carrying out the funerary rite viewed theirposition in relation to other members of society.The extent to which we can decode these explicit and implicit messages from thearchaeological evidence alone is inevitably limited. This paper discusses someelements of one particular group of cemeteries in relation to thesepossibilities. These cemeteries, situated in present-day central and northernAlbania, date to between the 6th and 9th centuries AD and represent theapparently rapid re-emergence of a burial rite involving grave goods in an areawhere this practice had previously been abandoned. The largest of thesecemeteries were at Koman and Kruja and as such they are often referred to byYugoslavian archaeologists as representing the Komani-Kruja culture, althoughAlbanian archaeologists generally refer to them in terms of the Arbër orproto-Albanian culture. For ease of reference, I use the term ‘Komanicemeteries’ when talking about these sites although that should not be taken toimply adherence to any of the nationalist archaeological theories that have beenapplied to this material.The Komani cemeteriesThe Komani cemeteries were first noted in the 19th century by the French consul,M. Degard, and aroused considerable interest as to their date and origin(Popovič 1984: 214; Bowden 2003a; 2003b: 203–11 with references to earlierliterature). The first to be discovered were those at Koman (Spahiu 1971;1979–1980) and Kruja (Anamali & Spahiu 1979–1980), and further cemeteries weresubsequently discovered at Lezhë (Prendi 1979–1980), Shurdhah (Komata1979–1980), Bukël (Anamali 1971), and Prosek (Doda 1989), together with a seriesof smaller cemeteries and isolated finds spread across the remote mountainousareas of central and northern Albania. Similar cemeteries are also known fromMijele in present-day Montenegro and Radoliste and St. Erasme in Macedonia,while a related cemetery was also excavated in the 1930s at Aphiona on theisland of Corfu (Bulle 1934). In southern Albania and northwest Greece, burialswhich shared some of the characteristics of the Komani cemeteries were found assecondary insertions in Bronze Age tumuli at Piskova, Cepuni, Merope and KatoPedina (Bodinaku 1983; Andreou 1980; 1983; 1986; 1987) (Fig. 11.1). Most of thecemeteries were poorly excavated, with relatively little detail being recordedof individual graves.[../images/fig11_1.jpg]Fig. 11.1. Map of Albania (drawing by W. Bowden).The most striking characteristic of the cemeteries was the range of objects thataccompanied some of the burials (although by no means all of them). Jewelleryand dress fittings appeared in many of the graves, occasionally including gildeddisc brooches and crescent shaped gold earrings, which were probably importedfrom Byzantine Sicily. There were also local variants of the same types of items(Anamali 1993). Buckles were also common, of a type widely known in the southernBalkans as well as in Italy, Hungary, Crimea, and Constantinople, together withlarge rectangular-backed bronze fibulae of a type found in the Danubianprovinces, Dalmatia, Thessalonica, and northern Italy (Popovič 1984: 217–18).Other metal finds included frequent examples of bronze and iron pendants (Prendi1979–1980: pl. xxii, which recall similar objects known from Avar cemeteries,bronze rings, many of which were decorated with Christian cryptograms (Spahiu1971: pl. v), and the radiate headed brooches (Anamali & Spahiu 1979–1980: pl.vii; Prendi 1979–1980: pl. xx), characteristic of the period and widely found inFrankish, Lombard, Slav, and Avar contexts. Glass necklaces (sometimes includingmillefiori beads) are also common (Anamali & Spahiu 1979–1980: 75), again of atype widely paralleled in Migration Period contexts elsewhere.The graves also contain pottery in a hard fired buff fabric and painted withwide red stripes similar to examples found in southern Italian cemeteries. Theseare usually in the form of two-handled flasks and trilobal jugs, and were foundfor example at Kruja (Anamali & Spahiu 1979–1980: pls v–vi), Lezhë (Prendi1979–1980: graves 3, 8, 11, 12, 20, 31, 35). With the exception of examples fromthe Aphiona cemetery on Corfu (Bulle 1934), finds of glass vessels are veryrare.Some of the burials contain weapons, including axes, as well as arrowheads andshort daggers. The axes can be of a lightweight, broad bladed form suitable forcombat (for example those from Koman illustrated by Spahiu 1979–1980: pl.iii.1–3), or alternatively of a more narrow bladed, wedge-shaped form suitablefor use as a splitting axe (e.g. the example from grave 7 at Lezhë, illustratedby Prendi 1979–1980: pl. iii). In general, axes are more common at Koman than atthe other cemeteries, as are spear heads and swords. Swords are rare even atKoman, where they were found in a form that Popović suggests is paralleled inMerovingian and Lombard contexts (1984: 221–22).The burials were usually placed in tombs constructed of slabs of limestonealthough occasionally a tent-like roof was adopted reminiscent of Roman‘cappuccina’ burials. This style of tomb construction including the use oflimestone slabs and pitched covers is very similar to that which can be seen inLate Roman contexts in Albania, although in most cases the dating of unfurnishedburials of this type is far from certain and could often date from any timebetween the 5th century and the Late Medieval Period. The apparent continuity ofthis type of cyst burial is often cited in support of the claims of culturalcontinuity discussed below (Prendi 1979–1980: 143).In terms of their location, the Komani cemeteries showed a marked break with thepast, in that they were not associated with the population centres of the RomanPeriod. The latter were predominantly concentrated on the coastal plain or alongthe principal north–south routes which ran along the river valleys of Albania.The Komani cemeteries, by contrast, were in mountainous and isolated locations,sometimes close to the fortified hill-top sites that were occupied in both theprehistoric and post-Roman periods (a fact that was made much of by communistperiod archaeologists keen to forge links between Early Medieval Albania and thepre-Roman Period). There is also a concentration of surviving Latin toponyms inthe vicinity of the main cemetery group, accompanied by a marked absence of theSlavic names that frequently occur elsewhere in Albania (Popovič 1984: 211–13)Although no contemporary settlements have been conclusively identified, thecemeteries suggest that new population foci developed in the changed politicaland social circumstances of the post-Roman Period.Status representation in the Komani cemeteriesWhen I first approached the question of the Komani cemeteries (Bowden 2003a;2003b), I devoted some attention to demonstrating that the Albanian communistperiod interpretation of these cemeteries as representing a proto-Albanianethnic identity was a construct rooted in a nationalistic culture-historicarchaeological tradition. Most of the cemetery excavations were carried outduring the 1960s, ’70s, and ’80s as part of an explicit agenda on the part ofthe ruling communist party of Enver Hoxha to provide archaeological evidence forthe modern Albanian population’s direct descent from the ancient Illyrians, thegroup of tribes who inhabited the western Balkans in the pre-Roman Period. Aswith most attempts to establish links with an ancient population, the principalintention was to reinforce the territorial primacy of the Albanian people,particular against the Greeks to the south and east, who continue to argue thatmuch of southern Albania is in fact Greek.In the Albanian interpretation (summarised for example by Anamali 1979–1980;1982) the Illyrians had been subjugated by the Romans, but had never been fullyassimilated into the Roman world. They had consequently remained ethnicallyindependent while under the Roman political control. When the Roman ‘occupation’ended, the Illyrians had reasserted their independence, reoccupying the sites oftheir earlier settlements and reviving pre-Roman forms of material culture andburial. The period from the 6th–11th century (the date when there is the firsttextual reference to the Albanians in the Alexiad of Anna Comnena) was ofcrucial importance to this thesis. The settlement sites of the Early MedievalPeriod in particular have proved extraordinarily difficult to find, and so theKomani cemeteries were fundamental to this reconstruction of Albanian historywith considerable resources put into their investigation. The interpretation ofthe grave goods and the skeletal remains was driven by the need to support thisnarrative. External parallels for the objects and the presence of possibleSlavic items were played down in favour of often questionable parallels withobjects from Illyrian tumulus burials.The problem of the relatively limited distribution of these cemeteries, whichunsurprisingly bore little resemblance to the area claimed by modern Albania,was solved by the identification of the so-called southern Arbër culture. Thiswas the name given to burials containing similar items to the Komani burials,that were found inserted into Bronze Age tumuli in the south of Albania. Theseincluded a series of tumuli excavated at Piskova in the upper reaches of theAoos river valley. Similar Late-Antique or post-Roman burials have been foundwithin prehistoric tumuli on the Greek side of the border for example at Meropeand Kato Pedina, which contained materials described by the excavators as‘Slavic’ (evidence summarised in Bowden 2003b, 211). This adoption of tumulusburial in the post-Roman Period was also used to bolster the case forIllyrian-Albanian continuity.All the arguments rested on the assumption inherent in culture-historicarchaeology, that material culture is a manifestation of the activities of aparticular ethnic group. Indeed, given the apparently rapid appearance ofobjects and burial practices, a classic culture historic explanation of theKomani cemeteries would favour the sudden appearance of a migrant population.This idea of incomers was untenable within the model favoured by Albanianarchaeologists, which saw the cemeteries as representing the survival of apre-Roman Illyrian population. The result was an awkward nationalist constructwhich sat uncomfortably within the culture-historic explanatory framework inwhich most of Albania’s archaeologists had been trained. Interestingly, althoughin the immediate post-communist period some Albanian archaeologists consciouslydistanced themselves from the extremes of the nationalist model (e.g. Miraj &Zeqo 1993), the basic reconstruction of Albanian history in this period remainslargely unchanged (repeated for example in Korkuti 2003).In attempting to move beyond this culture-historic construct, I argued that theKomani-Kruja graves were part of a wide sphere of burial practice that relatedto individual rather than to group identity, in which hierarchies were expressedthrough the interment of high-status objects (Bowden 2003a). Migrant groupsincluding the Avars, Slavs, and Lombards, who were probably the closestgeographically to Epirus Nova, buried their dead with jewellery, weapons, andother goods. The Komani-Kruja material indeed conforms to patterns ofstatus-related burial elsewhere, for example in Avar contexts, in which greatemphasis was placed on the presence of imported objects. The Albanian gravescontain a wide variety of imported materials, most notably the gold earrings,which probably originated in Byzantine Sicily. Also of note in this context arethe glass vessels which are unique to the Aphiona cemetery on Corfu.In my explanation, therefore, material culture was not used as a medium throughwhich ethnic difference was conveyed, but rather as a means through which theKomani-Kruja populations participated in a set of social relations.I also argued that a primary function of these ‘means of representation’ was ofengendering stability within a fragmented society. The post-Roman world was oneof uncertainty and high mobility, in terms of location of settlement orresidence and in terms of identity and status. The speed of change within7th-century Epirus was rapid. Historical sources suggest that in the late 6thand 7th centuries, groups of Avars and Slavs reportedly overran, among otherareas, the provinces of Epirus Nova and Epirus Vetus, forcing much of theexisting population to migrate elsewhere. Although the scale and timing of theseevents are contested, there can be little doubt that during the late 6th and 7thcenturies far reaching changes occurred within the provinces.In the space of perhaps two generations, an urbanised or semi-urbanised societywith recognisable affinities with the Roman past was transformed into one thatwas essentially rural, the leadership structures of which had also dramaticallyaltered (Bowden 2003b). Power became individualised in Late Antique Epirus, asituation that may have its origins in the patronage systems of the Late Empireand which was exacerbated by the ascendance of powerful churchmen in the late5th and 6th centuries. Epirus also became increasingly peripheral in relation tothe administrative structures of the Empire. This perhaps created a situation inwhich power coalesced around individuals rather than being focussed on town orstate. The result was a far more fluid and localised network of relationshipsbased around fluctuating allegiances and competition. In terms of social andpolitical cohesion these localised networks may not have been dissimilar tothose of incoming migrant groups, whose arrival doubtless exacerbated theprocess.This explanation sees the rapid re-emergence of a furnished burial rite as aresponse to an entirely new and continually changing set of social relations.The representation of individual identity and status in relation to peer groupsproved more compelling than previous strictures of the Christian churchregarding furnished burial. If the occupants of the Komani-Kruja graves wereChristian, their religion was not an aspect of their identity that was expressedwithin the burial ritual (and perhaps not within other areas of socialrelations). Although Christian items were placed within the graves, as with thepresence of Christian objects within the context of pagan graves elsewhere inEurope, their symbolic value lay in their status as objects rather than as ameans of religious representation.Ultimately, however, an interpretation that sees the transition to furnishedburial as related to individual status remains unsatisfactory as an explanatoryframework for the nature of the grave assemblages themselves. How did the graveassemblages work? What messages were they supposed to be communicating? And whatabout the graves that didn’t have any grave goods at all? What messages werethey communicating?The idea that grave goods demonstrate social status has some validity in thevery broadest sense. It would be hard to argue, that the Sutton Hoo ship burial,or the Oslo Viking ship burials belong to individuals who were of little accountin their respective communities. It gets more difficult at apparently lowerlevels of the social order if one attempts to ascribe status value to individualitems. Indeed, in this sense the ‘wealth scoring’ pioneered in a number ofcemetery studies (Parker Pearson 1999: 78–82) seems very difficult to apply inany but the most general sense. For example in Esmeralda Agolli’s (2006) tableof graves with arrowheads from Lezhë, it is extremely hard to rank these gravesin terms of the social status of the occupants. Grave 7 clearly has morematerial than the others, although grave 8 is also an individual of some accountby this reckoning. The remainder of the furnished graves, however, have littleto separate them in terms of the quality of their contents. Equally when thereis little or no chronological differentiation between the graves themselves,even if one suggests that a given object was perceived as having a greaterstatus than another, one cannot assume that these relative values remainedconstant, particularly in the case of objects which are often utilitarian(Parker Pearson 1999: 85; Bradley 1990).The attachment of values to different objects is in fact inherently dangerous,even in the case of objects which have a clear intrinsic worth such as gold orsilver. The social value of such objects can only be understood in their socialcontext, particularly in circumstances where rigid and complex social codesexist. These codes can mean that different values are attached by differentsections of society to the same body of material. While Renfrew, in his study ofChalcolithic burials at Varna on the Black Sea, suggested that gold had a ‘primevalue’ (Renfrew 1986; Parker Pearson 1999: 79), this value must be understood asbeing subject to a range of social imperatives to which we are not party. Whowas entitled to wield the gold-embellished symbols of power such as the macesand spears of the Varna burials and how was that status ascribed? Was thatstatus earned or inherited and was it part of the deceased’s identity in life aswell as death? Perhaps most importantly, was that status acknowledged by allmembers of the community?We are particularly well-informed about these socially ascribed values for theRoman Period, where it is quite clear that the most ostentatious funerarymonuments were often those of freedmen and women. It is also clear that thesetombs were built within the context of a strict social code in which purchasingpower was not necessarily commensurate with status. This is apparent fromPetronius’s ‘Dinner with Trimalchio’ in which the eponymous wealthy freedmanhosts a dinner of colossal extravagance, which culminates in a reading of hiswill and his instructions to his architect as to the nature of his tomb(Satyricon 10.71). Through this caricature Petronius mocks Trimalchio’spretensions and lack of taste in a way that reminds us that in the Roman world,wealth was not a mark of status in its own right, but had to be accommodatedwithin a wider set of social values involving one’s background and one’s role inpublic life.Nowhere was this more so than funerary monuments. These were aspirational,serving to demonstrate the status that the deceased and the builder of themonument had reached, and their place within the hierarchy of Roman society.Death was used to commemorate connections with class, wealth and power, asfreedmen and women erected monuments to their patrons who had often freed themin their wills. The socially mobile were particularly anxious to have theirachievements recorded and it is for this reason that freedmen and women are moreheavily represented in the epigraphic record and funerary record than any othersocial group. However, the process was clearly a social minefield, in whichindividuals had to tread a fine line between display and humility, ostentationand awareness of one’s place in the social hierarchy. Although Trimalchio is acaricature, Petronius’s lampooning of him would have only worked for hisaudience if they were implicitly aware of the social transgressions thatTrimalchio was committing.Is it possible to detect these types of anxieties or other related concernswithin the Early Medieval cemeteries in Albania? To my mind it is not anunreasonable proposition. As noted above, during the later 6th and 7th centuriesthe provinces of Epirus and Prevalitaine had undergone an extraordinary degreeof social upheaval, at the end of which their inhabitants were to all intentsand purposes outside the Roman Empire, the political system that they had been apart of for some 6–700 years. Small wonder that this upheaval coincided withchanges in funerary practice.Perhaps the most striking aspect of the Albanian cemeteries is the sheer levelof variation present within the burial practices represented. This variation canbe seen on two distinct levels. First there is variation in burial practicewithin individual cemeteries and second there is significant variation betweencemeteries in different locations. This level of variation suggests that‘normative behaviour’ was ill defined and probably very localised, and istherefore likely to have been the cause of social (and perhaps spiritual)anxiety. One would be hard pushed to identify cultural norms within thecemeteries and indeed the communist period archaeologists of Albania onlymanaged to create a coherent ‘culture’ by ignoring or downplaying significantareas of the evidence. The ‘southern Arber’ culture, with its reuse of tumulihas relatively little in common with the main Komani graves, apart from thepresence of certain types of material. Unfortunately the level of recording ofmost of the excavations is not sufficient for a reliable analysis of thecemeteries, but a few points can be highlighted regarding the wide variation inburial practice.Variable factors within the Komani cemeteriesThere is variation present in almost all aspects of the burial ritual within theKomani cemeteries, ranging from the orientation of the graves, to the presenceor absence of grave goods, or even the presence or absence of a body. Thesevariations are not, however, consistently present within cemeteries in differentareas, to the extent that one or more of the cemeteries often display markedcharacteristics that are wholly absent from the others. Given that it is veryunlikely that any of the cemeteries have been excavated in their entirety it ispossible that these variations simply reflect the selection of excavated graves,although this seems improbable.One of the most marked variations concerns the presence or absence of gravegoods. While the Albanian scholars were particularly concerned with the objectsfound within the tombs, it should be remembered that a significant proportion ofthe graves had no grave goods at all. In understanding the graves, theseunfurnished burials are clearly as important as those that include quantities ofobjects. In a situation where half the burials are furnished and half are not,it is likely that a lack of grave goods was intended to convey as important andexplicit a message as those that were buried with a large number of items.The ratio of unfurnished to furnished burials varies from cemetery to cemetery(Table 11.1), ranging from approximately equal proportions of each at Aphiona,Koman, and Shurdhah, to the situation at Lezhë, Kruja, Bukël, and Prosek wherethe furnished graves vastly outnumber the unfurnished ones. It is unclear as towhether there is a chronological aspect to this differentiation. Some cemeteriesalmost certainly stayed in use into the 2nd millennium AD, and it may be thatthe unfurnished tombs relate to this later period. Certainly it seems unlikelythat the deceased and their relatives were too impoverished to furnish a burialwith the most utilitarian of objects if they so desired. Consequently we shouldlook for other explanations as to why some sections of some communities weresimply not participating in the rite of furnished burial.Table 11.1. Ratios of furnished and unfurnished burials (where known) (data fromAgolli 2006 with additions).SiteFurnishedUnfurnishedAphiona910Lezhë334Koman (Dalmace)2218Kruja262Shurdhah912Bukël534Prosek367It is possible that the deceased and their relatives had different religiousbeliefs than those with furnished burials (e.g. they were Christian or belongedto a sub-group of a wider Christian community who rejected the use of gravegoods). This is certainly possible, and may have a chronological element also.Christianity was firmly established in the region by the late 4th century(Bowden 2003b: 108–10), and unless one considers that the existing populationwas wiped out or left the area entirely (neither of which is impossible) it islikely that a section of the population remained Christian into the Early MiddleAges. The cemeteries also have associated churches in some cases or at leastbuildings that are interpreted as such, as for example at Shurdah and Aphiona,although the relationships between these buildings and the graves areinconclusive. Indeed the nearest burials to the churches are in fact furnished.There is no indication as to whether the cemeteries and the churches were in usecontemporaneously and these buildings may reflect a later recognition of thesignificance of the location rather than a direct association. This isparticularly likely in the case of Shurdah (Komata 1979–1980), where the remainsof the settlement may well date to the Late Medieval Period.Although it has often been suggested that the occupants of the graves areChristian, there is little in the orientation of the graves to suggest this(although in many late antique Christian contexts orientation is also apparentlyof little account). Although considerable effort seems to have been made atAphiona, to maintain an E–W orientation (and there is some evidence for E–Worientation at Shurdah) elsewhere orientation seems to have been of littleconsideration (see Table 11.2). At most other cemeteries, the E–W orientatedgraves appear to be in the minority and there seems to be little obviousadherence to any other orientation.We should also consider the possibility that the occupants of the unfurnishedburials and their relatives belonged to a social group defined by factors otherthan religion for which grave goods were also inappropriate. This group may havebeen defined by class, gender, ethnic origin, or other factors. It is of coursepossible that we are looking at groups of newcomers or at least communities thatwere partly made up of newcomers. The wide variations in practice that can beidentified in a relatively small area of Albania may reflect the arrival ofimmigrants from a variety of locations who all brought their own localisedvariation of burial traditions with them.Table 11.2. Orientation of graves at Komani cemeteries (where known).[../images/table11_2.jpg]At Aphiona, Koman, and Shurdah the approximately equal ratio of unfurnished andfurnished burials could be suggested to reflect the gender of the occupants.This of course makes the considerable assumptions that a cross section of anentire community is represented within the cemeteries and that both male andfemale infants were equally encouraged to survive. It also assumes that culturaldifferences between different groups of people in a relatively small area weresufficiently pronounced to allow fundamental differences in the treatment ofmale and female bodies.The assignation of gender to the Komani graves is generally very problematic. Inthe Albanian archaeologists’ interpretation dress items and jewellery areassociated with female graves while weapons are associated with male graves. Thefibulae are suggested to be common to both sexes. None of these attributions,however, are based on osteology, but rely rather on the excavators’ perceptionsof gender roles, with which the drawbacks are self-evident. Indeed, closeexamination of the assemblages suggests that many items (including possiblyarrowheads) were present in graves of both sexes and that this associationbetween objects and gender is unreliable. This can be seen for example at Bukël,in a table from Esmeralda Agolli’s recent work (2006), where the single burialsclearly contain both weapons (i.e. arrowheads) and dress items. At Prosek, whichis the only cemetery where analysis of the skeletal remains has been carriedout, it was impossible to associate grave goods with individual bodies, becauseof their occurrence in multiple burials (Doda 1989). Only at Aphiona are theitems that occurred with the burials all those that the Albanian archaeologistshave associated with female burials.The picture of associations between grave goods is confused by the very highincidence of multiple burials at certain sites, although there is alsoconsiderable variation in this aspect. At Lezhë, Prendi (1979–1980: 144)suggested that most were ‘family’ tombs, containing 2–5 skeletons. At Kruja,however, 22 of the 28 graves contained single inhumations, while two gravescontained two skeletons, two contained three skeletons, and a single examplecontained four bodies. The remaining grave is not mentioned in this context(Anamali & Spahiu 1979–1980: 81). The multiple burials suggest that the gravesmay have been used over more than one generation, although there is no evidencethat all the bodies were not inserted contemporaneously or had been transferredfrom elsewhere. It has not been established whether the occupants of the graveshave familial relationships although with the continued improvement inextraction of mitochondrial DNA this is clearly both possible and desirable (seeBejko, Fenton & Foran 2006 on DNA work in Albania).Table 11.3. Graves containing arrowheads (after Agolli 2006).SiteTotal gravesTotal graves with arrowheadsLezhë377Koman (Dalmace)406Kruja282Shurdhah211Bukël575Prosek439At the opposite end of the scale both Bukël and Prosek also include a number ofapparent cenotaphs, where deposits had been buried in circumstances where a bodywas not available for interment, but where the relatives clearly considered itimportant to conduct a funerary rite, either for social or religious reasons orboth (Agolli 2006: 293). Interestingly at Koman, a number of graves (2, 13, 23,28, 32, 37) were excavated which lacked both grave goods and skeletal remains(Spahiu 1979–1980: 29–31), although the apparently poor preservation of theskeletal remains from Koman means that we should be wary of drawing too manyconclusions from this. It is not impossible, however, that the occupants ofthese cenotaph graves were removed some time after burial to be added to one ofthe multiple graves. The practice of constructing cenotaphs is seeminglyrestricted to these sites, with no recorded examples at Lezhë, Shurdah or Kruja.There is also considerable divergence between the cemeteries in terms of thetypes of objects present. The idea of a homogeneous ‘Komani culture’ wasattractive to the excavators, and the assemblages do share the definingcharacteristic of their existence in a milieu where furnished burial hadpreviously fallen from favour. Nonetheless, there is considerable diversitybetween the cemeteries in terms of the types of material present, which may inpart be explained by the fact that different groups of people in differentlocations would not all have had access to the same range of objects. Of note inthis context are the glass vessels from Aphiona, the presence of which maysuggest that Aphiona, by dint of its location, may have remained in contact withMediterranean trading routes from which the central Albanian cemeteries had beencut off.Weapons were present in some, but by no means all of the cemeteries and thetypes varied widely. Swords and spears are exceptional, the latter appearingmost at Koman, although single swords are known from Kruja and Koman (Anamali &Spahiu 1979–1980: 56–57), and the most common weapons are axes, daggers, andarrowheads. It should be noted that all the latter items also have functions offthe battlefield and may have been included in this context.The arrowheads, on which Agolli (2006) focuses (Table 11.3), are particularlyinteresting. Their inclusion must be as a symbolic token – a single arrow is oflimited practical use as a weapon in the afterlife and an act of conspicuousconsumption – demonstrating status by the disposal of goods – would surelyrequire multiple arrowheads. What could these signify? Agolli does not go beyondstating that they were an important part of the male burial rite. However, thenumbers suggest that not all males were buried with arrowheads, while the singleand cenotaph arrowhead graves at Bukël contain items that could also beassociated with female burials. Did arrowheads imply a particular social statusor a symbolic allegiance or claim to membership of a particular social group, inthe same way that weapon burials may have worked in Anglo Saxon England todemonstrate Germanic descent as Heinrich Härke (1992) demonstrated?One final point that is worthy of comment is the relatively small size of thecemeteries of which the largest with consistent records only contains 57burials. While it is likely that few, if any, of the cemeteries have beeninvestigated in their entirety, the picture that emerges suggests that thecemeteries, if in use for any length of time, were serving very smallcommunities, perhaps comprising a mere handful of families. There is alsonothing to say that the cemeteries were consistently in use, or whether theywere used seasonally or periodically. Given that Albanian archaeologists havepostulated that these cemeteries belong to a period that lasts through the 7thand 8th centuries and sometimes into the 9th century, this is a question thatneeds to be seriously addressed.Conclusion: interpreting burials in a period of transitionThe Komani-Kruja burials represent the re-emergence of furnished burials in aperiod of profound transition, in which Roman society effectively fragmentedinto a semi-tribal system based around fluid and localised loyalties andallegiances. It would be stretching credulity to claim that these changes inburial practice were not somehow connected with the fundamental changes thatwere occurring within society. Nonetheless with new social mores came additionalanxieties as people struggled to accommodate and adapt to new practices withintheir own lifestyles. The significant levels of variation between cemeteriessuggest that this fragmentation of society is reflected in burial practice, withdifferent groups adapting burial practices that were specific to that location.The adoption of furnished burial must have been a process that was fraught withsocial danger, seemingly indicated by the fact that not all members of thecommunity adopted it.In conclusion, however, although the possibilities for decoding explicit andimplicit messages from the burial evidence alone are limited by comparison withwhat can be achieved in historic periods, I am optimistic that possibilitiesexist for significant advances in our understanding of the Komani graves andother grave groups from non-historic contexts. The possibilities of extractingever greater levels of information from the skeletal remains themselves in termsof diet and health (and hence wealth and social status) and genetic backgroundare increasing exponentially, and it is now possible to ask and answer questionsthat were impossible to consider even 20 years ago. Equally the application ofbasic excavation techniques and clear publication would also aid ourunderstanding of these cemeteries very considerably.Finally, we must continually seek to nuance the questions that we ask offunerary assemblages. We must attempt to chart the social boundaries that areimplicit in these assemblages, and be alive to the possibilities that theseboundaries were continually being pushed and transgressed. Death is a momentwhen the social aspirations of the living come to the fore. The fluid socialstructures of the post-Roman world provided ample opportunity for socialmobility. However, the graves of Roman freedmen and women remind us that socialmobility is articulated through a complex vocabulary in which meanings are bothimplicit and explicit. Who knows what social censure may have befallen the manwho included an arrow in his wife’s grave, when her life and social backgrounddid not merit such an object in the eyes of his neighbours?BibliographyAgolli, E. 2006: ‘The Distribution of Arrowheads in Koman Culture Burials(6th–8th Centuries A.D.)’, in L.

In 1874, a large Viking ship was excavated in grave mound no. 1.However, contrary to the Oseberg and Gokstad Viking ships, the ship atMyklebostad was burnt. Only half of the mound was excavated, but the ship mayhave been the size of Gokstad or perhaps even larger. The most spectacular findwas the urn in which the cremated bones of a 30–35 year old man were found. Inmound no. 2 there were six burials dating from the 8th to the 10th century AD,including both inhumations, cremations and two smaller boats – one burnt and oneunburnt. Mounds nos 3 and 5 were not excavated, but in mound no. 4 crematedremains from a woman in a small boat were found. The most striking feature atthis cemetery regarding rituals is that all of these funerals were conducted ina different manner, even those within mound no. 2. Nevertheless, the deceasedbelonged to the same cultural and religious sphere, and may have been one familyor at least part of the same community. Thus, the different practices must havebeen used deliberately and this cemetery enables therefore a discussion of whythe rituals vary, the relationship between cremation and inhumation, theinvention and reinvention of tradition, and the ritual transformation of thesociety in the development of the Norwegian kingdom.Keywords: Cremation, inhumation, Norwegian kingdom, ritual mobilisation,tradition, Viking ship[../images/fig12_1.jpg]Fig. 12.1. Map of Myklebostad in Eid in Nordfjord, Norway (courtesy of RagnarBørsheim and Arkikon).The most famous Viking ship in the world is most likely the Oseberg ship. InNorway, ever since the first Viking ship was excavated at Borre in Vestfold in1852, Snorre’s sagas (he himself being an Icelandic poet, historian andpolitician, 1179?–1241) have been used to interpret which chieftains and kingswere given ship burials, thus linking the Viking ships to the Ynglingatal, theYnglinga Saga, and the foundation of the Norwegian kingdom. According tohistory, King Harald Hårfagre (Fairhair) started the conquest of Norway, whichended with the formation of the Norwegian kingdom, hence unifying the previousformer petty kingdoms or chiefdoms. Traditionally, Harald Hårfagre and thedevelopment of the Norwegian kingdom have been located to Vestfold in easternNorway (Andersen 1977). However, although the final battle in Hafrsfjord whereHårfagre unified Norway has traditionally been set at AD 872, it is now believedthat Harald Hårfagre started his conquest from his strongholds in southwesternNorway and that the unification took place somewhat later (Krag 1995: 86, Opedal1998; 2005; Myhre & Gansum 2003).Next to Oseberg’s fame is the Gokstad Viking ship. These, together with thelesser known Borre ship, are all buried in Vestfold, while the Tune ship wasburied across Oslofjord in Østfold. The Oseberg burial took place in AD 834,while those at Gokstad, Borre and Tune occurred around AD 900. In addition, insouthwestern Norway, two ship burials have been found at Avaldsnes: Storhaugdating to c. AD 690–750 and Grønhaug to c. AD 930, respectively. It is commonlyagreed that those who were given these extraordinary burials were part of theelites, political centres, processes and even the conquests that led in one wayor another to the unification of Norway as a kingdom. It is, however, highlyproblematic to link these graves to historical figures or persons described inthe sagas. Noteworthy, all these ship burials were unburnt and the deceasedinhumated, but perhaps the largest of all Viking ships found in Norway and theleast discussed, the Myklebostad ship in Eid in Nordfjord, western Norway, wasburnt and the deceased cremated.Thus, I will present and discuss the Myklebostad ship burial in the context ofthe unification of the kingdom of Norway (Fig. 12.1). Although it is possiblethat this funeral represents something ritually and cosmologically unique withregards to the circumstances of the deceased’s death necessitating such amassive cremation, in a political context (which will be discussed) one mayassume that the deceased was a local king or chieftain. Why was this ship burnt?Why only was this local king or chieftain cremated when the common practice forroyal burials was inhumation? How can this ritual practice be contextualised inrelation to the local traditions at Myklebostad, the foundation of the Norwegiankingdom, and the religious beliefs in the Viking Age?[../images/fig12_2.jpg]Fig. 12.2. The Myklebostad cemetery (after Shetelig 1905: 6, fig. 1).[../images/fig12_3.jpg]Fig. 12.3. Mound no. 1, Rundehogjen, at Myklebostad (courtesy of RagnarBørsheim).The Myklebostad ship burialOriginally, there were five large grave mounds at Myklebostad (Fig. 12.2). Ingrave mound no. 1. (Fig. 12.3), a large Viking ship was excavated in 1874 byAnders Lorange (Lorange 1875). The mound measured 31 m in diameter with a heightof 4 m. Around the mound there was a ditch measuring 4 m in width and 1 m indepth. As indicated, contrary to the Oseberg and Gokstad burials, the Vikingship at Myklebostad was burnt. Only half of the mound was excavated and 44shield bosses were found (Shetelig 1912: 201), which indicates the large size ofthe ship, and the fact that more shields may still be in situ. The Gokstad shipmay have had 64 shields, but only 32 were found (Nicolaysen 1882: 62). Thus, theMyklebostad ship may have been the size of Gokstad, which was 24 m long, orperhaps even longer. However, since this ship was burnt and excavated as earlyas 1874, the documentation is rather poor according to today’s standards. Thereare no drawings or maps of the site from the excavation; indeed, the originaldocumentation is also lost (Magnus 1967: 60). In fact, the only informationabout the excavation is a nine page published report describing the context(Lorange 1875: 153–61). Thus, in the absence of excavating the remaining mound,our interpretations are restricted to the 1875 publication, which neverthelessreveals information about the stratigraphy, the cremation, and the successiverituals.Before the mound was built, a layer of charcoal and burnt soil was deposited onthe field. The layer had the same diameter as the mound itself, around 30 m, andwas a bit thicker at the centre than at the edges. Above this layer, fine sandwas deposited covering most of the charcoal beneath, but leaving the outer edgesbare. Subsequently, another layer of charcoal was deposited with the samediameter as the one beneath, thus connecting the two charcoal layers at the edgeof the mound, but separated by about 20 cm of sand at the centre. In both thecharcoal layers, scattered ship nails, spikes, cremated remains, shield bossesand intentionally destroyed weapons were found (Lorange 1875: 154–55). Based onthe description of the context, it is for the time being impossible to decidewhether the ship was burnt on the spot where the mound was raised or if thematerial for the charcoal layers was transported to the site and thereafterscattered. It is possible to argue for both alternatives.The most remarkable find is nevertheless the urn, which was deposited in a pitin the gravel beneath the lower charcoal layer (Fig. 12.4). Twelve shield bossescovered the urn which was filled 2/3 with a mixture of burnt bones, ashes, andcharcoal. In between the cremated bones there were found pieces of burnt irontools and smelted bronze, together with an arrowhead, three bone dices and sixcounters (Lorange 1875: 155). All the cremated bones in the urn belonged to a30–35 year old man, but he might have been younger. The total weight of thebones was 1712 g. In the shoulder there was an indication of a cut, which maystem from a battle or post mortem treatment (Holck 1983).[../images/fig12_4.jpg]Fig. 12.4. The urn with shield bosses from grave mound no. 1, Myklebostad(courtesy of Bergen Museum, Bergen).The urn itself is one of the most spectacular finds in Norwegian archaeology.The three figures (Fig. 12.5) and the decoration at the bottom of the urn (Fig.12.6), in particular, show unique craftsmanship, with the figures bearing aresemblance to the ‘Buddha-bucket’ in the Oseberg burial. It is uncertain whatkind of cauldron this urn originally was. Paralleling hanging bowls inAnglo-Saxon graves, it is most likely Irish, though whether it was made inIreland or in Irish monasteries in England is not known. Indeed, its originalfunction may have been as a liturgical bowl for washing during Mass in earlyChristian communities (Liestøl 1953) or as a baptismal font. The bowl is datedto the middle or the end of the 8th century AD (Henry 1936; 1965: 93; Magnus1967: 111), and some time have elapsed before being used as an urn and depositedin the grave.Although there are no radiocarbon dates or exact typological dates for the shipburial, it has generally been considered to date from the end of the 9th centuryAD or the first half of the 10th century AD (Shetelig 1906; Magnus 1967; 1978;1992). This chronology would place the funeral within a similar timeframe as theformation of the Norwegian state and King Harald Hårfagre’s conquest of thepetty kingdoms along the west coast. According to Snorre Sturlasson (1993),there was a political centre in Nordfjord resisting King Harald Hårfagre’sunification, and both the local kings, Audbjørn and Vemund, were killed byHarald Hårfagre’s men. However, it is difficult to relate Snorre’s sagas tohistorical events. Even if there were two local kings named Audbjørn and Vemundin Nordfjord at this time, it is not obvious that one of them was buried withthe burnt ship in the Myklebostad grave. Thus, in order to contextualise thisunique ship one has to look closer at the local ritual and religious practices,which took place at this farmstead, and how they deviate from other funerarypractices at the same time.[../images/fig12_5.jpg]Fig. 12.5. The urn of grave mound no. 1: ‘The Myklebostad Man’ on the urn(courtesy of Bergen Museum, Bergen).The Myklebostad grave fieldThe political centre in Nordfjordeid from AD 600 to1000 was situated atMyklebostad, where five large grave mounds were constructed, including the onewith the burnt Viking ship (Table 12.1). In grave mound no. 2, there were sixburials (Fig. 12.7) dating from the 8th to the 10th century AD, which wereexcavated by Håkon Shetelig in 1902–3. The first and second graves were theeldest of these (Grave II), which was a double burial of a man and a woman –both inhumated. The third was a cremation burial of a man (Grave III),consisting of a cremation patch measuring 1.60 × 1 m scattered with human bones,but the grave also contained a concentration of cleaned bones together withintentionally destroyed weapons (Shetelig 1905: 24–32). The fourth grave was aship burial. Throughout large parts of the mound ship nails were scattered, andby their size it must have been a ship of considerable proportions. It ispossible that later graves disturbed this burial of an unburnt ship (Grave V),as the distribution of nails and pieces of wood seemed unstructured (Shetelig1905: 38, 51). The fifth grave was a cremation burial where a smaller boat wasburnt (Grave I), which left an imprint of its size, measuring 7 m in length. Inthe charcoal layer there were numerous nails, a sword and eight shield bosses.The cremated bones were collected and cleaned, and piled together under acauldron. Finally, there was a cremation of a woman (Grave IV) consisting of twocauldrons: one of iron and one of bronze, stemming from the British Islands.Most of the cremated bones together with the grave gifts, such as two bronzefibulae, were scattered in the charcoal layer of 2 × 3 m in extension. Thecremation had not taken place on the spot; furthermore ten unburnt boat nailswere also found in the layer, indicating that parts of a boat were involved inthe funerary procedures, although one would not label this as a boat grave(Shetelig 1905: 32–37).Table 12.1. Relative and absolute dating of the grave-mounds (from Shetelig1905).[../images/table12_1.jpg][../images/fig12_6.jpg]Fig. 12.6. The urn of grave mound no. 1: The décor at the bottom of the urn(after Shetelig 1905, folio at the end).[../images/fig12_7.jpg]Fig. 12.7. Grave mound no. 2 with the six graves (after Shetelig 1905, folio atthe end).Grave mound no. 4 was severely damaged and in 1847 large parts were removed aspart of a road construction. Nevertheless, it seems that there were at least twoburials in this mound. In one part, a sword, a spear and a cauldron were found,indicating that it was a male burial. In another part, Shetelig found a layer ofcharcoal of 1.80 × 1.30 m in extension, with a maximum thickness of six cm,containing about 350 boat nails, of which the majority measured between 2.5 cmand 3.5 cm in length. The deceased was a woman who had been cremated in a boat,but not where the mound was made because the charcoal layer, in which the boneswere scattered, was too small for such a cremation. Grave mounds nos 3 and 5were not excavated by archaeologists, though numerous boat nails in mound no. 3were found earlier during construction work, but no other finds (Shetelig 1905:40–41). Grave mound no. 5 was removed around 1875, from which two swords, twoaxes and a spear had been recovered and taken care of, indicating at least twomale funerals in the mound (Magnus 1967: 60). Thus, there may have been othergraves apart from the ones described.Changing rituals and ‘death myths’The term ‘religion’ is contested in Iron Age studies. On the one hand, it iscommonly acknowledged that there was no pre-Christian religion as such. On theother hand, depending upon definitions, one may also say that religion focuseson answering three main questions: 1) What becomes of us after death?, 2) Howshould we lead a moral life?, and 3) How and why were the universe, life, andhuman beings created? (Davies 1999). This relates to ritual practices and whycertain rituals are performed and conducted the way they are. In this sense,death is the door to religion.The grave mounds in this cemetery date from the 8th century AD, perhaps evenearlier, to the end of the 10th century AD, thus giving a ritual continuitycovering the Merovingian and the Viking Periods (c. AD 550–1000). The moststriking feature with regards to rituals is that all of these funerals wereconducted differently. Although there were some inhumations, the majority of menand women were cremated. The burnt Viking ship is an anomaly as a funeralpractice, but also two smaller boats were burnt. There are also indications ofone unburnt Viking ship of considerable size, as well as nails from two otherunburnt ships or boats. To add to the variation, men and women were cremated orinhumed with burnt and unburnt ships or boats. Nevertheless, the deceasedbelonged to the same cultural and religious sphere, possibly originating fromone family or at least the same community.Death is contra-social and the funerary rites may meet the threat that deathmakes to the social system (Goody 1962: 26). Before addressing the question ofinventing and reinventing tradition and why cremation is the dominant funeralpractice in this region as opposed to inhumation which the elite practiced inother parts, it is necessary to put emphasis on the observed variation in themortuary rituals: why are there differences in funeral practices when thedescendants are assumed to share the same cosmological ideas and worldviews? Thedifferences cannot be explained by different religions or ethnicities. Gender orsocial identities may have influenced the wealth of grave gifts, but prescribingcremation or not to both men and women cannot explain the variation within therespective rituals.An approach that may explain part of the variation is through an analyticalperspective, which we have called ‘death myths’ (Kristoffersen & Oestigaard2006; 2008). If one assumes that the variation in rituals conducted by thedescendants was intentional, then the differences are meaningful in themselves.Each funeral was carried out individually according to an overall cosmologicalor mythological scheme, which one may label a ‘death myth’. In death there are aset of ritual possibilities, whereby the descendants can compose and conduct thefuneral in accordance to: specific causes of death; the ancestors; the spiritualworld, or; using the deceased as a medium for social outcomes in thereconstruction of society. Hence, a funeral is not a fixed set of ritualsequences, but an open field of mediations and interactions between thedescendants and the divinities. Consequently, the participants may compose andperform particular rites to obtain a special desired result. Despite thedifferences in funeral practices, a large degree of homogeneity existed inburial customs. There are variations on a theme and a religious code must havedefined and prescribed what was allowed: this is what a ‘death myth’ is. It is acollective conception of how, why, and who can perform death rituals at a giventime. Variation in funeral customs can thus be seen as an expression wheredifferent rituals have been performed according to certain objectives based on agiven repertoire of ritual possibilities. By seeing a ritual as a practice insocial and religious life, it opens up a sphere of negotiations, manipulationsand constructions of political and cosmological orders (Kristoffersen &Oestigaard 2006; 2008).In pre-modern societies, tradition is intimately connected to truth. Based onanalogies, one may also assume that this is true for the Viking Age. The accessto truth or the possibility and capacity to make true statements about certaindomains of reality are restricted to only some actors (Boyer 1990: 94). This isnot limited to statements, but includes ritual participation and performance,particularly in funerals of the elite in a society. Not everybody can performthe most important and auspicious parts of the rituals, and hence, there will bea hierarchy among the descendants and ritual participants in a funeral(Oestigaard & Goldhahn 2006). In the words of Geertz (1980: 120), ‘A royalcremation was not an echo of a politics taking place somewhere else. It was anintensification of a politics taking place everywhere else’. Political ritualsand the state cult were not a cult of the state, but a repeated argument in thevocabulary of rituals that worldly status had a cosmic origin and that hierarchywas the governing principle of the universe (Geertz 1980: 102). Politicalrituals construct power and they are elaborate and efficacious arguments aboutpower and how it is made. Indeed, the political order was often perceived ascoming from divine sources (Bell 1997: 129).Traditions may be created in two ways: new inventions acquiring legitimacy fromtradition by being seen as a direct continuity, or; through being explicitlyperceived as a re-creation of a lost tradition. Hence, an invented tradition maynot bear any direct or visible relationship to the past, although believers mayperceive it differently. Consequently, the re-creation or the presence of anauthentic past in the present is often seen as an invention of tradition(Gombrich & Obeyesekere 1988: 241).All social and ritual practices change through time, and the belief in traditionas a timeless continuity without change is a construction. Indeed, continuity ismore remarkable than change. Roy Rappaport (2001: 6–7) has emphasised that‘structural transformations in some subsystems [have] made it possible tomaintain more basic aspects of the system unchanged’, and he stresses that thecrucial question to ask is ‘What does this change maintain unchanged?’ Changesin parts of the subsystems may preserve the continuity of the system as a wholeliving entity (Rappaport 2001: 7), in this case the religious and politicalinstitutions, and thus it is necessary to invent traditions and change ritualsin order to preserve the existing ideologies and hierarchies of power in a timeof transition.The variation in funeral practices at Myklebostad indicates that death was anactive medium by which the descendants or the elite probably reconstructed thedeceased and their relationship to the ancestors, society and cosmos. Moreover,if one looks at the Myklebostad grave field with a particular emphasis on theburnt Viking ship, there are several factors suggesting that the funerals weremass mobilisations recreating or reinventing a former tradition with its rootsin the Migration Period (c. AD 400–550), or in other words, re-creating a losttradition.Reinventing traditionThe political and religious context in which the Myklebostad complex appears ischaracterised by two overall processes: the formation of the Norwegian kingdomand the process of Christianisation. In the context of these processes one mayinterpret the ritual scenario which unfolded at Myklebostad. Harald Hårfagreunified Norway and conquered his enemies by force. Harald’s eldest son, EirikBloodaxe, married Gunnhild, the daughter of the Danish King, Gorm the Old, thusunifying the two dynasties. However, his youngest son, who later became KingHåkon the Good, was raised as a Christian by King Athelstan of England. Thus, onthe one hand, religion or Christianity seems to have been a political andstrategic tool, but on the other hand, religion can often be the key buildingblock of identity (Insoll 2004a) and ‘conceived as the superstructure into whichall other aspects of life can be placed’ (Insoll 2004b: 12), structuring allaspects of a given material culture and practices (Insoll 2004b: 13). It is inthis light, funerals played a particularly important role.With Christianity cremation was forbidden, but one cannot interpret inhumationsin the Viking Period as influenced by Christianity; this practice started amongthe elite in the Late Roman Period, with for instance ‘Flagghaugen’, which isthe richest grave in Norway from that period. However, cremation is undoubtedlya heathen practice, and coincidentally one of the closest parallels to theMyklebostad ship burial is found in France. In Île de Groix, Morbihan inBretagne, a Viking ship was burnt in a Viking context for the 930s or ’40s. Theship nails together with cremated bones, burnt soil, sand, and clay weredeposited in a layer measuring 5.4 m in diameter with a thickness of 10–12 cm,but this size is only partial since half of the grave had eroded over a cliffwhen it was excavated. There were at least 20 shield bosses together withweapons and other artefacts collected in an iron cauldron (Shetelig 1945, Price1989). This funeral in a Viking colony may hint that the Myklebostad practicemay be more common than usually thought (see Price 2010; 2013). Still, withregards to Myklebostad in the particular cultural-religious Norwegian context,one may suggest that the funeral reinforced and reinvented earlier practices ona massive scale:1. Cremation. Even though this was a common funeral practice in the VikingPeriod, its dominant position during the Migration Period was gradually replacedby inhumation which culminated with Christianity. The burnt Myklebostad ship isunique in the Norwegian context although it is described in written sources suchas Ibn Fadlan (2005) and Saxo Grammaticus [1975]. Smaller boats have been burntin Norway, but the cremation of a large Viking ship especially must have been ademonstration of power and wealth. This ritual manifested a particular religiousbelief and political ideology, since the other Viking ships such as Oseberg,Gokstad, Borre and Tune were unburnt.2. Urn. During the Roman Iron Age and the Migration Period (until c. 550 AD)the use of urns in cremations was the ordinary practice, but with the transitionto the Late Iron Age (from c. 550 AD) this practice disappears with some fewexceptions in Norway (although quite common in for instance Sweden). In Norway,the production of pottery ends abruptly with the transition to the MerovingianPeriod (c. AD 550) and consequently no ceramic urns are made locally. In theLate Iron Age, the common practice was that the bones were scattered in thecremation patch, and using urns may relate to former traditions and practicesfrom the Early Iron Age (Oestigaard 1999; 2000).3. Celtic cauldrons. If one assumes that those living at Myklebostad knew theoriginal meaning of this cauldron, the use of an alleged Christian liturgicalcauldron as an urn would then be a deliberate manifestation and replacement of areligious idea with another, which desecrated Christianity, particularly sinceit was used as an urn. Utilising a liturgical bowl (Henry 1936; 1965; Liestøl1953) in such a way may also relate to, and have a symbolic parallel to, olderCeltic practices, such as employing skulls for ritual purposes. Early baptismalfonts have been interpreted as a continuity of the pagan skull cult and use(Bord & Bord 1985: 8–9; Green 1998), and the cauldron in the Myklebostad gravemay relate to Irish heathendom. The double symbolism of cauldrons and skulls mayreflect pagan beliefs, and hence the iconic motifs of the three figures on theurn may point backwards to the heathen past rather than towards the process ofChristianisation.4. Intentional destruction of weapons. This is a practice only found incremations and it is a direct continuity of rituals from the Early Iron Age,which may relate to ancestral worship and cult. In the process of smelting andmaking swords, charcoal derived from the bones of animals and humans was used totransform iron into steel. Thus, smelting brought life and identities into theobjects, and this process may have been considered reversed in the ritualdestruction of the weapons during the cremation ritual (Gansum 2004a; 2004b;2004c; Goldhahn & Oestigaard 2007; Oestigaard 2007).All together, it seems that the cremation and the burning of the Viking ship atMyklebostad reinvented former cremation practices, which had their roots in theMigration Period. Although former traditions were reinvented, there also appearsto be a bricolage of syncretistic practices probably influenced by inhumationand beliefs of the body as a unity. Per Holck (1987: 55–56) analysed thecremated remains from eastern Norway: Of 1,082 samples, 919 were from the EarlyIron Age and 147 from the Late Iron Age, with a further 16 from the Bronze Age.Based on measurements from the Asker Crematorium outside Oslo, the averageweight of cremated bones from modern individuals is 3,075 grams (3375 g for men,2,625 g for women), whereas other analyses of cremated modern individualsindicate that the average weight is 2,700 g for men and 1,840 g for women (Holck1987: 71–73, 121). In contrast, the average weight of the cremated bones foundin the archaeological record in general in eastern Norway is 269.7 g for singledeposits. In many of these contexts it was impossible to determine the sexbecause too few fragments were available, but where possible the average weightwas 637.9 g for men (with a range of 10–3,175 g) and 455.6 g for women (with arange of 30–1,950 g) (Holck 1987: 119). Since the majority of these cremationswere conducted in the Early Iron Age, the traditional practice was that only10–20% of the deceased’s bones were placed in the urn and the rest were used forother purposes (Goldhahn & Oestigaard 2007; 2008). In the urn at Myklebostad,there were 1,712 g of bones, and although not a complete skeleton, it seems thatthe descendants aimed to collect all or most of the cremated bones. Thisobservation appears to indicate a belief that it was necessary to preserve thecomplete body – a belief which is more in accordance with inhumation andcontradicting the Early Iron Age cremation practices.The massive scale and dimensions of this funeral bears testimony to a ritualmobilisation at a time of transition when the Norwegian kingdom was beingestablished, and concomitant with the Christianisation process taking place(e.g. Gansum & Oestigaard 1999; 2004). The numerous shields deposited mayindicate that the deceased king’s men paid homage and tribute to their deadleader, who may have been killed in battle as indicated by the cut on hisshoulder. If this was the case, one may relate this event to the unification ofthe kingdom and local chieftains or kings fighting against this process, as theystood to lose part or all of their own political power and sovereignty. Thisinterpretation is, of course, based on a number of assumptions. Nevertheless,given the scale of the cremation in the time era when it took place, it could beof interest to pursue such a line of reasoning and propose some additionalinterpretations.Importantly, if the deceased was killed in battle, the successor, who mostlikely was responsible for conducting the funeral, could have used this ritualas a means for mobilising forces in the ongoing struggle. The massive dimensionsof the cremation, including the burning of the ship, is a strong manifestationof the pagan religion and its practices with continuity from earlier traditionsand beliefs. Thus, older beliefs and power structures were emphasised as elitefunerals linked the future with the past, which gave the present a divinelegitimacy. This deeply rooted heathen tradition is also evident in the othergrave mounds at Myklebostad, which seem to indicate a similar ritual andpolitical manifestation, although not on the same scale.However, if the local king at Myklebostad lost the war, another scenario is alsopossible. If the grave dates to the first half of the 10th century AD, it is oneof the last funerals to have been conducted at Myklebostad, perhaps with a fewminor burials later. Nevertheless, such a grandiose funeral can be seen as thefinal manifestation of a religious tradition. The tradition died with the king.In written sources there are references to the practice and ideal that when theking was killed, the battle was over. In Saxo Grammaticus, a battle is referredto where the Danish King Harald Hildetann went with his fleet to Kalmar inSweden and attacked King Ring and his men. However, Ring’s warriors killedHarald Hildetann, and when Ring became aware of his death, he ended the battleand ordered his men to search for the king’s corpse. They searched among thecorpses for half a day before they found the king’s body. King Ring thenprepared a funeral pyre and let the Danes put the deceased king’s ship on thepyre before it was lit. When the cremation was completed, the bones of the kingwere collected in an urn and transported back to Leire in Denmark (SaxoGrammaticus [1975]: 312–16). Thus, the Myklebostad King may have lost thebattle, and it was the victorious king’s duty to prepare and conduct anhonourable funeral for the deceased leader. If this was the case and his deathwas part of the unification of Norway, the political and ideological resistanceagainst this process from this region would have been crushed. However, themassive dimensions of the funeral at Myklebostad as a continuity of existingtradition may suggest that the funeral was used as a unifying mobilisationwithin the community.The Myklebostad king may even have been killed somewhere else and been crematedwhere he died, whereupon his men collected the bones, ashes and charcoal fromthe pyre and brought it back home. The uppermost of the two charcoal layers inthe mound may provide hints supporting this hypothesis. Since the crematedmaterial was placed upon a layer of sand, this would indicate that the remainsfrom the pyre were collected at a certain stage during the funeral and depositedafterwards. As mentioned, however, the evidence at present is too vague toconfirm whether the ship was burnt at the place where the mound was constructedor if the funeral took place somewhere else. In the latter scenario, thepossibility exists that the king lost the battle elsewhere or even overseas, andthis event may not relate to the unification of Norway, since the urn stems fromthe British Islands.If a person died abroad or far from home, the urn may have been procured fromthat region and transported back. Hence, the origin of the urn may giveindications of where the deceased died unless urns were procured prior to death(Oestigaard 1999). The parallel find of a burnt Viking ship in France suggeststhat the funeral was arranged where the battle was lost and that the ship wasburnt in situ upon which the mound was built.Changes in rituals, traditions and ritual variationMaking theoretical elaborations about social processes on a micro-level based onchanges in material culture are always a challenge. Complex rituals such asthose at Myklebostad can be solely local developments not relating to grandernarratives of renegotiating traditions. If, however, they are, it can be ofinterest to relate the Myklebostad complex to theories of tradition and socialchange through time.The past is always a created ideology with a purpose designed to controlindividuals or to motivate societies and inspire classes (Plumb 1969: 17). Thepast can be seen as an elaborate house of cards, which the present has beenconstantly upsetting and using for political purposes. Power needs legitimacyand legitimacy needs justification. Legitimacy can be justified in three ways:from religion, from philosophy, and from the past. More often than not,legitimacy is an amalgam of the three, which is evident at Myklebostad where thepast and religion (or possible philosophy) were two sides of the same coin usedin the formation of society. The past has constantly been involved in thepresent, and everything from the past including monuments and funerals weresecuring the authority (Plumb 1969: 36–38). Hence, tradition is an ideologicalinterpretation and uses the past in the present for the future.Tradition constitutes a broadly significant phenomenon. A major characteristicof tradition is that the temporal distance separating us from the past or theliving from the dead, is not value-free or objective. The time and relationbetween the past and the present is a transmission which generates and giveslegitimacy to meaning, which then gives legitimacy to social control andinstitutions. Tradition is the outcome of the exchange between an interpretedpast and an interpreted present. Within a tradition nobody is an absoluteinventor, but rather the contrary, the past is a source for constructing thefuture, which creates a situation where everybody is an heir of the past.Tradition enables us therefore to understand what has been said and done whenthis knowledge is transmitted historically through chains of interpretations andreinterpretation, which create some structural properties of societies (Ricoeur1990: 221, 227):1. Traditions create an interconnectedness which assures the continuity ofunderstanding the past. Thus, the past becomes a source for making history andthe future, whereby the actors are affected by the past.2. Traditions are bearers of meaning, and it is through tradition thatreceived heritage is given symbolic and moral value. In this sense traditionsare not only bearers of meaning, but also proposals and creators of meaning.3. Traditions are justifying legitimacy, and claims for truths can be foundin tradition, particularly when argumentation is offered within the public spaceof discussion or performed in rituals.The last point directs the attention from the dead to the living and emphasisesthat death is a matter of transactions and re-negotiations. From a societalperspective, death is often more important for the living than for the dead(Oestigaard & Goldhahn 2006). It is in this light important to distinguishbetween changes in tradition, rituals and ritual variation. As I have suggested,it seems that there is an intentional reinvention of tradition at Myklebostad,which had an explicit, political, ideological, and religious reason andpre-conceived outcome. In the conquest of Norway, which ended with the formationof a unified kingdom, the past was a source giving religious and politicallegitimacy to opposition and resistance, and the evidence for this can be tracedin the actual funerals. However, there is a lot of contemporary, ritualvariation, and an archaeological challenge remains how to distinguish betweensynchronic variation and diachronic change. The Myklebostad complex is,nevertheless, such an empirical case study, which enables one to analyse andpropose suggestions with regard to why ritual change took place.Concluding remarksThe burnt Viking ship at Myklebostad in western Norway is a unique example of afuneral which breaks both with tradition, and at the same time reinventstradition. The death of high-profile individuals provides a political andreligious platform, which was arguably more important for the living than thedead. Funerals were events where the descendants could legitimise futurehierarchies by transforming the deceased’s social and ritual status and power tothemselves (Oestigaard & Goldhahn 2006). Funeral rituals were a part ofpolitical strategies interwoven and legitimised by religion giving thesuccessors divine power and authenticity. The dead were a means and used asmediums for other social and religious purposes, thus combining socialstrategies, political ambitions, and religious beliefs. In this process ritualswere composed, changed, and reinvented creating the preferred and ideologicalplatform necessary for social change and re-establishing hierarchies. Thischange was within an overall religious framework, which one may call a ‘deathmyth’ prescribing and legitimising what was allowed to be done. Within thisritual sphere it seems that almost every kind of new invention was possible, solong as it was conducted by the right person and rooted in a real or imaginedtradition. In particular, such a situation as the unification of Norway and theconcomitant Christianisation would have necessitated the ritual mobilisationthat occurred.AcknowledgementsI would like to thank Ragnar Børsheim for discussions of the Myklebostad complexand for giving me permission to use his illustrations.

This paper focuses on the transitional periodof the 9th to the 11th centuries in England, when distinctively Christian burialrites emerged that placed a new emphasis on the treatment of the corpse and thestructure of the grave. Recent interpretations have emphasised economic andpolitical factors in prompting the demise of the furnished inhumation rite. Incontrast, it is argued here that Christian eschatology played a central role inshifting emphasis to maintaining the material continuity of the body, to allowits literal resurrection at Judgement Day. Christian burial rites of this periodexhibit three broad tendencies: the marking of graves with distinct materials,the containment of the body, and the dressing of religious corpses. It isproposed that these traits relate to Christian beliefs about the bodilyresurrection, the embodied experience of the afterlife, and the perceivedreality of corporeal transformation in death. Investigation of funerary rites atthe junctures of the boundaries between Early and later Medieval Periods alsoreveals long-term continuities and the reworking of older traditions, such asthe placement of amulets with the dead.Keywords: amulets, body, Christian eschatology, conversion, England,resurrection, transformation.Introduction: material continuity and the Medieval bodyThe Medieval Period witnessed stark changes in death rituals: the practice ofcremation ceased and the rite of furnished inhumation declined dramatically.However, comprehensive evaluation of this major transition has been lacking,perhaps prevented by the rigid periodisation of the discipline of Medievalarchaeology into early and later phases. The resulting tendency is for laterMedieval archaeologists to chronicle subtle variations in established modes ofChristian burial (11th–15th centuries CE), while their Early Medieval colleaguesexplore more diverse pagan funerary customs as expressions of social identitiesin life (5th–8th centuries CE). The most significant watersheds occur at thejunctures and limits of these period boundaries, when distinctively Christianburial rites developed from the 8th–11th centuries, and much later, whenMedieval Catholic rites were reinterpreted by the Protestant Reformation in the16th century (Gilchrist 2003).Traditionally, Early Medieval burials were studied in terms of race andreligion, with patterns in grave goods used as indices of migration andconversion. Over the past three decades, in contrast, Early Medievalarchaeologists have emphasised more symbolic and ideological elements inmortuary ritual (Williams 2005: 195). In particular, they have interpreted thedemise of the furnished burial rite as being linked to economic and politicalfactors, rather than stemming from any intrinsic connection to Christian belief(Hadley 2001: 92–93). To the contrary, I will argue that Christian eschatologyplayed a central role in redefining the meaning of the grave and the treatmentof the corpse. Of primary importance was the Christian premise of the materialcontinuity of the body for its resurrection at Judgement Day.I will focus particularly on the transitional period of the 9th to the 11thcenturies in England, when distinctively Christian burial rites emerged thatplaced a new emphasis on the corpse and the structure of the grave. Theseinnovations continued to be used in later Medieval churchyards and monasticcemeteries from the 11th century up to at least c. 1300. Many of these riteswere prevalent across western and northern Europe, with the precise chronologyand diversity of practice varying in each locality according to the dates ofChristianisation. My interpretative approach uses mortuary evidence to explorechanging beliefs about the body in life and death, drawing on the premise thatburials actively represent social theories of the body (after Joyce 1998;Lacquer 1990). My reassertion of the centrality of religious belief to themeaning of Medieval graves is consistent with a wider movement in interpretativearchaeology that calls for the reintegration of ritual with other aspects ofsocial life (Brück 1999; Insoll 2004; Bradley 2005).To many today, the belief in bodily resurrection seems entirely implausible. DidMedieval people truly accept that at the end of time God would reassemble theirfragmented remains, granting eternal life to these reanimated bones? Thehistorian Caroline Bynum has traced the doctrine of bodily resurrection from itsdevelopment between the 2nd and the 5th centuries up to its formalisation in thelater Middle Ages. Theological treatises leave little doubt that Medieval beliefwas deeply material (Bynum 1991; 1995). Theologians debated the smallest detailsof the embodied afterlife: What age and sex would the resurrected be? Would theywear clothes? Would they smell, eat or taste? These concerns are expressed, forexample, by the 10th-century English homilist Ælfric of Eynsham (c. 955–1010):‘Each person yet shall have his own height in the size that he was before as aperson, or that he should have had, had he become fully-grown, those thatdeparted in childhood or adolescence’ (quoted in Thompson 2002: 237). In 1215,the doctrine was confirmed by the 4th Lateran Council: ‘all rise again withtheir own individual bodies, that is, the bodies which they now wear’ (Bynum1991: 240).The doctrine of purgatory was also formalised by the 4th Lateran Council in1215, with the Medieval concept evolving from much earlier roots. The centraltenet of purification in the afterlife is based in Judaism, while the idea thatsins should be expurgated by trial emerged as early as the 3rd or 4th century.The Medieval construction of purgatory also drew upon classical traditions ofthe otherworld and European folkloric associations of fire with rejuvenation andrebirth (Le Goff 1984: 1–14). Purgatory was not conceived as a distinct physicalspace until the 12th century, but the premise was long established of apreliminary stage of the afterlife in which sins were cleansed. Did Medievalpeople perceive a material connection between the corpse in the grave and thesoul that was physically purged in the afterlife? In his classic study ofMedieval purgatory, Jacques Le Goff dismisses this question as unproblematic:‘Once separated from the body, the soul was endowed with a materiality suigeneris, and punishment could then be inflicted upon it in Purgatory as thoughit were corporeal’ (Le Goff 1984: 6). In contrast, Bynum identifies the questionof bodily continuity as a persistent challenge for Medieval theologians, whopondered how personal identity could endure the ravages of death and decay andthe miraculous resurrection of the body (Bynum 1991: 254). But to what extentdid these theological tenets permeate popular practice? Archaeological evidencefor Medieval funerary rites provides additional insight to social theories ofthe body, and in particular, to changing concerns over the integrity of theChristian body in death.Anglo-Saxon burial rites in transitionRecent interpretations of the richly furnished Anglo-Saxon burials of the 5th to7th centuries have assessed them as ‘theatrical tableaux’. The setting of thecorpse was staged as a funerary performance for the living to express theirsocial memory of the dead. Spectacular burials such as Sutton Hoo (Suffolk) orPrittlewell (Essex) have been compared by Martin Carver to ‘a theatre, in whicheach burial is a composition, offering, with greater or lesser authority, ametaphor for its age’ (Carver 1998: 139). It is commonly argued that lesserburials in Anglo-Saxon cemeteries were also laid out with the emphasis on theviewing of the tableau, with weapons, jewellery, and other grave furnishingsselected and arranged to display the identity of the deceased during life (Geake2003: 260; Devlin 2007: 33). There was broad consistency within the Germanicburial tradition that was shared by the Franks, Burgundians, Alamans, Bavarians,Saxons and Anglo-Saxons: jewellery, amulets, and chatelaines accompanied femaleburials; and weapons, tools, and horse-equipment were provided for men; bothsexes were associated with knives, buckles, coins, and food vessels andofferings (Marzinzik 2000: 149).From the 8th century onwards, only the most modest artefacts were deposited ingraves, items such as beads, rings, coins, small knives, and dress fasteners,perhaps reflecting the continued practice of clothed burial (Hadley 2001: 96).As grave furnishings declined in importance, greater significance was placed onthe location of the interment. Seventh and 8th century rites included burial inbarrows and on the boundaries of ancestral territories. Radiocarbon dating hasconfirmed that some 8th century cemeteries remained independent of churches andmaintained the traditional use of grave goods to at least some degree. There wasa gradual shift toward row-cemeteries on sites that were either associated withchurches or pre-dated their development on the same site, such asBarrow-upon-Humber (Lincolnshire) (Hadley 2002: 221); churchyard burial seems tohave been the usual practice by the 10th century (Hadley & Buckberry 2005:125–26).The impact of the Christian conversion is usually assessed with reference to thedisappearance of grave goods, but there is no evidence that the early church waseither prescriptive or consistent in its views on burial practice. Numerousearly churchyards have yielded graves containing single artefacts such as coins,combs, bracelets, and knives (Morris 1983: 50, 60–61). While most categories ofgrave good declined in variety and occurrence, one type actually increasedduring this transitional period. The range and frequency of amulets expanded toinclude fossils, the teeth of wild animals (such as boar and beaver), antiqueRoman coins, and waist bags, which may have held herbal charms or even Christianrelics (Geake 1997; Meaney 1981). These amulets were almost exclusive to thegraves of women and perhaps reflect the role of women as religious or funeraryspecialists (Geake 2003). Throughout Early Medieval Europe, the association isrepeated of amulets with the graves of women and children. Their frequencyincreases during the conversion period in respective regions, for example in thelater 10th century in Denmark (Zeiten 1997: 45). John Blair has proposed thatthis use of amulets may have been consistent with Christian practice andintegral to the mortuary display of religious affiliation by newly convertedwomen (Blair 2005: 174). Others have argued precisely the opposite: that theincreased use of amulets indicates resistance to Christianity, even that thedistinctive change in amulet use may represent the development of paganism as amore cohesive and political theology (Zeiten 1997: 49; Geake 1997: 98). Therelationship between Christianity and amulets may be clarified with reference toboth earlier and later practice, and I will return to discuss the meaning oftheir occurrence in later Medieval graves.Christian burial rites: marking, containing and dressing the bodyA range of Christian mortuary practices had emerged by the 9th century thatfocused more closely on the corpse and its framing within the grave. Some ofthese were variations on the furnished burial rite, but greater emphasis was nowplaced on the cadaver itself. Three themes can be identified among the diverserange of rites that are evidenced in urban, rural and ecclesiastical sites ofthe period.1. The marking of graves with distinct materialsGrave constructions were used to distinguish the corpse from the surroundingsoil, making it both visually and physically discrete (Thompson 2002: 231).These included grave linings of stone and tile, the framing of the head and bodywith stones, and the addition of distinctive materials to the grave. Thepractice of elaborating the grave with stones is well illustrated by excavationsat the 9th to 12th century church of Raunds (Northamptonshire). Stones wererepresented in approximately half of the excavated graves: they occurred singlyor in clusters, lining the entire grave or placed more strategically, under thehead or either side of it, along the body, or at the feet (Boddington 1996:38–42). A similar pattern is repeated at Worcester Cathedral (Worcestershire),where a late Saxon cemetery sealed by the Norman chapter house contained 180interments of men, women and children (Fig. 13.1). Stones were used to markapproximately 30% of burials, associated particularly with the head: as‘earmuffs’ to support the head on either side, or as ‘pillow stones’ placedbeneath the head (Guy 2010). In the Worcester cemetery, stones were sometimesused in conjunction with coffins. Stone and tile grave linings continued intothe later Middle Ages, but the use of ‘ear-muff’ stones became less common afterthe 11th century (Gilchrist and Sloane 2005: 138).The addition of charcoal to graves is well attested and linked especially withreligious settlements of the 9th–12th centuries, where it is often interpretedas a penitential rite (Thompson 2004: 118–22). But foreign substances such asclay, chalk and lime were also used to line graves, mixed with grave soils orused to pack coffins. For example, at the parish church of Barton-on-Humber(Lincolnshire), two distinct groups of 37 burials (dated c. 950–1150) had liquidmud poured into the coffins (Rodwell 2007: 26). The use of visually distinctivebase linings continued into the later Middle Ages, with chalk, mortar, andplaster commonly used to create plain white floors for graves, and morelocalised traditions of using crushed or chipped stone, sand and gravel(Gilchrist & Sloane 2005: 142–44)Victoria Thompson (2002: 240) has argued that this range of mortuary innovationsaimed to provide a ‘clean burial’, both spiritually and materially, to displayhumility and to protect the body from decay. The concept of the cemetery assacred space was fully developed by the 10th century (Gittos 2002), resulting insignificant pressure to reuse burial space within consecrated churchyards.Demarcation of the grave may also have protected it from disturbance bysubsequent grave-digging. At the 10th century church of St Mark’s, Lincoln,attempts to minimise disturbance involved the use of flat and upright gravemarkers, stone slabs, and wooden markers held in post-holes, all used alongsidetimber coffins and stone cists (Gilmour & Stocker 1986). At Barton-on-Humberthere is clear evidence that efforts were made to carefully remove and translateburials when the church was rebuilt. A group of 29 early burials at Barton weremeticulously exhumed and removed before the erection of the late Saxon church(Rodwell 2007: 30). At Addingham (West Yorkshire), which fell out of use by the11th or 12th century, bodies were deliberately exhumed from the western part ofthe cemetery for re-interment within new graves in the eastern cemetery: thedisinterred remains were placed neatly in a pile at one end of the new grave(Adams 1996: 186).[../images/fig13_1.jpg]Fig. 13.1. Plan of late Saxon burials excavated within the chapter house atWorcester Cathedral; stones were used in c. 30% of graves (shown shaded) (planby Christopher Guy, Worcester Cathedral Archaeologist; reproduced with the kindpermission of the Dean and Chapter of Worcester Cathedral).Occasionally, we recover discrete, secondary inhumations of translated remains.‘Translated’ burials are the disarticulated bones of a single individual thathave been repackaged for reburial. Translated remains at Raunds were inhumed insacks or pits (Boddington 1996: 28–29), while later Medieval practice favouredthe use of chests or caskets (Gilchrist & Sloane 2005: 116–17). For example, asmall wooden casket excavated from St Oswald’s, Gloucester, contained the neatlypacked bones of an adult male, including the tiny bones of the hands and feet(Heighway & Bryant 1999: 205–6).2. Containment of the bodyWithin the grave, the corpse was enveloped by a winding sheet or enclosed withina coffin. The white linen shroud indicated that the Christian body had beenshriven, denoting a ‘good death’ that followed the deathbed rites of confession,communion and the sacrament of extreme unction (Woolgar 2006: 50). The whiteshroud was symbolic of spiritual purity: St Cuthbert of Lindisfarne (d. 687)ordered that he should be buried only in a precious white cloth (although hismonastic community actually buried him in rich vestments and with grave goods ofa golden pectoral cross, a gold chalice, an ivory comb, scissors and a book ofGospels (Bonner et al. 1989). White shrouds may have been in regular use by the11th century, as suggested by the depiction of the funeral of Edward theConfessor on the Bayeux Tapestry (Hadley & Buckberry 2005: 123). The late Saxoncemetery at Worcester Cathedral produced nine fragments of woolen textile thatmay be remnants of shrouds; however, these examples derive from coffined burialsand could alternatively represent clothing (Guy 2010).The common use of coffins can be demonstrated at sites where water-loggedconditions have facilitated their survival. At Barton-on-Humber, radiocarbon anddendrochronology dates have confirmed that use of timber coffins was the norm bythe 10th century. These were oak coffins, lightly-constructed with few nails ormetal components, and occasionally incorporating bases woven from wattles(Rodwell 2007: 29, 22). At Worcester Cathedral, late Saxon timber coffinssurvived due to the very dry conditions beneath the chapter house: 106 coffinswere identified in association with 180 burials (Guy 2010). The difficulties indetecting coffins archaeologically may have led to under-estimates of their use,particularly if wooden dowels rather than iron nails were typically used forfastening. The incidence of coffin use at later Medieval monastic cemeteries hasbeen estimated to range from between 4% and 34% (Gilchrist & Sloane 2005).However, the 60% rate of coffin use at late Saxon Worcester Cathedral may callthis estimate into question.Other receptacles were sometimes employed to contain the corpse for burial.Occasionally domestic chests were used, complete with locks and hinges, apractice known in Scandinavia in the 10th century, and occurring in England fromthe 8th up to the 12th century (Fig. 13.2). Four chest-burials from York Minsterwere dated to the 9th or 10th centuries, so close together that they wereintercutting: they contained one elderly male, a middle-aged female, a youngadult male, and an adolescent of unknown sex (Kjølbye-Biddle 1995: 517). Theclose proximity of the chests suggests that these individuals may have formed adistinctive social group in life. Other chest-burials are known principally fromthe north of England, including Repton (Derbyshire), Ripon (Yorkshire),Flixborough (Lincolnshire), Partney (Lincolnshire) and Fishergate (York), butisolated examples have also been recorded from Winchester and Hereford(Kjølbye-Biddle 1995: 517; Hall & Whyman 1996: 113). This practice appears tohave been reserved for burials occurring within a discrete area of a monastic orcathedral cemetery, and the rite perhaps denoted a particular religious status.The latest dated example is the burial of a ‘possible’ male in a locked chest orcoffin at the hospital of Partney (Lincolnshire), radiocarbon dated AD 1080–1160(Atkins & Shepherd Popescu 2010).[../images/fig13_2.jpg]Fig. 13.2. Locks and straps from timber chests used for burial at the monasticcemetery of Ailcy Hill, Ripon, North Yorkshire, c. 7th–10th century (reproducedwith the kind permission of York Archaeological Trust from Hall & Whyman 1996,107: fig. 25).[../images/fig13_3.jpg]Fig. 13.3. A barrel padlock and key were placed between the knees of a youngadult female buried in a coffin at Worcester Cathedral (photograph byChristopher Guy, Worcester Cathedral Archaeologist; reproduced with kindpermission of the Dean and Chapter of Worcester Cathedral).The chest-burials seem to convey a deliberate symbolism of locks andcontainment. The locking metaphor may also be pertinent to barrel padlocks,which were occasionally deposited deliberately with Medieval burials. They werefirst used as grave goods during the conversion period: of six known examplesdating from the late 7th to 8th centuries, five occurred with women (Geake 1997:82). A young adult female from the late Saxon cemetery at Worcester Cathedralwas interred in a coffin with a barrel padlock placed between her knees (Fig.13.3). Analysis of the padlock showed that it was locked and intact, with thekey in place; remains of pupa cases were incorporated in the corrosion crust ofthe lock, confirming that the object was in contact with the corpse duringdecomposition (Guy 2010). In later Medieval contexts, padlocks were alsoassociated principally with women. Two 11th century padlocks from graves inHereford retained textile impressions, confirming that they were containedwithin the shroud: the padlocks were placed on the respective pelvic areas of anadolescent and an adult female. Two later Medieval examples from the Cistercianmonastery of St Mary Graces in London (1350–1538) were also associated withwomen, one adjacent to the pelvic area (Gilchrist & Sloane 2005: 178). Thegender correlation is uncertain in some cases: a barrel padlock recovered fromthe chapter house of Benedictine Sandwell Priory (Staffordshire; dated1250–1450) was deposited with an adult of unknown sex (Hodder 1991: 91).The social context of the chest and padlock burials suggests that thisparticular treatment may represent some distinct religious status, rather than ageneral effort to contain and protect the body, or even to imprison the‘dangerous’ dead. The position of the padlocks in association with the pelvicregion may indicate the signaling of chastity, the sexual purity of the body.Virginal bodies were believed to remain incorrupt in death, as indicated bycontemporary hagiography (Thompson 2002: 235–36). The symbolism of chests andlocks may have been used to represent the integrity of the virginal body, whilebarrel padlocks seem to have been reserved especially for deposition with thefemale corpse. Incorruptibility of the body after burial was regarded as thedefinitive miracle for proving sanctity, particularly in the case of femalesaints (Bynum 1991: 266).3. Dressing religious corpsesChristian burials show an increased emphasis on the marking and containment ofthe body, and small numbers of associated artefacts imply that the practice ofclothed burial continued to some extent. But the use of grave goods and funerarycostume was deliberately enhanced for one category of the Christian dead:religious personnel were given special treatment to denote the consecratedstatus of their bodies. Bishops, abbots, and priests were accompanied byreligious grave goods that signaled their ranking in the ecclesiasticalhierarchy: mortuary crosses and plaques, crosiers, and the chalice and patenthat were symbolic of the office of the priest (Gilchrist & Sloane 2005).Perhaps most significantly, religious corpses were fully dressed in theirmonastic habits or consecration robes. This clothing did not merely representthe identity or status of the deceased, it was perceived to protect the physicalbody of the corpse in purgatory.This belief is vividly expressed in the story of a lay-brother of the Cistercianmonastery of Stratford Langthorne (Essex), recounted in Peter of Cornwall’sLiber revelationum of 1200–6 (Holdsworth 1962: 196–97; Woolgar 2006: 180). Thisparticular lay-brother had demonstrated some uncertainty in his vocation: on oneoccasion he fled the abbey to resume his secular life as a shepherd, only toreturn subsequently to his calling. He was allowed re-entry to the abbey, but aspunishment the lay-brother was permitted to wear only the black tunic thatrepresented his position, and not the customary black hood. When the lay-brothereventually died he was buried in his tunic, but without the hood. Both the abbotand the prior of Stratford Langthorne reported oneiric visions of the deadlay-brother, who told them that he needed his full habit in order for his soulto be saved. The apparition was singed and scarred because he had lacked theprotection of the lay-brothers’ hood during the purgation of his sins. His hair,head and shoulders had been burnt by drips of burning pitch, sulphur and leadfrom a cauldron that the lay-brother had passed under during his judgement. Theimpact of the vision was immediate: the next day the monks exhumed thelay-brother’s body and redressed it in the full habit. The symbolism of thelay-brother’s hood is consistent with the metaphoric use of clothing in oneiricliterature. In his study of Medieval ghost stories, Jean-Claude Schmittemphasises the dual role of clothing to represent the identity of the deceasedand to convey the fate of their soul in the afterlife; clothing also provides aconcrete medium through which exchanges are made between the worlds of theMedieval living and the dead (Schmitt 1998: 201–5). The significance of the capeor hood is a recurring theme particularly of monastic apparitions and ghoststories. Schmitt connects this motif with folkloric attributions of the hoodproviding supernatural protection in the afterlife; in common with traditionalgrave goods, the monastic hood was perceived to hold amuletic properties.The monastic cemetery of Stratford Langthorne has been partially excavated,providing an opportunity to examine the actual burial practices among thecommunity associated with the lay-brother of the vision recounted by Peter ofCornwall. The cemetery to the northeast of the church was excavated by Museum ofLondon Archaeology and 651 burials were recovered (Barber et al. 2004) (Fig.13.4). These were predominantly male and are likely to represent the graves ofthe monastic community: only eleven burials were associated with dressaccessories, and two corpses were interred with medical poultice discs that wereused to promote healing of leg injuries (Fig. 13.5). The absence of preservedtextiles at the site prevents full understanding of burial rites that may haveinvolved monastic dress. However, the poultice discs are indicative of a broaderpractice of inhuming Medieval corpses with therapeutic devices such as metalplates and supports, crutches, and even hernia trusses (Gilchrist & Sloane 2005:103–5).The lay-brother’s tale underlines the emphatic materiality of Medieval beliefssurrounding the dead: the condition of the corpse in the grave was consonantwith that of the soul in purgatory (Bynum 1995: 206). Through preparation anddressing of the dead body for the grave, the living were empowered to assist theprogress of the soul through purgatory.Transforming the body in deathVictoria Thompson (2002: 232) has interpreted these new modes of burial asincreasingly elaborate means of controlling and confining the Christian body.But what prompted these innovations in funerary rites? The belief in bodilyresurrection must have heightened anxieties surrounding the decay andfragmentation of the corpse. Efforts to mark, contain and protect the cadaver inthe grave may be interpreted as strategies to preserve continuity of the bodyfor its resurrection. Further efforts were sometimes made to transform the body,as if to heal or enhance its physical form in anticipation of it rising again.[../images/fig13_4.jpg]Fig. 13.4. Typical earthen graves from the north-east cemetery at the Cistercianabbey of St Mary Stratford Langthorne, Essex (reproduced with kind permission ofMuseum of London Archaeology).[../images/fig13_5.jpg]Fig. 13.5. Copper alloy plate (medical poultice disc) from the burial of a manat the Cistercian abbey of St Mary Stratford Langthorne, Essex (diam. 58 mm)(reproduced with kind permission of Museum of London Archaeology).In addition to the medical items that were left adhering to corpses, aconsiderable number of amulets were placed with the Medieval dead (Gilchrist2008). The ancient practice of placing apotropaic objects in graves reached apeak during the conversion period, and continued right up to the 15th century.Many of the same artefact types and natural materials were selected fordeposition with conversion period and later Medieval corpses: fossils, animalteeth, white stones, antique coins, rings and bracelets, and single beads. Forexample, boar tusks were included in adult graves at the monastic sites ofWearmouth (county Durham) and St Oswald’s, Gloucester (Cramp 2005: 80). Theexample at St Oswald’s dates to the 11th century: the tusk was placed near theright shoulder of a female who was buried in a charred coffin (Heighway & Bryant1999: 202, 214) (Fig. 13.6). At Barton-on-Humber, the coffined burial of a3-year old child contained an amulet fashioned from a worn pig canine; the datebracket of the grave spanned the 10th–13th centuries (Waldron 2007: 158). Boartusks were used as amulets in Early Medieval graves (Meaney 1981: 131) and arealso well known from prehistoric burial contexts. Tusks may have been retainedinitially as hunting trophies, but some appear to have been handed down asheirlooms: for example, a radiocarbon-dated tusk from the Bronze Age barrow atIrthlingborough (Cambridgeshire) was hundreds of years old when it was deposited(Woodward et al. 2005: 45). We may postulate a common tradition of ‘curating’selected objects such as boar tusks for amuletic use, a practice that wasfamiliar to many prehistoric and historic communities across Europe. Thedeposition of ancient, fragmented and worn items in graves suggests that theresulting heirlooms were occasionally placed with the dead for apotropaicmotives (Woodward 2002).While Early Medieval amulet use was almost exclusively associated with femalegraves, amulets in later Medieval burials were also linked with those of infantsand children. Some limited correlation can also be demonstrated for theplacement of amulets with inhumations of physically disabled individuals,particularly those with impaired mobility (Gilchrist 2008). Perhaps amulets wereintended to transform the immature or disabled body: was special assistancegiven to those deemed too young or impaired to rise at Doomsday? If thisinterpretation seems far-fetched, we should return to the contemporarycommentary offered by Ælfric of Eynsham: ‘Nor shall the holy ones who are toenter heaven have any blemish or ill-health, or be one-eyed, although he waslame in his life, but his limbs shall be all sound to him, in shiningbrightness, and tangible in his spiritual body’ (quoted in Thompson 2002: 237).[../images/fig13_6.jpg]Fig. 13.6. Burial 383 from St Oswald, Gloucester, displays many of the lateSaxon mortuary rites discussed in the text. This 11th century burial of a womanwas placed in a nailed timber coffin on a thick layer of oak charcoal. Twostones were placed within the coffin to support the head, and to the right ofthe shoulder was placed a very large, left canine tusk of wild boar (Sus scrofa)(Heighway & Bryant 1999: 202, 214) (drawing by Wayne Loughlin, reproduced withthe kind permission of Carolyn Heighway).The increased use of amulets during the conversion period has been interpretedpreviously as evidence of deliberate pagan resistance to Christianity (Geake1997: 98; Zeiten 1997: 49). To the contrary, I would argue that the tradition ofamulet use was adopted and developed as a Christian strategy to transform thebody in readiness for the resurrection. The general concept of corporealtransformation is entirely consistent with Christian rites: during the mass, theconsecrated materials of the wafer and wine were believed to transformmiraculously into the body and blood of Christ. These same apotropaic materialsaccompanied the burials of priests, contained in the chalice and paten that wereplaced with the priest’s corpse, to protect his soul on its journey throughpurgatory.Concluding remarks: the materiality of the Christian afterlifeFor the past three decades, the study of Early Medieval burial practice has beendominated by questions of social identity: how furnished burials wereconstructed to convey aspects of an individual’s identity during life. Withnoteworthy exceptions (Marzinzik 2000; Effros 2002; Thompson 2002, 2004;Crawford 2004; Blair 2005; Hadley 2009), even burials of the transitional andEarly Christian Periods have been discussed in terms of lifetime identity,neglecting the potential impact of Christian eschatology on burial rites. Theemerging funerary practices of the 9th–11th centuries reveal the fundamentalsignificance and shared comprehension of three Christian beliefs about theafterlife: bodily resurrection, continuity of embodied experience, and thereality of corporeal transformation in death. But alongside these new tenets,some long-held traditions persisted. Investigation of funerary rites at thejunctures between the Early and later Medieval Period boundaries reveals theextent of this syncretism. Consideration of longer-term trends also promotes therecognition of important continuities and the reworking of older traditions,such as the placement of amulets with the dead.Widespread acceptance of the belief in the resurrection seems to have promptedefforts to preserve the integrity of the body in the grave. This was expressedby marking of the grave through the use of linings, stones, and visuallydistinctive materials, that both created a symbolic boundary for the burial andhelped to protect it from subsequent disturbance in consecrated cemeteries thatwere subject to regular reuse. Some human remains were ‘curated’ by theChristian community, including the careful exhumation of graves that were to bedisturbed by new buildings, and the translation of disinterred bones forreburial. The corpse was contained in a shroud or coffin as a practicalintervention to impede decay, while serving simultaneously as an act of ritualenclosure or containment of the cadaver. More unusual rites seem to haverepresented the symbolic integrity of the body, with the use of locking chestsand barrel padlocks for some members of religious communities, perhaps to conveythe incorruptibility of the chaste Christian body (and particularly that of thepious female cadaver). This example emphasises that the meaning of Christiangrave goods can be highly nuanced, with ordinary domestic chests and padlocksholding the potential to convey aspects of gendered embodiment in specificcontexts.From the 11th and 12th centuries, the developing concept of purgatory heightenedanxiety surrounding the continuity of the body: the progress of the soul injudgement was directly affected by the condition of the corpse in the grave(Bynum 1995). The tale of the lay-brother of Stratford Langthorne confirms thepopular perception that items of dress could provide amuletic protection on thesoul’s journey, while the distinctive garb of religious personnel could hastentheir salvation. The experience of the dead in purgatory was embodied andsensory, and the living could alleviate their suffering by undertaking theappropriate preparations of the corpse and the grave.Finally, the Christian belief in corporeal transformation impacted on burialrites. The transformation and resurrection of Christ’s body represented thesalvation of humanity, through its transubstantiation during the sacrament ofthe mass, and through its resurrection at the Sepulchre. The transformativematerials of the mass were deposited in priests’ burials, with the sacrificialwine held in the chalice and the Eucharistic wafer placed on the paten; thesewere symbolic of the priest’s office and offered powerful protection on thejourney through purgatory (Gilchrist 2009). Amulets and medical devices weresometimes placed with the most vulnerable of the dead: those perceived torequire special assistance in achieving the transformation from withered bonesto ‘shining brightness’, to rise from their graves whole.Current scholarship characterises Medieval Christian funerary practices in sharpopposition to those of the preceding Anglo-Saxons. ‘Theatrical tableaux’ ofpagan corpses were replaced by Christian rites that emphasised the integrity andcontinuity of the physical body. Motives of display, and celebration of theindividual in life, were transplanted by themes of transformation for benefit inthe afterlife. But perhaps some continuities can be discerned, some elements ofpagan belief that were selected and developed for incorporation into Christianfunerary practice? Many of the objects deposited in Anglo-Saxon furnishedburials were used in the protection or modification of the body, includingweapons, grooming implements and amulets (Devlin 2007: 33). Howard Williams(2006) has argued that the lavishly staged funerary tableaux represent thetransformation of the Anglo-Saxon dead, emphasising the emotive force of grief,rather than the static display of their identity in life.The theme of corporeal transformation was further elaborated by the processes ofsyncretism that connected Medieval pagan and Christian funerary rites. Themateriality of death was developed in relation to the emerging tenets ofpurgatory and the bodily resurrection: judgement and the afterlife were imaginedas fully embodied, introducing an imperative to protect the integrity of thedead body. The perceived continuity between the corpse in the grave and the soulin the afterlife sustained the centrality of the mortuary sphere to social life.Christian burial rites continued to channel the emotive force of grief, in anepoch when humble shrouds and modest coffins were the most efficacious giftsfrom the living to the dead.1Note1 The manuscript for this article was submitted in July 2008.

Inhistorical periods, we have written discourse, too. Belief discourses and ritualpractices surrounding the dead human body in the period from the Reformation tothe 19th century related to each other in particularly complex ways.Theologically, Protestant eschatology suggests that place and manner of burialdo not matter, but in practice it did. This is most evident in attitudes todeviants – criminals and suicides, where irregular burial and interventions inthe body were used as social and legal sanction. Scientific humanism alsodeveloped an empirical and medicalised discourse of the body over this period.The incompatibility between a theology which stressed the meaninglessness of thedead body, and a legal system which specified treatments of the dead body (suchas dissection, or gibbeting) as part of criminal punishment is to some extentclarified by attention to another belief discourse: folk practice. I willconsider two examples of folk practices which were widespread in Early ModernEurope: ‘bier-right’ (Bahr-Recht) and the curative power of the ‘dead hand’.These rituals suggest a belief that power remains in the newly dead body. Thisunwritten, unspoken belief, asserted neither in theological doctrine norscientific humanism, also seems to inform legal and social norms and maycontinue to do so to the present day.Keywords: Belief, body, Britain, death, folk practice, Ireland, legal system,scientific humanism, theology.My concern in this article is with the relationship between ritual and belief:that is, how beliefs and what I have chosen to call here ‘belief discourses’affect people’s ritual practices. As archaeologists, and in common with otherscholars of the human past, we often seek explanation for change in ritualpractices in the beliefs that inform them. As beliefs change, it may beexpected, so too will the ritualised actions which produce and reproduce them insociety. This chapter unpacks that proposition through the consideration of oneexample which suggests that, contrary to expectations, ritual action might havebeen more stable than belief, and that ‘belief’ is a contradictory, multiple andcomplex thing.The particular ritual practices I am concerned with are those surrounding thedead body in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries AD in Britain and Ireland. Thiswas an eventful period in terms of beliefs about the dead. The ProtestantReformation of the mid-16th century should best be understood as a processrather than an event. Part of the process involved the transformation ofrelationships between the living and the dead. The replacement of Catholicismwith Protestant orthodoxy meant that the dead individual no longer went toPurgatory, from whence the prayers and masses of the living could bring abouthis or her early release. Instead the dead person went directly to Judgement,and nothing that the living did could make any difference to the fate of a deadperson’s soul.Theological beliefs, however, are not the only kind of beliefs to affect ritualpractices. Social beliefs, scientific beliefs and folk beliefs, among others,all affect the kinds of ritual that surround the dead body. The remainder ofthis paper considers the operation of some of those kinds of belief.The work discussed in this paper is part of a project funded by the LeverhulmeTrust called ‘Changing Beliefs about the Human Body’. When I began the researchI was thinking that the critical term in that title was ‘body’: now, I thinkthat the most interesting and problematic idea is actually ‘belief’.Addressing problems of the relationship between belief and ritual practice inthe past is problematic for a number of reasons. In particular there are twoproblems involved with dealing with interior experience: first, people do notalways say or do what they really think; and second (even more seriously) wecannot suppose that belief, even inside the head of a single person, is clearand coherent. Rather than belief, in the sense of interior conviction,therefore, this paper considers ‘belief discourse’: the way people ‘talk’,through their words and deeds, about their beliefs.In this paper I will discuss four kinds of belief discourse in relation to thedead body:1. Theological belief2. Social belief3. Scientific belief4. Folk belief/practiceI will briefly summarise the main developments in each tradition of discourse.Theological beliefThe Protestant theology which dominated Britain from the mid-16th centuryonwards was profoundly different to Late Medieval Catholicism in many ways. Thetreatment of the dead was most affected by the disappearance of Purgatory. Butin other ways, ideas about the significance of the dead body were similar toCatholic discussions about the body and the soul. Religious texts of the perioddo not pay much attention to the dead body, but when they do, it is nearlyalways to contrast the repugnant body with the divine and eternal soul. The bodyis thus characterised as only a temporary container for the soul, and itsfleshliness is emphasised.‘Is it not your greatest desire to flitte from this bodie which is but a Booth,a shoppe, or Tabernacle of clay? Is not your Soule wearie to sojourne into sucha reekie Lodge?’ asks Zacharie Boyd (1629: 84).Is not this Body wherein now I dwell,Nought But my Vassall, Casket, House or Shell?Compact of dust and Ashes, things most baseconcludes the Soul in William Prynne’s poem The Soule’s Complaint against theBody published in 1641. Scores of similar examples could easily be piled up.Given a dualistic understanding of human nature where the principal distinctionis between body and soul, the one being temporary and worldly, the other divine,it makes sense to value the soul more highly, and to value the body principallybecause it is the container for the soul, a ‘temple’ is among the more positivemetaphors regularly used. But when the soul leaves the body, it is no longer atemple but a ‘jakes’ [toilet] (Prynne 1641), or even just a ‘dead Carkase’(Sherlock 1690). The dualistic opposition between body and soul was a corebelief of both Catholics and Protestants, but where the dead body was a focus ofprayer for Catholics, Protestant theology downgraded religious funerary ritualto a very brief service, and promoted largely secular commemoration. The corpseitself had minimal importance to the formal and religious part of commemorativeritual but, as we shall see, it continued or even grew in significance insecular mortuary rites.The treatment of the body at death matters not at all to the future fate of thesoul, say Early Modern Protestant theologians, in a rare example of consensus.They do not agree about exactly what our resurrected bodies will be like, butthey all concede that God will be able to reconstitute the bodies of therighteous for resurrection, no matter what kind of funerary rites they havereceived. ‘Vile, or no exequies at all hinder nothing the sepulture of the pooresaints’ wrote Thomas Becon in 1568. Even if evil people, said Oxford preacherThomas Beconsall (1697: 23):tear Infants from the Womb, to sacrifice to Wolves and Tygers; yet after Wit andMalice, and Cruelty have spent themselves, there will still be Materials enoughfor Omnipotence to perfect his own Designs, in a glorious and triumphantResurrection.Social beliefAll the dismissive metaphors used to describe the body by Early ModernProtestant theologians might lead one to predict a decrease in the amount ofcare and attention given to the preparation of the dead body and its disposal.It would also be consistent to expect the abandonment of the crowded churchyardand the hard-to-access underfloor space within the church itself, since thebelief that any part of the ground was more holy than any other, or that burialclose to saints or churches would in any way enhance your prospects ofredemption were seen after the Reformation as Popery of the worst kind.However, the archaeological evidence of Protestant burial in the 16th and 17thcenturies tells a very different story. The amount of care and money spent onthe preparation and disposable of the average dead body if anything increasedafter the Reformation. The use of coffins, which was becoming more common evenbefore the Reformation (Gilchrist & Sloane 2005), became very widespread in thisperiod, even for the burial of people who had died in epidemics, as seems tohave been the case at one 17th century cemetery in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, and inwhat appear to be plague burials in London (Norton et al. 2005; Harding 1993).The ongoing social significance of the dead body is perhaps most evident,however, at the top and at the bottom of the social scale: at the upper end, thedead body as a material object was at the centre of rites that reinforcedrelationships and position in society. The decay of the body was denied throughembalming, the use of lead coffins (Goodall 1970: 155; Fig. 14.1) andwax-impregnated ‘cerecloths’ which delayed or prevented decay by creating ananaerobic wrapper for the body.At Hemingford Grey, in Cambridgeshire, a late 17th century dissenter cemeteryeschewed the conventions of west–east burial – still an almost universal customin Anglican graveyards, but still treated the bodies of the dead with care,dressing them specially for the grave in tailored, lace-up shrouds of thenightdress variety, attested by the presence of copper alloy aglets and numerousshroud pins in the mostly coffined burials (McNichol et al. 2007).The dead body could also be indexical of the person for the representation ofsocial status. At the bottom of the social scale were criminals and suicides,where irregular burial and interventions in the body were used as social andlegal sanction. In the century and a half following the Reformation, suicideswere treated with particular intolerance in Britain. Among other sanctions, theywere denied Christian burial. Instead they were by custom, and by law, buried inthe road – often at a crossroads, with a stake through their body. From thelater 17th century, the social treatment of suicides softened, and their bodieswere increasingly permitted church burial, as local authorities often decidedthat their suicide was driven by mental imbalance and that they could nottherefore be held responsible (MacDonald & Murphy 1990). However, folkloricaccounts of staked burial in the road exist as late as the early twentiethcentury in some parts of England, and the criminal who committed suicide as away of evading execution was still subject to considerable social opprobrium(Fig. 14.2).[../images/fig14_1.jpg]Fig. 14.1. Lead coffin of John Belaysus from a vault at Blandford, Dorset(photograph by Reverend Canon Goodall).[../images/fig14_2.jpg]Fig. 14.2. The body of John Williams being taken for staked burial at CannonStreet crossroads, London, in 1811. Williams was a convicted murderer who killedhimself rather than face judicial execution (The Newgate Calendar,http://www.exclassics.com/newgate/ngbibl.htm[http://www.exclassics.com/newgate/ngbibl.htm]).An other area where attitudes to the body different to those promulgated bychurch leaders is very evident is the treatment of the dead criminal body. Upuntil the mid-19th century the post-mortem fate of the criminal body was oftenpart of their judicial punishment. Moreover, these bodily punishments oftenspecified ways in which the dead body should be treated. Primarily, the corpsesof criminals could be stigmatised by the division or segmentation of the body,by its anatomisation, and by special treatment in the place and/or manner ofburial. The broken bodies dumped in the ditch around Oxford castle (Fig. 14.3)are the remains of criminal bodies that had been subjected to anatomicaldissection (Norton 2006).The presentation of a number of criminal corpses to the anatomists of theColleges, Guilds and Schools was customary in most European countries throughoutthe Early Modern Period. In Britain and Ireland, the practice was givenadditional force in 1751 with the passage of the Act for Better Preventing theHorrid Crime of Murder. This stipulated that after execution the bodies ofmurderers should not be given a normal Christian burial, but either given toanatomists or ‘hung in chains’, a practice also known as gibbeting. Gibbetinginvolved leaving the body hanging in a cage from a tall edifice, tree or aspecially-constructed gibbet, until it fell to pieces and was devoured byanimals and the natural processes of decay. Archaeological evidence of a formergibbet comes from Dunball Island in the mouth of the Avon, where numerous piecesof disarticulated bone were found when the pilings for the Royal Edward Dockswere being sunk (Brett 1996). Eyre Square in Galway City also produceddisarticulated human bone thought to be gibbeting deposits, as well as a numberof crania from just below the city walls, which are likely to be the remains ofheads exhibited on the walls (Lofqvist 2004). All this suggests that peoplecared sufficiently about their bodies for the threat of violation of the bodyafter death to work as a deterrent.[../images/fig14_3.jpg]Fig. 14.3. Remains of an anatomised body buried in the ditch at Oxford Castle(reproduced with the kind permission of Oxford Archaeology).Scientific beliefScientific humanism also developed an empirical and medicalised discourse of thebody over this period. Although the metaphors that came eventually to dominatescientific and medical discourses of the body were those of bodies as machines,the dominant metaphors in the 16th and 17th centuries were geographical – thebody was a country or a world to be explored (Sawday 1995). Geographicalmetaphors also enabled scientific discourses of the body to conform, at lastsuperficially, to another strand of theological discussion about the human body– the idea of the microcosm.The Early Modern body was not the collection of biological facts that it wouldbecome in later centuries. It was an allegory of God, the universe and theworld. In 1615 Helkiah Crooke published his Microcosmographia, a highly detailedand illustrated anatomy of the human body (Fig. 14.4). The eponymous microcosmis the human body itself, frequently used in literary and philosophical texts ofthe period as a conceit for the whole universe.A study of the introductory chapters and dedicatory epistles of anatomytextbooks in the 17th century shows that the ultimate purpose of studyinganatomy as advanced by most of the famous anatomists, was a greater knowledge ofGod. At the start of the 17th century, Anthony Nixon’s anatomy text, called TheDignitie of Man, both in the perfections of his soule and bodie (1612) describesthe practice of anatomy as a meditation upon the divine. The book itself takesthe form of a catechistic set of questions and answers. In answer to thequestion: ‘What commoditie commeth by Anatomy of the body?’ Nixon answers:It puts us in minde of our mortality, and teacheth us that if the providence ofGod bee so wonderful in the composition of the vilest and the earthly partes, Itmust needes follow that it is farre more great, and admirable in the creation ofthe Noble parts, especially of the Soule.Thus, to know the human body was also to know God. Anatomy could, in this way,be justified as a devotional practice.Anatomical dissection was used punitively, as we have seen, but the majority ofsubjects of post-mortem investigation were not criminals. Post-mortem autopsywas often carried out on the bodies of the well-to-do to establish cause ofdeath, essentially as an extension of their medical treatment, or as part of theembalming process.When anatomy was not punitive, efforts were made to repair the body and topresent it in an appropriate form for burial. One individual, for example,buried at Barton-upon-Humber in England in about 1800, had been subject toextensive post-mortem investigation (Rodwell & Rodwell 1982). The top of hisskull had been removed (craniotomy), and all his abdominal and thoracic organs,and his spine were removed. But before burial his body had been restored to anappearance of normality by inserting a length of charred wood to stiffen hisback, in place of a spine, and stuffing the body cavity with straw or moss. Theskull had been glued together and the join concealed by hair.[../images/fig14_4.jpg]Fig. 14.4. Frontispiece of Helkiah Crooke’s Microcosmographia.Later, the ‘unclaimed’ bodies of those who died in institutions were also oftentaken as subjects for anatomists, as were, notoriously, the stolen bodies soldby ‘resurrection men’ – grave robbers. Grave robbing was the focus of greatcultural anxiety, particularly in the 18th and 19th century when demand fordissectable cadavers was at its height (Richardson 1988).The point to make here is to re-iterate that whatever the general wisdom mighthave been when discussing the relative properties of the body and the soul, andthe theologically coherent teaching on the vanity of caring for the body, andthe particular insignificance of the dead body – as a body without a soul,people cared very deeply about what happened to the dead body.There seems to be an incompatibility between theological beliefs about the deadbody which stress its insignificance, scientific beliefs according to which thedead body was valued chiefly for the insights it could provide to thefunctioning of the living one, an interpretation sometimes glossed in devotionalterms, and the social beliefs which subjected the dead body to considerableritual care, and which continued to use place and manner of burial as a way ofconstructing and signalling social position.Folk beliefThe incompatibility between a theology, which stressed the meaninglessness ofthe dead body, and a legal system, which specified treatments of the dead body(such as dissection, or gibbeting) as part of criminal punishment, is to someextent clarified by attention to another belief discourse: folk practice. I willconsider two kinds of folk practice, which were both widespread in Early ModernEurope: the curative power of the ‘dead hand’ and the judicial power of themurdered body, called in German Bahr-Recht (the ‘Law of the Bier’: the Englishword ‘cruentation’ is not widely used). Finally I will consider briefly thesignificance of the dead saintly body among Catholics in the wake of theReformation.The ‘dead hand’There is considerable evidence that people sought out the touch of the dead formedicinal reasons. Most widespread was the belief that the touch of a recentlyhanged man’s hand would cure various medical conditions. Peacock’s (1896) surveyof the significance of executed criminals in folk medicine records the practicethroughout France, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, and parts of Italy,particularly Sicily. Balkutė records the Lithuanian folkloric belief that thehand of a corpse (but not necessarily a hanged one) will cure moles, warts, andsimilar skin conditions. Similar traditions in the regions of Britain arelegion. Wollaston Groome (1895) records the Suffolk belief that the hand of adead man, passed 3 times over the affected part, will cure wens or ‘fleshyexcrescences’. The Stamford Mercury of March 26th 1830 records that two women,one bringing a child, attended the execution of three men at Lincoln in order torub the dead men’s hands over themselves in order to cure diseased parts oftheir bodies. A correspondent of the journal Notes and Queries (ii: 36) said in1850 that execution days in Northampton drew crowds of the afflicted hoping toreceive the ‘death stroke’, and an Oxfordshire woman in 1852 was keen to try thecure for her goitre, because it had apparently worked for her father (Notes andQueries first series vi: 145). In the late 18th century, John Brand (1777: 97)noted a widespread willingness to subject ‘any maculated part to the Touch ofthe Dead’. Even in the early twentieth century the touch of a dead man’s handwas believed effective for curing cancer in Cambridgeshire (Porter 1969: 75),and in the Cambridgeshire fens it was believed that, if woman was able to holdthe hand of a dead man for two minutes, she would not conceive for two years, amost desirable reward for the mothers of large, poor Fenland families in an ageof rudimentary family planning. In North Yorkshire too unspecified diseasescould be cured by the touch of a dead hand (Blakeborough 1898: 201) and inSussex and Northamptonshire a hanged man’s hand would cure a wen or goitre(Sternberg 1851: 116). In County Durham, the hand of a dead child or a suicidewould cure a goitre, and Brockie (1974 [1886]: 221) cites the case of a coalminer’s wife in that county in about 1853 who, on the advice of a wise woman,spent the night in an outhouse where a suicide had been laid out, with the handof the corpse against her neck to cure a wen there.Often the bodies of those who had died a violent death were particularly potent,especially executed criminals. In Thomas Hardy’s short story The Withered Arm(published in 1888 but set in the 1820s) a desperate young woman seeks out thebody of a victim of hanging in the hope that the touch of the young man’s stillwarm neck will cure her own deformity. Even medical men apparently made use ofthe power of the corpse on occasion. According to Napier (1976 [1879]: 92–3),William Harvey, the 17th century physician who first described the circulationof the blood, successfully removed ‘tumours and excrescences’ by the applicationof the hand of one who had recently died of a lingering disease. The curativepower of the hanged body, particularly the hand of an executed criminal, iswell-attested through much of Europe, and known from Early Modern times. In 1584Reginald Scot (1964 [1584]: 210) knew of a belief that the touch of a dead handwould cure cysts, wens, goitres, ulcers and the ‘King’s (or Queen’s) evil’(scrofula), and John Aubrey in 1686 knew of a man whose wen had been cured thatway, as well as a child who had been cured of a hunchback (1881 [1686]: 198). InSomerset, said Aubrey (1696: 97), it was believed that a man’s wen could becured by the touch of a dead woman’s hand, and a woman should use the hand of adead man. He emphatically affirms the ‘Wonderful Effects’ proceeding from thetouch of a dead hand (1696: 97).In Denmark, Germany and Switzerland the blood of decapitated criminals was takenas medicine, even in the nineteenth century (Peacock 1896: 270–1) and ChristianIV of Denmark is alleged to have taken the powdered skulls of criminals as acure for his epilepsy (1896: 270).‘Bahr Recht’The Medieval belief that the body of a murder victim would bleed, if broughtinto the presence of its murderer, was recognised into the 17th and even the18th century. Keith Thomas discusses two cases in 1613 and 1636, in Somerset andLancashire respectively, where a person suspected of murder refused to come intothe presence of the corpse for fear, it was alleged, that the corpse wouldincriminate them in this way (1971: 261). The Somerset man in fact confessed tomurder ten years later, having been pursued by the ghost of his victim (Thomas1971: 714). Holt (1992: 74–76) describes the case of another Somerset man,Robert Sutton, who was murdered around 1729 or 1730. His body was laid out inthe church porch and the local clergy and magistrates stood beside it as all themen in the neighbourhood filed past and each in turn laid a hand upon thecorpse. When a certain Jack White came past he refused to touch the corpse andwas subsequently tried and convicted of Sutton’s murder for which he was hanged,although how dependent his conviction was on the mute testimony of the corpse isnot clear from Holt’s account. A similar story is recorded for Manningford Abbasin Wiltshire (although the source is unreliable): in 1798 Taylor Dyke was robbedand murdered near the Phoenix Inn. The following Sunday the local rector madeeveryone file out of the church past the body of Dyke and each member of thecongregation in turn had to lay a hand on the body and swear their innocence ofhis murder. A man called Amor refused to swear and was subsequently charged andhanged (Wiltshire 1975: 138). The belief in the power of the corpse to accuseits murderer was also known in Scotland. Napier (1976 [1879]: 85) claims to haveheard ‘many instances adduced to prove the truth of bleeding taking place on theintroduction of the murderer’ and asserts that an eleventh-century ballad (whichhe does not name) alludes to the practice, as does another Medieval balladcalled Young Huntin, which must be Child’s (1860) ballad 68, versions B, C andJ. Napier prefers to explain this phenomenon, in which he clearly believespersonally, in terms of Christian belief, acknowledging the Rev. Mr Wodrow’sstatement that such a marvel could be ascribed to ‘the wonderful Providence ofGod’, so that murderers might be found out and His command that ‘thou shalt notsuffer a murderer to live’ be obeyed. The custom was evidently also known inWales. In the late 19th century, according to Jones (1979 [1930]: 34), O. M.Edwards recorded a story in his journal Cymru about a teamsman, who was workingaway from home, when he heard of the death of the young woman he had beencourting. He returned home and encountered the ghost of the young woman who toldhim that she had been seduced and strangled by the man for whom she had beenkeeping house. She asked him to have her grave and her coffin opened and tobring the guilty man into her presence. Then, claimed the ghost, her blood would‘leap to his face’. The young man, however, did not do as she had asked and diedhimself soon afterwards (Cymru 4: 43). Also from Wales comes the belief that thebody could announce its innocence from the grave. A Montgomeryshire man executedfor murder proclaimed that his innocence would be proven by the fact that nograss would grow on his grave (Jones 1979 [1930]: 217).Belief in the judicial reliability of corpses was not confined to poorlyeducated provincial types either. Highly educated and rational men like FrancisBacon and Reginald Scot refer to it, even as they rejected much other folkbelief as superstition (although Bacon (apophthegm 144) does refer to the beliefas a ‘common tradition’ and his own position is not clear). Thomas argues thatthe acceptance of this folk belief was possible because the Neo-Platonicconception of the universe ‘pulsating with many undiscovered occult influences’(1971: 691) accommodated numerous relationships of influence and attraction.Even if they were not (yet) properly understood, those laws would eventuallyprovide a scientific explanation of phenomena which were believed to exist. Itis interesting that where the phenomenon of the bleeding corpse was accepted astrue by the learned middle and upper classes, attempts were made to explainthrough the belief discourses of either religion (Napier’s Rev. Wodrow) orscience (Scot).Perhaps because executed criminals were often healthy and fit young men, theirpowerful bodies seemed to contain more life than the sick, emaciated and oldbodies of those who died natural deaths. This would also explain why the bodiesof victims of drowning were sometimes attributed with similar powers to those ofexecuted criminals. Hallam and Hockey’s useful distinction between vegetablesand vampires is significant here (Hallam & Hockey 2001). Hallam and Hockey usethose terms to distinguish categories of person whose social death does notcoincide with their biological death. Vegetables are those people whose lengthydeclines meant that much of their death processes had happened before theyceased breathing (removal from normal social life into an institution, gradualseparation from the people and roles with which they had been familiar in life);vampires those who, cut off in the midst of life, extended their active andsocial powers further beyond the point of ‘natural’ death. Murder victims,executed criminals and drowned men were all ‘vampires’ by this reckoning.Martyrs and miraclesPeacock’s preferred explanation for the widespread folk belief in the power ofthe criminal corpse, reflecting the vogue for historically deep derivations offolkloric belief in the 19th century, is that the judicially slain take theplace of the pre-Christian sacrifice. Modern folklorists are less willing toaccept very deep time lines, but the 19th-century beliefs logged by Peacock(1896) and her contemporaries were probably nevertheless descended from thetheologically-sanctioned beliefs and practices of Catholic antecedents. Thecurative and apotropaic power of the body parts of exceptional individuals – andit is worth noting that saints had often met with violent and sudden death whilein good health – was controlled by the Church who held the relics. Suffererswould sometimes make long pilgrimages to visit the relics of an appropriatesaint.St Margaret Clitheroe, martyred in 1586 for refusing to plead against theaccusation of harbouring a priest, was canonised only in the 20th century, butbefore that had had her hand preserved and venerated in the Convent of theBlessed Virgin at York, where it was believed to be effective against throatailments (presumably because of her own silence). Similarly the hand of StEdmund Arrowsmith, a Jesuit martyred in 1628 is still kept at St Oswald’sChurch, Ashton in Makerfield. In their collection of Lancashire folklore,Harland and Wilkinson (1882: 158–60) include Arrowsmith’s hand as an example ofsuperstitious folk-belief rather than of Catholic orthodoxy. They supply thedetail that the hand was kept in a chapel at Bryn Hall, which had beendemolished by 1882 and the hand removed to Ashton in a silk bag which wasbrought out to work cures. Both St Margaret Clitheroe and St Edmund Arrowsmithwere among the ‘English martyrs’, who died during or in the aftermath of theReformation, and were among the 40 beatified martyrs who were canonised in 1970.In Catholic Ireland the powerful relic was often a body part (but not always:objects associated with the life or, particularly, the death of the saint alsofrequently have miraculous powers). While some of these belong to ancientsaints, corporeal relics of more recent saints are also widespread. The head ofSt Oliver Plunkett, another of the recently canonised martyrs, was snatched fromthe flames of the pyre in which he was martyred and taken first to Lambspring inGermany and then to Rome. In the early 18th century it was moved to a newconvent in Drogheda, smuggled into Ireland, according to legend, in the top of agrandfather clock (Kilfeather 2002: 232). It is now in St Peter’s churchDrogheda, near Dublin. There would seem to be some inconsistency between saints’relics where their efficacy is related to the particular blessedness of anindividual of extreme virtue, and the powerful body parts of the executedcriminal, where the individual certainly was not a person of great virtue or therecipient of divine favour. The particular curative power of a saint oftenrelated to the part of the saint’s body that was most closely involved withtheir martyrdom. Thus St Bartholemew (who was flayed) was especially good forskin diseases; St Erasmus (disembowelled) for digestive problems and so on. Thenotable association between hanged men and conditions of the neck and throatprobably related to this tradition.The rituals of the dead hand and of bahr-recht suggest a belief that powerremains in the newly dead body. This unwritten, unspoken belief, not asserted ineither theological doctrine or scientific humanism, also seems to inform legaland social norms and may continue to do so to the present day, as is evident inthe legal protection accorded to bodies and body parts.Concluding remarksThe dead body was at the centre of a number of ritual practices. These includedthe burial and commemoration of a social being, as well as a divine soul. Thedead body itself, as a material object and an assemblage of substances, was alsoused in folkloric ritual, for medicinal and divination purposes. All theseritual practices were discussed in terms of belief: not only religiousorthodoxy, but also social and scientific beliefs. However, most of thepractices discussed here were known from the Medieval Period. The Early Modernperiod in Britain witnessed a number of attempts to draw together the beliefs ofreformed religion, modern science and new, sophisticated beliefs about socialand political organisation, with these older, folk practices. Attempts toincorporate the belief in Bahr-Recht into formal judicial process were oneexample of this; another might be the explanation of the appearance of ghosts byappealing to the hierarchy of Heaven (Kirk 1976 [1690/1]), or the new science of‘palingenesie’ (Hibbert 1825), the theory that all living things hold the‘ghost’ of all their future generations inside themselves and that this ghostcan be released through, for example, the application of heat.We might tentatively conclude from the evidence of mortuary practices in EarlyModern Britain and Ireland that ritual practice appears to be more stable thanthe beliefs that ‘explain’ it. ‘Belief’, by contrast turns out to be complex,contradictory and slippery. Rather that providing a foundation for ritualpractice, many belief discourses are drawn upon contextually to provide post hoclegitimation for ritual practices whose worth or efficacy is recognised prior tothe deployment of the new theology, science or philosophy. Rituals, then, seemless mutable than the beliefs that surround them.AcknowledgementsMany thanks to the Leverhulme Trust for funding the research on which this paperis based and to Annia Cherryson for reading a draft version.
