[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"THE WILL TO POWERPREFACE(Nov. 1887-March 1888)1Of what is great one must either be silent or speak with greatness. Withgreatness--that means cynically and with innocence.2What I relate is the history of the next two centuries. I describe what is coming, what can no longer come differently: the advent of nihilism. This history can be related even now; for necessity itself is at work here. This future speaks even now in a hundred signs, this destiny announces itself everywhere; for this music of the future all ears are cocked even now. For some time now, our whole European culture has been moving as toward a catastrophe, with a tortured tension that is growing from decade to decade: restlessly, violently, headlong, like a river that wants to reach the end, that no longer reflects, that is afraid to reflect.3He that speaks here, conversely, has done nothing so far but reflect: a philosopher and solitary by instinct, who has found his advantage in standing aside and outside, in patience, in procrastination, in staying behind; as a spirit of daring and experiment that has already lost its way once in every labyrinth of the future; as a soothsayer-bird spirit who looks back when relating what will come; as the first perfect nihilist of Europe who, however, has even now lived through the whole ofnihilism, to the end, leaving it behind, outside himself.4For one should make no mistake about the meaning of the title that this gospel of the future wants to bear. \"The Will to Power: Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values\"--in this formulation a countermovement finds expression, regarding both principle and task; a movement that in some future will take the place of this perfect nihilism--but presupposes it,logically and psychologically, and certainly can come only after and outof it. For why has the advent of nihilism become necessary? Because the values we have had hitherto thus draw their final consequence; because nihilism represents the ultimate logical conclusion of our great values and ideals--because we must experience nihilism before we can find out what value these \"values\" really had.--We require, sometime, new values.BOOK ONEEUROPEAN NIHILISM1 (1885-1886) Toward an Outline (1844-1900)Friedrich Wilhelm NietzscheBOOK I - EUROPEAN NIHILISMBOOK II - CRITIQUE OF HIGHEST VALUES HITHERTOBOOK III - PRINCIPLES OF A NEW EVALUATIONCONTENTS:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"1. Nihilism stands at the door: whence comes this uncanniest of all guests? Point of departure: it is an error to consider \"social distress\" or \"physiological degeneration\" or, worse, corruption, as the cause of nihilism. Ours is the most decent and compassionate age. Distress, whether of the soul, body, or intellect, cannot of itself givebirth to nihilism (i. e., the radical repudiation of value, meaning, anddesirability). Such distress always permits a variety of interpretations. Rather: it is in one particular interpretation, the Christian-moral one, that nihilism is rooted.2. The end of Christianity--at the hands of its own morality (which cannot be replaced), which turns against the Christian God (the sense oftruthfulness, developed highly by Christianity, is nauseated by the falseness and mendaciousness of all Christian interpretations of the world and of history; rebound from \"God is truth\" to the fanatical faith\"All is false\"; Buddhism of action).3. Skepticism regarding morality is what is decisive. The end of the moral interpretation of the world, which no longer has any sanction after it has tried to escape into some beyond, leads to nihilism. \"Everything lacks meaning\" (the untenability of one interpretation of the world, upon which a tremendous amount of energy has been lavished, awakens the suspicion that all interpretations of the world are false). Buddhistic tendency, yearning for Nothing. (Indian Buddhism is not the culmination of a thoroughly moralistic development; its nihilism is therefore full of morality that is not overcome: existence as punishment, existence construed as error, error thus as a punishment--a moral valuation.) Philosophical attempts to overcome the \"moral God\" (Hegel, pantheism). Overcoming popular ideals: the sage; the saint; the poet. The antagonism of \"true\" and \"beautiful\" and \"good\".4. Against \"meaninglessness\" on the one hand, against moral value judgments on the other: to what extent has all science and philosophy sofar been influenced by moral judgments? and won't this net us the hostility of science? Or an antiscientific mentality? Critique of Spinozism. Residues of Christian value judgments are found everywhere insocialistic and positivistic systems. A critique of Christian morality is still lacking5. The nihilistic consequences of contemporary natural science (togetherwith its attempts to escape into some beyond). The industry of its pursuit eventually leads to self-disintegration, opposition, an antiscientific mentality. Since Copernicus man has been rolling from thecenter toward X.*6. The nihilistic consequences of the ways of thinking in politics and economics, where all \"principles\" are practically histrionic: the air ofmediocrity, wretchedness, dishonesty, etc. Nationalism. Anarchism, etc. Punishment. The redeeming class and human being are lacking--the justifiers.7. The nihilistic consequences of historiography and of the \"practical historians,\" i. e., the romantics. The position of art: its position in the modern world absolutely lacking in originality. Its decline into gloom. Goethe's allegedly Olympian stance.8. Art and the preparation of nihilism: romanticism (the conclusion of Wagner's Nibelungen).I. NIHILISM"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"2 (Spring-Fall 1887)What does nihilism mean? That the highest values devaluate themselves. The aim is lacking; \"why?\" finds no answer.3 (Spring-Fall 1887)Radical nihilism is the conviction of an absolute untenability of existence when it comes to the highest values one recognizes; plus the realization that we lack the least right to posit a beyond or an in-itself of things that might be \"divine\" or morality incarnate.This realization is a consequence of the cultivation of \"truthfulness\"--thus itself a consequence of the faith in morality.4 (June 10, 1887)3What were the advantages of the Christian moral hypothesis?1. It granted man an absolute value, as opposed to his smallness and accidental occurrence in the flux of becoming and passing away.2. It served the advocates of God insofar as it conceded to the world, in spite of suffering and evil, the character of perfection-including \"freedom\": evil appeared full of meaning.3. It posited that man had a knowledge of absolute values and thus adequate knowledge precisely regarding what is most important.4. It prevented man from despising himself as man, from taking sides against life; from despairing of knowledge: it was a means of preservation.In sum: morality was the great antidote against practical and theoretical nihilism.5 (June 10, 1887)But among the forces cultivated by morality was truthfulness: this eventually turned against morality, discovered its teleology, its partial perspective--and now the recognition of this inveterate mendaciousness that one despairs of shedding becomes a stimulant. Now wediscover in ourselves needs implanted by centuries of moral interpretation--needs that now appear to us as needs for untruth; on theother hand, the value for which we endure life seems to hinge on these needs. This antagonism--not to esteem what we know, and not to be allowed any longer to esteem the lies we should like to tell ourselves--results in a process of dissolution.6 (Spring-Fall 1887)This is the antinomy:Insofar as we believe in morality we pass sentence on existence.7 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)The supreme values in whose service man should live, especially when they were very hard on him and exacted a high puce--these social values were erected over man to strengthen their voice, as if they were commands of God, as 'reality,\" as the true\" world, as a hope and future"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"world. Now that the shabby origin of these values is becoming clear, theuniverse seems to have lost value, seems \"meaningless\"--but that is onlya transitional stage.8 (1883-1888)The nihilistic consequence (the belief in valuelessness) as a consequence of moral valuation: everything egoistic has come to disgust us (even though we realize the impossibility of the unegoistic); what isnecessary has come to disgust us (even though we realize the impossibility of any liberum arbitrium or intelligible freedom\"). We seethat we cannot reach the sphere in which we have placed our values; but this does not by any means confer any value on that other sphere in which we live: on the contrary, we are weary because we have lost the main stimulus \"In vain so far!\"9 (Spring-Fall 1887)Pessimism as a preliminary form of nihilism.10 (Spring-Fall 1887)Pessimism as strength--in what? in the energy of its logic, as anarchismand nihilism, as analytic.Pessimism as decline--in what? as growing effeteness, as a sort of cosmopolitan fingering, as \"tout comprendre and historicism.The critical tension: the extremes appear and become predominant.11 (Spring-Fall 1887, rev. Spring-Fall 1888)The logic of pessimism down to ultimate nihilism: what is at work in it?The idea of valuelessness, meaninglessness: to what extent moral valuations hide behind all other high values.Conclusion: Moral value judgments are ways of passing sentence, negations; morality is a way of turning one's back on the will to existence.Problem: But what is morality?12 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)Decline of Cosmological Values( A )Nihilism as a psychological state will have to be reached, first, when we have sought a \"meaning\" in all events that is not there: so the seeker eventually becomes discouraged. Nihilism, then, is the recognition of the long waste of strength, the agony of the \"in vain,\" insecurity, the lack of any opportunity to recover and to regain composure--being ashamed in front of oneself, as if one had deceived oneself all too long.--This meaning could have been: the \"fulfillment\" of some highest ethical canon in all events, the moral world order; or the growth of love and harmony in the intercourse of beings; or the gradual approximation of a state of universal happiness; or even the development toward a state of universal annihilation--any goal at least constitutes some meaning. What all these notions have in common is that something is to be achieved through the process--and now one realizes"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"that becoming aims at nothing and achieves nothing.-- Thus, disappointment regarding an alleged aim of becoming as a cause of nihilism: whether regarding a specific aim or, universalized, the realization that all previous hypotheses about aims that concern the whole \"evolution\" are inadequate (man no longer the collaborator, let alone the center, of becoming).Nihilism as a psychological state is reached, secondly, when one has posited a totality, a systematization, indeed any organization in all events, and underneath all events, and a soul that longs to admire and revere has wallowed in the idea of some supreme form of domination and administration (--if the soul be that of a logician, complete consistency and real dialectic are quite sufficient to reconcile it to everything). Some sort of unity, some form of \"monism\": this faith suffices to give man a deep feeling of standing in the context of, and being dependent on, some whole that is infinitely superior to him, and he sees himself as a mode of the deity.--\"The well-being of the universal demands the devotion of the individual\"--but behold, there is no such universal! At bottom, man has lost the faith in his own value when no infinitely valuable whole works through him; i. e., he conceivedsuch a whole in order to be able to believe in his own value.Nihilism as psychological state has yet a third and last form.Given these two insights, that becoming has no goal and that underneath all becoming there is no grand unity in which the individual could immerse himself completely as in an element of supreme value, an escape remains: to pass sentence on this whole world of becoming as a deceptionand to invent a world beyond it, a true world. But as soon as man finds out how that world is fabricated solely from psychological needs, and how he has absolutely no right to it, the last form of nihilism comes into being: it includes disbelief in any metaphysical world and forbids itself any belief in a true world. Having reached this standpoint, one grants the reality of becoming as the only reality, forbids oneself every kind of clandestine access to afterworlds and false divinities--but cannot endure this world though one does not want to deny it.What has happened, at bottom? The feeling of valuelessness was reached with the realization that the overall character of existence may not be interpreted by means of the concept of \"aim,\" the concept of \"unity,\" orthe concept of \"truth.\" Existence has no goal or end; any comprehensive unity in the plurality of events is lacking: the character of existence is not \"true,\" is false. One simply lacks any reason for convincing oneself that there is a true world. Briefly: the categories \"aim,\" \"unity,\" \"being\" which we used to project some value into the world--we pull out again; so the world looks valueless.( B )Suppose we realize how the world may no longer be interpreted in terms of these three categories, and that the world begins to become valuelessfor us after this insight: then we have to ask about the sources of our faith in these three categories. Let us try if it is not possible to give up our faith in them. Once we have devaluated these three categories, the demonstration that they cannot be applied to the universe is no longer any reason for devaluating the universe.Conclusion: The faith in the categories of reason is the cause of nihilism. We have measured the value of the world according to categories that refer to a purely fictitious world."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Final conclusion: All the values by means of which we have tried so far to render the world estimable for ourselves and which then proved inapplicable and therefore devaluated the world--all these values are, psychologically considered, the results of certain perspectives of utility, designed to maintain and increase human constructs of domination--and they have been falsely projected into the essence of things. What we find here is still the hyperbolic naivete of man: positing himself as the meaning and measure of the value of things.13 (Spring-Fall 1887)Nihilism represents a pathological transitional stage (what is pathological is the tremendous generalization, the inference that there is no meaning at all): whether the productive forces are not yet strong enough, or whether decadence still hesitates and has not yet invented its remedies.Presupposition of this hypothesis: that there is no truth, that there isno absolute nature of things nor a \"thing-in-itself.\" This, too, IS merely nihilism--even the most extreme nihilism. It places the value of things precisely in the lack of any reality corresponding to these values and in their being merely a symptom of strength on the part of the value-positers, a simplification for the sake of life.14 (Spring-Fall 1887)Values and their changes are related to increases in the power of those positing the values.The measure of unbelief, of permitted \"freedom of the spirit\" as an expression of an increase in power.\"Nihilism\" an ideal of the highest degree of powerfulness of spirit, theover-richest life--partly destructive, partly ironic.15 (Spring-Fall 1837)What is a belief? How does it originate? Every belief is a considering-something-true.The most extreme form of nihilism would be the view that every belief, every considering-something-true, is necessarily false cause there simply is no true world. Thus, a perspectival appearance whose origin lies in us (in so far as we continually need a narrower, abbreviated, simplified world).-That it is the measure of strength to what extent we can admit to ourselves, without perishing, the merely apparent character, the necessity of lies.To this extent, nihilism, as the denial of a truthful world, of being, might be a divine way of thinking.16 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)If we are \"disappointed,\" it is at least not regarding life: rather we are now facing up to all kinds of \"desiderata.\"With scornful wrath we contemplate what are called \"ideals\"; we despise ourselves only because there are moments when we cannot subdue that absurd impulse that is called \"idealism.\" The influence of too much"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"coddling is stronger than the wrath of the disappointed.17 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. 1888)To what extent Schopenhauer's nihilism still follows from the same idealthat created Christian theism.--One felt so certain about the highest desiderata, the highest values, the highest perfection that the philosophers assumed this as an absolute certainty, as if it were a priori: \"God\" at the apex as a given truth. \"To become as God,\" \"to be absorbed into God\"--for thousands of years these were the most naive andconvincing desiderata (but what convinces is not necessarily true--it ismerely convincing: a note for asses).One has unlearned the habit of conceding to this posited ideal the reality of a person; one has become atheistic. But has the ideal itself been renounced?--At bottom, the last metaphysicians still seek in it true \"reality,\" the \"thing-in-itself\" compared to which everything else is merely apparent. It is their dogma that our apparent world, being so plainly not the expression of this ideal, cannot be \"true\"--and that, atbottom, it does not even lead us back to that metaphysical world as its cause. The unconditional, representing that highest perfection, cannot possibly be the ground of all that is conditional. Schopenhauer wanted it otherwise and therefore had to conceive of this metaphysical ground as the opposite of the ideal--as \"evil, blind will\": that way it could be that \"which appears,\" that which reveals itself in the world of appearances. But even so he did not renounce the absoluteness of the ideal--he sneaked by.-(Kant considered the hypothesis of \"intelligible freedom\" necessary in order to acquit the ens perfection of responsibility for the world's being such-and-such-in short, to account for evil and ills: a scandalousbit of logic for a philosopher.)18 (1883-1888)The most universal sign of the modern age: man has lost dignity in his own eyes to an incredible extent. For a long time the center and tragic hero of existence in general; then at least intent on proving himself closely related to the decisive and essentially valuable side of existence--like all metaphysicians who wish to cling to the dignity of man, with their faith that moral values are cardinal values. Those who have abandoned God cling that much more firmly to the faith in morality.19 (1883-1888)Every purely moral value system (that of Buddhism, for example) ends in nihilism: this to be expected in Europe. One still hopes to get along with a moralism without religious background: but that necessarily leadsto nihilism.--In religion the constraint is lacking to consider ourselves as value-positing.20 (Spring-Fall 1887)The nihilistic question \"for what?\" is rooted in the old habit of supposing that the goal must be put up, given, demanded from outside-by some superhuman authority. Having unlearned faith in that, one still follows the old habit and seeks another authority that can speak unconditionally and command goals and tasks. The authority of consciencenow steps up front (the more emancipated one is from theology, the more imperativistic morality becomes) to compensate for the loss of a personal authority. Or the authority of reason. Or the social instinct"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"(the herd). Or history with an immanent spirit and a goal within, so onecan entrust oneself to it. One wants to get around the will, the willingof a goal, the risk of positing a goal for oneself; one wants to rid oneself of the responsibility (one would accept fatalism). Finally, happiness--and, with a touch of Tartuffe, the happiness of the greatest number.One says to oneself:1. a definite goal is not necessary at all,2. cannot possibly be anticipated.Just now when the greatest strength of will would be necessary, it is weakest and least confident. Absolute mistrust regarding the organizing strength of the will for the whole.21 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. 1888)The perfect nihilist.--The nihilist's eye idealizes in the direction of ugliness and is unfaithful to his memories: it allows them to drop, losetheir leaves; it does not guard them against the corpselike pallor that weakness pours out over what is distant and gone. And what he does not do for himself, he also does not do for the whole past of mankind: he lets it drop.22 (Spring-Fall 1887)Nihilism. It is ambiguous:A. Nihilism as a sign of increased power of the spirit: as active nihilism.B. Nihilism as decline and recession of the power of the spirit: as passive nihilism.23 (Spring-Fall 1887)Nihilism as a normal condition.It can be a sign of strength: the spirit may have grown so strong that previous goals (\"convictions,\" articles of faith) have become incommensurate (for a faith generally expresses the constraint of conditions of existence, submission to the authority of circumstances under which one flourishes, grows, gains power). Or a sign of the lack of strength to posit for oneself, productively, a goal, a why, a faith.It reaches its maximum of relative strength as a violent force of destruction--as active nihilism.Its opposite: the weary nihilism that no longer attacks; its most famousform, Buddhism; a passive nihilism, a sign of weakness. The strength of the spirit may be worn out, exhausted, so that previous goals and valueshave become incommensurate and no longer are believed; so that the synthesis of values and goals (on which every strong culture rests) dissolves and the individual values war against each other: disintegration--and whatever refreshes, heals, calms, numbs emerges intothe foreground in various disguises, religious or moral, or political, or aesthetic, etc.24 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Nihilism does not only contemplate the \"in vain!\" nor is it merely the belief that everything deserves to perish: one helps to destroy.--This is, if you will, illogical; but the nihilist does not believe that one needs to be logical.--It is the condition of strong spirits and wills, and these do not find it possible to stop with the No of \"judgment\": their nature demands the No of the deed. The reduction to nothing by judgment is seconded by the reduction to nothing by hand.25 (Spring-Fall 1887)On the genesis of the nihilist.--It is only late that one musters the courage for what one really knows.'. That I have hitherto been a thorough-going nihilist, I have admitted to myself only recently: the energy and radicalism with which I advanced as a nihilist deceived me about this basic fact. When one moves toward a goal it seems impossible that \"goal-lessness as such\" is the principle of our faith.26 (Spring-Fall 1887)The pessimism of active energy: the question \"for what?\" after a terrible struggle, even victory. That something is a hundred times more important than the question of whether we feel well or not: basic instinct of all strong natures--and consequently also whether others feel well or not. In sum, that we have a goal for which one does not hesitate to offer human sacrifices, to risk every danger, to take upon oneself whatever is bad and worst: the great passion.27 (Spring-Fall 1887)Causes of nihilism: 1. The higher species is lacking, i. e., those whoseinexhaustible fertility and power keep up the faith in man. (One should recall what one owes to Napoleon: almost all of the higher hopes of thiscentury.)2. The lower species (\"herd,\" \"mass,\" \"society\") unlearns modesty and blows up its needs into cosmic and metaphysical values. In this way the whole of existence is vulgarized: in so far as the mass is dominant it bullies the exceptions, so they lose their faith in themselves and become nihilists.All attempts to think up higher types failed (\"romanticism\"; the artist,the philosopher; against Carlyle's attempt to ascribe to them the highest moral values).The resistance to higher types as a result.Decline and insecurity of all higher types. The fight against the genius(\"folk poetry,\" etc.). Pity for the lowly and suffering as a measure forthe height of a soul.The philosopher is lacking who interprets the deed and does not merely transpose it.28 (Spring-Fall 1887)Main proposition. How complete nihilism is the necessary consequence of the ideals entertained hitherto.Incomplete nihilism; its forms: we live in the midst of it."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Attempts to escape nihilism without revaluating our values so far: they produce the opposite, make the problem more acute.29 (1883-1888)The ways of self-narcotization.--Deep down: not knowing whither. Emptiness. Attempt to get over it by intoxication intoxication as music;intoxication as cruelty in the tragic enjoyment of the destruction of the noblest; intoxication as blind enthusiasm for single human beings orages (as hatred, etc.).--Attempt to work blindly as an instrument of science: opening one's eyes to the many small enjoyments; e. g., also inthe quest of knowledge (modesty toward oneself); resignation to generalizing about oneself, a pathos; mysticism, the voluptuous enjoyment of eternal emptiness; art \"for its own sake\" (\"le fait\") and \"pure knowledge\" as narcotic states of disgust with oneself; some kind or other of continual work, or of some stupid little fanaticism; a medley of all means, sickness owing to general immoderation (debauchery kills enjoyment).1. Weakness of the will as a result.2. Extreme pride and the humiliation of petty weakness felt in contrast.30 (Nov. 1887-March 1888; rev. 1888)The time has come when we have to pay for having been Christians for twothousand years: we are losing the center of gravity by virtue of which we lived; we are lost for a while. Abruptly we plunge into the opposite valuations, with all the energy that such an extreme overvaluation of man has generated in man.Now everything is false through and through, mere \"words,\" chaotic, weak, or extravagant:a. one attempts a kind of this-worldly solution, but in the same sense--that of the eventual triumph of truth, love, and justice (socialism: \"equality of the person\");b. one also tries to hold on to the moral ideal (with the pre-eminence of what is un-egoistic, self-denial, negation of the win);c. one tries to hold on even to the \"beyond\"--even if only as some antilogical \"x\"--but one immediately interprets it in such a way that some sort of old-fashioned metaphysical comfort can be derived from it;d. one tries to find in events an old-fashioned divine governance--an order of things that rewards, punishes, educates, and betters;e. one still believes in good and evil and experiences the triumph of the good and the annihilation of evil as a task (that is English; typical case: the flathead John Stuart Mill);f. contempt for what is \"natural,\" for desire, for the ego: attempt to understand even the highest spirituality and art as the consequence of depersonalization and as desinteressement;g. the church is still permitted to obtrude into all important experiences and main points of individual life to hallow them and give them a higher meaning: we still have the \"Christian state,\" \"Christian marriage\""},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"31 (1884)There have been more thoughtful and thought-addicted ages than ours: ages, e. g., like that in which the Buddha appeared, when after centuries of quarrels among sects the people themselves were as deeply lost in the ravines of philosophic doctrines as European nations were attimes in the subtleties of religious dogmas. Surely, one should not let \"literature\" and the press seduce us to think well of the \"spirit\" of our time: the existence of millions of spiritists and a Christianity that goes in for gymnastics of that gruesome ugliness that characterizesall English inventions are more instructive.European pessimism is still in its early stages--bears witness against itself: it still lacks that tremendous, yearning rigidity of expression in which the Nothing is reflected, once found in India; it is still far too contrived and too little \"organic\"-too much a pessimism of scholars and poets: I mean, much of it is excogitated and invented, is \"created\" and not a \"cause.\"32 (Summer-Fall 1888)Critique of pessimism to date.--Resistance to eudaemonistic considerations as the last reduction to the question: what does it mean?The reduction of growing gloom.-Our pessimism: the world does not have the value we thought it had. Our faith itself has so increased our desire for knowledge that today we have to say this. Initial result: it seems worth less; that is how it isexperienced initially. It is only in this sense that we are pessimists; i. e., in our determination to admit this revaluation to ourselves without any reservation, and to stop telling ourselves tales-lies-the old way.That is precisely how we find the pathos that impels us to seek new values. In sum: the world might be far more valuable than we used to believe; we must see through the naivete of our ideals, and while we thought that we accorded it the highest interpretation, we may not even have given our human existence a moderately fair value.What has been deïfied? The value instincts in the community (that which made possible its continued existence).What has been slandered? That which set apart the higher men from the lower, the desires that create clefts.33 (Spring-Fall 1887)Causes of the advent of pessimism:1. that the most powerful desires of life that have the most future havehitherto been slandered, so a curse weighs on life;2. that the growing courage and integrity and the bolder mistrust that now characterize man comprehend that these instincts are inseparable from life, and one therefore turns against life;3. that only the most mediocre, who have no feeling at all for this conflict, flourish while the higher kind miscarries and, as a product ofdegeneration, invites antipathy--that the mediocre on the other hand, when they pose as the goal and meaning, arouse indignation (that nobody is able any more to answer any \"for what or who?\""},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"4. that diminution, sensitivity to pain, restlessness, haste, and hustling grow continually--that it becomes easier and easier to recognize this whole commotion, this so-called \"civilization,\" and that the individual, faced with this tremendous machinery, loses courage and submits.34 (1&35-1886)Modern pessimism is an expression of the uselessness of the modern world--not of the world of existence.35 (Spring-Fall 1887)The \"predominance of suffering over pleasure\" or the opposite (hedonism): these two doctrines are already signposts to nihilism.For in both of these cases no ultimate meaning is posited except the appearance of pleasure or displeasure.But that is how a kind of man speaks that no longer dares to posit a will, a purpose, a meaning: for any healthier kind of man the value of life is certainly not measured by the standard of these trifles. And suffering might predominate, and in spite of that a powerful will might exist, a Yes to life, a need for thus predominance.\"Life is not worthwhile\"; \"resignation\"; \"why the tears?-- a weakly and sentimental way of thinking. \"Un monstre gai vaut mieux qu'un sentimental ennuyeux.36 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)The philosophical nihilist is convinced that all that happens is meaningless and in vain; and that there ought not to be anything meaningless and in vain. But whence this: there ought not to be. From where does one get this \"meaning,\" this standard?-- At bottom, the nihilist thinks that the sight of such a bleak, useless existence makes a philosopher feel dissatisfied, bleak, desperate. Such an insight goes against our finer sensibility as philosophers. It amounts to the absurd valuation: to have any right to be, the character of existence would have to give the philosopher pleasure.Now it is easy to see that pleasure and displeasure can only be means inthe course of events: the question remains whether we are at all able tosee the \"meaning,\" the \"aim,\" whether the question of meaninglessness orits opposite is not insoluble for us.37 (Spring-Fall 1887)The development of pessimism into nihilism.--Denaturalization of values.Scholasticism of values. Detached and idealistic, values, instead of dominating and guiding action, turn against action and condemn it.Opposites replace natural degrees and ranks. Hatred against the order ofrank. Opposites suit a plebeian age because easier to comprehend.The repudiated world versus an artificially built \"true, valuable\" one.--Finally: one discovers of what material one has built the \"true world\": and now all one has left is the repudiated world, and one adds this supreme disappointment to the reasons why it deserves to be repudiated."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"At this point nihilism is reached: all one has left are the values that pass judgment--nothing else.Here the problem of strength and weakness originates:1. The weak perish of it;2. those who are stronger destroy what does not perish;3. those who are strongest overcome the values that pass judgment.In sum this constitutes the tragic age.38 (1883-1888)Recently much mischief has been done with an accidental and in every wayunsuitable word: everywhere \"pessimism\" is discussed, and the question is debated whether pessmism or optimism is right, as if there must be answers to that.One fails to see, although it could hardly be more obvious, that pessimism is not a problem but a symptom, that the name should be replaced by \"nihilism,\" that the question whether not-to-be is better than to be is itself a disease, a sign of decline, an idiosyncrasy.The nihilistic movement is merely the expression of physiological decadence.39 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)To be comprehended: That every kind of decay and sickness has continually helped to form overall value judgments; that decadence has actually gained predominance in the value judgments that have become accepted; that we not only have to fight against the consequences of allpresent misery of degeneration, but that all previous decadence is stillresidual, i. e., survives. Such a total aberration of mankind from its basic instincts, such a total decadence of value judgments--that is the question mark par excellence, the real riddle that the animal \"man\" poses for the philosopher.40 (March-June 1888)The concept of decadence.--Waste, decay, elimination need not be condemned: they are necessary consequences of life, of the growth of life. The phenomenon of decadence is as necessary as any increase and advance of life: one is in no position to abolish it. Reason demands, onthe contrary, that we do justice to it.It is a disgrace for all socialist systematizers that they suppose therecould be circumstances--social combinations--in which vice, disease, prostitution, distress would no longer grow.--But that means condemning life.--A society is not free to remain young. And even at the height of its strength it has to form refuse and waste materials. The more energetically and boldly it advances, the richer it will be in failures and deformities, the closer to decline.--Age is not abolished by means of institutions. Neither is disease. Nor vice.41 (Jan.-Fall 1888)Basic insight regarding the nature of decadence: its supposed causes are"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"its consequences.This changes the whole perspective of moral problems.The whole moral struggle against vice, luxury, crime, even disease, appears a naivete and superfluous: there is no \"improvement\" (against repentance).Decadence itself is nothing to be fought: it is absolutely necessary andbelongs to every age and every people. What should be fought vigorously is the contagion of the healthy parts of the organism.Is this being done? The opposite is done. Precisely that is attempted inthe name of humanity.How are the supreme values held so far, related to this basic biologicalquestion? Philosophy, religion, morality, art, etc.(The cure: e. g., militarism, beginning with Napoleon who considered civilization his natural enemy.)42 (March-June 1888)First principle:The supposed causes of degeneration are its consequences.But the supposed remedies of degeneration are also mere palliatives against some of its effects: the \"cured\" are merely one type of the degenerates.Consequences of decadence: vice--the addiction to vice; sickness, crime-criminality; celibacy-sterility; hystericism, weakness of the will; alcoholism; pessimism; anarchism; libertinism (also of the spirit). The slanderers, underminers, doubters, destroyers.43 (March-June 1888)On the concept of decadence.1. Skepticism is a consequence of decadence, as is libertinism of the spirit.2. The corruption of morals is a consequence of decadence (weakness of the will, need for strong stimuli).3. Attempted cures, psychological and moral, do not change the course ofdecadence, do not arrest it, are physiologically naught:Insight into the great nullity of these presumptuous \"reactions\"; they are forms of narcotization against certain terrible consequences; they do not eliminate the morbid element; often they are heroic attempts to annul the man of decadence and to realize the minimum of his harmfulness.4. Nihilism is no cause but merely the logical result of decadence.5. The \"good\" and \"bad\" man are merely two types of decadence: in all basic phenomena they agree.6. The social question is a consequence of decadence."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"7. Sicknesses, especially those affecting nerves and head, are signs that the defensive strength of the strong natures is lacking; precisely this is suggested by irritability, so pleasure and displeasure become foreground problems.44 (Spring-Summer 1888)Most general types of decadence:1. Believing one chooses remedies, one chooses in fact that which hastens exhaustion; Christianity is an example (to name the greatest example of such an aberration of the instincts); \"progress\" is another instance.-2. One loses one's power of resistance against stimuli--and comes to be at the mercy of accidents: one coarsens and enlarges one's experiences tremendously--\"depersonalization,\" disintegration of the will; example: one whole type of morality, the altruistic one which talks much of pity--and is distinguished by the weakness of the personality, so that it is sounded, too, and like an overstimulated string vibrates continually--an extreme irritability.-3. One confuses cause and effect: one fails to understand decadence as aphysiological condition and mistakes its consequences for the real causeof the indisposition; example: all of religious morality.4. One longs for a condition in which one no longer suffers: life is actually experienced as the ground of ills; one esteems unconscious states, without feeling, (sleep, fainting) as incomparably more valuablethan conscious ones; from this a method.45 (March-June 1888)On the hygiene of the \"weak.\"--Everything done in weakness fails. Moral:do nothing. Only there is the hitch that precisely the strength to suspend activity, not to react, is sickest of all under the influence ofweakness: one never reacts more quickly and blindly than when one shouldnot react at all.A strong nature manifests itself by waiting and postponing any reaction:it is as much characterized by a certain adiaphoria as weakness is by aninvoluntary countermovement and the suddenness and inevitability of \"action.\"-- The will is weak-- and the prescription to avoid stupiditieswould be to have a strong will and to do nothing.--Contradictio.--A kindof self- destruction; the instinct of preservation is compromised.--The weak harm themselves.--That is the type of decadence.In fact, we find a tremendous amount of reflection about practices that would lead to impassability. The instinct is on the right track insofar as doing nothing is more expedient than doing something.All the practices of the orders, the solitary philosophers, the fakirs are inspired by the right value standard that a certain kind of man cannot benefit himself more than by preventing himself as much as possible from acting.-Means of relief: absolute obedience, machinelike activity, avoidance of people and things that would demand instant decisions and actions.46 (March-June 1888)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Weakness of the will: that is a metaphor that can prove misleading. For there is no will, and consequently neither a strong nor a weak will. Themultitude and disgregation of impulses and the lack of any systematic order among them result in a \"weak will\"; their coordination under a single predominant impulse results in a \"strong will\": in the first caseit is the oscillation and the lack of gravity; in the latter, the precision and clarity of the direction.47 (March-June 1888)What is inherited is not the sickness but sickliness: the lack of strength to resist the danger of infections, etc., the broken resistance; morally speaking, resignation and meekness in face of the enemy.I have asked myself if all the supreme values of previous philosophy, morality, and religion could not be compared to the values of the weakened, the mentally ill, and neurasthenics: in a milder form, they represent the same ills.-It is the value of all morbid states that they show us under a magnifying glass certain states that are normal--but not easily visible when normal.-Health and sickness are not essentially different, as the ancient physicians and some practitioners even today suppose. One must not make of them distinct principles or entities that fight over the living organism and turn it into their arena. That is silly nonsense and chatter that is no good any longer. In fact, there are only differences in degree between these two kinds of existence: the exaggeration, the disproportion, the nonharmony of the normal phenomena constitute the pathological state (Claude Bernard).Just as \"evil\" can be considered as exaggeration, disharmony, disproportion, \"the good\" may be a protective diet against the danger ofexaggeration, disharmony, and disproportion.Hereditary weakness as the dominant feeling: cause of the supreme values.N. B. One wants weakness: why? Usually because one is necessarily weak.Weakness as a task: weakening the desires, the feelings of pleasure and displeasure, the will to power, to a sense of pride, to want to have andhave more; weakening as meekness; weakening as faith; weakening as aversion and shame in the face of everything natural, as negation of life, as sickness and habitual weakness--weakening as the renunciation of revenge, of resistance, of enmity and wrath.-The error in treatment: one does not want to fight weakness with a systeme fortifiant, but rather with a kind of justification and moralization; i. e., with an interpretation.--Two totally different states confounded: e. g., the calm of strength, which is essentially forbearance from reaction (type of the gods whom nothing moves)--and the calm of exhaustion,. rigidity to the point of anesthesia. All philosophic-ascetic procedures aim at the second, but really intend the former--for they attribute predicates to the attained state as if a divine state had been attained."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"48 (March-June 1888)The most dangerous misunderstanding.--One concept apparently permits no confusion or ambiguity: that of exhaustion. Exhaustion can be acquired or inherited--in any case it changes the aspect of things, the value of things.As opposed to those who, from the fullness they represent and feel, involuntarily give to things and see them fuller, more powerful, and pregnant with future--who at least are able to bestow something--the exhausted diminish and botch all they see--they impoverish the value: they are harmful.-About this no mistake seems possible: yet history contains the gruesome fact that the exhausted have always been mistaken for the fullest--and the fullest for the most harmful.Those poor in life, the weak, impoverish life; those rich in life, the strong, enrich it. The first are parasites of life; the second give presents to it.--How is it possible to confound these two?When the exhausted appeared with the gesture of the highest activity andenergy (when degeneration effected an excess of spiritual and nervous discharge), they were mistaken for the rich. They excited fear.--The cult of the fool is always the cult of those rich in life, the powerful.The fanatic, the possessed, the religious epileptic, all eccentrics havebeen experienced as the highest types of power: as divine.This kind of strength that excites fear was considered preeminently divine: here was the origin of authority; here one interpreted, heard, sought wisdom.--This led to the development, almost everywhere, of a will to \"deify,\" i. e., a will to the typical degeneration of spirit, body, and nerves: an attempt to find the way to this higher level of being. To make oneself sick, mad, to provoke the symptoms of derangementand ruin-that was taken for becoming stronger, more superhuman, more terrible, wiser. One thought that in this way one became so rich in power that one could give from one's fullness. Wherever one adored one sought one who could give.Here the experience of intoxication proved misleading. This increases the feeling of power in the highest degree--therefore, naively judged, power itself. On the highest rung of power one placed the most intoxicated, the ecstatic. (--There are two sources of intoxication: theover-great fullness of life and a state of pathological nourishment of the brain.)49 (Jan.-Fall 1888)Acquired, not inherited, exhaustion: (1) Inadequate nourishment, often from ignorance about norishment; e. g., among scholars. (2) Erotic precociousness: the curse in particular of French youth, above all in Paris, who emerge into the world from their Lycees botched and soiled and never free themselves again from the chain of contemptible inclinations, ironical and disdainful toward themselves--galley slaves with all refinements (incidentally, in most cases already a symptom of the decadence of race and family, like all hypersensitivity; also the contagion of the milieu--to let oneself be determined by one's environment is decadent).

All of education to date, helpless, untenable, without center of gravity, stained by the contradiction of values.52 (Jan.-Fall 1888)Nature is not immoral when it has no pity for the degenerate: on the contrary, the growth of physiological and moral ills among mankind is the consequence of a pathological and unnatural morality. The sensibility of the majority of men is pathological and unnatural.Why is it that mankind is corrupt morally and physiologically?-The body perishes when an organ is altered.

The objection to it is that from experience it knows only the form of the decay of society, and inevitably it takes its own instincts of decay forthe norms of sociological judgment.In these norms the life that is declining in present-day Europe formulates its social ideals: one cannot tell them from the ideals of old races that have outlived themselves.-The herd instinct, then--a power that has now become sovereign--is something totally different from the instinct of an aristocratic society: and the value of the units determines the significance of the sum.--Our entire sociology simply does not know any other instinct than that of the herd, i. e., that of the sum of zeroes--where every zero has\"equal rights,\" where it is virtuous to be zero.-The valuation that is today applied to the different forms of society isentirely identical with that which assigns a higher value to peace than to war: but this judgment is antibiological, is itself a fruit of the decadence of life.--Life is a consequence of war, society itself a meansto war.--As a biologist, Mr. Herbert Spencer is a decadent; as a moralist, too (he considers the triumph of altruism a desideratum! ! !).54 (Jan.-Fall 1888)It is my good fortune that after whole millennia of error and confusion I have rediscovered the way that leads to a Yes and a No.I teach the No to all that makes weak--that exhausts.I teach the Yes to all that strengthens, that stores up strength, that justifies the feeling of strength.So far one has taught neither the one nor the other: virtue has been taught, mortification of the self, pity, even the negation of life. All these are the values of the exhausted.Prolonged reflection on the physiology of exhaustion forced me to ask towhat extent the judgments of the exhausted had penetrated the world of values.My result was as surprising as possible, even for me who was at home in many a strange world: I found that all of the supreme value judgments--all that have come to dominate mankind, at least that part that has become tame--can be derived from the judgments of the exhausted.Under the holiest names I pulled up destructive tendencies; one has called God what weakens, teaches weakness, infects with weakness.--I found that the \"good man\" is one of the forms in which decadence affirmsitself.That virtue of which Schopenhauer still taught that it is the supreme, the only virtue, and the basis of all virtues--precisely pity I"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"recognized as more dangerous than any vice.

Put differently: How did those come to power who are the last.--How did the instinct of the human animal come to stand on its head?-55 (June 10, 1887)31Extreme positions are not succeeded by moderate ones but by extreme positions of the opposite kind. Thus the belief in the absolute immorality of nature, in aim- and meaninglessness, is the psychologically necessary affect once the belief in God and an essentially moral order becomes untenable. Nihilism appears at that point, not that the displeasure at existence has become greater than before but because one has come to mistrust any \"meaning\" in suffering, indeed in existence. One interpretation has collapsed; but because it was considered the interpretation it now seems as if there were no meaning at all in existence, as if everything were in vain.That this \"in vain\" constitutes the character of present-day nihilism remains to be shown. The mistrust of our previous valuations grows untilit becomes the question: \"Are not all 'values' lures that draw out the comedy without bringing it closer to a solution?\" Duration \"in vain,\" without end or aim, is the most paralyzing idea, particularly when one understands that one is being fooled and yet lacks the power not to be fooled.Let us think this thought in its most terrible form: existence as it is,without meaning or aim, yet recurring inevitably without any finale of nothingness: \"the eternal recurrence.\" This is the most extreme form of nihilism: the nothing (the \"meaningless\"), eternally!The European form of Buddhism: the energy of knowledge and strength compels this belief. It is the most scientific of all possible hypotheses. We deny end goals: if existence had one it would have to have been reached.So one understands that an antithesis to pantheism is attempted here: for \"everything perfect, divine, eternal\" also compels a faith in the \"eternal recurrence.\" Question: does morality make impossible *is pantheistic affirmation of all things, too? At bottom, it is only the moral god that has been overcome. Does it make sense to conceive a god \"beyond good and evil\"? Would a pantheism in this sense be possible? Canwe remove the idea of a goal from the process and then affirm the process in spite of this?-This would be the case if something were attained at every moment within this process--and always the same. Spinoza reached such an affirmative position in so far as every moment"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"has a logical necessity, and with his basic instinct, which was logical,he felt a sense of triumph that the world should be constituted that way.But his case is only a single case. Every basic character trait that is encountered at the bottom of every event, that finds expression in everyevent, would have to lead every individual who experienced it as his ownbasic character trait to welcome every moment of universal existence with a sense of triumph. The crucial point would be that one experiencedthis basic character trait in oneself as good, valuable--with pleasure.It was morality that protected life against despair and the leap into nothing, among men and classes who were violated and oppressed by men: for it is the experience of being powerless against men, not against nature, that generates the most desperate embitterment against existence. Morality treated the violent despots, the doers of violence, the \"masters\" in general as the enemies against whom the common man mustbe protected, which means first of all encouraged and strengthened. Morality consequently taught men to hate and despise most profoundly what is the basic character trait of those who rule: their will to power. To abolish, deny, and dissolve this morality--that would mean looking at the best-hated drive with an opposite feeling and valuation. If the suffering and oppressed lost the faith that they have the right to despise the will to power, they would enter the phase of hopeless despair. This would be the case if this trait were essential to life andit could be shown that even in this will to morality this very \"will to power\" were hidden, and even this hatred and contempt were still a will to power. The oppressed would come to see that they were on the same plain with the oppressors, without prerogative, without higher rank.Rather the opposite! There is nothing to life that has value, except thedegree of power-assuming that life itself is the will to power. Moralityguarded the underprivileged against nihilism by assigning to each an infinite value, a metaphysical value, and by placing each in an order that did not agree with the worldly order of rank and power: it taught resignation, meekness, etc. Supposipg that the faith in this morality would perish, then the underprivileged would no longer have their comfort--and they would perish.This perishing takes the form of self-destruction--the instinctive selection of that which must destroy. Symptoms of this selfdestruction of the underprivileged: self-vivisection, poisoning, intoxication, romanticism, above all the instinctive need for actions that turn the powerful into mortal enemies (as it were, one breeds one's own hangmen);the will to destruction as the will of a still deeper instinct, the instinct of self-destruction, the will for nothingness.Nihilism as a symptom that the underprivileged have no comfort left; that they destroy in order to be destroyed; that without morality they no longer have any reason to \"resign themselves\" --that they place themselves on the plain of the opposite principle and also want power bycompelling the powerful to become their hangmen. This is the European form of Buddhism--saying No after all existence has lost its \"meaning.\"It is not that \"distress\" has grown: on the contrary. \"God, morality, resignation,\" were remedies on terribly low rungs of misery: active nihilism appears in relatively much more favorable conditions. The feeling that morality has been overcome presupposes a fair degree of spiritual culture, and this in turn that one is relatively well off.

Consider the situation in which the Buddha appeared. The doctrine of the eternal recurrence would have scholarly presuppositions (as did the Buddha's doctrine; e. g., the concept of causality, etc.).*What does \"underprivileged\" mean? Above all, physiologically--no longer politically. The unhealthiest kind of man in Europe (in all classes) furnishes the soil for this nihilism: they will experience the belief inthe eternal recurrence as a curse, struck by which one no longer shrinksfrom any action; not to be extinguished passively but to extinguish everything that is so aim- and meaningless, although this is a mere convulsion, a blind rage at the insight that everything has been for eternities--even this moment of nihilism and lust for destruction.--It is the value of such a crisis that it purlfies, that it pushes together related elements to perish of each other, that it assigns common tasks to men who have opposite ways of thinking--and it also brings to light the weaker and less secure among them and thus promotes an order of rankaccording to strength, from the point of view of health: those who command are recognized as those who command, those who obey as those whoobey. Of course, outside every existing social order.*Who will prove to be the strongest in the course of this? The most moderate; those who do not require any extreme articles of faith; those who not only concede but love a fair amount of accidents and nonsense; those who can think of man with a considerable reduction of his value without becoming small and weak on that account: those richest in healthwho are equal to most misfortunes and therefore not so afraid of misfortunes--human beings who are sure of their power and represent the attained strength of humanity with conscious pride.*How would such a human being even think of the eternal recurrence?56 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)- Periods of European NihilismThe period of unclarity, of all kinds of tentative men who would conserve the old without letting go of the new.The period of clarity: one understands that the old and the new are basically opposite, the old values born of declining and the new ones ofascending life--that all the old ideals are hostile to life (born of decadence and agents of decadence, even if in the magnificent Sunday-clothes of morality).

Disintegration characterizes this time, andthus uncertainty: nothing stands firmly on its feet or on a hard faith in itself; one lives for tomorrow, as the day after tomorrow is dubious.Everything on our way is slippery and dangerous, and the ice that still supports us has become thin: all of us feel the warm, uncanny breath of the thawing wind; where we still walk, soon no one will be able to walk.58 (1885-1888)If this is not an age of decay and declining vitality, it is at least one of headlong and arbitrary experimentation:--and it is probable that a superabundance of bungled experiments should create an overall impression as of decay--and perhaps even decay itself.59 (1885-1886)Toward a History of the Modern EclipseThe state nomads (civil servants, etc.): without home.

On the first stage one demands justice from those who are in power. On the second, one speaks of \"freedom--that is, one wants to get away from those in power.

And this is really the case, and I bewared in time, with some sort of regret, of the German andChristian narrowness and inconsequence of pessimism a la Schopenhauer or, worse, Leopardi, and sought out the most quintessential forms (Asia). But in order to endure this type of extreme pessimism (it can beperceived here and there in my Birth of Tragedy) and to live alone \"without God and morality\" I had to invent a counterpart for myself. Perhaps I know best why man alone laughs: he alone suffers so deeply that he had to invent laughter. The unhappiest and most melancholy animal is, as fitting, the most cheerful.92 (1883-1888)Regarding German culture, I have always had the feeling of decline. Thisfact, that I first became acquainted with a type in decline, has often made me unfair to the whole phenomenon of European culture.

That the reign of the individual has to be brief. The squandering is too great; the very possibility of collecting and capitalizing is lacking; and exhaustion follows immediately. These are times when everything is spent, when the very strength is spent with which one collects, capitalizes, and piles riches upon riches.- Even the opponents of such movements are forced into an absurd waste of energy; they, too, soon become exhausted, spent, desolate.In the Reformation we possess a wild and vulgar counterpart to the Italian Renaissance, born of related impulses; only in the retarded north, which had remained coarse, they had to don a religious disguise; for there the concept of the higher life had not yet detached itself from that of the religious life."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Through the Reformation, too, the individual sought freedom; \"everybody his own priest\" is also a mere formula of libertinage. In truth, one word was enough--\"evangelical freedom\"--and all instincts that had reason to remain hidden broke out like wild dogs, the most brutal requirements suddenly acquired the courage to face themselves, and everything seemed justified.--One was careful not to understand what liberty one had really meant at bottom; one shut one's eyes before oneself.--But shutting one's eyes and moistening one's lips with enthusiastic orations did not prevent one's hands from grasping whatevercould be grabbed, and the belly became the god of the \"free evangel,\" and all the cravings of revenge and envy satisfied themselves with insatiable rage.-This took a while; then exhaustion set in, just as it had in the south of Europe--and here, too, a vulgar kind of exhaustion, a general were inservitium.-- The indecent century of Germany arrived.-94 (1884)Chivalry as the conquered position of power: its gradual breaking up (and in part transition into what is more spread out, bourgeois). In La Rochefoucauld we find a consciousness of the true motive springs of noblesse of the mind--and a view of these motive springs that is darkened by Christianity.The French Revolution as the continuation of Christianity. Rousseau is the seducer: he again unfetters woman who is henceforth represented in an ever more interesting manner--as suffering. Then the slaves and Mrs. Beecher- Stowe. Then the poor and the workers. Then the vice addicts andthe sick--all this is moved into the foreground(even to develop sympathy for the genius one no longer knows any other way for the past five hundred years than to represent him as the bearer of great suffering!). Next come the curse on voluptuousness (Baudelaire and Schopenhauer); the most decided conviction that the lust to rule is the greatest vice; the perfect certainty that morality and disinterestedness are identical concepts and that the \"happiness of all\" is a goal worth striving for (i. e., the kingdom of heaven of Christ). We are well along on the way: the kingdom of heaven of the poorin spirit has begun.-- Intermediary stages: the bourgeois (a parvenu on account of money) and the worker (on account of the machine).Comparison of Greek culture and that of the French in the age of Louis XIV. Decided faith in oneself. A leisure class whose members make thingsdifficult for themselves and exercise much self-overcoming. The power ofform, the will to give form to oneself. \"Happiness\" admitted as a goal. Much strength and energy behind the emphasis on forms.

Much beast of prey au fond, much ascetic habit to remain master. The century of strong will; also of strong passion.The eighteenth century is dominated by woman, given to enthusiasm, full of esprit, shallow, but with a spirit in the service of what is desirable, of the heart, libertine in the enjoyment of what is most spiritual, and undermines all authorities; intoxicated, cheerful, clear,humane, false before itself, much canaille au fond, sociable.-The nineteenth century is more animalic and subterranean, uglier, more realistic and vulgar, and precisely for that reason \"better,\" \"more honest,\" more submissive before every kind of \"reality,\" truer; but weakin will, but sad and full of dark cravings, but fatalistic. Not full of awe and reverence for either \"reason\" or \"heart\"; deeply convinced of the rule of cravings (Schopenhauer spoke of \"will\"; but nothing is more characteristic of his philosophy than the absence of all genuine willing). Even morality reduced to one instinct (\"pity\").Auguste Comte is a continuation of the eighteenth century (domination ofcoeur over la tête, sensualism in the theory of knowledge, altruistic enthusiasm).That science has become sovereign to such a degree proves how the nineteenth century has rid itself of the domination of ideals. A certainfrugality of desire makes possible our scientific curiosity and severity--which is our kind of virtue.-Romanticism is an echo of the eighteenth century; a kind of piled-high desire for its enthusiasm in the grand style (as a matter of fact, a good deal of histrionics and self-deception: one wanted to represent strong natures and grand passions).The nineteenth century looks instinctively for theories that seem to justify its fatalistic submission to matters of fact. Already Hegel's success against \"sentimentality\" and romantic idealism was due to his fatalistic way of thinking, to his faith in the greater reason on the side of the victorious, to his justification of the actual \"state\" (in place of \"mankind,\" etc.).-Schopenhauer: we are something stupid and, at best, even something that cancels itself. Success of determinism, of the genealogical derivation of obligations that had formerly been considered absolute, the doctrine of milieu and adaptation, the reduction of will to reflexes, the denial of the will as an \"efficient cause\"; finally--a real rechristening: one sees so little will that the word becomes free to designate something else. Further theories: the doctrine of objectivity--\"will- less\" contemplation--as the only road to truth; also to beauty (--also the faith in the \"genius\" to justify a right to submission); mechanism, the calculable rigidity of the mechanical process; the alleged \"naturalism,\" elimination of the choosing, judging, interpreting subjectas a principle-Kant, with his \"practical reason\" and his moral fanaticism is wholly"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"eighteenth century; still entirely outside the historical movement; without any eye for the actuality of his time, e. g., Revolution; untouched by Greek philosophy; fanciful visionary of the concept of duty; sensualist with the backdrop of the pampering of dogmatism.-The movement back to Kant in our century is a movement back to the eighteenth century: one wants to regain a right to the old ideals and the old enthusiasm--for that reason an epistemology that \"sets boundaries,\" which means that it permits one to posit as one may see fita beyond of reason.-Hegel's way of thinking is not far different from Goethe's: one needs only to listen to Goethe about Spinoza.

The eighteenth uses the work in an attempt to arouse interest in the author.

He felt the mitigation, the subtleties, the spiritual joys of the civilized state; he despised narrowmindedness, also in the form of virtue, and the lack of delicatesse, also among ascetics and monks.The moral reprehensibility of man seemed to preoccupy Rousseau; with thewords \"unjust\" and \"cruel\" one can best stir up the instincts of the oppressed who otherwise smart under the ban of the vetitum and disfavor,so their conscience advises them against rebellious cravings. Such emancipators seek one thing above all: to give their party the grand accents and poses of the higher nature.100 (Spring-Fall 1887)Rousseau: the rule based on feeling; nature as the source of justice; man perfects himself to the extent to which he approaches nature (according to Voltaire, to the extent to which he moves away from nature). The very same epochs are for one ages of the progress of humanity; for the other, times when injustice and inequality grow worse.Voltaire still comprehended umanita in the Renaissance sense; also virtu(as \"high culture\"); he tights for the cause of the \"honnetes gens\" and \"de la bonne compagnie,\" the cause of taste, of science, of the arts, ofprogress itself and civilization.The fight began around 1760: the citizen of Geneva and le seigneur de Ferney. Only from that moment on Voltaire becomes the man of his century, the philosopher, the representative of tolerance and unbelief (till then merely un bel esprit). Envy and hatred of Rousseau's success impelled him forward, \"to the heights.\"Pour \"la canaille\" un dieu rémunerateur et vengeur- Voltaire.Critique of both points of view in regard to the value of civilization. The social invention is for Voltaire the most beautiful there is: there is no higher goal than to maintain and perfect it; precisely this is honnêteté, to respect social conventions; virtue as obedience to certainnecessary \"prejudices\" in favor of the preservation of \"society.\" Missionary of culture, aristocrat, representative of the victorious, ruling classes and their valuations. But Rousseau remained a plebeian, also as homme de lettres; that was unheard of; his impudent contempt of all that was not he himself.What was sick in Rousseau was admired and imitated most.

In brief, our feelings, as feelings about values, are not upto date.To generalize: feelings about values are always behind the times; they express conditions of preservation and growth that belong to times long gone by; they resist new conditions of existence with which they cannot cope and which they necessarily misunderstand: thus they inhibit and arouse suspicion against what is new.-111 (Spring-Fall 1887)The problem of the nineteenth century. Whether its strong and weak sidesbelong together? Whether it is all of one piece? Whether the diversenessof its ideals and their mutual inconsistency are due to a higher aim: assomething higher.---For it could be the precondition of greatness to grow to such an extent in violent tension. Dissatisfaction, nihilism could be a good sign.112 (Spring-Fall 1887)Overall insight.-Actually, every major growth is accompanied by a tremendous crumbling and passing away: suffering, the symptoms of decline belong in the times of tremendous advances; every fruitful and powerful movement of humanity has also created at the same time a nihilistic movement. It could be the sign of a crucial and most essential growth, of the transition to new conditions of existence, thatthe most extreme form of pessimism, genuine nihilism, would come into the world. This I have comprehended.113 (1883-1888)( A )To begin with a full and cordial tribute to contemporary humanity: not to be deceived by appearances--this type of humanity is less striking but gives far better warranties of duration; its tempo is slower, but the beat is much richer. Health is increasing, the actual conditions fora strong body get recognized and are slowly created, \"asceticism\" ironice. One shrinks from extremes; a certain confidence in the \"right road''; no enthusing; temporary acclimatization to narrower values (like\"fatherland,\" like \"scholarship,\" etc.).Still, this whole picture would remain ambiguous: it could be an ascending but also a descending movement of life.( B )Faith in \"progress\"-in the lower spheres of intelligence it appears as ascending life; but this is self-deception; in the higher spheres of"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"intelligence as decending life.Description of the symptoms.Unity of point of view: uncertainty about standards of value. Fear of a general \"in vain.\" Nihilism.114 (June 10,1887)Actually, we have no longer such need of an antidote to the first nihilism: life in our Europe is no longer that uncertain, capricious, absurd. Such a tremendous increase in the value of man, the value of trouble, etc., is not so needful now; we can take a significant decreaseof this value, we may concede much absurdity and caprice: the power man has attained now permits a demotion of the means of breeding of which the moral interpretation was the strongest. \"God\"' is far too extreme a hypothesis.115 (Jan.-Fall 1888)If anything signifies our humanization--a genuine and actual progress--it is the fact that we no longer require excessive oppositions, indeed no opposites at all-- we may love the senses, we have spiritualized and made them artistic in every degree; we have a right to all those things which were most maligned until now.\"116 (Jan.-Fall 1888)The inversion of the order of rank.-The pious counterfeiters, the priests, among us become chandalas--they replace the charlatans, quacks,counterfeiters, and wizards; we consider them corrupters of the will, great slanderers of life on which they wish to revenge themselves, rebels among the underprivileged. We have turned the caste of senants, the Sudras, into our middle class, our \"Volk\" [\"people\"], those who makepolitical decisions.On the other hand, the chandala of former times is at the top: foremost,those who blaspheme God, the immoralists, the nomads of every type, the artists, Jews, musicians--at bottom, all disreputable classes of men-We have raised ourselves to the level of honorable thoughts; even more, we determine honor on earth, \"nobility\"--All of us are today advocates of life.--We immoralists are today the strongest power: the other great powers need us--we construe the world in our image-We have transferred the concept of the \"chandala\" to the priests, teachers of a beyond, and the Christian society that is grown together with them, as well as all who are of the same origin, the pessimists, nihilists, romantics of pity, criminals, vice addicts-- the whole spherein which the concept of \"God\" is imagined as a savior-We are proud of no longer having to be liars, slanderers, men who cast suspicion on life-117 (Spring-Fall 1887)Progress of the nineteenth century against the eighteenth (--at bottom we good Europeans wage a war against the eighteenth century--):1. \"Return to nature\" understood more and more decisively in the opposite sense from Rousseau's. Away from idyl and opera!"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"2. more and more decisively anti-idealistic, more concrete, more fearless, industrious, moderate, suspicious against sudden changes, antirevolutionary;3. more and more decisively the question concerning the health of the body is put ahead of that of \"the soul\": the latter being understood as a state consequent upon the former, and the former at the very least as a precondition of the health of the soul.118 (1883-1888)If anything at all has been achieved, it is a more innocuous relation tothe senses, a more joyous, benevolent, Goethean attitude toward sensuality; also a prouder feeling regarding the search for knowledge, so that the \"pure fool\" is not given much credit.119 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. 1888)We who are \"objective.\"-It is not \"pity\" that opens the gates to the most distant and strange types of being and culture to us, but rather our accessibility and lack of partiality that does not empathize with orshare suffering but on the contrary takes delight in a hundred things that formerly led people to suffer (feel outraged or deeply moved, or prompted hostile and cold looks-). Suffering in all its nuances has become interesting for us: in this respect we are certainly not fuller of pity, even when we are shaken by the sight of suffering and moved to tears: we do not by any means for that reason feel like helping.In this voluntary desire to contemplate all sorts of distress and transgressions we have become stronger and more vigorous than the eighteenth century was; it is a proof of our increase in vigor (we have come closer to the seventeenth and sixteenth centuries.). But it is a profound misunderstanding to construe our \"romanticism\" as a proof that our \"souls\" have become \"more beautiful\"-We desire strong sensations as all coarser ages and social strata do.--This should be distinguished from the needs of those with weak nerves and the decadents: they have a need for pepper, even for cruelty-All of us seek states in which bourgeois morality no longer has any say,and priestly morality even less (--every book to which some of the air of pastors and theologians still clings gives us the impression of a pitiable niaiserie and poverty.--\"Good society\" consists of those whom at bottom nothing interests except what is forbidden in bourgeois society and gives a bad reputation: the same applies to books, music, politics, and the estimation of woman.120 (Spring-Fall 1887)How man has become more natural in the nineteenth century (the eighteenth century is that of elegance, refinement, and sentiments genereux).--Not \"return to nature\"--for there has never yet been a natural humanity. The scholasticism of un- and antinatural values is therule, is the beginning; man reaches nature only after a long struggle--he never \"returns\" to Nature: i. e., daring to be immoral like nature.We are coarser, more direct, full of irony against generous feelings even when we succumb to them.More natural is our first society, that of the rich, the leisure class:"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"they hunt each other, love between the sexes is a kind of sport in whichmarriage furnishes an obstacle and a provocation; they amuse themselves and live for pleasure; they esteem physical advantages above all, are curious and bold.More natural is our attitude to the search for knowledge: we possess libertinage of the spirit in all innocence, we hate pompous and hieratical manners, we delight in what is most forbidden, we should hardly know any longer of any interest of knowledge if the way to it were paved with boredom.More natural is our attitude toward morality. Principles have become ridiculous; nobody permits himself any longer to speak without irony of his \"duty.\" But a helpful, benevolent disposition is esteemed (morality is found in an instinct, and the rest is spurned. In addition a few concepts of points of honor-).More natural is our position in politicis: we see problems of power, of one quantum of power against another. We do not believe in any right that is not supported by the power of enforcement: we feel all rights tobe conquests.More natural is our estimation of great human beings and great things: we consider passion a privilege, we consider nothing great unless it includes a great crime; we conceive all being-great as a placing-oneself-outside as far as morality is concerned.More natural is our attitude toward nature: we no longer love it on account of its \"innocence,\" \"reason,\" or \"beauty\"; we have made it nicely \"devilish\" and \"dumb.\" But instead of despising it on that account, we have felt more closely related to it ever since, more at home in it. It does not aspire to virtue, and for that we respect nature.More natural is our attitude toward art: we do not demand beautiful illusory lies from it, etc.; brutal positivism reigns, recognizing factswithout becoming excited.In summa: there are signs that the European of the nineteenth century isless ashamed of his instincts; he has taken a goodly step toward admitting to himself his unconditional naturalness, i. e., his immorality, without becoming embittered--on the contrary, strong enough to endure only this sight.This sounds to some ears as if corruption had progressed-- and it is certain that man has not come dose to that \"nature\" of which Rousseau speaks but has progressed another step in civilization, which Rousseau abhorred. We have become stronger: we have again come closer to the seventeenth century, especially to the taste of its end(Dancourt, Lesage, Regnard).121 (1888)Culture contra civilization.-The high points of culture and civilizationdo not coincide: one should not be deceived about the abysmal antagonismof culture and civilization. The great moments of culture were always, morally speaking, times of corruption; and conversely, the periods when the taming of the human animal (\"civilization\") was desired and enforcedwere times of intolerance against the boldest and most spiritual natures. Civilization has aims different from those of culture--perhaps they are even opposite-"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"122 (January-Fall 1888)What I warn against: the instincts of decadence should not be confused with humaneness; the means of civilization, which lead to disintegrationand necessarily to decadence, should not be confused with culture; the libertinage, the principle of \"laisser aller,\" should not be confused with the will to power (--which is the counterprinciple).123 (Spring-Fall 1887)The unfinished problems I pose anew: the problem of civilization, the fight between Rousseau and Voltaire around 1760. Man becomes more profound, mistrustful, \"immoral,\" stronger, more confident of himself--and to this extent \"more natural\": this is \"progress.\"--At the same time, in accordance with a kind of division of labor, the strata that have become more evil are separated from those that have become milder and tamer-so that the overall fact is not noticed immediately.--It is characteristic of strength, of the self-control and fascination of strength, that these stronger strata possess the art of making others experience their progress in evil as something higher. It is characteristic of every \"progress\" that the strengthened elements are reinterpreted as \"good.\"124 (Spring-Fall 1887)To give men back the courage to their natural drives-To check their self-underestimation (not that of man as an individual but that of man as nature-)-To remove antitheses from things after comprehending that we have projected them there-To remove the idiosyncrasies of society from existence (guilt, punishment, justice, honesty, freedom, love, etc.)-Progress toward \"naturalness\": in all political questions, also in the relations of parties, even of commercial, workers', and employers' parties, questions of power are at stake--\"what one can do,\" and only after that what one ought to do.125 (1885)lSocialism--as the logical conclusion of the tyranny of the least and thedumbest, i. e., those who are superficial, envious, and three-quarters actors-is indeed entailed by \"modern ideas\" and their latent anarchism; but in the tepid air of democratic well-being the capacity to reach conclusions, or to finish, weakens. One follows --but one no longer seeswhat follows. Therefore socialism is on the whole a hopeless and sour affair; and nothing offers a more amusing spectacle than the contrast between the poisonous and desperate faces cut by today's socialists--andto what wretched and pinched feelings their style bears witness!--and the harmless lambs' happiness of their hopes and desiderata. Nevertheless, in many places in Europe they may yet bring off occasionalcoups and attacks: there will be deep \"rumblings\" in the stomach of the next century, and the Paris commune, which has its apologists and advocates in Germany, too, was perhaps no more than a minor indigestion compared to what is coming. But there will always be too many who have possessions for socialism to signify more than an attack of sickness--and those who have possessions are of one mind on one article of faith:"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"\"one must possess something in order to be something.\" But this is the oldest and healthiest of all instincts: I should add, \"one must want to have more than one has in order to become more.\" For this is the doctrine preached by life itself to all that has life: the morality of development. To have and to want to have more--growth, in one word--thatis life itself. In the doctrine of socialism there is hidden, rather badly, a \"will to negate life\"; the human beings or races that think up such a doctrine must be bungled. Indeed, I should wish that a few great experiments might prove that in a socialist society life negates itself,cuts off its own roots. The earth is large enough and man still sufficiently unexhausted; hence such a practical instruction and demonstratio ad absurdum would not strike me as undesirable, even if it were gained and paid for with a tremendous expenditure of human lives. In any case, even as a restless mole under the soil of a society that wallows in stupidity, socialism will be able to be something useful and therapeutic: it delays \"peace on earth\" and the total mollification of the democratic herd animal; it forces the Europeans to retain spirit, namely cunning and cautious care, not to abjure manly and warlike virtues altogether, and to retain some remnant of spirit, of clarity, sobriety, and coldness of the spirit- it protects Europe for the time being from the marasmus femininus that threatens it.126 (Spring-Fall 1887)The most favorable inhibitions and remedies of modernity:1. universal military service with real wars in which the time for joking is past;2. national bigotry (simplifies, concentrates);3. improved nutrition (meat);4. increasing cleanliness and healthfulness of domiciles;5. hegemony of physiology over theology, moralism, economics, and politics;6. military severity in the demand for and handling of one's\"obligations\" (one does not praise any more-).127 (1884)I am glad about the military development of Europe; also of the internalstates of anarchy: the time of repose and Chinese ossification, which Galiani predicted for this century, is over. Personal manly virtu of thebody, is regaining value, estimation becomes more physical, nutrition meatier. Beautiful men are again becoming possible. Pallid hypocrisy (with mandarins at the top, as Comte dreamed) is over. The barbarian in each of us is affirmed; also the wild beast. Precisely for that reason philosophers have a future.--Kant is a scarecrow, some day!128 (1884)I have as yet found no reason for discouragement. Whoever has preserved,and bred in himself, a strong will, together with an ample spirit, has more favorable opportunities than ever. For the trainability of men has become very great in this democratic Europe; men who learn easily and adapt themselves easily are the rule: the herd animal, even highly intelligent, has been prepared. Whoever can command finds those who mustobey: I am thinking, e. g., of Napoleon and Bismarck. The rivalry with"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"strong and unintelligent wills, which is the greatest obstacle, is small. Who doesn't topple these \"objective\" gentlemen with weak wills, like Rancle or Renan!129 (1885)Spiritual enlightenment is an infallible means for making men unsure, weaker in will, so they are more in need of company and support--in short, for developing the herd animal in man. Therefore all great artists of government so far (Confucius in China, the imperium Romanum, Napoleon, the papacy at the time when it took an interest in power and not merely in the world), in the places where the dominant instincts have culminated so far, also employed spiritual enlightenment--at least let it have its way (like the popes of the Renaissance). The self-deception of the mass concerning this point, e. g., in every democracy, is extremely valuable: making men smaller and more governable is desiredas \"progress\"!130 (1883-1888)The highest equity and mildness as a state of weakening (the New Testament and the original Christian community--apparent as complete betisel in the Englishmen, Darwin and Wallace). Your equity, you higher natures, impels you toward suffrage universel, etc.; your \"humanity,\" toward mildness confronted with crime and stupidity. In the long run youthus make stupidity and the unscrupulous victorious: comfort and stupidity--the mean.Externally: age of tremendous wars, upheavals, explosions.Internally: ever greater weakness of man, events as excitants. The Parisian as the European extreme.Consequences: (1) barbarians (at first, of course, below the form of culture so far [e. g., Duhring]); (2) sovereign individuals (where masses of barbarian force are crossed with a lack of all restraint regarding whatever has been). Age of the greatest stupidity, brutality, and the masses, and of the highest individuals.131 (1884)Innumerable individuals of a higher type now perish: but whoever gets away is strong as the devil. Similar to the situation at the time of theRenaissance.132 (1885)Good Europeans that we are--what distinguishes us above the men of fatherlands?-First, we are atheists and immoralists, but for the presentwe support the religions and moralities of the herd instinct: for these prepare a type of man that must one day fall into our hands, that must desire our hands.Beyond good and evil--but we demand that herd morality should be held sacred unconditionally.We hold in reserve many types of philosophy which need to be taught: possibly, the pessimistic type, as a hammer; a European Buddhism might perhaps be indispensable.We probably support the development and maturing of democratic"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"institutions: they enhance weakness of the will: in socialism we see a thorn that protects against comfortableness.Position toward peoples.

Critique of Religion1. Genesis of Religions142 (Jan.-Fall 1888)Toward a critique of the law-book of Manu.-- The whole book is founded on the holy lie. Was the well-being of mankind the inspiration of this system? Was this species of man, who believes in the interestedness of every action, interested or not in imposing this system? To improve mankind--how is this intention inspired? Where is the concept of improvement derived from?We find a species of man, the priestly, which feels itself to be the norm, the high point and the supreme expression of the type man: this species derives the concept \"improvement\" from itself. It believes in its own superiority, it wills itself to be superior in fact: the origin of the holy lie is the will to power--Establishment of rule: to this end, the rule of those concepts that place a non plus ultra of power with the priesthood. Power through the lie--in the knowledge that one does not possess it physically, militarily--the lie as a supplement to power, a new concept of \"truth.\"It is a mistake to suppose an unconscious and naive development here, a kind of self-deception-- Fanatics do not invent such carefully thought-out systems of oppression-- The most cold-blooded reflection was at workhere; the same kind of reflection as a Plato applied when he imagined his \"Republic.\" \"He who wills the end must will the means\"--all lawgivers have been clear in their minds regarding this politician's insight.We possess the classic model in specifically Aryan forms: we may therefore hold the best-endowed and most reflective species of man responsible for the most fundamental lie that has ever been told-- That lie has been copied almost everywhere: Aryan influence has corrupted allthe world--143 (March-June 1888)A lot is said today about the Semitic spirit of the New Testament: but what is called Semitic is merely priestly--and in the racially purest Aryan law-book, in Manu, this kind of \"Semitism,\" i. e., the spirit of the priest, is worse than anywhere else.The development of the Jewish priestly state is not original: they learned the pattern in Babylon: the pattern is Aryan. When, later on, the same thing became dominant in a Europe with a preponderance of Germanic blood, this was in accordance with the spirit of the ruling race: a great atavism. The Germanic Middle Ages aimed at a revival of the Aryan order of castes."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Mohammedanism in turn learned from Christianity: the employment of the \"beyond\" as an instrument of punishment.The pattern of an unchanging community with priests at its head--this oldest of the great cultural products of Asia in the realm of organization--was bound to invite reflection and imitation in every respect. Again Plato: but above all the Egyptians.144 (1885)Moralities and religions are the principal means by which one can make whatever one wishes out of man, provided one possesses a superfluity of creative forces and can assert one's will over long periods of time--in the form of legislation, religions, and customs.145 (1884-1888)What an affirmative Aryan religion, the product of the ruling class, looks like: the law-book of Manu. (The deification of the feeling of power in Brahma: interesting that it arose among the warrior caste and was only transferred to the priests.)What an affirmative Semitic religion, the product of the ruling class, looks like: the law-book of Mohammed, the older parts of the Old Testament. (Mohammedanism, as a religion for men, is deeply contemptuousof the sentimentality and mendaciousness of Christianity--which it feelsto be a woman's religion.)What a negative Semitic religion, the product of an oppressed class, looks like: the New Testament (--in Indian-Aryan terms: a chandala religion).What a negative Aryan religion looks like, grown up among the ruling orders: Buddhism.It is quite in order that we possess no religion of oppressed Aryan races, for that is a contradiction: a master race is either on top or itis destroyed.151 (1885-1886)Religions are destroyed by belief in morality. The Christian moral God is not tenable: hence \"atheism\"--as if there could be no other kinds of god.Similarly, culture is destroyed by belief in morality. For when one discovers the necessary conditions out of which alone it can grow, one no longer wants it (Buddhism).2. History of Christianity168 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)--The church is precisely that against which Jesus preached--and againstwhich he taught his disciples to fight--169 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)A god who died for our sins: redemption through faith; resurrection after death--all these are counterfeits of true Christianity for which"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"that disastrous wrong-headed fellow [Paul] must be held responsible.The exemplary life consists of love and humility; in a fullness of heartthat does not exclude even the lowliest; in a formal repudiation of maintaining one's rights, of self-defense, of victory in the sense of personal triumph; in faith in blessedness here on earth, in spite of distress, opposition and death; in reconciliation; in the absence of anger; not wanting to be rewarded; not being obliged to anyone; the completest spiritual-intellectual independence; a very proud life beneath the will to a life of poverty and service.After the church had let itself be deprived of the entire Christian way of life and had quite specifically sanctioned life under the state, thatform of life that Jesus had combatted and condemned, it had to find the meaning of Christianity in something else: in faith in unbelievable things, in the ceremonial of prayers, worship, feasts, etc. The concept \"sin,\" \"forgiveness,\" \"reward\"--all quite unimportant and virtually excluded from primitive Christianity--now comes into the foreground.An appalling mishmash of Greek philosophy and Judaism; asceticism; continual judging and condemning; order of rank, etc.191 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)Christians have never put into practice the acts Jesus prescribed for them, and the impudent chatter about \"justification by faith\" and its unique and supreme significance is only the consequence of the church's lack of courage and will to confess the works which Jesus demanded.The Buddhist acts differently from the non-Buddhist; the Christian acts as all the world does and possesses a Christianity of ceremonies and moods.The profound and contemptible mendaciousness of Christianity in Europe--: we really are becoming the contempt of the Arabs, Hindus, Chinese-- Listen to the speeches of German's first statesman on what hasreally occupied Europe for forty years now--listen to the language, the court-chaplain Tartuffery.3.

That means wanting to know that mankind has a goal, a destiny--"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"339 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)The very obscure and arbitrary idea that mankind has a single task to perform, that it is moving as a whole towards some goal, is still very young. Perhaps we shall be rid of it again before it becomes a \"fixed idea\"--This mankind is not a whole: it is an inextricable multiplicity of ascending and descending life-processes--it does not have a youth followed by maturity and finally by old age; the strata are twisted and entwined together--and in a few millennia there may still be even younger types of man than we can show today. Decadence, on the other hand, belongs to all epochs of mankind: refuse and decaying matter are found everywhere; it is one of life's processes to exclude the forms of decline and decay.*When Christian prejudice was a power, this question did not exist: meaning lay in the salvation of the individual soul; whether mankind could endure for a long or a short time did not come into consideration.The best Christians desired that it should end as soon as possible--concerning that which was needful to the individual there was no doubt--The task of every present individual was the same as for a future individual in any kind of future: value, meaning, domain of values were fixed, unconditional, eternal, one with God-- That which deviated from this eternal type was sinful, devilish, condemned--For each soul, the gravitational center of valuation was placed within itself: salvation or damnation! The salvation of the immortal soul! Extremest form of personalization-- For every soul there was only one perfecting; only one ideal; only one way to redemption-- Extremest form of equality of rights, tied to an optical magnification of one's own importance to the point of insanity-- Nothing but insanely important souls, revolving about themselves with a frightful fear--No man believes now in this absurd self-inflation: and we have sifted our wisdom through a sieve of contempt. Nevertheless, the optical habit of seeking the value of man in his approach to an ideal man remains undisturbed: fundamentally, one upholds the perspective of personalization as well as equality of rights before the ideal. In summa: one believes one knows what the ultimate desideratum is with regard to the ideal man--This belief, however, is only the consequence of a dreadful deterioration through the Christian ideal: as one at once discovers withevery careful examination of the \"ideal type.\" One believes one knows, first that an approach to one type is desirable; secondly, that one knows what this type is like; thirdly, that every deviation from this type is a regression, an inhibition, a loss of force and power in man--To dream of conditions in which this perfect man will be in the vast majority: even our socialists, even the Utilitarians have not gone farther than this.--In this way a goal seems to have entered the development of mankind: at any rate, the belief in progress towards the ideal is the only form in which a goal in history is thought of today.

Critique of the \"Good Man,\" the Saint, etc.352 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)The concept of power, whether of a god or of a man, always includes boththe ability to help and the ability to harm. Thus it is with the Arabs; thus with the Hebrews. Thus with all strong races.It is a fateful step when one separates the power for the one from the power for the other into a dualism-- In this way, morality becomes the poisoner of life--C. Disagreement of the So-Called Evil Qualities377 (1883-1888)Falsity.--Every sovereign instinct has the others for its tools, retainers, flatterers: it never lets itself be called by its ugly name: and it countenances no praise in which it is not also praised indirectly. All praise and blame in general crystallizes around every sovereign instinct to form a rigorous order and etiquette. This is one of the causes of falsity.Every instinct that struggles for mastery but finds itself under a yoke requires for itself, as strengthening and as support for its self-esteem, all the beautiful names and recognized values: so, as a rule, itventures forth under the name of the \"master\" it is combatting and from whom it wants to get free (e. g., the fleshly desires or the desires forpower under the dominion of Christian values).-- This is the other causeof falsity.Perfect naïveté reigns in both cases: the falsity does not become conscious. It is a sign of a broken instinct when man sees the driving force and its \"expression\" (\"the mask\") as separate things--a sign of self-contradiction, and victorious far less often. Absolute innocence inbearing, word, affect, a \"good conscience\" in falsity, the certainty with which one grasps the greatest and most splendid words and postures--all this is necessary for victory.In the other case: when one has extreme clear-sightedness one needs the genius of the actor and tremendous training in self-control if one is toachieve victory. That is why priests are the most skillful conscious hypocrites; then princes, whom rank and ancestry have endowed with a kind of acting ability. Thirdly, men of society, diplomats. Fourthly, women.Basic idea: falsity seems so profound, so omnisided, the will so clearlyopposed to direct self-knowledge and the calling of things by their right names, that it is very highly probable that truth, will to truth is really something else and only a disguise.

Spring-Fall 1888)Schopenhauer interpreted high intellectuality as liberation from the will; he did not want to see the freedom from moral prejudice which is part of the emancipation of the great spirit, the typical immorality of the genius; he artfully posited the only thing he held in honor, the moral value of \"depersonalization,\" as the condition of spiritual activity, of \"objective\" viewing. \"Truth,\" even in art, appears after the withdrawal of the will--I see a fundamentally different valuation cutting across all the moral idiosyncrasies: I know nothing of such an absurd distinction between \"genius\" and the moral and immoral world of the will. The moral man is alower species than the immoral, a weaker species; indeed--he is a type in regard to morality, but not a type in himself; a copy, a good copy atbest--the measure of his value lies outside him. I assess a man by the quantum of power and abundance of his will: not by its enfeeblement and extinction; I regard a philosophy which teaches denial of the will as a teaching of defamation and slander-- I assess the power of a will by howmuch resistance, pain, torture it endures and knows how to turn to its advantage; I do not account the evil and painful character of existence a reproach to it, but hope rather that it will one day be more evil and painful than hitherto--The high point of the spirit imagined by Schopenhauer was to attain to the recognition that there is no meaning in anything, in short, to recognize what the good man already instinctively does-- He denies the possibility of a higher kind of intellect--he took his insight for a nonplus ultra. Here spirituality is placed much lower than goodness; its highest value (e. g., as art) would be to urge and prepare moral conversion: absolute domination of moral values.--Beside Schopenhauer I would characterize Kant: nothing Greek, absolutelyantihistorical (his passage on the French Revolution) and a moral fanatic (Goethe's passage on radical evil). Saintliness was in the background in his case, too.I need a critique of the saint--Hegel's value. \"Passion.\"--Shopkeeper's philosophy of Mr. Spencer; complete absence of an ideal, except that of the mediocre man.Fundamental instinctive principle of all philosophers and historians andpsychologists: everything of value in man, art, history, science, religion, technology must be proved to be of moral value, morally conditioned, in aim, means and outcome. Everything understood in the light of the supreme value: e. g., Rousseau's question concerning civilization: \"Does man become better through it?\"--an amusing question,"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"since the reverse is obvious and is precisely that which speaks in favorof civilization.383 (March-June 1888)Religious morality.-- Affect, great desire, the passion for power, love,revenge, possessions--: moralists want to extinguish and uproot them, to\"purify\" the soul of them.The logic is: the desires often produce great misfortune--consequently they are evil, reprehensible. A man must free himself from them: otherwise he cannot be a good man--This is the same logic as: \"if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out.: In the particular case in which that dangerous \"innocent from the country,\" the founder of Christianity, recommended this practice to his disciples, the case of sexual excitation, the consequence is, unfortunately, not only the loss of an organ but the emasculation of a man's character-- And the same applies to the moralist's madness that demands, instead of the restraining of the passions, their extirpation. Its conclusion is always: only the castrated man is a good man.Instead of taking into service the great sources of strength, those impetuous torrents of the soul that are so often dangerous and overwhelming, and economizing them, this most shortsighted and pernicious mode of thought, the moral mode of thought, wants to make them dry up.384 (1885-1886)Overcoming of the affects?-- No, if what is implied is their weakening and extirpation. But putting them into service: which may also mean subjecting them to a protracted tyranny (not only as an individual, but as a community, race, etc.). At last they are confidently granted freedom again: they love us as good servants and go voluntarily whereverour best interests lie.385 (Spring-Fall 1887)Moral intolerance is an expression of weakness in a man: he is afraid ofhis own \"immorality,\" he must deny his strongest drives because he does not yet know how to employ them. Thus the most fruitful regions of the earth remain uncultivated the longest:-- the force is lacking that couldhere become master--386 (Spring-Fall 1887)There are very naive people and men who believe that continual fine weather is something desirable: even today they believe, in rebus moralibus, [Moral matters.] that the \"good man,\" and nothing but the \"good man,\" is something desirable--and that the course of human evolution is directed toward the survival of the \"good man\" only (and that one must bend all one's efforts in that direction--). This is in the highest degree an uneconomic thought and, as stated, the acme of naïveté, nothing but the expression of the pleasing effect produced by the \"good man\" (he arouses no fear, he permits one to relax, he gives what one is able to take).From a superior viewpoint one desires the contrary: the ever-increasing dominion of evil, the growing emancipation of man from the narrow and fear-ridden bonds of morality, the increase of force, in order to press"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"the mightiest natural powers--the affects--into service.387 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)The whole conception of an order of rank among the passions: as if the right and normal thing were for one to be guided by reason--with the passions as abnormal, dangerous, semi-animal, and, moreover, so far as their aim is concerned, nothing other than desires for pleasure--Passion is degraded (1) as if it were only in unseemly cases, and not necessarily and always, the motive force; (2) in as much as it has for its object something of no great value, amusement--The misunderstanding of passion and reason, as if the latter were an independent entity and not rather a system of relations between various passions and desires; and as if every passion did not possess its quantum of reason--388 (Spring-Fall 1887)How, under the impress of the ascetic morality of depersonalization, it was precisely the affects of love, goodness, pity, even those of justice, magnanimity, heroism, that were necessarily misunderstood:It is richness in personality, abundance in oneself, overflowing and bestowing, instinctive good health and affirmation of oneself, that produce great sacrifice and great love: it is strong and godlike selfhood from which these affects grow, just as surely as did the desireto become master, encroachment, the inner certainty of having a right toeverything. What according to common ideas are opposite dispositions arerather one disposition; and if one is not firm and brave within oneself,one has nothing to bestow and cannot stretch our one's hand to protect and support--How was one able so to transform these instincts that man thought valuable that which was directed against his self? when he sacrificed his self to another self. Oh the psychological wretchedness and mendaciousness that has hitherto laid down the law in the church and in church-infected philosophy!If man is sinful through and through, then he ought only to hate himself. Fundamentally, he would have to treat his fellow men on the same basis as he treats himself; charity needs to be justified--its justification lies in the fact that God has commanded it.-- It follows from this, that all the natural instincts of man (the instinct of love, etc.) appear to be forbidden in themselves and only after they have beendenied are they restored to their rights on the basis of obedience to God--Pascal, the admirable logician of Christianity, went so far! consider his relations to his sister. \"Not to make oneself love\" seemed Christian to him.D. Critique of the Words: Improvement, Perfecting, Elevation398 (Jan.-Fall 1888)What I want to make clear by all the means in my power:a. that there is no worse confusion than the confusion of breeding with taming: which is what has been done-- Breeding, as I understand it, is ameans of storing up the tremendous forces of mankind so that the generations can build upon the work of their forefathers--not only"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"outwardly, but inwardly, organically growing out of them and becoming something stronger--b. that it is extraordinarily dangerous to believe that mankind as a whole will progress and grow stronger if individuals become flabby, equal, average-- Mankind is an abstraction: the goal of breeding, even in the case of a single individual, can only be the stronger man (--the man without breeding is weak, extravagant, unstable--).6. Further Considerations for a Critique of MoralityIII. Critique of Philosophy1. General Observations410 (1885-1886) For the PrefaceDeeply mistrustful of the dogmas of epistemology, I loved to look now out of this window, now out of that; I guarded against settling down with any of these dogmas, considered them harmful--and finally: is it likely that a tool is able to criticize its own fitness?-- What I noticed was rather that no epistemological skepticism or dogmatism had ever arisen free from ulterior motives--that it acquires a value of the second rank as soon as one has considered what it was that compelled theadoption of this point of view.Fundamental insight: Kant as well as Hegel and Schopenhauer--the skeptical-epochistic attitude as will as the historicizing, as well as the pessimistic--have a moral origin. I saw no one who had ventured a critique of moral value feelings: and I soon turned my back one the meager attempts made to arrive at a description of the origin of these feelings (as by the English and German Darwinists).How can Spinoza's position, his denial and rejection of moral value judgments, be explained? (It was one consequence of his theodicy!)413 (1885)Ulterior moral motives have hitherto most obstructed the course of philosophy.423 (March-June 1888)Theory and practice.-- Fateful distinction, as if there were an actual drive for knowledge that, without regard to questions of usefulness and harm, went blindly for the truth; and then, separate from this, the whole world of practical interests--I tried to show, on the other hand, what instincts have been active behind all these pure theoreticians--how they have all, under the spell of their instincts, gone fatalistically for something that was \"truth\" for them--for them and only for them. The conflict between different systems, including that between epistemological scruples, is a conflict between quite definite instincts (forms of vitality, decline, classes, races, etc.).The so-called drive for knowledge can be traced back to a drive to appropriate and conquer: the senses, the memory, the instincts, etc. have developed as a consequence of this drive. The quickest possible reduction of the phenomena, economy, the accumulation of the spoils of knowledge (i. e., of world appropriated and made manageable)--"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Morality is such a curious science because it is in the highest degree practical: so that the position of pure knowledge, scientific integrity,is at once abandoned as soon as the claims of morality must be answered.Morality says: I need many answers--reasons, arguments; scruples can come afterward, or not at all--.\"How should one act?\"-- If one considers that one is dealing with a sovereignly developed type that has \"acted\" for countless millennia, andin which everything has become instinct, expediency, automatism, fatality, then the urgency of this moral question must actually seem ridiculous.\"How should one act?\"-- Morality has always been a misunderstanding: in reality, a species fated to act in this or that fashion wanted to justify itself, by dictating its norm as the universal norm--\"How should one act?\" is not a cause but an effect. Morality follows, the ideal comes at the end.--On the other hand, the appearance of moral scruples (in other words: the becoming-conscious of the values by which one acts) betrays a certain sickliness; strong ages and peoples do not reflect on their rights, on the principles on which they act, on their instincts and reasons. Becoming-conscious is a sign that real morality, i. e., instinctive certainty in actions, is going to the devil-- Every time a new world of consciousness is created, the moralists are a sign of damage, impoverishment, disorganization.-- The deeply instinctive are shy of logicizing duties: among them are found Pyrrhic opponents of dialectics and of knowability in general-- A virtue is refuted with a \"for\"--Thesis: the appearance of moralists belongs to an age in which morality is coming to an end.Thesis: the moralist disintegrates the moral instincts, however much he may suppose himself to be their restorer.Thesis: that which really drives the moralist is not the moral instinctsbut the instincts of decadence translated into the formulas of morality-- (he regards it as corruption when the instincts become uncertain).Thesis: the instincts of decadence, which, through the moralists, want to become master over the instinctive morality of strong races and ages,are1. the instincts of the weak and underprivileged;2. the instincts of the exceptions, the solitaries, the abandoned, of the abortus [Abortion.] in what is lofty and what is petty.3. the instincts of those habituated to suffering, who need a noble interpretation of their condition and therefore must know as little as possible about physiology.2. Critique of Greek Philosophy428 (March-June 1888)How far psychologists have been corrupted by the moral idiosyncrasy:--not one of the ancient philosophers had the courage for a theory of the \"unfree will\" (i. e., for a theory that denies morality);--no one had"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"the courage to define the typical element in pleasure, every sort of pleasure (\"happiness\") as the feeling of power: for to take pleasure in power was considered immoral;--no one had the courage to conceive virtueas a consequence of immorality (of a will to power) in the service of the species (or of the race or polis), for the will to power was considered immorality.In the entire evolution of morality, truth never appears: all the conceptual elements employed are fictions; all the psychologica acceptedare falsifications; all the forms of logic dragged into this realm of lies are sophistries. What distinguishes moral philosophers themselves is a complete absence of cleanliness and intellectual self-discipline: they take \"beautiful feelings\" for arguments: they regard their \"heavingbosom\" as the bellows of divinity-- Moral philosophy is the scabrous period in the history of the spirit.The first great example: in the name of morality, under the patronage ofmorality, an unheard-of wrong was perpetrated, in fact a piece of decadence in every respect. One cannot insist too strongly upon the factthat the great Greek philosophers represent the decadence of every kind of Greek excellence and make it contagious-- \"Virtue\" made completely abstract was the greatest seduction to make oneself abstract: i. e., to detach oneself.It is a very remarkable moment: the Sophists verge upon the first critique of morality, the first insight into morality:--they juxtapose the multiplicity (the geographical relativity) of the moral value judgments;--they let it be known that every morality can be dialectically justified; i. e., they divine that all attempts to give reasons for morality are necessarily sophistical--a proposition later proved on the grand scale by the ancient philosophers, from Plato onwards (down to Kant);--they postulate the first truth that a \"morality-in-itself,\" a \"good-in-itself\" do not exist, that it is a swindle to talk of \"truth\" in this field.Where was intellectual integrity in those days?The Greek culture of the Sophists had developed out of all the Greek instincts; it belongs to the culture of the Periclean age as necessarilyas Plato does not: it has its predecessors in Heraclitus, in Democritus,in the scientific types of the old philosophy; it finds expression in, e. g., the high culture of Thucydides. And--it has ultimately shown itself to be right: every advance in epistemological and moral knowledgehas reinstated the Sophists-- Our contemporary way of thinking is to a great extent Heraclitean, Democritean, and Protagorean: it suffices to say Protagorean, because Protagoras represented a synthesis of Heraclitus and Democritus.(Plato: a great Cagliostro--remember how Epicurus judged him; how Timon,the friend of Pyrrho, judged him--— Is Plato's integrity beyond question?-- But we know at least that he wanted to have taught as absolute truth what he himself did not regard as even conditionally true: namely, the separate existence and separate immortality of \"souls.\")430 (March-June 1888)The great rationality of all education in morality has always been that one tried to attain to the certainty of an instinct: so that neither good intentions nor good means had to enter consciousness as such. As the soldier exercises, so should man learn to act. In fact, this"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"unconsciousness belongs to any kind of perfection: even the mathematician employs his combinations unconsciously--What, then, is the significance of the reaction of Socrates, who recommended dialectics as the road to virtue and made mock when moralitydid not know how to justify itself logically?-- As if this were not partof its value--without consciousness it is no good--Positing proofs as the presupposition for personal excellence in virtue signified nothing less than the disintegration of Greek instincts. They are themselves types of disintegration, all these great \"virtuous men\" and word-spinners.In praxi, this means that moral judgments are torn from their conditionality, in which they have grown and alone possess any meaning, from their Greek and Greek-political ground and soil, to be denaturalized under the pretense of sublimation. The great concepts \"good\" and \"just\" are severed from the presuppositions to which they belong and, as liberated \"ideas,\" become objects of dialectic. One looksfor truth in them, one takes them for entities or signs of entities: oneinvents a world where they are at home, where they originate--In summa: the mischief has already reached its climax in Plato-- And then one had need to invent the abstractly perfect man as well:--good, just, wise, a dialectician--in short, the scarecrow of the ancient philosopher: a plant removed from all soil; a humanity without any particular regulating instincts; a virtue that \"proves\" itself with reasons. The perfectly absurd \"individuum\" in itself! unnaturalness of the first water--In short, the consequence of the denaturalization of moral values was the creation of a degenerate type of man--\"the good man,\" \"the happy man,\" \"the wise man.\"-- Socrates represents a moment of the profoundest perversity in the history of values.440 (Jan.-Fall 1888)When morality--that is to say subtlety, caution, bravery, equity--has been as it were stored up through the practice of a whole succession of generations, then the total force of this accumulated virtue radiates even into that sphere where integrity is most seldom found, into the spiritual sphere. In all becoming-conscious there is expressed a discomfiture of the organism; it has to try something new, nothing is sufficiently adapted for it, there is toil, tension, strain--all this constitutes becoming-conscious--Genius resides in instinct; goodness likewise. One acts perfectly only when one acts instinctively. Even from the viewpoint of morality, all conscious thinking is merely tentative, usually the reverse of morality.Scientific integrity is always ruptured when the thinker begins to reason: try the experiment of putting the wisest men on the most delicate scales by making them talk about morality--It could be proved that all conscious thinking would also show a far lower standard of morality than the thinking of the same man when it is directed by his instincts.3.

Our inner world, too, \"appearance\"!477 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)I maintain the phenomenality of the inner world, too: everything of which we become conscious is arranged, simplified, schematized, interpreted through and through--the actual process of inner \"perception,\" the causal connection between thoughts, feelings, desires,between subject and object, are absolutely hidden from us--and are perhaps purely imaginary. The \"apparent inner world\" is governed by justthe same forms and procedures as the \"outer\" world. We never encounter \"facts\": pleasure and displeasure are subsequent and derivative intellectual phenomena--\"Causality\" eludes us; to suppose a direct causal link beween thoughts, as logic does--that is the consequence of the crudest and clumsiest observation. Between two thoughts all kinds of affects play their game: but their motions are too fast, therefore we fail to recognize them, we deny them--\"Thinking,\" as epistemologists conceive it, simply does not occur: it isa quite arbitrary fiction, arrived at by selecting one element from the process and eliminating all the rest, an artificial arrangement for the purpose of intelligibility--The \"spirit,\" something that thinks: where possible even \"absolute, purespirit\"--this conception is a second derivative of that false introspection which believes in \"thinking\": first an act is imagined which simply does not occur, \"thinking,\" and secondly a subject-substratum in which every act of thinking, and nothing else, has its origin: that is to say, both the deed and the doer are fictions.478 (March-June 1888)One must not look for phenomenalism in the wrong place: nothing is more phenomenal (or, more clearly:) nothing is so much deception as this inner world which we observe with the famous \"inner sense.\"We have believed in the will as cause to such an extent that we have from our personal experience introduced a cause into events in general (i. e., intention a cause of events--).We believe that thoughts as they succeed one another in our minds stand in some kind of causal relation: the logician especially, who actually speaks of nothing but instances which never occur in reality, has grown"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"accustomed to the prejudice that thoughts cause thoughts--.We believe--and even our philosopers still believe--that pleasure and pain are causes of reactions, that the purpose of pleasure and pain is to occasion reactions.

Upon reflection, however, we should concede that everything would have taken the same course, according to exactly the same sequence of causes and effects, if these states of \"pleasure and displeasure\" had been absent, and that one is simply deceiving oneself if one thinks they cause anything at all: they are epiphenomena with a quite different object than to evoke reactions; they are themselves effects within the instituted process of reaction.In summa: everything of which we become conscious is a terminal phenomenon, an end--and causes nothing; every successive phenomenon in consciousness is completely atomistic--And we have sought to understand the world through the reverse conception--as if nothing were real and effective but thinking, feeling, willing!--479 (Jan.-Fall 1888)The phenomenalism of the \"inner world.\" Chronological inversion, so thatthe cause enters consciousness later than the effect.--We have learned that pain is projected to a part of the body without being situated there--we have learned that sense impressions naively supposed to be conditioned by the outer world are, on the contrary, conditioned by the inner world; that we are always unconscious of the real activity of the outer world--The fragment of outer world of which we are conscious is born after an effect from outside has impressed itself upon us, and is subsequently projected as its \"cause\"--In the phenomenalism of the \"inner world\" we invert the chronological order of cause and effect. The fundamental fact of \"inner experience\" isthat the cause is imagined after the effect has taken place--The same applies to the succession of thoughts: --we seek the reason for a thought before we are conscious of it; and the reason enters consciousness first, and then its consequence--Our entire dream life is the interpretation of complex feelings with a view to possible causes--and in such way that we are conscious of a condition only when the supposed causal chain associated with it has entered consciousness.The whole of \"inner experience\" rests upon the fact that a cause for an excitement of the nerve centers is sought and imagined --and that only acause thus discovered enters consciousness: this cause in no way corresponds to the real cause--it is a groping on the basis of previous \"inner experiences,\" i. e., of memory. But memory also maintains the habit of the old interpretations, i. e., of erroneous causality--so thatthe \"inner experience\" has to contain within it the consequences of all previous false causal fictions. Our \"outer world\" as we project it everymoment is indissolubly tied to the old error of the ground: we interpretit by means of the schematism of \"things,\" etc.\"Inner experience\" enters our consciousness only after it has found a language the individual understands--i. e., a translation of a conditioninto conditions familiar to him--; \"to understand\" means merely: to be able to express something new in the language of something old and familiar.

There is no question of \"subject and object,\" but of a particular species of animal that can prosper only through a certain relative rightness; above all, regularity of its perceptions (so that itcan accumulate experience)--Knowledge works as a tool of power. Hence it is plain that it increases with every increase of power--The meaning of \"knowledge\": here, as in the case of \"good\" or \"beautiful\", the concept is to be regarded in a strict and narrow anthropocentric and biological sense. In order for a particular species to maintain itself and increase its power, its conception of reality must comprehend enough of the calculable and constant for it to base a scheme of behavior on it. The utility of preservation --not some abstract-theoretical need not to be deceived--stands as the motive behind the development of the organs of knowledge--they develop in such a way that their observations suffice for our preservation. In other words: the measure of the desire for knowledge depends upon the measure to which the will to power grows in a species: a species grasps a certain amount of reality in order to become master of it, in order to press it into service.3. Belief in the \"Ego.\" The Subject481 (1883-1888)Against positivism, which halts at phenomena--\"There are only facts\"--I would say: No, facts is precisely what there is not, only interpretations. We cannot establish any fact \"in itself\": perhaps it isfolly to want to do such a thing.\"Everything is subjective,\" you say; but even this is interpretation. The \"subject\" is not something given, it is something added and inventedand projected behind what there is.--Finally, is it necessary to posit an interpreter behind the interpretation? Even this is invention, hypothesis.In so far as the word \"knowledge\" has any meaning, the world is knowable; but it is interpretable otherwise, it has no meaning behind it, but countless meanings.--\"Perspectivism.\"It is our needs that interpret the world; our drives and their For and Against. Every drive is a kind of lust to rule; each one has its perspective that it would like to compel all the other drives to accept as a norm.482 (1886-1887)We set up a word at the point at which our ignorance begins, at which wecan see no further, e. g., the word \"I,\" the word \"do,\" the word \"suffer\":--these are perhaps the horizon of our knowledge, but not \"truths.\""},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"483 (1885)Through thought the ego is posited; but hitherto one believed as ordinary people do, that in \"I think\" there was something of immediate certainty, and that this \"I\" was the given cause of thought, from which by analogy we understood all other causal relationships. However habitual and indispensable this fiction may have become by now--that in itself proves nothing against its imaginary origin: a belief can be a condition of life and nonetheless be false.484 (Spring-Fall 1887)\"There is thinking: therefore there is something that thinks\": this is the upshot of all Descartes' argumentation. But that means positing as \"true à priori\" our belief in the concept of substance-- that when thereis thought there has to be something \"that thinks\" is simply a formulation of our grammatical custom that adds a doer to every deed. Inshort, this is not merely the substantiation of a fact but a logical-metaphysical postulate--Along the lines followed by Descartes one does not come upon something absolutely certain but only upon the fact of a very strong belief.If one reduces the proposition to \"There is thinking, therefore there are thoughts,\" one has produced a mere tautology: and precisely that which is in question, the \"reality of thought,\" is not touched upon--that is, in this form the \"apparent reality\" of thought cannot be denied. But what Descartes desired was that thought should have, not an apparent reality, but a reality in itself.485 (Spring-Fall 1887)The concept of substance is a consequence of the concept of the subject:not the reverse! If we relinquish the soul, \"the subject,\" the precondition for \"substance\" in general disappears. One acquires degreesof being, one loses that which has being.Critique of \"reality\": where does the \"more or less real,\" the gradationof being in which we believe, lead to?--The degree to which we feel life and power (logic and coherence of experience) gives us our measure of \"being\", \"reality\", not appearance.The subject: this is the term for our belief in a unity underlying all the different impulses of the highest feeling of reality: we understand this belief as the effect of one cause--we believe so firmly in our belief that for its sake we imagine \"truth\", \"reality\", substantiality in general.-- \"The subject\" is the fiction that many similar states in us are the effect of one substratum: but it is we who first created the \"similarity\" of these states; our adjusting them and making them similaris the fact, not their similarity (--which ought rather to be denied--).486 (1885-1886)One would have to know what being is, in order to decide whether this orthat is real (e. g., \"the facts of consciousness\"); in the same way, what certainty is, what knowledge is, and the like.-- But since we do not know this, a critique of the faculty of knowledge is senseless: how should a tool be able to criticize itself when it can use only itself for the critique? It cannot even define itself!487 (1883-1886)"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Must all philosophy not ultimately bring to light the preconditions uponwhich the process of reason depends?--our belief in the \"ego\" as a substance, as the sole reality from which we ascribe reality to things in general? The oldest \"realism\" at last comes to light: at the same time that the entire religious history of mankind is recognized as the history of the soul superstition. Here we come to a limit: our thinking itself involves this belief (with its distinction of substance, accident; deed, doer, etc.); to let it go means: being no longer able tothink.But that a belief, however necessary it may be for the preservation of aspecies, has nothing to do with truth, one knows from the fact that, e. g., we have to believe in time, space, and motion, without feeling compelled to grant them absolute reality.488 (Spring-Fall 1887)Psychological derivation of our belief in reason.--The concept \"reality\", \"being\", is taken from our feeling of the \"subject\".\"The subject\": interpreted from within ourselves, so that the ego countsas a substance, as the cause of all deeds, as a doer.The logical-metaphysical postulates, the belief in substance, accident, attribute, etc., derive their convincing force from our habit of regarding all our deeds as consequences of our will--so that the ego, assubstance, does not vanish in the multiplicity of change.--But there is no such thing as will.--We have no categories at all that permit us to distinguish a \"world in itself\" from a \"world of appearance.\" All our categories of reason are of sensual origin: derived from the empirical world. \"The soul\", \"the ego\"--the history of these concepts shows that here, too, the oldest distinction (\"breath\", \"life\")--If there is nothing material, there is also nothing immaterial. The concept no longer contains anything.No subject \"atoms\". The sphere of a subject constantly growing or decreasing, the center of the system constantly shifting; in cases whereit cannot organize the appropriate mass, it breaks into two parts. On the other hand, it can transform a weaker subject into its functionary without destroying it, and to a certain degree form a new unity with it.No \"substance\", rather something that in itself strives after greater strength, and that wants to \"preserve\" itself only indirectly (it wants to surpass itself--).489 (1886-1887)Everyting that enters consciousness as \"unity\" is already tremendously complex: we always have only a semblance of Unity.The phenomenon of the body is the richer, clearer, more tangible phenomenon: to be discussed first, methodologically, without coming to any decision about its ultimate significance.490 (1885)The assumption of one single subject is perhaps unnecessary; perhaps it is just as permissible to assume a multiplicity of subjects, whose"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"interaction and struggle is the basis of our thought and our consciousness in general?

Belief in the truth of dreams--).492 (1885)The body and physiology the starting point: why?--We gain the correct idea of the nature of our subject-unity, namely as regents at the head of a communality (not as \"souls\" or \"life forces\"), also of the dependence of these regents upon the ruled and of an order of rank and division of labor as the conditions that make possible the whole and itsparts. In the same way, how living unities continually arise and die andhow the \"subject\" is not eternal; in the same way, that the struggle expresses itself in obeying and commanding, and that a fluctuating assessment of the limits of power is part of life. The relative ignorance in which the regent is kept concerning individual activities and even disturbances within the communality is among the conditions under which rule can be exercised. In short, we also gain a valuation ofnot-knowing, of seeing things on a broad scale, of simplification and falsification, of perspectivity. The most important thing, however, is: that we understand that the ruler and his subjects are of the same kind,all feeling, willing, thinking--and that, wherever we see or divine movement in a body, we learn to conclude that there is a subjective, invisible life appertaining to it. Movement is symbolism for the eye; itindicates that something has been felt, willed, thought.The danger of the direct questioning of the subject about the subject and of all self-reflection of the spirit lies in this, that it could be useful and important for one's activity to interpret oneself falsely. That is why we question the body and reject the evidence of the sharpened senses: we try, if you like, to see whether the inferior partsthemselves cannot enter into communication with us.4.

Morphology shows us howthe senses and the nerves, as well as the brain, develop in proportion to the difficulty of finding nourishment.495If the morality of \"thou shalt not lie\" is rejected, the \"sense for truth\" will have to legitimize itself before another tribunal:-- as a means of the preservation of man, as will to power.Likewise our love of the beautiful: it also is our shaping will. The twosenses stand side-by-side; the sense for the real is the means of acquiring the power to shape things according to our wish. The joy in shaping and reshaping--a primeval joy!

To trace one's own relationship tomany other things (or the relationship of kind)-- how should that be \"knowledge\" of other things!

Consciousness is present only to the extent that consciousness is useful. It cannot be doubted that all senseperceptions are permeated with value judgments (useful and harmful--consequently, pleasant or unpleasant). Each individual color is also forus an expression of value (although we seldom admit it, or do so only after a protracted impression of exclusively the same color; e. g., a prisoner in prison, or a lunatic).

Origin of Reason and Logic508 (1883-1888)Originally a chaos of ideas. The ideas that were consistent with one another remained, the greater number perished--and are perishing.509 (1883-1888)The earthly kingdom of desires out of which logic grew: the herd instinct in the background. The assumption of similar cases presupposes \"similar souls.\" For the purpose of mutual agreement and dominion.510 (1883-1888)On the origin of logic. The fundamental inclination to posit as equal, to see things as equal, is modified, held in check, by consideration of usefulness and harmfulness, by considerations of success: it adapts itself to a milder degree in which it can be satisfied without at the same time denying and endangering life.

The coarser organ sees much apparent equality;2. the spirit wants equality, i. e., to subsume a sense impression into an existing series: in the same way as the body assimilates inorganic matter.Toward an understanding of logic: the will to equality is the will to power--the belief that something is thus and thus (the essence of judgment) is the consequence of a will that as much as possible shall beequal.512 (1885)Logic is bound to the condition: assume there are identical cases. In fact, to make possible logical thinking and inferences, this condition must first be treated fictitously as fulfilled. That is: the will to logical truth can be carried through only after a fundamental falsification of all events is assumed. From which it follows that a drive rules here that is capable of employing both means, firstly falsification, then the implementation of its own point of view: logic does not spring from will to truth.513 (Fall 1886)The inventive force that invented categories labored in the service of our needs, namely of our need for security, for quick understanding on the basis of signs and sounds, for means of abbreviation:--\"substance\", \"subject\", \"object\", \"being\", \"becoming\" have nothing to do with metaphysical truths.--It is the powerful who made the names of things into law, and among the powerful it is the greatest artists in abstraction who created the categories.514 (March-June 1888)A morality, a mode of living, tried and proved by long experience and testing, at length enters consciousness as a law, as dominating--And therewith the entire group of related values and states enters into it: it becomes venerable, unassailable, holy, true; it is part of its development that its origin should be forgotten.-- That is a sign it hasbecome master--Exactly the same thing could have happened with the categories of reason: they could have prevailed, after much groping and fumbling, through their relative utility--There came a point when one collected them together, raised them to consciousness as a whole--and when one commanded them, i. e., when they had the effect of a command--From then on, they counted as à priori, as beyond experience, as irrefutable. And yet perhaps they represent nothing more than the expediency of a certainrace and species --their utility alone is their \"truth\"--515 (March-June 1888)Not \"to know\" but to schematize to impose upon chaos as much regularity and form as our practical needs require."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"In the formation of reason, logic, the categories, it was need that was authoritative: the need, not to \"know,\" but to subsume, to schematize, for the purpose of intelligibility and calculation--(The development of reason is adjustment, invention, with the aim of making similar, equal--the same process that every sense impression goes through!) No pre-existing \"idea\" was here at work, but the utilitarian fact that only when we see things coarsely and made equal do they become calculable andusable to us--Finality in reason is an effect, not a cause: life miscarries with any other kinds of reason, to which there is a continualimpulse--it becomes difficult to survey--too unequal--The categories are \"truths\"' only in the sense that they are conditions of life for us: as Euclidean space is a conditional \"truth.\" (Between ourselves: since no one would maintain that there is any necessity for men to exist, reason, as well as Euclidean space, is a mere idiosyncracyof a certain species of animal, and one among many--)The subjective compulsion not to contradict here is a biological compulsion: the instinct for the utility of inferring as we do infer is part of us, we almost are this instinct--But what naivete to extract from this a proof that we are therewith in possession of a \"truth in itself\"!--Not being able to contradict is proof of an incapacity, not of\"truth.\"516 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)We are unable to affirm and to deny one and the same thing: this is a subjective empirical law, not the expression of any \"necessity\" but onlyof an inability.If, according to Aristotle, the law of contradiction is the most certainof all principles, if it is the ultimate and most basic, upon which every demonstrative proof rests, if the principle of every axiom lies init; then one should consider all the more rigorously what presuppositions already lie at the bottom of it. Either it asserts something about. actuality, about being, as if one already knew this from another source; that is, as if opposite attributes could not be ascribed to it. Or the proposition means: opposite attributes should notbe ascribed to it. In that case, logic would be an imperative, not to know the true, but to posit and arrange a world that shall be called true by us.In short, the question remains open: are the axioms of logic adequate toreality or are they a means and measure for us to create reality, the concept \"reality,\" for ourselves.?--To affirm the former one would, as already said, have to have a previous knowledge of being--which is certainly not the case. The proposition therefore contains no criterion of truth, but an imperative concerning that which should count as true.Supposing there were no self-identical \"A\", such as is presupposed by every proposition of logic (and of mathematics), and the \"A\" were already mere appearance, then logic would have a merely apparent world as its condition. In fact, we believe in this proposition under the influence of ceaseless experience which seems continually to confirrn it. The \"thing\"--that is the real substratum of \"A\"; our belief in things is the precondition of our belief in logic. The \"A\" of logic is, like the atom, a reconstruction of the thing--If we do not grasp this, but make of logic a criterion of true being, we are on the way to positing as realities all those hypostases: substance, attribute, object, subject, action, etc.; that is, to conceiving a metaphysical world, that is, a \"real world\" (--this, however, is the apparent world"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"once more--).The very first acts of thought, affirmation and denial, holding true andholding not true, are, in as much as they presuppose, not only the habitof holding things true and holding them not true, but a right to do this, already dominated by the belief that we can gain possession of knowledge, that judgments really can hit upon the truth;--in short, logic does not doubt its ability to assert something about the true-in-itself (namely, that it cannot have opposite attributes).Here reigns the coarse sensualistic prejudice that sensations teach us truths about things--that I cannot say at the same time of one and the same thing that it is hard and that it is soft. (The instinctive proof \"I cannot have two opposite sensations at the same time\"--quite coarse and false.)The conceptual ban on contradiction proceeds from the belief that we areable to form concepts, that the concept not only designates the essence of a thing but comprehends it--In fact, logic (like geometry and arithmetic) applies only to fictitious entities that we have created. Logic is the attempt to comprehend the actual world by means of a schemeof being posited by ourselves; more correctly, to make it formulatable and calculable for us--517 (Spring-Fall 1887)In order to think and infer it is necessary to assume beings: logic handles only formulas for what remains the same. That is why this assumption would not be proof of reality: \"beings\" are part of our perspective. The \"ego\" as a being (--not affected by becoming and development).The fictitious world of subject, substance, \"reason\" etc., is needed--: there is in us a power to order, simplify, falsify, artificially distinguish. \"Truth\" is the will to be master over the multiplicity of sensations:--to classify phenomena into definite categories. In this we start from a belief in the \"in-itself\" of things (we take phenomena as real).The character of the world in a state of becoming as incapable of formulation, as \"false,\" as \"'self-contradictory.\" Knowledge and becoming exclude one another. Consequently, \"knowledge\" must be something else: there must first of all be a will to make knowable, a kind of becoming must itself create the deception of beings.518 (1885-1886)If our \"ego\" is for us the sole being, after the model of which we fashion and understand all being: very well! Then there would be very much room to doubt whether what we have here is not a perspective illusion--an apparent unity that encloses everything like a horizon. Theevidence of the body reveals a tremendous multiplicity; it is allowable,for purposes of method, to employ the more easily studied, richer phenomena as evidence for the understanding of the poorer. Finally: supposing everything is becoming, then knowledge is possible only on thebasis of belief in being.519 (1883-1888)If there \"is only one being, the ego\" and all other \"being\" is fashionedafter its model--if, finally, belief in the \"ego\" stands or falls with"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"belief in logic, i. e., the metaphysical truth of the categories of reason; if, on the other hand, the ego proves to be something in a stateof becoming: then--520 (1885)Continual transition forbids us to speak of \"individuals,\" etc; the \"number\" of beings is itself in flux. We would know nothing of time and motion if we did not, in a coarse fashion, believe we see what is at \"rest\" beside what is in motion. The same applies to cause and effect, and without the erroneous conception of \"empty space\" we should certainly not have acquired the conception of space. The principle of identity has behind it the \"apparent fact\" of things that are the same. A world in a state of becoming could not, in a strict sense, be \"comprehended\" or \"known\"; only to the extent that the \"comprehending\" and \"knowing\" intellect encounters a coarse, already-created world, fabricated out of mere appearances but become firm to the extent that this kind of appearance has preserved life--only to this extent is thereanything like \"knowledge\"; i. e., a measuring of earlier and later errors by one another.521 (Spring-Fall 1887)On \"logical semblance\"-- The concepts \"individual\" and \"species\" equallyfalse and merely apparent. \"Species\" expresses only the fact that an abundance of similar creatures appear at the same time and that the tempo of their further growth and change is for a long time slowed down,so actual small continuations and increases are not very much noticed (--a phase of evolution in which the evolution is not visible, so an equilibrium seems to have been attained, making possible the false notion that a goal has been attained--and that evolution has a goal--).The form counts as something enduring and therefore more valuable; but the form has merely been invented by us; and however often \"the same form is attained,\" it does not mean that it is the same form--what appears is always something new, and it is only we, who are always comparing, who include the new, to the extent that it is similar to the old, in the unity of the \"form.\" As if a type should be attained and, asit were, was intended by and inherent in the process of formation.Form, species, law, idea, purpose--in all these cases the same error is made of giving a false reality to a fiction, as if events were in some way obedient to something--an artificial distinction is made in respect of events between that which acts and that toward which the act is directed (but this \"which\" and this \"toward\" are only posited in obedience to our metaphysical-logical dogmatism: they are not \"facts\").One should not understand this compulsion to construct concepts, species, forms, purposes, laws (\"a world of identical cases\") as if theyenabled us to fix the real world; but as a compulsion to arrange a worldfor ourselves in which our existence is made possible:--we thereby create a world which is calculable, simplified, comprehensible, etc., for us.This same compulsion exists in the sense activities that support reason--by simplification, coarsening, emphasizing, and elaborating, upon which all \"recognition,\" all ability to make oneself intelligible rests. Our needs have made our senses so precise that the \"same apparentworld\" always reappears and has thus acquired the semblance of reality.Our subjective compulsion to believe in logic only reveals that, long"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"before logic itself entered our consciousness, we did nothing but introduce its postulates into events: now we discover them in events--wecan no longer do otherwise--and imagine that this compulsion guarantees something connected with \"truth.\" It is we who created the \"thing,\" the \"identical thing,\" subject, attribute, activity, object, substance, form, after we had long pursued the process of making identical, coarse and simple. The world seems logical to us because we have made it logical.522 (1886-1887)Ultimate solution.--We believe in reason: this, however, is the philosophy of gray concepts. Language depends on the most naive prejudices.Now we read disharmonies and problems into things because we think only in the form of language--and thus believe in the \"eternal truth\" of \"reason\" (e. g., subject, attribute, etc.)We cease to think when we refuse to do so under the constraint of language; we barely reach the doubt that sees this limitation as a limitation.Rational thought is interpretation according to a scheme that we cannot throw off..6. Consciousness523 (March-June 1888)Nothing is more erroneous than to make of psychical and physical phenomena the two faces, the two revelations of one and the same substance. Nothing is explained thereby: the concept \"substance\" is perfectly useless as an explanation. Consciousness in a subsidiary role,almost indifferent, superfluous, perhaps destined to vanish and give wayto a perfect automatism--When we observe only the inner phenomena we may be compared with the deaf-and-dumb, who divine through movements of the lips the words they do not hear. From the phenomena of the inner sense we conclude the existence of invisible and other phenomena that we would apprehend if our means of observation were adequate and that one calls the nerve current.We lack any sensitive organs for this inner world, so we sense a thousandfold complexity as a unity; so we introduce causation where any reason for motion and change remains invisible to us --the sequence of thoughts and feelings is only their becoming visible in consciousness. That this sequence has anything to do with a causal chain is completely unbelievable: consciousness has never furnished us with an example of cause and effect.524 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)The role of \"consciousness.\"--It is essential that one should not make amistake over the role of \"consciousness\": it is our relation with the \"outer world\" that evolved it. On the other hand, the direction or protection and care in respect of the co-ordination of the bodily functions does not enter our consciousness; any more than spiritual accumulation: that a higher court rules over these things cannot be doubted--a kind of directing committee on which the various chief"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"desires make their votes and power felt. \"Pleasure,\" \"displeasure\" are hints from this sphere; also the act of will; also ideas.In summa: That which becomes conscious is involved in causal relations which are entirely withheld from us--the sequence of thoughts, feelings,ideas in consciousness does not signify that this sequence is a causal sequence; but apparently it is so, to the highest degree. Upon this appearance we have founded our whole idea of spirit, reason, logic, etc.(--none of these exist: they are fictitious syntheses and unities), and projected these into things and behind things!Usually, one takes consciousness itself as the general sensorium and supreme court; nonetheless, it is only a means of communication: it is evolved through social intercourse and with a view to the interests of social intercourse--\"Intercourse\" here understood to include the influences of the outer world and the reactions they compel on our side;also our effect upon the outer world. It is not the directing agent, butan organ of the directing agent.525 (1888)My proposition compressed into a formula that smells of antiquity, Christianity, scholasticism, and other muskiness: in the concept \"God asspirit,\" God as perfection is negated--526 (March-lune 1888)Where a certain unity obtains in the grouping of things, one has always posited spirit as the cause of this coordination: for which notion thereis no ground whatever. Why should the idea of a complex fact be one of the conditions of this fact? or why should the notion of a complex fact have to precede it as its cause?--We shall be on our guard against explaining purposiveness in terms of spirit: there is no ground whatever for ascribing to spirit the properties of organization and systematization. The nervous system has amuch more extensive domain; the world of consciousness is added to it. Consciousness plays no role in the total process of adaptation and systematization.527 (1886-1887)Physiologists, like philosophers, believe that consciousness increases in value in proportion as it increases in clarity: the clearest consciousness, the most logical and coldest thinking, is supposed to be of the first rank. However--by what measure is this value determined?--In regard to release of will, the most superficial, most simplified thinking is the most useful--it could therefore--etc. (because it leavesfew motives over).Precision in action is antagonistic to far-seeing providentiality, the judgments of which are often uncertain: the latter is led by the deeper instinct.528 (1886-1887)Principal error of psychologists: they regard the indistinct idea as a lower kind of idea than the distinct: but that which removes itself fromour consciousness and for that reason becomes obscure can on that account be perfectly clear in itself. Becoming obscure is a matter of perspective of consciousness."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"529 (March-June 1888)Tremendous blunders:1. the absurd overestimation of consciousness, the transformation of it into a unity, an entity: \"spirit\", \"soul\", something that feels, thinks,wills--2. spirit as cause, especially wherever purposiveness, system, co-ordination appear;3. consciousness as the highest achieveable form, as the supreme kind ofbeing, as \"God\";4. will introduced wherever there are effects;5. the \"real world\" as a spiritual world, as accessible through the facts of consciousness;6. knowledge as uniquely the faculty of consciousness wherever there is knowledge at all.Consequences:every advance lies in an advance in becoming conscious; every regressionin becoming unconscious; (--becoming unconscious was considered a falling back to the desires and senses --as becoming animal--)one approaches reality, \"real being\", through dialectic; one distances oneself from it through the instincts, senses, mechanism--to resolve man into spirit would mean to make him into God: spirit, will, goodness--all one; all good must proceed from spirituality, must be a fact of consciousness; any advance toward the better can only be anadvance in becoming conscious7. Judgment. True--FalseIn the case of Kant, theological prejudice, his unconscious dogmatism, his moralistic perspective, were dominant, directing, commanding.The proton pseudos: how is the fact of knowledge possible? is knowledge a fact at all? what is knowledge? If we do not know what knowledge is, we cannot possibly answer the question whether there is knowledge.--Verywell! But if I do not already \"know' whether there is knowledge, whetherthere can be knowledge, I cannot reasonably put the question \"what is knowledge?\" Kant believes in the fact of knowledge: what he wants is a piece of naivete: knowledge of knowledge!\"Knowledge is judgment!\" But judgment is a belief that something is thusand thus! And not knowledge! \"All knowledge consists of synthetic judgments\" of universal validity(the case is thus and not otherwise in every case), of necessary validity (the opposite of the assertion can never occur).The legitimacy of belief in knowledge is always presupposed: just as thelegitimacy of the feelings of conscience-judgments is presupposed. Here moral ontology is the dominant prejudice.The conclusion is therefore:"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"1. there are assertions that we consider universally valid and necessary;2. necessity and universal validity cannot be derived from experience;3. consequently they must be founded, not upon experience, but upon something else, and derive from another source of knowledge!(Kant infers (1) there are assertions which are valid only under a certain condition; (2) this condition is that they derive, not from experience, but from pure reason.)Therefore: the question is, whence do we derive our reasons for believing in the truth of such assertions? No, how our belief is caused!But the origin of a belief, of a strong conviction, is a psychological problem: and a very narrow and limited experience often produces such a belief! It already presupposes that there is not \"data à posteriori\" butalso data à priori, \"preceding experience.\" Necessity and universal validity could never be given to us by experience: why does that mean that they are present without any experience at all?There are no isolated judgments!An isolated judgment is never \"true,\" never knowledge; only in the connection and relation of many judgments is there any surety.What distinguishes the true from the false belief? What is knowledge? He\"knows\" it, that is heavenly!Necessity and universality can never be given by experience! thus they are independent of experience, prior to all experience! That insight that occurs a priori, therefore independently of all experience, out of sheer reason, is \"a pure form of knowledge\"!\"The basic laws of logic, the law of identity and the law of contradiction, are forms of pure knowledge, because they precede all experience.\"--But these are not forms of knowledge at all! they are regulative articles of belief.To establish the à priori character (the pure rationality) of the judgments of mathematics, space must be conceived as a form of pure reason.Hume had declared: \"There are no synthetic à priori judgments.\" Kant says: But there are! Those of mathematics! And if there are such judgments, perhaps there is also metaphysics, a knowledge of things by pure reason!Mathematics is possible under conditions under which metaphysics is never possible. All human knowlege is either experience or mathematics.A judgment is synthetic; i. e., it connects different ideas.It is à priori; i. e., every connection is a universally valid and necessary one, which can never be given by sense perception but only through pure reason.If there are to be synthetic a priori judgments, then reason must be in a position to make connections: connection is a form. Reason must possess the capacity of giving form."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"531 (1885-1886)Judgment is our oldest belief, our most habitual holding-true or holding-untrue, an assertion or denial, a certainty that something is thus and not otherwise, a belief that here we really \"know\"-- what is itthat is believed true in all judgments?What are attributes?--We have not regarded change in us as change but asan \"in itself\" that is foreign to us, that we merely \"perceive\": and we have posited it, not as an event, but as a being, as a \"quality\"--and inaddition invented an entity to which it adheres; i. e., we have regardedthe effect as something that effects, and this we have regarded as a being. But even in this formulation, the concept \"effect\" is arbitrary: for those changes that take place in us, and that we firmly believe we have not ourselves caused, we merely infer to be effects, in accordance with the conclusion: \"every change must have an author\";--but this conclusion is already mythology: it separates that which effects from the effecting. If I say \"lightning flashes,\" I have posited the flash once as an activity and a second time as a subject, and thus added to the event a being that is not one with the event but is rather fixed, \"is\" and does not \"become.\"--To regard an event as an \"effecting,\" and this as being, that is the double error, or interpretation, of which we are guilty.532 (1885)Judgment--this is the belief: \"This and that are so.\" Thus there is in every judgment the avowal of having encountered an \"identical case\": it therefore presupposes comparison with the aid of memory. The judgment does not produce the appearance of an identical case. Rather it believesit perceives one: it works under the presupposition that identical casesexist. Now, what is that function that must be much older and must have been at work much earlier, that makes cases identical and similar which are in themselves dissimilar? What is that second function, which on thebasis of the first, etc. \"Whatever arouses the same sensation is the same\": but what is it that makes sensations the same, \"accepts\" them as the same? There could be no judgments at all if a kind of equalization were not practiced within sensations: memory is possible only with a continual emphasizing of what is already familiar, experienced.--Before judgment occurs, the process of assimilation must already have taken place; thus here, too, there is an intellectual activity that does not enter consciousness, as pain does as a consequence of a wound. Probably an inner event corresponds to each organic function; hence assimilation,rejection, growth, etc.Essential: to start from the body and employ it as guide. It is the muchricher phenomenon, which allows of clearer observation. Belief in the body is better established than belief in the spirit.\"No matter how strongly a thing may be believed, strength of belief is no criterion of truth.\" But what is truth? Perhaps a kind of belief thathas become a condition of life? In that case, to be sure, strength couldbe a criterion; e. g., in regard to causality.533 (Spring-Fall 1887)Logical certainty, transparency, as criterion of truth (\"omncillud verumest, quod clare et distincte percipitur.\" Descartes): with that, the mechanical hypothesis concerning the world is desired and credible."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"But this is a crude confusion: like simplex sigillum veri. How does one know that the real nature of things stands in this relation to our intellect?--Could it not be otherwise? that it is the hypothesis that gives the intellect the greatest feeling of power and security, that is most preferred, valued and consequently characterized as true?--The intellect posits its freest and strongest capacity and capability as criterion of the most valuable, consequently of the true--\"True\": from the standpoint of feeling--: that which excites the feelingmost strongly (\"ego\");from the standpoint of thought--: that which gives thought the greatest feeling of strength;from the standpoint of touch, seeing, hearing--: that which calls for the greatest resistance.Thus it is the highest degrees of performance that awaken belief in the \"truth,\" that is to say reality, of the object. The feeling of strength,of struggle, of resistance convinces us that there is something that is here being resisted.534 (1887-1888)The criterion of truth resides in the enhancement of the feeling of power.535 (1885)\"Truth\": this, according to my way of thinking, does not necessarily denote the antithesis of error, but in the most fundamental cases only the posture of various errors in relation to one another. Perhaps one isolder, more profound than another, even ineradicable, in so far as an organic entity of our species could not live without it; while other errors do not tyrannize over us in this way as conditions of life, but on the contrary when compared with such \"tyrants\" can be set aside and \"refuted.\"An assumption that is irrefutable--why should it for that reason be \"true\"? This proposition may perhaps outrage logicians, who posit their limitations as the limitations of things: but I long ago declared war onthis optimism of logicians.536 (Jan.-Fall 1888)Everything simple is merely imaginary, is not \"true.\" But whatever is real, whatever is true, is neither one nor even reducible to one.537 (1885-1888)What is truth?--Inertia; that hypothesis which gives rise to contentment; smallest expenditure of spiritual force, etc.538 (1883-1888)First proposition.

Against Causalism545 (1885)I believe in absolute space as the substratum of force: the latter limits and forms. Time eternal. But space and time do not exist in themselves. \"Changes\" are only appearances (or sense processes for us); if we posit the recurrence of these, however regular, nothing is established thereby except this simple fact, that it has always happenedthus. The feeling that post hoc is propter hoc can easily be shown to bea misunderstanding; it is comprehensible. But appearances cannot be \"causes\"!546 (1885-1886)The interpretation of an event as either an act or the suffering of an act (--thus every act a becoming-other, presupposes an author and someone upon who \"change\" is effected.547 (1885-1886)Psychological history of the concept \"subject.\" The body, the thing, the\"whole\" construed by the eye, awaken the distinction between a deed and a doer; the doer, the cause of the deed, conceived ever more subtly, finally left behind the \"subject.\"548 (1885-1886)Our bad habit of taking a mnemonic, an abbreviative formula, to be an entity, finally as a cause, e. g., to say of lightning \"it flashes.\" Or the little word \"I.\" To make a kind of perspective in seeing the cause of seeing: that was what happened in the invention of the \"subject,\" the\"I\"!549 (1885)\"Subject\", \"object\", \"attribute\"--these distinctions are fabricated and are now imposed as a schematism upon all the apparent facts. The fundamental false observation is that I believe it is I who does something, suffer something, \"have\" something, \"have\" a quality.550 (1885-1886)In every judgment there resides the entire, full, profound belief in subject and attribute, or in cause and effect (that is, as the assertionthat every effect is an activity and that every activity presupposes an agent); and this latter belief is only a special case of the former, so there remains as the fundamental belief the belief that there are subjects, that everything that happens is related attributively to some subject.I notice something and seek a reason for it; this means originally: I seek an intention in it, and above all someone who has intentions, a subject, a doer: every event a deed--formerly One saw intentions in all events, this is our oldest habit.

That which gives the extraordinary firmness to our belief in causality is not the great habit of seeing one occurrence following another but our inability to interpret events otherwise than as events caused by intentions. It is belief in the living and thinking as the only effective force--in will, in intention--it is belief that every event is a deed, that every deed presupposes a doer, it is belief in the\"subject.\" Is this belief in the concept of subject and attribute not a great stupidity?Question: is intention the cause of an event? Or is that also illusion?Is it not the event itself?551 (March-June 1888)Critique of the concept \"cause\".- We have absolutely no experience of a cause; psychologically considered, we derive the entire concept from thesubjective conviction that we are causes, namely, that the arm moves--But that is an error. We separate ourselves, the doers, from the deed, and we make use of this pattern everywhere--we seek a doer for every event. What is it we have done? We have misunderstood the feeling of strength, tension, resistance, a muscular feeling that is already the beginning of the act, as the cause, or we have taken the will to do thisor that for a cause because the action follows upon it--cause, i. e.,-There is no such thing as \"cause\"; some cases in which it seemed to be given us, and in which we have projected it out of ourselves in order tounderstand an event, have been shown to be self-deceptions. Our \"understanding of an event\" has consisted in our inventing a subject which was made responsible for something that happens and for how it happens. We have combined our feeling of will, our feeling of \"freedom,\" our feeling of responsibility and our intention to perform anact, into the concept \"cause\": causa efficiens and causa finalis are fundamentally one.We believed that an effect was explained when a condition was detected in which the effect was already inherent. In fact, we invent all causes after the schema of the effect: the latter is known to us--Conversely, we are not in a position to predict of any thing what it will \"effect.\" The thing, the subject, will, intention--all inherent in the conception \"cause.\" We search for things in order to explain why something has changed. Even the atom is this kind of super-added \"thing\" and \"primitive subject\"--At length we grasp that things--consequently atoms, too-- effect nothing: because they do not exist at all--that the concept of causalityis completely useless.-- A necessary sequence of states does not imply acausal relationship between them (--that would mean making their effective capacity leap from 1 to 2, to 3, to 4, to 5). There are neither causes nor effects. Linguistically we do not know how to rid ourselves of them. But that does not matter. If I think of the muscle apart from its \"effects\", I negate it--In summa: an event is neither effected nor does it effect. Causa is a capacity to produce effects that has been super-added to the events--Interpretation by causality a deception--A \"thing\" is the sum of its effects, synthetically united by a concept, an image. In fact, science"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"has emptied the concept causality of its content and retained it as a formula of an equation, in which it has become at bottom a matter of indifference on which side cause is placed and on which side effect. It is asserted that in two complex states (constellations of force) the quanta of force remain constant.The calculability of an event does not reside in the fact that a rule isadhered to, or that a necessity is obeyed, or that a law of causality has been projected by us into every event: it resides in the recurrence of \"identical cases\".There is no such thing as a sense of causality, as Kant thinks. One is surprised, one is disturbed, one desires something familiar to hold on to--As soon as we are shown something old in the new' we are calmed. Thesupposed instinct for causality is only fear of the unfamiliar and the attempt to discover something familiar in it--a search, not for causes, but for the familiar.552 (Spring-Fall 1887)Against determinism and teleology.-- From the fact that something ensuesregularly and ensues calculably, it does not follow that it ensues necessarily. That a quantum of force determines and conducts itself in every particular case in one way and manner does not make it into an \"unfree will.\" \"Mechanical necessity\" is not a fact: it is we who first interpreted it into events. We have interpreted the formulatable character of events as the consequence of a necessity that rules over events. But from the fact that I do a certain thing, it by no means follows that I am compelled to do it. Compulsion in things certainly cannot be demonstrated: the rule proves only that one and the same eventis not another event as well. Only because we have introduced subjects, \"doers,\" into things does it appear that all events are the consequencesof compulsion exerted upon subjects--exerted by whom? again by a \"doer.\" Cause and effect--a dangerous concept so long as one thinks of something that causes and something upon which an effect is produced.a. Necessity is not a fact but an interpretation.b. When one has grasped that the \"subject\" is not something that createseffects, but only a fiction, much follows.It is only after the model of the subject that we have invented the reality of things and projected them into the medley of sensations. If we no longer believe in the effective subject, then belief also disappears in effective things, in reciprocation, cause and effect between those phenomena that we call things.There also disappears, of course, the world of effective atoms: the assumption of which always depended on the supposition that one needed subjects.At last, the \"thing-in-itself\" also disappears, because this is fundamentally the conception of a \"subject-in-itself.\" But we have grasped that the subject is a fiction. The antithesis \"thing-in-itself\" and \"appearance\" is untenable; with that, however, the concept \"appearance\" also disappears.c. If we give up the effective subject, we also give up the object upon which effects are produced. Duration, identity with itself, being are inherent neither in that which is called subject nor in that which is called object: they are complexes of events apparently durable in"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"comparison with other complexes--e. g., through the difference in tempo of the event (rest--motion, firm--loose: opposites that do not exist in themselves and that actually express only variations in degree that froma certain perspective appear to be opposites. There are no opposites: only from those of logic do we derive the concept of opposites--and falsely transfer it to things).d. If we give up the concept \"subject\" and \"object,\" then also the concept \"substance\"--and as a consequence also the various modificationsof it, e. g., \"matter,\" \"spirit,\" and other hypothetical entities, \"the eternity and immutability of matter,\" etc. We have got rid of materiality.From the standpoint of morality, the world is false. But to the extent that morality itself is a part of this world, morality is false.Will to truth is a making firm, a making true and durable, an abolition of the false character of things, a reinterpretation of it into beings. \"Truth\" is therefore not something there, that might be found or discovered--but something that must be created and that gives a name to a process, or rather to a will to overcome that has in itself no end--introducing truth, as a processus in infinitum, an active determining--not a becoming conscious of something that is in itself firm and determined. It is a word for the \"will to power.\"Life is founded upon the premise of a belief in enduring and regularly recurring things; the more powerful life is, the wider must be the knowable world to which we, as it were, attribute being. Logicizing, rationalizing, systematizing as expedients of life.Man projects his drive to truth, his \"goal\" in a certain sense outside himself as a world that has being, as a metaphysical world, as a \"thing-in-itself,\" as a world already in existence. His needs as creator inventthe world upon which he works, anticipate it; this anticipation (this \"belief\" in truth) is his support.All events, all motion, all becoming, as a determination, degrees and relations of force, as a struggle--As soon as we imagine someone who is responsible for our being thus and thus, etc. (God, nature), and therefore attribute to him the intention that we should exist and be happy or wretched, we corrupt for ourselves the innocence of becoming. We then have someone who wants to achieve something through us and with us.The \"'welfare of the individual\" is just as imaginary as the \"welfare ofthe species\": the former is not sacrificed to the latter, species viewedfrom a distance is just as transient as the individual. \"Preservation ofthe species\" is only a consequence of the growth of the species, i. e., the. overcoming of the species on the road to a stronger type.[Theses.] That the apparent \"purposiveness\" (\"that purposiveness which endlessly surpasses all the arts of man\") is merely the consequence of the will to power manifest in all events; that becoming stronger involves an ordering process which looks like a sketchy purposiveness; that apparent ends are not intentional but, as soon as dominion is established over a lesser power and the latter operates as a function ofthe greater power, an order of rank, of organization is bound to producethe appearance of an order of means and ends.Against apparent \"necessity\": --this is only an expression for the fact"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"that a force is not also something else.Against apparent \"purposiveness\": --the latter only an expression for anorder of spheres of power and their interplay.9. Thing-in-Itself and Appearance553 (1886-1887)The sore spot of Kant's critical philosophy has gradually become visibleeven to dull eyes: Kant no longer has a right to his distinction \"appearance\" and \"thing-in-itself\"--he had deprived himself of the rightto go on distinguishing in this old familiar way, in so far as he rejected as impermissible making inferences from phenomena to a cause ofphenomena--in accordance with his conception of causality and its purelyintra-phenomenal validity-- which conception, on the other hand, alreadyanticipates this distinction, as if the \"thing-in-itself\" were not only inferred but given.554 (1885-1886)Causalism.--It is obvious that things-in-themselves cannot be related toone another as cause and effect, nor can appearance be so related to appearance; from which it follows that in a philosophy that believes in things-in-themselves and appearances the concept \"cause and effect\" cannot be applied. Kant's mistakesIn fact, the concept \"cause and effect\" derives, psychologically speaking, only from a mode of thought that believes that always and everywhere will operates upon will--that believes only in living things and fundamentally only in \"souls\" (and not in things). Within the mechanistic view of the world (which is logic and its application to space and time), that concept is reduced to the formulas of mathematics--with which, as one must emphasize again and again, nothing is ever comprehended, but rather designated and distorted.555 (1885-1886)Against the scientific prejudice.--The biggest fable of all is the fableof knowledge. One would like to know what things-in-themselves are; but behold, there are no things-in-themselves! But even supposing there werean in-itself, an unconditioned thing, it would for that very reason be unknowable! Something unconditioned cannot be known; otherwise it would not be unconditioned! Coming to know, however, is always \"placing oneself in a conditional relation to something\" one who seeks to know the unconditioned desires that it should not concern him, and that this same something should be of no concern to anyone. This involves a contradiction, first, between wanting to know and the desire that it notconcern us (but why know at all, then?) and, secondly, because somethingthat is of no concern to anyone IS not at all, and thus cannot be known at all.--Coming to know means \"to place oneself in a conditional relation to something\"; to feel oneself conditioned by something and oneself to condition it--it is therefore under all circumstances establishing, denoting, and making-conscious of conditions (not forthcoming entities, things, what is \"in-itself\").556 (1885-1886)A \"thing-in-itself\" just as perverse as a \"sense-in-itself,\" a \"meaning-"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"in-itself.\" There are no \"facts-in-themselves,\" for a sense must always be projected into them before there can be \"facts.\"The question \"what is that?\" is an imposition of meaning from some otherviewpoint. \"Essence,\" the \"essential nature,\" is something perspective and already presupposes a multiplicity. At the bottom of it there alwayslies \"what is that for me?\" (for us, for all that lives, etc.)A thing would be defined once all creatures had asked \"what is that?\" and had answered their question. Supposing one single creature, with itsown relationships and perspectives for all things, were missing, then the thing would not yet be \"defined\".In short: the essence of a thing is only an opinion about the \"thing.\" Or rather: \"it is considered\" as the real \"it is,\" the sole \"this is.\"One may not ask: \"who then interprets?\" for the interpretation itself isa form of the will to power, it exists (but not as a \"being,' but as a process, a becoming) as an affect.The origin of \"things\" is wholly the work of that which imagines, thinks, wills, feels. The concept \"thing\" itself just as much as all itsqualities.--Even \"the subject\" is such a created entity, a \"thing\" like all others: a simplification with the object of defining the force whichposits, invents, thinks, as distinct from all individual positing, inventing, thinking as such. Thus a capacity as distinct from all that is individual--fundamentally, action collectively considered with respect to all anticipated actions (action and the probability of similar actions).557 (1885-1886)The properties of a thing are effects on other \"things\": if one removes other \"things,\" then a thing has no properties, i. e., there is no thingwithout other things, i. e., there is no \"thing-in-itself.\"558 (Spring-Fall 1887)The \"thing-in-itself\" nonsensical. If I remove all the relationships, all the \"properties,\" all the \"activities\" of a thing, the thing does not remain over; because thingness has only been invented by us owing tothe requirements of logic, thus with the aim of defining, communication (to bind together the multiplicity of relationships, properties, activities).559 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)\"Things that have a constitution in themselves\"--a dogm idea with which one must break absolutely.560 (Spring-Fall 1887)That things possess a constitution in themselves quite apart from interpretation and subjectivity, is a quite idle hypothesis: it presupposes that interpretation and subjectivity are not essential, thata thing freed from all relationships would still be a thing.Conversely, the apparent objective character of things: could it not be merely a difference of degree within the subjective?--that perhaps that which changes slowly presents itself to us as \"objectively\" enduring, being, \"in-itself\"--that the objective is only a false concept of a"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"genus and an antithesis within the subjective?561 (1885-1886)Suppose all unity were unity only as an organization? But the \"thing\" inwhich we believe was only invented as a foundation for the various attributes. If the thing \"effects,\" that means: we conceive all the other properties which are present and momentarily latent, as the cause of the emergence of one single property; i. e., we take the sum of its properties--\"x\"--as cause of the property \"x\": which is utterly stupid and mad!All unity is unity only as organization and co-operation--just as a human community is a unity--as opposed to an atomistic anarchy, as a pattern of domination that signifies a unity but is not a unity.562 (1883-1888)\"In the development of thought a point had to be reached at which one realized that what one called the properties of things were sensations of the feeling subject: at this point the properties ceased to belong tothe thing.\" The \"thing-in-itself\" remained. The distinction between the thing-in-itself and the thing-for-us is based on the older, naive form of perception which granted energy to things; but analysis revealed thateven force was only projected into them, and likewise--substance. \"The thing affects a subject\"? Root of the idea of substance in language, notin beings outside us! The thing-in-itself is no problem at all!Beings will have to be thought of as sensations that are no longer basedon something devoid of sensation.In motion, no new content is given to sensation. That which IS, cannot contain motion: therefore it is a form of being.N. B. The explanation of an event can be sought firstly: through mental images of the event that precede it (aims);secondly: through mental images that succeed it (the mathematical-physical explanation).One should not confuse the two. Thus: the physical explanation, which isa symbolization of the world by means of sensation and thought, can in itself never account for the origin of sensation and thought; rather physics must construe the world of feeling consistently as lacking feeling and aim--right up to the highest human being. And teleology is only a history of purposes and never physical!563 (1886-1887)Our \"knowing\" limits itself to establishing quantities; but we cannot help feeling these differences in quantity as qualities. Quality is a perspective truth for us; not an \"in-itself.\"Our senses have a definite quantum as a mean within which they function;i. e., we sense bigness and smallness in relation to the conditions of our existence. If we sharpened or blunted our senses tenfold, we should perish; i. e., with regard to making possible our existence we sense even relations between magnitudes as qualities.564 (1885-1886)"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Might all quantities not be signs of qualities? A greater power implies a different consciousness, feeling, desiring, a different perspective; growth itself is a desire to be more; the desire for an increase in quantum grows from a quale; in a purely quantitative world everything would be dead, stiff, motionless.-- The reduction of all qualities to quantities is nonsense: what appears is that the one accompanies the other, an analogy--565 (Fall 1886)Qualities are insurmountable barriers for us; we cannot help feeling that mere quantitative differences are something fundamentally distinct from quantity, namely that they are qualities which can no longer be reduced to one another. But everything for which the word \"knowledge\" makes any sense refers to the domain of reckoning. weighing, measuring, to the domain of quantity; while, on the other hand, all our sensations of value (i. e., simply our sensations) adhere precisely to qualities, i. e., to our perspective \"truths\" which belong to us alone and can by no means be \"known\"! It is obvious that every creature different from ussenses different qualities and consequently lives in a different world from that in which we live. Qualities are an idiosyncrasy peculiar to man; to demand that our human interpretations and values should be universal and perhaps constitutive values is one of the hereditary madnesses of human pride.566 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)The \"real world,\" however one has hitherto conceived it, it has always been the apparent world once again.567 (March-June 1888)The apparent world, i. e., a world viewed according to values; ordered, selected according to values, i. e., in this case according to the viewpoint of utility in regard to the preservation and enhancement of the power of a certain species of animal.The perspective therefore decides the character of the \"appearance\"! As if a world would still remain over after one deducted the perspective! By doing that one would deduct relativity!Every center of force adopts a perspective toward the entire remainder, i. e., its own particular valuation, mode of action, and mode of resistance. The \"apparent world,\" therefore, is reduced to a specific mode of action on the world, emanating from a center.Now there is no other mode of action whatever; and the \"world\" is only aword for the totality of these actions. Reality consists precisely in this particular action and reaction of every individual part toward the whole--No shadow of a right remains to speak here of appearance--The specific mode of reacting is the only mode of reacting; we do not know how many and what kinds of other modes there are.But there is no \"other,\" no \"true,\" no essential being--for this would be the expression of a world without action and reaction--The antithesis of the apparent world and the true world reduced to the antithesis \"world\" and \"nothing.\"--"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"568 (March-June 1888)Critique of the concept \"true and apparent world.\"-- Of these, the firstis a mere fiction, constructed of fictitious entities.\"Appearance\" itself belongs to reality: it is a form of its being; i. e., in a world where there is no being, a certain calculable world of identical cases must first be created through appearance: a tempo at which observation and comparison are possible, etc.Appearance is an arranged and simplified world, at which our practical instincts have been at work; it is perfectly true for us; that is to say, we live, we are able to live in it: proof of its truth for us--The world, apart from our condition of living in it, the world that we have not reduced to our being, our logic and psychological prejudices, does not exist as a world \"in-itself\"; it is essentially a world of relationships; under certain conditions it has a differing aspect from every point; its being is essentially different from every point; it presses upon every point, every point resists it--and the sum of these is in every case quite incongruent.The measure of power determines what being possesses the other measure of power; in what form, force, constraint it acts or resists.Our particular case is interesting enough: we have produced a conceptionin order to be able to live in a world, in order to perceive just enoughto endure it--569 (Spring-Fall 1887)Our psychological perspective is determined by the following: 1. that communication is necessary, and that for there to be communication something has to be firm, simplified, capable of precision (above all inthe [so-called] identical case). For it to be communicable, however, it must be experienced as adapted, as \"recognizable.\" The material of the senses adapted by the understanding, reduced to rough outlines, made similar, subsumed under related matters. Thus the fuzziness and chaos ofsense impressions are, as it were, logicized;2. the world of \"phenomena\" is the adapted world which we feel to be real. The \"reality\" lies in the continual recurrence of identical, familiar, related things in their logicized character, in the belief that here we are able to reckon and calculate;3. the antithesis of this phenomenal world is not \"the true world,\" but the formless unformulable world of the chaos of sensations--another kindof phenomenal world, a kind \"unknowable\" for us;4. questions, what things \"in-themselves\" may be like, apart from our sense receptivity and the activity of our understanding, must be rebutted with the question: how could we know that things exist? \"Thingness\" was first created by us. The question is whether there couldnot be many other ways of creating such an apparent world--and whether this creating, logicizing, adapting, falsifying is not itself the best-guaranteed reality; in short, whether that which \"posits things\" is not the sole reality; and whether the \"effect of the external world upon us\" is not also only the result of such active subjects--The other \"entities\" act upon us; our adapted apparent world is an adaptation and overpowering of their actions; a kind of defensive measure.

Metaphysical Need570 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)If one is a philosopher as men have always been philosophers, one cannotsee what has been and becomes--one sees only what is. But since nothing is, all that was left to the philosopher as his \"world\" was the imaginary.571 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)To assert the existence as a whole of things of which we know nothing whatever, precisely because there is an advantage in not being able to know anything of them, was a piece of naivete of Kant, resulting from needs, mainly moral-metaphysical.572 (1883-1888)An artist cannot endure reality, he looks away from it, back: he seriously believes that the value of a thing resides in that shadowy residue one derives from colors, form, sound, ideas, he believes that the more subtilized, attenuated, transient a thing or a man is, the morevaluable he becomes; the less real, the more valuable. This is Platonism, which, however, involved yet another bold reversal: Plato measured the degree of reality by the degree of value and said: The more\"Idea\", the more being. He reversed the concept \"reality\" and said: \"What you take for real is an error, and the nearer we approach the 'Idea', the nearer we approach 'truth'. \"--Is this understood? It was the greatest of rebaptisms; and because it has been adopted by Christianity we do not recognize how astonishing it is. Fundamentally, Plato, as the artist he was, preferred appearance to being! lie and invention to truth! the unreal to the actual! But he was so convinced ofthe value of appearance that he gave it the attributes \"being\",\"causality\" and \"goodness\", and \"truth\", in short everything menvalue.The concept of value itself considered as a cause: first insight. The ideal granted all honorific attributes: second insight.573 (Jan.-Fall 1888)The idea of the \"true world\" or of \"God\" as absolutely immaterial, spiritual, good, is an emergency measure necessary while the opposite instincts are still all-powerful--The degree of moderation and humanity attained is exactly reflected in the humanization of the gods: the Greeks of the strongest epoch, who were not afraid of themselves but rejoiced in themselves, brought their gods close to all their own affects--.The spiritualization of the idea of God is therefore far from being a sign of progress: one is heartily conscious of this when considering Goethe--in his case, the vaporization of God into virtue and spirit is felt as being on a coarser level--574 (1883-1888)"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Senselessness of all metaphysics as the derivation of the conditioned from the unconditioned.It is in the nature of thinking that it thinks of and invents the unconditioned as an adjunct to the conditioned; just as it thought of and invented the \"ego\" as an adjunct to the multiplicity of its processes; it measures the world according to magnitudes posited by itself--such fundamental fictions as \"the unconditional\",\"ends and means'',\"things\",\"substances\", logical laws, numbers and forms.There would be nothing that could be called knowledge if thought did notfirst re-form the world in this way into \"things\", into what is self-identical. Only because there is thought is there untruth.Thought cannot be derived, any more than sensations can be; but that does not mean that its primordiality or \"being-in-itself\" has been proved! all that is established is that we cannot get beyond it, becausewe have nothing but thought and sensation.575 (1885-1886)\"Knowledge\" is a referring back: in its essence a regressus in infinitum. That which comes to a standstill (at a supposed causa prima, at something unconditioned, etc.) is laziness, weariness576 (1883-1888)Psychology of metaphysics: the influence of timidity.That which has been feared the most, the cause of the most powerful suffering (lust to rule, sex, etc.), has been treated by men with the greatest amount of hostility and eliminated from the \"true\" world. Thus they have eliminated the affects one by one --posited God as the antithesis of evil, that is, placed reality in the negation of the desires and affects (i. e., in nothingness).In the same way, they have hated the irrational, the arbitrary, the accidental (as the causes of immeasurable physical suffering). As a consequence, they negated this element in being-in-itself and conceived it as absolute \"rationality\" and \"purposiveness.\"In the same way, they have feared change, transitoriness: this expressesa straitened soul, full of mistrust and evil experiences (the case of Spinoza: an opposite kind of man would account change a stimulus).A creature overloaded and playing with force would call precisely the affects, irrationality, and change good in a eudaemonistic sense, together with their consequences: danger, contrast, perishing, etc.577 (Spring-Fall 1887)Against the value of that which remains eternally the same (vice Spinoza's naivete; Descartes' also), the values of the briefest and mosttransient, the seductive flash of gold on the belly of the serpent vita--578 (Spring-Fall 1887)Moral values even in theory of knowledge: trust in reason--why not mistrust? the \"true world\" is supposed to be the good world--why? appearance, change, contradiction, struggle devalued as immoral; desire"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"for a world in which these things are missing; the transcendental world invented, in order that a place remains for \"moral freedom\" (in Kant); dialectic a way to virtue (in Plato and Socrates: evidently because Sophistry counted as the way to immorality); time and space ideal: consequently \"unity\" in the essence of things; consequently no \"sin,\" noevil, no imperfection --a justification of God; Epicurus denied the possibility of knowledge, in order to retain moral (or hedonistic) values as the highest values.

It is suffering that inspires these conclusions: fundamentally they are desires that such a world should exist; in the same way, to imagine another, more valuable world is an expression of hatred for a world that makes one suffer: the ressentiment of metaphysicians against actuality is here creative.Second series of questions: for what is there suffering?--and from this a conclusion is derived concerning the relation of the true world to ourapparent, changing, suffering, contradictory world: (1) Suffering as a consequence of error: how is error possible? (2) Suffering as a consequence of guilt: how is guilt possible? (--experiences derived fromnature or society universalized and projected to the sphere of \"in-itself\"). If, however, the conditioned world is causally conditioned by the unconditioned world, then freedom to err and incur guilt must also be conditioned by it: and again one asks, what for?--The world of appearance, becoming, contradiction, suffering, is therefore willed: what for?The error in these conclusions: two opposite concepts are constructed--because one of them corresponds to a reality, the other \"must\" also correspond to a reality. \"Whence should one derive this opposite conceptif this were not so?\"--Reason is thus a source of revelation concerning being-in-itself.But the origin of these antitheses need not necessarily go back to a supernatural source of reason: it is sufficient to oppose to it the realgenesis of the concepts. This derives from the practical sphere, the sphere of utility; hence the strength of the faith it inspires (one would perish if one did not reason according to this mode of reason; butthis is no \"proof\" of what it asserts).The preoccupation with suffering on the part of metaphysicians--is quitenaive. \"Eternal bliss\": psychological nonsense. Brave and creative men never consider pleasure and pain as ultimate values--they are epiphenomena: one must desire both if one is to achieve anything--. Thatthey see the problem of pleasure and pain in the foreground reveals something weary and sick in metaphysicians and religious people. Even morality is so important to them only because they see in it an essential condition for the abolition of suffering.In the same way, their preoccupation with appearance and error: cause ofsuffering, superstition that happiness attends truth (confusion:"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"happiness in \"certainty\", in \"faith\").580 (Spring-Fall 1887)To what extent the basic epistemological positions (materialism, idealism) are consequences of evaluations: the source of the supreme feelings of pleasure (\"feelings of value\") as decisive also for the problem of reality!--The measure of positive knowledge is quite subsidiary or a matter of indifference: as witness the development of India.The Buddhistic negation of reality in general (appearance = suffering) is perfectly consistent: undemonstrability, inaccessibility, lack of categories not only for a \"'world-in-itself,\" but an insight into the erroneous procedures by means of which this whole concept is arrived at.\"Absolute reality,\" \"being-in-itself\" a contradiction. In a world of becoming, \"reality\" is always only a simplification for practical ends, or a deception through the coarseness of organs, or a variation in the tempo of becoming.Logical world-denial and nihilation follow from the fact that we have tooppose non-being with being and that the concept \"becoming\" is denied. (\"Something\" becomes.)581 (Spring-Fall 1887)Being and becoming.--\"Reason\", evolved on a sensualistic basis, on the prejudices of the senses, i. e., in the belief in the truth of the judgments of the senses.\"Being\" as universalization of the concept \"life\" (breathing), \"having asoul\", \"willing, effecting,\" \"becoming\".The antithesis is: \"not to have a soul,\" \"not to become,\" \"not to will.\" Therefore: \"being\" is not the antithesis of non-being, appearance, nor even of the dead (for only something that can live can be dead).The \"soul,\" the \"ego\" posited as primeval fact, and introduced everywhere where there is any becoming.582 (1885-1887)Being--we have no idea of it apart from the idea of \"living.\"-- How can anything dead \"be\"?583 (March-June 1888)( A )I observe with astonishment that science has today resigned itself to the apparent world; a real world--whatever it may be like--we certainly have no organ for knowing it.At this point we may ask: by means of what organ of knowledge can we posit even this antithesis?--That a world accessible to our organs is also understood to be dependentupon these organs, that we understand a world as being subjectively conditioned, is not to say that an objective world is at all possible."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Who compels us to think that subjectivity is real, essential?The \"in-itself\" is even an absurd conception; a \"constitutioning-itself\" is nonsense; we possess the concept \"being,\" \"thing,\" only as a relational concept--The worst thing is that with the old antithesis \"apparent\" and \"true\" the correlative value judgment \"lacking in value\" and \"absolutely valuable\" has developed.The apparent world is not counted as a \"valuable\" world; appearance is supposed to constitute an objection to supreme value. Only a \"true\" world can be valuable in itself--Prejudice of prejudices! Firstly, it would be possible that the true constitution of things was so hostile to the presuppositions of life, soopposed to them, that we needed appearance in order to be able to live--After all, this is the case in so many situations; e. g., in marriage.Our empirical world would be determined by the instincts of self-preservation even as regards the limits of its knowledge: we would regard as true, good, valuable that which serves the preservation of thespecies--a. We possess no categories by which we can distinguish a true from an apparent world. (There might only be an apparent world, but not our apparent world.)b. Assuming the true world, it could still be a world less valuable for us; precisely the quantum of illusion might be of a higher rank on account of its value for our preservation. (Unless appearance as such were grounds for condemnation?)c. That a correlation exists between degrees of value and degrees of reality (so that the supreme values also possess the supreme reality) isa metaphysical postulate proceeding from the presupposition that we knowthe order of rank of values; namely, that this order of rank is a moral order--Only with this presupposition is truth necessarily part of the definition of all the highest values.( B )It is of cardinal importance that one should abolish the true world.

The \"criterion of truth\" was in fact merely the biological utility of such asystem of systematic falsification; and since a species of animals knowsof nothing more important than its own preservation, one might indeed bepermitted to speak here of \"truth.\" The naivete was to take an anthropocentric idiosyncrasy as the measure of things, as the rule for determining \"real\" and \"unreal\": in short, to make absolute something conditioned. And behold, suddenly the world fell apart into a \"true\" world and an \"apparent\" world: and precisely the world that man's reasonhad devised for him to live and settle in was discredited. Instead of employing the forms as a tool for making the world manageable and calculable, the madness of philosophers divined that in these categoriesis presented the concept of that world to which the one in which man lives does not correspond--The means were misunderstood as measures of value, even as a condemnation of their real intention--The intention was to deceive oneself in a useful way; the means, the invention of formulas and signs by means of which one could reduce the confusing multiplicity to a purposive and manageable schema.But alas! now a moral category was brought into play: no creature wants to deceive itself, no creature may deceive--consequently there is only awill to truth. What is \"truth\"?The law of contradiction provided the schema: the true world, to which one seeks the way, cannot contradict itself, cannot change, cannot become, has no beginning and no end.This is the greatest error that has ever been committed, the essential fatality of error on earth: one believed one possessed a criterion of reality in the forms of reason--while in fact one possessed them in order to become master of reality, in order to misunderstand reality in a shrewd manner--And behold: now the world became false, and precisely on account of the properties that constitute its reality: change, becoming, multiplicity, opposition, contradiction, war. And then the entire fatality was there:1. How can one get free from the false, merely apparent world? (--it wasthe real, the only )2. how can one become oneself as much as possible the antithesis of the character of the apparent world?

Physiology teaches us better!--We see how morality (a) poisons the entire conception of the world, (b) cuts off the road to knowledge, to science, (c) disintegrates and undermines all actual instincts (in that it teaches that their roots areimmoral).We see at work before us a dreadful tool of decadence that props itself up by the holiest names and attitudes.585 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev.

Let us reflect, let us think back; let us follow the highways and byways!( A )Man seeks \"the truth\": a world that is not self-contradictory, not deceptive, does not change, a true world--a world in which one does not suffer; contradiction, deception, change--causes of suffering!

(Indian critique: e. g. the \"ego\" as apparent, as not real.)Whence does man here derive the concept reality--Why is it that he derives suffering from change, deception, contradiction? and why not rather his happiness?--Contempt, hatred for all that perishes, changes, varies-- whence comes this valuation of that which remains constant? Obviously, the will to truth is here merely the desire for a world of the constant.The senses deceive, reason corrects the errors; consequently, one concluded, reason is the road to the constant; the least sensual ideas must be closest to the \"true world.\"--It is from the senses that most misfortunes come--they are deceivers, deluders, destroyers.--Happiness can be guaranteed only by being; change and happiness exclude one another. The highest desire therefore contemplates unity with what has being. This is the formula for: the road to the highest happiness.In summa: the world as it ought to be exists; this world, in which we live, is an error--this world of ours ought not to exist.Belief in what has being is only a consequence: the real primum mobile is disbelief in becoming, mistrust of becoming, the low valuation of allthat becomes--What kind of man reflects in this way?

A nihilist is a man who judges of the world as it is that it ought not to be, and of the world as it ought to be that it does not exist. Accordingto this view, our existence (action, suffering, willing, feeling) has nomeaning: the pathos of \"in vain\" is the nihilists' pathos--at the same time, as pathos, an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists.Whoever is incapable of laying his will into things, lacking will and strength, at least lays some meaning into them, i. e., the faith that there is a will in them already.It is a measure of the degree of strength of will to what extent one cando without meaning in things, to what extent one can endure to live in ameaningless world because one organizes a small portion of it oneself.The philosophical objective outlook can therefore be a sign that will and strength are small. For strength organizes what is close and closest; \"men of knowledge,\" who desire only to ascertain what is, are those who cannot fix anything as it ought to be.Artists, an intermediary species: they at least fix an image of that which ought to be; they are productive, to the extent that they actualy alter and transform; unlike men of knowledge, who leave everything as itis.Connection between philosophers and the pessimistic religions: the same species of man (--they ascribe the highest degree of reality to the mosthighly valued things--).Connection between philosophers and moral men and their evaluations (--the moral interpretation of the world as meaning: after the decline of the religious meaning--).Overcoming of philosophers through the destruction of the world of being: intermediary period of nihilism: before there is yet present the strength to reverse values and to deïfy becoming and the apparent world as the only world, and to call them good."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"( B )Nihilism as a normal phenomenon can be a symptom of increasing strength or of increasing weakness:partly, because the strength to create, to will, has so increased that it no longer requires these total interpretations and introductions of meaning (\"present tasks,\" the state, etc.);partly because even the creative strength to create meaning has declinedand disappointment becomes the dominant condition.

Does our instinct not contradict this judgment? Does man not eternally create a fictitious world for himself because he wants a better world than reality?

And finally: what gives us the right to posit, as it were, degrees of reality? This is something different from an unknown world-- it is already a wanting to know something of the unknown-- The \"other,\" the \"unknown\" world--very good!

Morality has been a simplification of this kind: it taught that men were known, familiar.--Now we have destroyed morality--we have again become completely obscure to ourselves! I know that I know nothing of myself. Physics proves to be a boon for the heart: science (as the way to knowledge) acquires a new charm after morality has been eliminated--and because it is here alone that we find consistency, we have to construct our life so as to preserve it. This yields a sort of practical reflection on the conditions of our existenceas men of knowledge.595 (1884)Our presuppositions: no God: no purpose: finite force.

Belief that there is no truth at all,the nihilistic belief, is a great relaxation for one who, as a warrior of knowledge, is ceaselessly fighting ugly truths. For truth is ugly.599 (1885-1886)The \"meaninglessness of events\": belief in this is the consequence of aninsight into the falsity of previous interpretations, a generalization of discouragement and weakness--not a necessary belief.The immodesty of man: to deny meaning where he sees none.600 (1885-1886)No limit to the ways in which the world can be interpreted; every interpretation a symptom of growth or of decline.Inertia needs unity (monism); plurality of interpretations a sign of strength.

The attempt at monism belongs here.602 (1884)This perspective world, this world for the eye, tongue, and ear, is veryfalse, even if compared for a very much more subtle sense-apparatus.

The deeper one looks, the more our valuations disappear--meaninglessness approaches! We have created the world that possesses values! Knowing this, we know, too, that reverence for truth is already the consequence of an illusion--and that one should value more than truth the force that forms, simplifies, shapes, invents.\"Everything is false! Everything is permitted!\"Only with a certain obtuseness of vision, a will to simplicity, does thebeautiful, the \"valuable\" appear: in itself, it is I know not what.603 (1885)That the destruction of an illusion does not produce truth-- but only one more piece of ignorance, an extension of our \"empty space, an increase of our \"desert\"--604 ( 1885-1886)\"Interpretation,\" the introduction of meaning not \"explanation\" (in mostcases a new interpretation over an old interpretation that has become incomprehensible, that is now itself only a sign). There are no facts, everything is in flux, incomprehensible, elusive; what is relatively most enduring is--our opinions.605 (Spring-Fall 1887)The ascertaining of \"truth\" and \"untruth,\" the ascertaining of facts in general, is fundamentally different from creative positing, from forming, shaping, overcoming, willing, such as is of the essence of philosophy. To introduce a meaning--this task still remains to be done, assuming there is no meaning yet. Thus it is with sounds, but also with the fate of peoples: they are capable of the most different interpretations and direction toward different goals.On a yet higher level is to posit a goal and mold facts according to it;that is, active interpretation and not merely conceptual translation.606 (1885-1886)Ultimately, man finds in things nothing but what he himself has importedinto them: the finding is called science, the importing --art, religion,love, pride. Even if this should be a piece of childishness, one should carry on with both and be well disposed toward both--some should find; others--we others!--should import!607 (Spring-Fall 1886)Science: its two sides: in regard to the individual; in regard to the cultural complex (level);--valuations from one side or the other are mutually antagonistic.608 (1886-1887)The development of science resolves the \"familiar\" more and more into the unfamiliar:--it desires, however, the reverse, and proceeds from theinstinct to trace the unfamiliar back to the familiar.In summa, science is preparing a sovereign ignorance, a feeling that"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"there is no such thing as \"knowing,\" that it was a kind of arrogance to dream of it, more, that we no longer have the least notion that warrantsour considering \"knowledge\" even a possibility--that \"knowing\" itself isa contradictory idea.

You need to grasp that without this kind of ignorance life itself would be impossible, that it is a condition under which alone the living thing can preserve itself and prosper: a great, firm dome of ignorance must encompass you.610 (1884)Science--the transformation of nature into concepts for the purpose of mastering nature--belongs under the rubric \"means.\"But the purpose and will of man must grow in the same way, the intentionin regard to the whole.611 (1883-1888)We find that the strongest and most constantly employed faculty at all stages of life is thought--even in every act of perceiving and apparent passivity! Evidently, it thus becomes most powerful and demanding, and in the long run it tyrannizes over all other forces. Finally it becomes \"passion-in-itself.\"612 (Spring-Fall 1887)To win back for the man of knowledge the right to great affects! after self-effacement and the cult of \"objectivity\" have created a false orderof rank in this sphere, too. Error reached its peak when Schopenhauer taught: the only way to the \"true,\" to knowledge, lies precisely in getting free from affects, from will; the intellect liberated from will cannot but see the true, real essence of things.The same error in arte as if everything were beautiful as soon as it is viewed without will.613 (Fall 1888)Competition between affects and the dominion of one of the affects over the intellect.614 (1884)To \"humanize\" the world, i. e., to feel ourselves more and more masters within it--615 (1884)"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Among a higher kind of creatures, knowledge, too, will acquire new formsthat are not yet needed.616 (1885-1886)That the value of the world lies in our interpretation (--that other interpretations than merely human ones are perhaps somewhere possible--); that previous interpretations have been perspective valuations by virtue of which we can survive in life, i. e., in the willto power, for the growth of power; that every elevation of man brings with it the overcoming of narrower interpretations; that every strengthening and increase of power opens up new perspectives and means believing in new horizons--this idea permeates my writings. The world with which we are concerned is false, i. e., is not a fact but a fable and approximation on the basis of a meager sum of observations; it is \"in flux,\" as something in a state of becoming, as a falsehood always changing but never getting near the truth: for--there is no \"truth.\"617 (1883-1885)To impose upon becoming the character of being--that is the supreme willto power.Twofold falsification, on the part of the senses and of the spirit, to preserve a world of that which is, which abides, which is equivalent, etc.That everything recurs is the closest approximation of a world of becoming to a world of being:--high point of the meditation.From the values attributed to being proceed the condemnation of and discontent with becoming, after such a world of being had first been invented.The metamorphoses of what has being (body, God, ideas, laws of nature, formulas, etc.)\"Beings\" as appearance; reversal of values; appearance was that which conferred value--.Knowledge-in-itself in a world of becoming is impossible; so how is knowledge possible?

Decay of Europe.-- The annihilation of slavish evaluations.-- Dominion over the earth as a means of producing a higher type.-- The annihilation of the tartuffery called \"morality\" (Christianity as a hysterical kind of honesty in this:Augustine, Bunyan).-- The annihilation of suffrage universel; i. e., thesystem through which the lowest natures prescribe themselves as laws forthe higher.-- The annihilation of mediocrity and its acceptance. (The one-sided, individuals--peoples; to strive for fullness of nature through the pairing of opposites: race mixture to this end).-- The new courage--no a priori truths (such truths were sought by those accustomedto faith!), but a free subordination to a ruling idea that has its time:e. g., time as a property of space, etc.2. The Strong and the Weak"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"871 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)The victorious and unbridled: their depressive influence on the value ofthe desires. It was the dreadful barbarism of custom that, especially inthe Middle Ages, compelled the creation of a veritable \"league of virtue\"--together with an equally dreadful exaggeration of that which constitutes the value of man. Struggling \"civilization\" (taming) needs every kind of irons and torture to maintain itself against terribleness and beast-of-prey natures.Here a confusion is quite natural, although its influence has been fatal: that which men of power and will are able to demand of themselvesalso provides a measure of that which they may permit themselves. Such natures are the antithesis of the vicious and unbridled: although they may on occasion do things that would convict a lesser man of vice and immoderation.Here the concept of the \"equal value of men before God\" is extraordinarily harmful; one forbade actions and attitudes that were in themselves among the prerogatives of the strongly constituted--as if they were in themselves unworthy of men. One brought the entire tendencyof the strong into disrepute when one erected the protective measures ofthe weakest (those who were weakest also when confronting themselves) asa norm of value.Confusion went so far that one branded the very virtuosi of life (whose autonomy offered the sharpest antithesis to the vicious and unbridled) with the most opprobrious names. Even now one believes one must disapprove of a Cesare Borgia; that is simply laughable. The church has excommunicated German emperors on account of their vices: as if a monk or priest had any right to join in a discussion about what a Frederick II may demand of himself. A Don Juan is sent to hell: that is very naive. Has it been noticed that in heaven all interesting men are missing?-- Just a hint to the girls as to where they can best find theirsalvation.-- If one reflects with some consistency, and moreover with a deepened insight into what a \"great man\" is, no doubt remains that the church sends all \"great men\" to hell--it fights against all \"greatness of man.\"877 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)The revolution made Napoleon possible: that is its justification. For the sake of a similar prize one would have to desire the anarchical collapse of our entire civilization. Napoleon made nationalism possible:that is its excuse.The value of a man (apart from his morality or immorality, naturally; for with these concepts the value of a man is not even touched) does notreside in his utility; for it would continue to exist even if there wereno one to whom he could be of any use. And why could not precisely that man who produced the most disastrous effects be the pinnacle of the whole species of man: so high, so superior that everything would perish from envy of him?893 (Spring-Fall 1887)Hatred of mediocrity is unworthy of a philosopher: it is almost a question mark against his \"right to philosophy.\" Precisely because he isan exception he has to take the rule under his protection, he has to keep the mediocre in good heart."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"898 (Spring-Fall 1887)The strong of the future.-- That which partly necessity, partly chance has achieved here and there, the conditions for the production of a stronger type, we are now able to comprehend and consciously will: we are able to create the conditions under which such an elevation is possible.Until now, \"education\" has had in view the needs of society: not the possible needs of the future, but the needs of the society of the day. One desired to produce \"tools\" for it. Assuming the wealth of force weregreater, one could imagine forces being subtracted, not to serve the needs of society but some future need.Such a task would have to be posed the more it was grasped to what extent the contemporary form of society was being so powerfully transformed that at some future time it would be unable to exist for itsown sake alone, but only as a tool in the hands of a stronger race.The increasing dwarfing of man is precisely the driving force that brings to mind the breeding of a stronger race--a race that would be excessive precisely where the dwarfed species was weak and growing weaker (in will, responsibility, self-assurance, ability to posit goals for oneself).The means would be those history teaches: isolation through interests inpreservation that are the reverse of those which are average today; habituation to reverse evaluations; distance as a pathos; a free conscience in those things that today are most undervalued and prohibited.The homogenizing of European man is the great process that cannot be obstructed: one should even hasten it. The necessity to create a gulf, distance, order of rank, is given eo ipso--not the necessity to retard the process.As soon as it is established, this homogenizing species requires a justification: it lies in serving a higher sovereign species that standsupon the former and can raise itself to its task only by doing this. Notmerely a master race whose sole task is to rule, but a race with its ownsphere of life, with an excess of strength for beauty, bravery, culture,manners to the highest peak of the spirit; an affirming race that may grant itself every great luxury--strong enough to have no need of the tyranny of the virtue-imperative, rich enough to have no need of thrift and pedantry, beyond good and evil; a hothouse for strange and choice plants.>> new barbarians >> cynics {experimenters} conquerors >> union of spiritual superiority with well-being and an excess of strength >> 899 (1885)Our psychologists, whose glance lingers involuntarily on symptoms of decadence alone, again and again induce us to mistrust the spirit.

There exists also another type of barbarian, who comes from the heights: a species of conquering and ruling natures in search of material to mold.

Whether one wants to become softer, more yielding, more human, or more \"inhuman\"?5. Whether one wants to become more prudent or more ruthless?6. Whether one wants to reach a goal or to avoid all goals (as, e. g., the philosopher does who smells a boundary, a nook, a prison, a stupidity in every goal)?7.

Spring-Fall 1888)What has been ruined by the church's misuse of it:1. asceticism: one has hardly the courage so far to display its natural utility, its indispensability in the service of the education of the will. Our absurd pedagogic world, before which the \"useful civil servant\" hovers as a model, thinks it can get by with \"instruction,\" with brain drill; it has not the slightest idea that something else is needed first--education of will power; one devises tests for everything except for the main thing: whether one can will, whether one may promise; the young man finishes school without a single question, without any curiosity even, concerning this supreme value-problem of hisnature;2. fasting: in every sense--even as a means of preserving the delicacy of one's ability to enjoy all good things (e. g., occasionally to stop reading, listening to music, being pleasant; one must have fast days for"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"one's virtues, too);3. the \"monastery\": temporary isolation, accompanied by strict refusal, e. g., of letters; a kind of most profound self-reflection and self-recovery that desires to avoid, not \"temptations,\" but \"duties\": an escape from the daily round; a detachment from they tyranny of stimuli and influences that condemns us to spend our strength in nothing but reactions and does not permit the accumulation to the point of spontaneous activity (one should observe our scholars from close up: they think only reactively; i. e., they have to read before they can think);4. feasts: One has to be very coarse in order not to feel the presence of Christians and Christian values as an oppression beneath which all genuine festive feelings go to the devil. Feasts include: pride, exuberance, wantonness; mockery of everything serious and Philistine; a divine affirmation of oneself out of animal plenitude and perfection--one and all states which the Christian cannot honestly welcome. The feast is paganism par excellence;5. courage confronted with one's own nature: dressing up in \"moral costumes.-- That one has no need of moral formulas in order to welcome an affect; standard: how far we can affirm what is nature in us--how much or how little we need to have recourse to morality;6. death-- One must convert the stupid physiological fact into a moral necessity. So to live that one can also will at the right time to die!918 (Jan.-Fall 1888)One would make a fit little boy stare if one asked him: \"Would you like to become virtuous?\"-- but he will open his eyes wide if asked: \"Would you like to become stronger than your friends?\"--3. The Noble Man941 (Summer-Fall 1883)The meaning of our gardens and palaces (and to this extent also the meaning of all desire for riches) is to remove disorder and vulgarity from sight and to build a home for nobility of soul.The majority, to be sure, believe they will acquire higher natures when,those beautiful, peaceful objects have operated upon them: hence the rush to go to Italy and on travels, etc.; all reading and visits to theaters. They want to have themselves formed--that is the meaning of their cultural activity! But the strong, the mighty want to form and no longer to have anything foreign about them!Thus men also plunge into wild nature, not to find themselves but to lose and forget themselves in it. \"To be outside oneself\" as the desire of all the weak and the self-discontented.942 (1885)There is only nobility of birth, only nobility of blood. (I am not speaking here of the little word \"von\" or of the Almanach de Gotha [Genealogy reference book of the royal families of Europe.]: parenthesisfor asses.)

The Masters of the Earth958 (1884)I write for a species of man that does not yet exist: for the \"masters of the earth.\"Religions, as consolations and relaxations, dangerous: man believes he has a right to take his ease.In Plato's Theages it is written: \"Each one of us would like to be master over all men, if possible, and best of all God.\" This attitude must exist again.Englishmen, Americans, and Russians--—960 (1885-1886)From now on there will be more favorable preconditions for more comprehensive forms of dominion, whose like has never yet existed. And even this is not the most important thing; the possibility has been established for the production of international racial unions whose taskwill be to rear a master race, the future \"masters of the earth\";--a new, tremendous aristocracy, based on the severest self-legislation, in which the will of philosophical men of power and artist-tyrants will be made to endure for millennia--a higher kind of man who, thanks to their superiority in will, knowledge, riches, and influence, employ democraticEurope as their most pliant and supple instrument for getting hold of the destinies of the earth, so as to work as artists upon \"man\" himself.Enough: the time is coming when politics will have a different meaning.5. The Great Human Being966 (1884)In contrast to the animals, man has cultivated an abundance of contrary drives and impulses within himself: thanks to this synthesis, he is master of the earth.-- Moralities are the expression of locally limited orders of rank in his multifarious world of drives, so man should not perish through their contradictions. Thus a drive as master, its opposite weakened, refined, as the impulse that provides the stimulus for the activity of the chief drive.The highest man would have the greatest multiplicity of drives, in the relatively greatest strength that can be endured. Indeed, where the plant \"man\" shows himself strongest one finds instincts that conflict powerfully (e. g., in Shakespeare), but are controlled.6.

And unfortunately nothing at all amiable.984 (1884)Greatness of soul is inseparable from greatness of spirit. For it involves independence; but in the absence of spiritual greatness, independence ought not to be allowed, it causes mischief, even through its desire to do good and practice \"justice.\" Small spirits must obey--hence cannot possess greatness.II. Dionysus1003 (Jan.-Fall 1888)To him who has turned out well, who does my heart good, carved from woodthat is hard, gentle, and fragrant--in whom even the nose takes pleasure--this book is dedicated.He enjoys the taste of what is wholesome for him;his pleasure in anything ceases when the bounds of the wholesome are crossed;he divines the remedies for partial injuries; he has illnesses as great stimulants of his life;he knows how to exploit ill chances;he grows stronger through the accidents that threaten to destroy him;he instinctively gathers from all that he sees, hears, experiences, whatadvances his main concern--he follows a principle of selection--he allows much to fall through;he reacts with the slowness bred by a long caution and a deliberate pride--he tests a stimulus for its origin and its intentions, he does not submit;he is always in his own company, whether he deals with books, men, or landscapes;he honors by choosing, by admitting, by trusting.1007 (Spring-Fall 1887)To revalue values--what would that mean?

What one has not had the courage for is to call this \"man in himself\" good and to see in him the guarantee of the future. Neither has one dared to grasp that an increase in the terribleness of man is an accompaniment ofevery increase in culture; in this, one is still subject to the Christian ideal and takes its side against paganism, also against the Renaissance concept of virtù. But the key to culture is not to be found in this way: and in praxis one retains the falsification of history in favor of the \"good man\" (as if he alone constituted the progress of man)and the socialist ideal (i. e., the residue of Christianity and of Rousseau in the de-Christianized world).The struggle against the eighteenth century: its supreme overcoming by Goethe and Napoleon. Schopenhauer, too, struggles against it; but he involuntarily steps back into the seventeenth century--he is a modern Pascal, with Pascalian value judgments without Christianity. Schopenhauer was not strong enough for a new Yes.Napoleon: insight that the higher and the terrible man necessarily belong together. The \"man\" reinstated; the woman again accorded her due tribute of contempt and fear. \"Totality\" as health and highest activity;the straight line, the grand style in action rediscovered; the most powerful instinct, that of life itself, the lust to rule, affirmed.1023 (March-June 1888)Pleasure appears where there is the feeling of power.Happiness: in the triumphant consciousness of power and victory.Progress: the strengthening of the type, the ability for great willing; everything else is misunderstanding, danger.1026 (Summer-Fall 1883)Not \"happiness follows virtue\"--but the more powerful man first designates his happy state as virtue.Evil actions belong to the powerful and virtuous: bad, base ones to the subjected.The most powerful man, the creator, would have to be the most evil, in as much as he carries his ideal against the ideals of other men and remakes them in his own image. Evil here means: hard, painful, enforced.Such men as Napoleon must come again and again and confirm the belief inthe autocracy of the individual: but he himself was corrupted by the means he had to employ and lost noblesse of character. If he had had to prevail among a different kind of man he could have employed other means; and it would thus not seem to be a necessity for a Caesar to become bad.1028 (Spring-Fall 1887)Terribleness is part of greatness: let us not deceive ourselves."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"1038 (March-Fall 1888)--And how many new gods are still possible!

The idea [of the eternal recurrence]: the presuppositions that would have to be true if it were true. Its consequences.2. As the hardest idea: its probable effect if it were not prevented, i.e., if all values were not revalued.3. Means of enduring it: the revaluation of all values. No longer joy incertainty but uncertainty; no longer \"cause and effect\" but the continually creative; no longer will to preservation but to power; no longer the humble expression, \"everything is merely subjective,\" but \"itis also our work!-- Let us be proud of it!\"1060 (1884)To endure the idea of the recurrence one needs: freedom from morality; new means against the fact of pain (pain conceived as a tool, as the father of pleasure; there is no cumulative consciousness of displeasure); the enjoyment of all kinds of uncertainty, experimentalism, as a counterweight to this extreme fatalism; abolition of the concept of necessity; abolition of the \"will\"; abolition of \"knowledge-in-itself.\""},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Greatest elevation of the consciousness of strength in man, as he creates the overman.1061 (1887-1888)The two most extreme modes of thought--the mechanistic and the Platonic--are reconciled in the eternal recurrence: both as ideals.1062 (1885)If the world had a goal, it must have been reached. If there were for itsome unintended final state, this also must have been reached. If it were in any way capable of a pausing and becoming fixed, of \"being,\" then all becoming would long since have come to an end, along with all thinking, all \"spirit.\" The fact of \"spirit\" as a form of becoming proves that the world has no goal, no final state, and is incapable of being.The old habit, however, of associating a goal with every event and a guiding, creative God with the world, is so powerful that it requires aneffort for a thinker not to fall into thinking of the very aimlessness of the world as intended. This notion--that the world intentionally avoids a goal and even knows artifices for keeping itself from entering into a circular course--must occur to all those who would like to force on the world the ability for eternal novelty, i. e., on a finite, definite, unchangeable force of constant size, such as the world is, themiraculous power of infinite novelty in its forms and states. The world,even if it is no longer a god, is still supposed to be capable of the divine power of creation, the power of infinite transformations; it is supposed to consciously prevent itself from returning to any of its old forms; it is supposed to possess not only the intention but the means ofevery one of its movements at every moment so as to escape goals, final states, repetitions--and whatever else may follow from such an unforgivably insane way of thinking and desiring. It is still the old religious way of thinking and desiring, a kind of longing to believe that in some way the world is after all like the old beloved, infinite, boundlessly creative God--that in some way \"the old God still lives\"--that longing of Spinoza which was expressed in the words \"deus sive natura\" [God or nature.] (he even felt \"natura sive deus\").What, then, is the law and belief with which the decisive change, the recently attained preponderance of the scientific spirit over the religious, God-inventing spirit, is most clearly formulated? Is it not: the world, as force, may not be thought of as unlimited, for it cannot be so thought of; we forbid ourselves the concept of an infinite force as incompatible with the concept \"force.\" Thus--the world also lacks thecapacity for eternal novelty.1063 (1887-1888)The law of the conservation of energy demands eternal recurrence.1064 (1885)That a state of equilibrium is never reached proves that it is not possible. But in an indefinite space it would have to have been reached.Likewise in a spherical space. The shape of space must be the cause of eternal movement, and ultimately of all \"imperfection.\"That \"force\" and \"rest,\" \"remaining the same,\" contradict one another."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The measure of force (as magnitude) as fixed, but its essence in flux. [The MS continues: \"in tension, compelling.\"]\"Timelessness\" to be rejected. At any precise moment of a force, the absolute conditionality of a new distribution of all its forces is given: it cannot stand still. \"Change\" belongs to the essence, thereforealso temporality: with this, however, the necessity of change has only been posited once more conceptually.1065 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)A certain emperor always bore in mind the transitoriness of all things so as not to take them too seriously and to live at peace among them. Tome, on the contrary, everything seems far too valuable to be so fleeting: I seek an eternity for everything: ought one to pour the most precious salves and wines into the sea?-- My consolation is that everything that has been is eternal: the sea will cast it up again.1066 (March-June 1888)The new world-conception.-- The world exists; it is not something that becomes, not something that passes away. Or rather: it becomes, it passes away, but it has never begun to become and never ceased from passing away--it maintains itself in both.-- It lives on itself: its excrements are its food.We need not worry for a moment about the hypothesis of a created world. The concept \"create\" is today completely indefinable [This word is illegible.], unrealizable; merely a word, a rudimentary survival from the ages of superstition; one can explain nothing with a mere word. The last attempt to conceive a world that had a beginning has lately been made several times with the aid of logical procedures--generally, as onemay divine, with an ulterior theological motive.Lately one has sought several times to find a contradiction in the concept \"temporal infinity of the world in the past\" (regressus in infinitum): one has even found it, although at the cost of confusing thehead with the tail. Nothing can prevent me from reckoning backward from this moment and saying \"I shall never reach the end\"; just as I can reckon forward from the same moment into the infinite. Only if I made the mistake--I shall guard against it--of equating this correct concept of a regressus in infinitum with an utterly unrealizable concept of a finite progressus up to this present, only if I suppose that the direction (forward or backward) is logically a matter of indifference, would I take the head--this moment--for the tail: I shall leave that to you, my dear Herr Dühring!--I have come across this idea in earlier thinkers: every time it was determined by other ulterior considerations (--mostly theological, in favor of the creator spiritus). If the world could in any way become rigid, dry, dead, nothing, or if it could reach a state of equilibrium, or if it had any kind of goal that involved duration, immutability, the once-and-for-all (in short, speaking metaphysically: if becoming could resolve itself into being or into nothingness), then this state must have been reached: from which it follows--This is the sole certainty we have in our hands to serve as a correctiveto a great host of world hypotheses possible in themselves. If, e. g., the mechanistic theory cannot avoid the consequence, drawn for it by William Thomson [First Baron Kelvin (1824-1907), British physicist and mathematician who introduced the Kelvin or Absolute Scale of"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"temperature.], of leading to a final state, then the mechanistic theory stands refuted.If the world may be thought of as a certain definite quantity of force and as a certain definite number of centers of force--and every other representation remains indefinite and therefore useless--it follows that, in the great dice game of existence, it must pass through a calculable number of combinations. In infinite time, every possible combination would at some time or another be realized; more: it would berealized an infinite number of times. And since between every combination and its next recurrence all other possible combinations would have to take place, and each of these combinations conditions the entire sequence of combinations in the same series, a circular movement of absolutely identical series is thus demonstrated: the world as a circular movement that has already repeated itself infinitely often and plays its game in infinitum.This conception is not simply a mechanistic conception; for if it were that, it would not condition an infinite recurrence of identical cases, but a final state. Because the world has not reached this, mechanistic theory must be considered an imperfect and merely provisional hypothesis.1067 (1885)And do you know what \"the world\" is to me? Shall I show it to you in my mirror? This world: a monster of energy, without beginning, without end;a firm, iron magnitude of force that does not grow bigger or smaller, that does not expend itself but only transforms itself; as a whole, of unalterable size, a household without expenses or losses, but likewise without increase or income; enclosed by \"nothingness\" as by a boundary; not something blurry or wasted, not something endlessly extended, but set in a definite space as a definite force, and not a sphere that mightbe \"empty\" here or there, but rather as force throughout, as a play of forces and waves of forces, at the same time one and many, increasing here and at the same time decreasing there; a sea of forces flowing and rushing together, eternally changing, eternally flooding back, with tremendous years of recurrence, with an ebb and a flood of its forms; out of the simplest forms striving toward the most complex, out of the stillest, most rigid, coldest forms toward the hottest, most turbulent, most self-contradictory, and then again returning home to the simple outof this abundance, out of the play of contradictions back to the joy of concord, still affirming itself in this uniformity of its courses and its years, blessing itself as that which must return eternally, as a becoming that knows no satiety, no disgust, no weariness: this, my Dionysian world of the eternally self-creating, the eternally self-destroying, this mystery world of the twofold voluptuous delight, my \"beyond good and evil,\" without goal, unless the joy of the circle is itself a goal; without will, unless a ring feels good will toward itself--do you want a name for this world? A solution for all its riddles? A light for you, too, you best-concealed, strongest, most intrepid, most midnightly men?-- This world is the will to power--and nothing besides! And you yourselves are also this will to power--and nothing besides! The End"}]
