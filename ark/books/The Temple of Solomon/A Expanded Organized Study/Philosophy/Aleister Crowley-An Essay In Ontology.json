These arenot aspects of one being, but separate and evenantagonistic existences. All are equally real; we cannotaccept mystics of the type of Caird as being orthodoxexponents of the religion of Christ.The Hindus enumerate Brahm, infinite in alldimensions and directions—indistinguishable from thePleroma of the Gnostics—and Maya, illusion. This is ina sense the antithesis of noumenon and phenomenon,noumenon being negated of all predicates until itbecomes almost extinguished in the Nichts under thetitle of the Alles. (Cf. Max Müller on the metaphysicalNirvana, in his Dhammapada, Introductory Essay.) TheBuddhists express no opinion.Let us consider the force-quality in the existencesconceived of by those two religions respectively,remembering that the God of the Christian is infinite,and yet discussing the alternative if we could supposehim to be a finite God. In any equilibrated system offorces, we may sum and represent them as a triangle orseries of triangles which again resolve into one. And ifany one of the original forces in such a system may beconsidered, that one is equal to the resultant of theremainder. Let x, the purpose of the universe, be theresultant of the forces G, S, and M (God, Satan, andMan). Then M is also the resultant of G, S, and -x. Sothat we can regard either of our forces as supreme, andthere is no reason for worshipping one rather that theother. All are finite. This argument the Christiansclearly see: hence the development of God from thepetty joss of Genesis to the intangible, but self-contradictory spectre of to-day. But if G be infinite, theother forces can have no possible effect on it. AsWhewell says, in the strange accident by which heanticipates the metre of In Memoriam: “No force onearth, however great, can stretch a cord, however fine,into a horizontal line that shall be absolutely straight.”The definition of God as infinite therefore deniesman implicitly; while if he be finite, there is an end ofthe usual Christian reasons for worship, though Idaresay I could myself discover some reasonably goodones. [I hardly expect to be asked, somehow.]The resulting equilibrium of God and man,destructive of worship, is of course absurd. We mustreject it, unless we want to fall into Positivism,Materialism, or something of the sort. But if, then, wecall God infinite, how are we to regard man, and Satan?(the latter, at the very least, surely no integral part ofhim). The fallacy lies not in my demonstration (whichis also that of orthodoxy) that a finite God is absurd, butin the assumption that man has any real force.1In our mechanical system (as I have hinted above), ifone of the forces be infinite, the others, however great,are both relatively and absolutely nothing.In any category, infinity excludes finity, unless thatfinity be an identical part of that infinity.In the category of existing things, space beinginfinite, for on that hypothesis we are still working,either matter fills or does not fill it. If the former,matter is infinitely great; if the latter, infinitely small.Whether the matter-universe be 1010000 light-years indiameter or half a mile makes no difference; it isinfinitely small—in effect, Nothing. The unmath-ematical illusion that it does exist is what the Hinduscall Maya.If, on the other hand, the matter-universe is infinite,Brahm and God are crowded out, and the possibility ofreligion is equally excluded.We may now shift our objective. The Hindus cannotaccount intelligibly, though they try hard, for Maya, thecause of all suffering. Their position is radically weak,but at least we may say for them that they have tried tosquare their religion with their common sense. TheChristians, on the other hand, though they saw whitherthe Manichean Heresy2 must lead, and crushed it, havenot officially admitted the precisely similar conclusionwith regard to man, and denied the existence of thehuman soul as distinct from the divine soul.Trismegistus, Iamblichus, Porphyry, Boehme, and themystics generally have of course substantially done so,though occasionally with rather inexplicablereservations, similar to those made in some cases by theVedantists themselves.   1 Lully, Descartes, Spinoza, Schelling.

But, on hisbasal hypothesis of an infinite God, infinite space, time,and so on, no other conclusion is possible. DeanMansel is found in the impossible position of one whowill neither give up his premisses nor dispute thevalidity of his logical processes, but who shrinks inhorror from the inevitable conclusion; he supposes theremust be something wrong somewhere, and concludesthat the sole use of reason is to discover its owninferiority to faith. As Deussen2 well points out, faith inthe Christian sense merely amounts to being convincedon insufficient grounds.3 This is surely the last refugeof incompetence.But though, always on the original hypothesis of theinfinity of space, &c., the Advaitist position of theVedantists and the great Germans is unassailable, yet onpractical grounds the Dvaitists have all the advantage.Fichte and the others exhaust themselves trying to turnthe simple and obvious position that: “If the Ego aloneexists, where is any place, not only for morals andreligion, which we can very well do without, but for themost essential and continuous acts of life? Why shouldan infinite Ego fill a non-existent body with imaginaryfood cooked in thought only over an illusionary fire by acook who is not there? Why should infinite power usesuch finite means, and very often fail even then?”What is the sum total of the Vedantist position? “‘I’am an illusion, externally. In reality, the true ‘I’ am theInfinite, and if the illusionary ‘I’ could only realise Who‘I’ really am, how very happy we should all be!” Andhere we have Karma, rebirth, all the mighty laws ofnature operating nowhere in nothing!There is no room for worship or for morality in theAdvaitist system. All the specious pleas of theBhagavad-Gita, and the ethical works of WesternAdvaitist philosophers, are more or less consciouslyconfusion of thought. But no subtlety can turn thepractical argument; the grinning mouths of the Dvaitistguns keep the fort of Ethics, and warn metaphysics tokeep off the rather green grass of religion.That its apologists have devoted so much time,thought, scholarship and ingenuity to this question isthe best proof of the fatuity of the Advaita position.There is then a flaw somewhere. I boldly take up theglove against all previous wisdom, revert to the mostelementary ideas of cannibal savages, challenge all themost vital premisses and axiomata that have passedcurrent coin with philosophy for centuries, and presentmy theory.   1 Encyclopedia Britannica, Art. Metaphysics.2 “The Principles of Metaphysics.” Macmillan.3 Or, as the Sunday-school boy said: “Faith is the power ofbelieving what we know to be true. I quote Deussen with themore pleasure, because it is about the only sentence in all hiswritings with which I am in accord.—A.C.I clearly foresee the one difficulty, and will discuss itin advance. If my conclusions on this point are notaccepted, we may at once get back to our previousirritable agnosticism, and look for our Messiahelsewhere. But if we can see together on this one point,I think things will go fairly smoothly afterwards.Consider4 Darkness! Can we philosophically oractually regard as different the darkness produced byinterference of light and that existing in the mereabsence of light?Is Unity really identical with .9 recurring?Do we not mean different things when we speakrespectively of 2 sine 60° and of 3?Charcoal and diamond are obviously different in thecategories of colour, crystallisation, hardness, and so on;but are they not really so even in that of existence?The third example is to my mind the best. 2 sine 60°and 3 are unreal and therefore never conceivable, atleast to the present constitution of our humanintelligences. Worked out, neither has meaning;unworked, both have meaning, and that a differentmeaning in one case and the other.We have thus two terms, both unreal, bothinconceivable, yet both representing intelligible anddiverse ideas to our minds (and this is the point!)though identical in reality and convertible by a processof reason which simulates or replaces that apprehensionwhich we can never (one may suppose) attain to.Let us apply this idea to the Beginning of all things,about which the Christians lie frankly, the Hindusprevaricate, and the Buddhists are discreetly silent,while not contradicting even the gross and ridiculousaccounts of the more fantastic Hindu visionaries.The Qabalists explain the “First Cause”5 by thephrase: “From 0 to 1, as the circle opening out into theline.” The Christian dogma is really identical, for bothconceive of a previous and eternally existing God,though the Qabalists hedge by describing this latentDeity as “Not.” Later commentators, notably theillustrious6 MacGregor-Mathers, have explained thisNot as “negatively-existing.” Profound as is my respectfor the intellectual and spiritual attainments of himwhom I am proud to have been permitted to call mymaster,6 I am bound to express my view that when theQabalists said Not, they meant Not, and nothing else.In fact, I really claim to have re-discovered the long-lostand central Arcanum of those divine philosophers.I have no serious objection to a finite god, or gods,distinct from men and things. In fact, personally, Ibelieve in them all, and admit them to possessinconceivable though not infinite power.The Buddhists admit the existence of Maha-Brahma,but his power and knowledge are limited; and hisagelong day must end. I find evidence everywhere, evenin our garbled and mutilated version of the HebrewScriptures, that Jehovah’s power was limited in all sortsof ways. At the Fall, for instance, Tetragrammaton   4 Ratiocination may perhaps not take us far. But acontinuous and attentive study of these quaint points ofdistinction may give us an intuition, or direct mind-apperception of what we want, one way or the other.—A.C.5 An expression they carefully avoid using.—A.C.6 I retain this sly joke from the first edition."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"3Elohim has to summon his angles hastily to guard theTree of Life, lest he should be proved a liar. For had itoccurred to Adam to eat of that Tree before theirtransgression was discovered, or had the Serpent beenaware of its properties, Adam would indeed have livedand not died. So that a mere accident saved theremnants of the already besmirched reputation of theHebrew tribal Fetich.When Buddha was asked how things came to be, hetook refuge in silence, which his disciples veryconveniently interpreted as meaning that the questiontended not to edification.I take it that the Buddha (ignorant, doubtless, ofalgebra) had sufficiently studied philosophy andpossessed enough worldly wisdom to be well aware thatany system he might promulgate would be instantlyattacked and annihilated by the acumen of his numerousand versatile opponents.Such teaching as he gave on the point may besummed up as follows. “Whence, whither, why, weknow not; but we do know that we are here, that wedislike being here, that there is a way out of the wholeloathsome affair—let us make haste and take it!”I am not so retiring in disposition; I persist in myinquiries, and at last the appalling question is answered,and the past ceases to intrude its problems upon mymind.Here you are! Three shies a penny! Change all badarguments.I ASSERT THE ABSOLUTENESS OF THE QABALISTICZERO.When we say that the Cosmos sprang from 0, whatkind of 0 do we mean? By 0 in the ordinary sense of theterm we mean “absence of extension in any of thecategories.”When I say “No cat has two tails,” I do not mean, asthe old fallacy runs, that “Absence-of-cat possesses twotails”; but that “In the category of two-tailed things,there is no extension of cat.”Nothingness is that about which no positiveproposition is valid. We cannot truly affirm: “Nothing-ness is green, or heavy, or sweet.”Let us call time, space, being, heaviness, hunger, thecategories.1 If a man be heavy and hungry, he isextended in all these, besides, of course, many more.But let us suppose that these five are all. Call the manX; his formula is then Xt+s+b+h+h. If he now eat; he willcease to be extended in hunger; if he be cut off fromtime and gravitation as well, he will now be representedby the formula Xs+b. Should he cease to occupy spaceand to exist, his formula would then be X0. Thisexpression is equal to 1; whatever X may represent, if itbe raised to the power of 0 (this meaningmathematically “if it be extended in no dimension orcategory”), the result is Unity, and the unknown factorX is eliminated.This is the Advaitist idea of the future of man; hispersonality, bereft of all qualities, disappears and is lost,while in its place arises the impersonal Unity, The   1 I cannot here discuss the propriety of representing thecategories as dimensions. It will be obvious to any student ofthe integral calculus, or to any one who appreciates thegeometrical significance of the term x4.—A.C.Pleroma, Parabrahma, or the Allah of the Unity-adoringfollowers of Mohammed. (To the Musulman fakir,Allah is by no means a personal God.)Unity is thus unaffected, whether or no it be extendedin any of the categories. But we have already agreed tolook to 0 for the Uncaused.Now if there was in truth 0 “before the beginning ofyears,” THAT 0 WAS EXTENDED IN NONE OF THECATEGORIES, FOR THERE COULD HAVE BEENNO CATEGORIES IN WHICH IT COULD EXTEND!If our 0 was the ordinary 0 of mathematics, there wasnot truly absolute 0, for 0 is, as I have shown, dependenton the idea of categories. If these existed, then thewhole question is merely thrown back; we must reach astate in which this 0 is absolute. Not only must we getrid of all subjects, but of all predicates. By 0 (inmathematics) we really mean 0n, where n is the finalterm of a natural scale of dimensions, categories, orpredicates. Our Cosmic Egg, then, from which thepresent universe arose, was Nothingness, extended in nocategories, or graphically, 00. This expression is in itspresent form meaningless. Let us discover its value by asimple mathematical process!000001111==−Multiply by1=nnThen 00011nn×=×∞.Now the multiplying of the infinitely great by theinfinitely small results in SOME UNKNOWN FINITENUMBER EXTENDED IN AN UNKNOWN NUMBEROF CATEGORIES. It happened, when this our GreatInversion took place, from the essence of allnothingness to finity extended in innumerablecategories, that an incalculably vast system wasproduced. Merely by chance, chance in the truest senseof the term, we are found with gods, men, stars, planets,devils, colours, forces, and all the materials of theCosmos: and with time, space, and causality, theconditions limiting and involving them all.2Remember that it is not true to say that our 00existed; nor that it did not exist. The idea of existencewas just as much unformulated as that of toasted cheese.But 00 is a finite expression, or has a finite phase,and our universe is a finite universe; its categories arethemselves finite, and the expression “infinite space” isa contradiction in terms. The idea of an absolute andinfinite3 God is relegated to the limbo of all similar idleand pernicious perversions of truth. Infinity remains,but only as a mathematical conception as impossible innature as the square root of -1. Against all thismathematical, or semi-mathematical, reasoning, it maydoubtless be objected that our whole system of numbers,and of manipulating them, is merely a series ofconventions. When I say that the square root of three is   2 Compare and contrast this doctrine with that of HerbertSpencer (“First Principles,” Pt. I.), and see my “Science andBuddhism” for a full discussion of the difference involved.—A.

But this, theoretically true, is practically absurd.If I mean “the number of a, b, and c,” it does not matterif I write 3 or 503; the idea is a definite one; and it isthe fundamental ideas of consciousness of which we aretreating, and to which we are compelled to refereverything, whether proximately or ultimately.So also my equation, fantastic as it may seem, has aperfect and absolute parallel in logic. Thus: let usconvert twice the proposition “some books are on thetable.” By negativing both terms we get “Absence-of-book is not on the table,” which is precisely my equationbackwards, and a thinkable thing. To reverse theprocess, what do I mean when I say “some pigs, but notthe black pig, are not in the sty”? I imply that the blackpig is in the sty. All I have done is to represent theconversion as a change, rather than as merely anotherway of expressing the same thing. And “change” isreally not my meaning either; for change, to our minds,involves the idea of time. But the whole thing isinconceivable—to ratiocination, though not to thought.Note well too that if I say “Absence-of-books is not onthe table,” I cannot convert it only “All books are on thetable” but only to “some books are on the table.” Theproposition is an “I” and not an “A” proposition. It isthe Advaita blunder to make it so; and may a schoolboyhas fed off the mantelpiece for less.There is yet another proof—the proof by exclusion. Ihave shown, and metaphysicians practically admit, thefalsity alike of Dvaitism and Advaitism. The third, theonly remaining theory, this theory, must, howeverantecedently improbably, however difficult toassimilate, be true.1“My friend, my young friend,” I think I hear someChristian cleric say, with an air of profound wisdom,not untinged with pity, condescending to pose beardlessand brainless impertinence: “where is the Cause for thistruly remarkable change?”That is exactly where the theory rears to heaven itsstoutest bastion! There is not, and could not be, anycause. Had 00 been extended in causality, no changecould have taken place.2Here then, are we, finite beings in a finite universe,time, space, and causality themselves finite(inconceivable as it may seem) with our individuality,and all the “illusions” of the Advaitists, just as real asthey practically are to our normal consciousness.As Schopenhauer, following Buddha, points out,suffering is a necessary condition of this existence.3The war of the contending forces as they grind them-selves down to the final resultant must cause endlessagony. We may one day be able to transform the   1 I may remark that the distinction between this theory andthe normal one of the Immanence of the Universe, is trivial,perhaps even verbal only. Its advantage, however, is that, byhypostatising nothing, we avoid the necessity of anyexplanation. How did nothing come to be? is a questionwhich requires no answer.2 See the Questions of King Milinda, vol. ii. p. 103.3 See also Huxley, “Evolution and Ethics.”categories of emotion as certainly and easily as we nowtransform the categories of force, so that in a few yearsChicago may be importing suffering in the raw state andturning it into tinned salmon: but at present the reverseprocess is alone practicable.How, then, shall we escape? Can we expect the entireuniverse to resolve itself back into the phase of 00?Surely not. In the first place there is no reason why thewhole should do so; xyis just as convertible as x. Butworse, the category of causality has already beenformed, and its inertia is sufficient to oppose a mostserious stumbling-block to so gigantic a process.The task before us is consequently of a terriblenature. It is easy to let things slide, to grin and bear it infact, until everything is merged in the ultimate unity,which may or may not be decently tolerable. But whilewe wait?There now arises the question of freewill. Causalityis probably not fully extended in its own category,4 acircumstance which gives room for a fractional amountof freewill. If this be not so, it matters little; for if I findmyself in a good state, that merely proves that mydestiny took me there. We are, as Herbert Spencerobserves, self-deluded with the idea of freewill; but ifthis be so, nothing matters at all. If, however, HerbertSpencer is mistaken (unlikely as it must appear), thenour reason is valid, and we should seek out the rightpath and pursue it. The question therefore need nottrouble us at all.Here then we see the use of morals and of religion,and all the rest of the bag of tricks. All these aremethods, bad or good, for extricating ourselves from theuniverse.Closely connected with this question is that of thewill of God. People argue that an Infinite intelligencemust have been at work on this cosmos. I reply No!There is no intelligence at work worthy of the name.The Laws of Nature may be generalised in one—theLaw of Inertia. Everything moves in the directiondetermined by the path of least resistance; species arise,develop, and die as their collective inertia determines; tothis Law there is no exception but the doubtful one ofFreewill; the Law of Destiny itself is formally and reallyidentical with it.5As to an infinite intelligence, all philosophers of anystanding are agreed that all-love and all-power areincompatible. The existence of the universe is astanding proof of this.The Deist needs the Optimist to keep him company;over their firesides all goes well, but it is a sadshipwreck they suffer on emerging into the cold world.   4 Causality is itself a secondary, and in its limitation asapplied to volition, an inconceivable idea. H. Spencer, op. cit.This consideration alone should add great weight to theagnostic, and à fortiori to the Buddhist, position.5 See H. Spencer, “First Principles,” “The Knowable,” fora fair summary of the facts underlying this generalisation;which indeed he comes within an ace of making in so manywords. It may be observed that this law is nearly if not quiteaxiomatic, its contrary being enormously difficult if notimpossible to formulate mentally."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"5This is why those who seek to buttress up religion areso anxious to prove that the universe has no realexistence, or only a temporary and relativelyunimportant one; the result is of course the usual self-destructive Advaitist muddle.The precepts of morality and religion are thus of use,of vital use to us, in restraining the more violent forcesalike of nature and of man. For unless law and orderprevail, we have not the necessary quiet and resourcesfor investigating, and learning to bring under ourcontrol, all the divergent phenomena of our prison, awork which we undertake that at last we may be able tobreak down the walls, and find that freedom which aninconsiderate Inversion has denied.The mystical precepts of pseudo-Zoroaster, Buddha,Çankaracharya, pseudo-Christ and the rest, are foradvanced students only, for direct attack on theproblem. Our servants, the soldiers, lawyers, all formsof government, make this our nobler work possible, andit is the gravest possible mistake to sneer at thosehumble but faithful followers of the great minds of theworld.What, then, are the best, easiest, directed methods toattain our result? And how shall we, in mortallanguage, convey to the minds of others the nature of aresult so beyond language, baffling even imaginationeagle-pinioned? It may help us if we endeavour tooutline the distinction between the Hindu and Buddhistmethods and aims of the Great Work.The Hindu method is really mystical in the truestsense; for, as I have shown, the Atman is not infiniteand eternal: one day it must sink down with the otherforces. But by creating in though an infinite ImpersonalPersonality, by defining it as such, all religions exceptthe Buddhist and, as I believe, the Qabalistic, havesought to annihilate their own personality. TheBuddhist aims directly at extinction; the Hindu deniesand abolished his own finity by the creation of anabsolute.As this cannot be done in reality, the process isillusory; yet it is useful in the early stages—as far, atany rate, as the fourth stage of Dhyana, where theBuddha places it, though the Yogis claim to attain toNirvikalpa-Samadhi, and that Moksha is identical withNirvana; the former claim I see no reason to deny them;the latter statement I must decline at present to accept.The task of the Buddhist recluse is roughly asfollows. He must plunge every particle of his being intoone idea: right views, aspirations, word, deed, life, will-power, meditation, rapture, such are the stages of hisliberation, which resolves itself into a struggle againstthe laws of causality. He cannot prevent past causestaking effect, but he can prevent present causes fromhaving any future results. The exoteric Christian andHindu rather rely on another person to do this for them,and are further blinded by the thirst for life andindividual existence, the most formidable obstacle of all,in fact a negation of the very object of all religion.Schopenhauer shows that life is assured to the will-to-live, and unless Christ (or Krishna, as the case may be)destroys these folk by superior power—a task fromwhich almightiness might well recoil baffled!—I muchfear that eternal life, and consequently eternal suffering,joy, and change of all kinds, will be their melancholyfate. Such persons are in truth their own real enemies.Many of them, however, believing erroneously that theyare being “unselfish,” do fill their hearts with devotionfor the beloved Saviour, and this process is, in itsultimation, so similar to the earlier stages of the GreatWork itself, that some confusion has, stupidly enough,arisen; but for all that the practice has been the meansof bringing some devotees on to the true Path of theWise, unpromising as such material must sound tointelligent ears.The esoteric Christian or Hindu adopts a middlepath. Having projected the Absolute from his mind, heendeavours to unite his consciousness with that of hisAbsolute and of course his personality is destroyed inthe process. Yet it is to be feared that such an adept toooften starts on the path with the intention ofaggrandising his personality to the utmost. But hismethod is so near to the true one that this tendency issoon corrected, as it were automatically.(The mathematical analogue of this process is toprocure for yourself the realisation of the nothingness ofyourself by keeping the fourth dimension ever present toyour mind.)The illusory nature of this idea of an infinite Atmanis well shown by the very proof which that mostdistinguished Vedantist, the late Swami Vivekananda(no connection with the firm of a similar name1 acrossthe street), gives of the existence of the infinite. “Thinkof a circle!” says he. “You will in a moment becomeconscious of an infinite circle around your originalsmall one.” The fallacy is obvious. The big circle is notinfinite at all, but is itself limited by the little one. Butto take away the little circle, that is the method of theesoteric Christian or the mystic. But the process isnever perfect, because however small the little circlebecomes, its relation with the big circle is still finite.But even allowing for a moment that the Absolute isreally attainable, is the nothingness of the finity relatedto it really identical with that attained directly by theBuddhist Arahat? This, consistently with my formerattitude, I feel constrained to deny. The consciousnessof the Absolute-wala2 is really extended infinitely ratherthan diminished infinitely, as he will himself assureyou. True, Hegel says: “Pure being is pure nothing!”and it is true that the infinite heat and cold, joy andsorrow, light and darkness, and all the other pairs ofopposites,3 cancel one another out: yet I feel ratherafraid of this Absolute! Maybe its joy and sorrow arerepresented in phases, just as 00 and finity are phases ofan identical expression, and I have an even chance onlyof being on the right side of the fence!   1 The Swami Vive Ananda, Madame Horos, for whosehistory consult the Criminal Law Reports.2 Wala, one whose business is connected with anything.E.g. Jangli-wala, one who lives in, or has business with, ajungle, i.e. a wild man, or a Forest Conservator.3 The Hindus see this as well as any one, and call AtmanSat-chit-ananda, these being above the pairs of opposites,rather on the Hegelian lines of the reconciliation (rather thanthe identity) of opposites in a master-idea. We havedismissed infinity as the figment of a morbid mathematic: butin any case the same disproof applies to it as to God.—A.C."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"6The Buddhist leaves no chances of this kind; in allhis categories he is infinitely unextended; though thecategories themselves exist; he is in fact 0A+B+C+D+E+..+Nand capable of no conceivable change, unless weimagine Nirvana to be incomprehensibly divided byNirvana, which would (supposing the two Nirvanas topossess identical categories) result in the production ofthe original 00. But a further change would benecessary even then before serious mischief could result.In short, I think we may dismiss from our minds anyalarm in respect of this contingency.On mature consideration, therefore, I confidently anddeliberately take my refuge in the Triple Gem.Namo Tasso Bhagavato Arahato Sammasam-buddhasa!1Let there be hereafter no discussion of the classicalproblems of philosophy and religion! In the light of thisexposition the antitheses of noumenon andphenomenon, unity and multiplicity, and their kind, areall reconciled, and the only question that remains is thatof finding the most satisfactory means of attainingNirvana—extinction of all that exists, knows, or feels;extinction final and complete, utter and absoluteextinction. For by these words only can we indicateNirvana: a state which transcends thought cannot bedescribed in thought’s language. But from the point ofview of thought extinction is complete: we have no datafor discussing that which is unthinkable, and mustdecline to do so. This is the answer to those who accusethe Buddha of hurling his Arahats (and himself) fromSamma Samadhi to annihilation.Pray observe in the first place that my solution of theGreat Problem permits the co-existence of an indefinitenumber of means: they need not even be compatible;Karma, rebirth, Providence, prayer, sacrifice, baptism,there is room for all. On the old and, I hope, nowfinally discredited hypothesis of an infinite being, thesupporters of these various ideas, while explicitlyaffirming them, implicitly denied. Similarly, note thatthe Qabalistic idea of a supreme God (and innumerablehierarchies) is quite compatible with this theory,provided that the supreme God is not infinite.Now as to our weapons. The advanced Yogis of theEast, like the Nonconformists at home, have practicallyabandoned ceremonial as idle. I have yet to learn,however, by what dissenters have replaced it! I take thisto be an error, except in the case of a very advancedYogi. For there exists a true magical ceremonial, vitaland direct, whose purpose has, however, at any rate ofrecent times, been hopelessly misunderstood.Nobody any longer supposes that any means but thatof meditation is of avail to grasp the immediate causesof our being; if some person retort that he prefers to relyon a Glorified Redeemer, I simply answer that he is thevery nobody to whom I now refer.Meditation is then the means; but only the suprememeans. The agony column of the Times is the suprememeans of meeting with the gentleman in the brownbillycock and frock coat, wearing a green tie andchewing a straw, who was at the soirée of the CarltonClub last Monday night; no doubt! but this means is   1 Hail unto Thee, the Blessed One, the Perfect One, theEnlightened One!seldom or never used in the similar contingency of acow-elephant desiring her bull in the jungles of Ceylon.Meditation is not within the reach of every one; notall possess the ability; very few indeed (in the West atleast) have the opportunity.In any case what the Easterns call “one-pointedness”is an essential preliminary to even early stages of truemeditation. And iron will-power is a still earlierqualification.By meditation I do not mean merely “thinking about”anything, however profoundly, but the absolute restraintof the mind to the contemplation of a single object,whether gross, fine, or altogether spiritual.Now true magical ceremony is entirely directed toattain this end, and forms a magnificent gymnasium forthose who are not already finished mental athletes. Byact, word, and thought, both in quantity and quality, theone object of the ceremony is being constantly indicated.Every fumigation, purification, banishing, invocation,evocation, is chiefly a reminder of the single purpose,until the supreme moment arrives, and every fibre of thebody, every force-channel of the mind, is strained out inone overwhelming rush of the Will in the directiondesired. Such is the real purport of all the apparentlyfantastic directions of Solomon, Abramelin, and othersages of repute. When a man has evoked and masteredsuch forces as Taphtartharath, Belial, Amaimon, andthe great powers of the elements, then he may be safelybe permitted to try to stop thinking. For, needless tosay, the universe, including the thinker, exists only byvirtue of the thinker’s thought.2In yet one other way is magic a capital trainingground for the Arahat. True symbols do really awakethose macrocosmic forces of which they are the eidola,and it is possible in this manner very largely to increasethe magical “potential” to borrow a term from electricalscience.Of course, there are bad and invalid processes, whichtend rather to disperse or to excite the mind-stuff ratherthan to control it; these we must discard. But there is atrue magical ceremonial, the central Arcanum alike ofEastern and Western practical transcendentalism.Needless to observe, if I knew it, I should not disclose it.I therefore affirm the validity of the Qabalistictradition in its practical part as well as in those exaltedregions of thought through which we have to recently,and so hardly, travelled.3   2 See Berkeley and his expounders, for the Western shapeof this Eastern commonplace. Huxley, however, curiouslyenough, states the fact in almost these words.—A.C.3 A possible mystic transfiguration of the Vedanta systemhas been suggested to me on the lines of the Syllogism—God = Being (Patanjali).Being= Nothing (Hegel).God= Nothing (Buddhism).Or, in the language of religion:Every one may admit that monotheism, exalted by theintroduction of the ∞ symbol, is equivalent to pantheism.Pantheism and atheism are really identical, as the opponentsof both are the first to admit.If this be really taught, I must tender my apologies, forthe reconcilement is of course complete.—A.C.
