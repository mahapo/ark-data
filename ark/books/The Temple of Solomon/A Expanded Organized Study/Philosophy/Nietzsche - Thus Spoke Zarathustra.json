In a letter, Nietzsche wonders if Louise canlong stand his \"anti-democratic\" ideas and his aphorisms about wo-men.[5] (1885) Difficulties start with his anti-Semitic publisher, Sch-meitzner who refuses to publishZarathustra 4.In a letter to Overbeck:\"my writings lie completely buried and unexhumeable in this anti-Semit-ic hole (meaning Schmeitzner)\"[5](1885)41- November: Nietzsche is delighted to encounter an astronomer, a\"snow white old man,\" making observations who recites passages fromHuman, All Too Human.[5] (1885)June: He beginsBeyond Good and Evil.August: He spends time with Meta von Salis, Emily Flynn, Helen Zim-mern.42- November: Accidentally \"discovers\" Dostoevsky. \"... my joy was ex-traordinary: I would have to go back to my acquaintance with Stendhal'sRouge et Noir to recall the same degree of delight\"[5](1886)January: He completesBeyond Good and Evil. August: The book is pub-lished.261"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"October: Nietzsche writes the fifth book ofThe Gay Science.43-November: Nietzsche sends a copy ofGenealogy of Moralsto GeorgBrandes, the influential and famous Danish literary critic, who replies,\"you are without doubt the most exciting of German writers.\"[4] (p.314).A lively correspondence ensues.Early April: Nietzsche discovers Turin and is delighted with the dryweather, the people, the cuisine and the beautiful, \"quiet, aristocratic\" at-mosphere of the city.April:Brandes writes that he had been \"seized with a kind of angerthat no one in Scandinavia knows of you, and had quickly decided tomake you famous all in one blow\".He will give a series of open lecturesat the University of Copenhagen on Nietzsche's philosophy.The fivelectures are a great success and at the end Brandes is given a ovation by alarge audience. In May he tells Nietzsche, \"Your name now, I can saywithout exaggeration, is verypopularin all intelligent circles of Copen-hagen andknown, at least in all of Scandinavia.[7] (p.289)Later in theyear Brandes \"completely wins over\" the influential Swedish writerAugust Strindberg, who tells Nietzsche, \"I am ending all my letters,'Read Nietzsche' \". [4] (p.333)Nietzsche is delighted by all this. The rest of the year becomes one ofhis happiest and most productive years. His health and energy seemmuch better. He senses approaching fame. He writes 5 books where hisusual pace is one per year.Turin continues to enchant him especiallyafter September.May: He begins work onThe Wagner Case.June: Nietzsche leaves for Sils Maria. He works onTwilight of the Idols.September: He finishesThe Wagner Caseand theTwilight of the Idolsandbegins work on theThe Antichrist.44-October:On the 15th, his 44th birthday, he starts writing his autobio-graphy and commentary on his writings entitledEcce Homo.End of November:The Antichristis all but finished.December 12-15 Nietzsche quickly assembles a short book of previouspassages calledNietzsche Contro Wagner.End of December:Ecce Homois almost completed.January 3: On a street in Turin, Italy, Nietzsche collapses unconsciousafter tearfully flinging his arms around a horse that was being beaten byits owner.

The first onslaught (1873) was directed against German culture,upon which I looked down even at that time with unmitigated contempt.Without either sense, substance, or goal, it was simply \" public opinion.\"There could be no more dangerous misunderstanding than to supposethat Germany's success at arms proved anything in favour of Germanculture-and still less the triumph of this culture over that of France.The second essay (1874) brings to light that which is dangerous, thatwhich corrodes and poisons life in our manner of pursuing scientificstudy : Life is diseased, thanks to this dehumanised piece of clockworkand mechanism, thanks to the \" impersonality\" of the workman, and thefalse economy of the \" division of labour.\" The object, which is culture, islost sight of: modern scientific activity as a means thereto simply pro-duces barbarism. In this treatise, the \" historical sense,\" of which this cen-tury is so proud, is for the first time recognised as sickness, as a typicalsymptom of decay. -In the third and fourth essays, a sign-post is set up pointing to a higherconcept of culture, to a re-establishment of the notion \" culture \"; andtwo pictures of the hardest self-love and self-discipline are presented,two essentially un-modern types, full of the most sovereign contempt forall that which lay around them and was called \" Empire,\" \" Culture,\" \"Christianity,\" \" Bismarck,\" and \" Success,\" - these two types wereSchopenhauer and Wagner, or, in a word, Nietzsche... .\" [3]part 5, sec. 2HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMANAge34 - 35,1877 - 1879\"... Human, all-too-Human, with its two sequels, is the memorial of acrisis. It is called a book for free spirits: almost every sentence in it is theexpression of a triumph - by means of it I purged myself of everything inme which was foreign to my nature. Idealism is foreign to me : the titleof the book means: \"Where you see ideal things I see - human, alas! all-too-human things! \"... I know men better. The word \" free spirit\" in thisbook must not be understood as anything else than a spirit that has be-come free, that has once more taken possession of itself.\" [3] part 6, sec. 1THE DAWN265"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Age36-1880\"... With this book I open my campaign against morality... . This yes-saying book projects its light, its love, its tenderness, over all evil things,it restores to them their soul, their clear conscience, and their superiorright and privilege to exist on earth. Morality is not assailed, it simplyceases to be considered... .\" [3] part 6, sec. 1\"... The question concerning the origin of moral valuations is therefore amatter of the highest importance to me because it determines the futureof mankind. The demand made upon us to believe that everything isreally in the best hands, that a certain book, the Bible, gives us the defin-ite and comforting assurance that there is a Providence that wisely rulesthe fate of man,-when translated back into reality amounts simply tothis, namely, the will to stifle the truth which maintains the reverse of allthis, which is that until now man has been in the worst possible hands,and that he has been governed by the physiologically botched, the menof cunning and burning revengefulness, and the so-called \" saints \" -those slanderers of the world and violators of humanity... . .\"[3] part 7,sec. 2THE GAY SCIENCEAge37-1881\"[This book] seems to be written with the language of the wind thatmelts ice and snow: high spirits, unrest, contradiction, and the weatherof April are present in it... . Thankfulness comes out of it continuously,as if something unexpected had just happened - the thankfulness of aconvalescent - for his convalescence was not expected. \"Gay Science\":that signifies the celebration of a spirit who has resisted patiently a ter-rible, long pressure - patiently, severely, coldly, never submitting, butalso without hope - and now all at once hope has attacked him, the hopefor health, and the intoxication of a convalescent.\"[9] Preface, sec. 1\"... Dawn of Day is a yes-saying book, profound, but clear and kindly.The same applies once more and in the highest degree to La GayaScienza : in almost every sentence of this book, profundity and playful-ness go gently hand in hand... .\" [3] part 8, sec. 1266"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRAAge39-1882-85\"... The fundamental idea of the work, the Eternal Recurrence, thehighest formula of a Yes-saying to life that can ever be attained, was firstconceived in the month of August 1881. I made a note of the idea on asheet of paper, with the postscript: \"Six thousand feet beyond man andtime.\"[3] (part 9, sec. 1)... inspiration?... I will describe it. If one had the smallest vestige of su-perstition left in one, it would hardly be possible completely to set asidethe idea that one is the mere incarnation, mouthpiece, or medium of analmighty power. The idea of revelation, in the sense that somethingwhich profoundly convulses and upsets one becomes suddenly visibleand audible with indescribable certainty and accuracy-describes thesimple fact. One hears-one does not seek; one takes-one does not askwho gives: a thought suddenly flashes up like lightning, it comes withnecessity, without faltering-I have never had any choice in the matter... ..[3](part 9, sec. 3)... The psychological problem presented by the type of Zarathustra is,how can he, who in an unprecedented manner says no, and acts no, inregard to all that which has been affirmed until now, remain neverthe-less a yes-saying spirit? how can he who bears the heaviest destiny onhis shoulders and whose very life-task is a fatality, yet be the brightestand the most transcendental of spirits-for Zarathustra is a dancer? howcan he who has the hardest and most terrible grasp of reality, and whohas thought the most \" abysmal thoughts,\" nevertheless avoid conceivingthese things as objections to existence, or even as objections to the eternalrecurrence of existence?- how is it that on the contrary he finds reasonsfor being himself the eternal affirmation of all things, \"the tremendousand unlimited saying of Yes and Amen\"?... \" [3](part 9, sec. 6)BEYOND GOOD AND EVILAge42-1886\"... In all its essential points, this book (1886) is a criticism of modernity,embracing the modern sciences, arts, even politics, together with certainindications as to a type which would be the reverse of modern man, or aslittle like him as possible, a noble and yes-saying type. In this last respect267"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"the book is a school for gentlemen-the term gentleman being understoodhere in a much more spiritual and radical sense than it has implied untilnow... .\" [3](part 10, sec. 2)ON THE GENEALOGY OF MORALSAge43-1887\"... The truth of the first essay is the psychology of Christianity: the birthof Christianity out of the spirit of ressentiment [resentment], not, as issupposed, out of the \"spirit,\" - a counter-movement by its very nature,the great rebellion against the dominion of noble values... .[3](part 11,sec. 1)... The second essay deals with the psychology of conscience: this is not,as is supposed, \"the voice of God in man,\" - it is the instinct of cruelty,turning back after it can no longer discharge itself outwardly. For thefirst time, cruelty is here revealed as one of the oldest and basic ground-work of culture that simply cannot be imagined away... [3](part 11, sec.1)... The third essay answers the question from where the ascetic idealcomes, the ideal of the priests, derives its great power although it is thevery harmful ideal in extreme, a will to the end, an ideal of decadence....\" [3](part 11, sec. 1)TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLSAge44-1888(Published January 24, 1889)\"This work... is altogether an exception among books : there is no workmore rich in substance, more independent, more upsetting-more wicked.If anyone should desire to obtain a rapid sketch of how everything, be-fore my time, was standing on its head, he should begin reading me inthis book.

Since I must soon confront humanity with the greatest demand evermade of it, it seems necessary to say who and what I am. Truly, thisought to be well known already, for I have not \" held my tongue\" aboutmyself. But the difference between the greatness of my task and thesmallness of my contemporaries, is revealed by the fact that people haveneither heard me nor yet seen me. I live on my own self-made credit...... Under these circumstances, it is my duty - against which my usual re-serve and, even more, the pride of my instincts rebel - to say : Listen! forI am such and such a person. Above all, do not mistake me for someoneelse!... [3](preface, sec. 1)... I am, for example, in no way a bogey man, or moral monster. In truth,I am the very opposite of the kind of man that has been honoured untilnow as virtuous. Between ourselves, it seems to me that exactly this ispart of my pride. I am a disciple of the philosopher Dionysus, and Iwould even prefer to be a satyr than a saint.

He must be accustomed to living on mountain tops—and tolooking upon the wretched gabble of politics and nationalism as beneathhim.
