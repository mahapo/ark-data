Instead of the dull realism of mindless atomsand billiard balls that is usually invoked to spoil all the fun inphilosophy, I will defend a weird realism. This model features aworld packed full of ghostly real objects signaling to each other frominscrutable depths, unable to touch one another fully. There is anobvious link here with the tradition known as occasionalism, the firstto suggest that direct interaction between entities is impossible. Thereis another clear link with the related sceptical tradition, which alsoenvisions objects as lying side-by-side without direct connection, thoughhere the objects in question are human perceptions rather thanindependent real things. Yet this article abandons the solution of alone magical super-entity responsible for all relations (whether God forMalebranche and his Iraqi forerunners, or the human mind forsceptics, empiricists, and idealists), in favor of a vicarious causationdeployed locally in every portion of the cosmos. While its strangenessmay lead to puzzlement more than resistance, vicarious causation is notsome autistic moonbeam entering the window ofan asylum. Instead, it is both the launching pad for a rigorous post-Heideggerian philosophy, and a fitting revival of the venerableproblem of communication betweensubstances.Harman-willust 8/2/07 11:26 Page 187"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"up-to-date cousins have anything to say about the collisionof balls-in-themselves. In the past century, the doctrine ofParmenides that being and thought are the same has beenimplied by Husserl, stated explicitly by Heidegger, andrestated quite emphatically by Badiou. But this equation ofbeing and thought must be rejected, since it leaves usstranded in a human–world coupling that merely reenactsthe breakthroughs of yesteryear. Reviving the problem ofcausation means to break free of the epistemologicaldeadlock and reawaken the metaphysical question of whatrelation means. Along with causation there is also the‘vicarious’ part of the phrase, which indicates that relationsnever directly encounter the autonomous reality of theircomponents. After thousands of years, ‘substance’ is stillthe best name for such reality. The widespread resistanceto substance is nothing more than revulsion at certaininadequate models of substance, and such models can bereplaced. Along with substance, the term ‘objects’ will beused to refer to autonomous realities of any kind, with theadded advantage that this term also makes room for thetemporary and artificial objects too often excluded fromthe ranks of substance.Since this article rejects any privilege of human accessto the world, and puts the affairs of human consciousnesson exactly the same footing as the duel between canaries,microbes, earthquakes, atoms, and tar, it may sound like adefense of scientific naturalism that reduces everything tophysical events. But the term ‘vicarious’ is designed tooppose all forms of naturalism, by indicating that we stillhave no idea how physical relations (or any other kind) arepossible in the first place. For as I will contend, objects hide189Harman – Vicarious CausationThe phrase ‘vicarious causation’ consists of two parts,both of them cutting against the grain of present-dayphilosophy.1Causality has rarely been a genuine topic ofinquiry since the seventeenth century. The supposed greatdebate over causation between sceptics and transcendentalphilosophers is at best a yes-or-no dispute as to whethercausal necessity exists, and in practice is just an argumentover whether it can be known. What has been lacking isactive discussion of the very nature of causality. This isnow taken to be obvious: one object exerts force overanother and makes it change physical position or some ofits features. No one sees any way to speak about theinteraction of fire and cotton, since philosophy remainspreoccupied with the sole relational gap between humansand the world – even if only to deny such a gap. Inanimaterelations have been abandoned to laboratory research,where their metaphysical character is openly dismissed. Torevivecausation in philosophy means to reject thedominance of Kant’s Copernican Revolution and its singlelonely rift between people and everything else. Although Iwill claim that real objects do exist beyond human sensualaccess to them, this should not be confused with Kant’sdistinction between phenomena and noumena. WhereasKant’s distinction is something endured by humans alone,I hold that one billiard ball hides from another no less thanthe ball-in-itself hides from humans. When a hailstormsmashes vineyards or sends waves through a pond, theserelations are just as worthy of philosophy as the unceasingdispute over the chasm or non-chasm between being andthought.

For severalcenturies, philosophy has been on the defensive against thenatural sciences, and now occupies a point of lower socialprestige and, surprisingly, narrower subject matter. A briefglance at history shows that this was not always the case.To resume the offensive, we need only reverse the long-standing trends of renouncing all speculation on objectsand volunteering for curfew in an ever-tinier ghetto ofsolely human realities: language, texts, political power.Vicarious causation frees us from such imprisonment byreturning us to the heart of the inanimate world, whethernatural or artificial. The uniqueness of philosophy issecured, not by walling off a zone of precious humanreality that science cannot touch, but by dealing with thesame world as the various sciences but in a differentmanner. In classical terms, we must speculate once more oncausation while forbidding its reduction to efficientcausation. Vicarious causation, of which science so farknows nothing, is closer to what is called formal cause. Tosaythat formal cause operates vicariously means thatforms do not touch one another directly, but somehowmelt, fuse, and decompress in a shared common spacefrom which all are partly absent. My claim is that twoentities influence one another only by meeting on theinterior of a third, where they exist side-by-side untilsomething happens that allows them to interact. In thissense, the theory of vicarious causation is a theory of themolten inner core of objects – a sort of plate tectonics ofontology. 190COLLAPSE IIHarman-willust 8/2/07 11:26 Page 190"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The tribesman who dwells with the godlike leopard, or theprisoner who writes secret messages in lemon juice, are nocloser to the dark reality of these objects than the scientistwho gazes at them. If perception and theory both objectifyentities, reducing them to one-sided caricatures of theirthundering depths, the same is true of practical manipula-tion. We distort when we see, and distort when we use.Nor is the sin of caricature a merely human vice. Dogs donot make contact with the full reality of bones, and neitherdo locusts with cornstalks, viruses with cells, rocks withwindows, nor planets with moons. It is not human con-sciousness that distorts the reality of things, but relational-ity per se. Heidegger’s tool-analysis unwittingly gives us thedeepest possible account of the classical rift betweensubstance and relation. When something is ‘present-at-hand,’ this simply means it is registered through some sortof relation: whether perceptual, theoretical, practical, orpurely causal. To be ‘ready-to-hand’ does not mean to beuseful in the narrow sense, but to withdraw into subter-ranean depths that other objects rely on despite never fullyprobing or sounding them.2When objects fail us, weexperience a negation of their accessible contours andbecome aware that the object exceeds all that we grasp ofit. This predicament gives rise to the theme of vicariouscausation. For if objects withdraw from relations, we maywonder how they make contact at all. Heidegger’s tool-analysis opens the gates on a strange new realism in whichentities flicker vaguely from the ocean floor: unable tomake contact, yet somehow managing to do so anyway.193Harman – Vicarious Causation1. TWOKINDS OFOBJECTSWhile the phenomenological movement of Husserl andHeidegger did too little to overcome the idealism of theprevious cluster of great philosophers, they and their descendants often show a novel concern with specific, concrete entities. Mailboxes, hammers, cigarettes, and silkgarments are at home in phenomenology in a way that wasnever true for the earlier classic figures of German thought.Even if Husserl and Heidegger remain too attached tohuman being as the centerpiece of philosophy, both silentlyraise objects to the starring role, each in a different manner.While Husserl bases his system on intentional or idealobjects (which I will rechristen sensual objects), Heideggerrestores real objects to philosophy through his famous tool-analysis. It is seldom realized that these two types ofobjects are both different and complementary. Theinterplay between real and sensual objects, if takenseriously, provides ontology with a radical new theme.In the tool-analysis of Heidegger, which fascinates hisopponents no less than his allies, we find perhaps the mostenduring insight of twentieth century philosophy. Ourprimary relationship with objects lies not in perceiving ortheorizing about them, but simply in relying on them forsome ulterior purpose. This first step is useful enough, butmisses the essence of Heidegger’s breakthrough, whicheven he never quite grasps. If we remain at this stage, itmight seem that Heidegger merely claims that all theory isgrounded in practice, that we need to have an everydayrelationship with leopards or acids before staring at themor developing a science of them. But notice that even ourpractical relation to these objects fails to grasp them fully.192COLLAPSE II2.

Each sensual profile is encrusted onto theunified zebra-object like a patina of brine. Whereas realobjects withdraw, sensual objects lie directly before us,frosted over with a swirling, superfluous outer shell. Butthis difference seems to give sensual objects the oppositecausal status of real ones. Given that real objects nevertouch directly, their causal relations can only be vicarious.But sensual objects, far from being withdrawn, exist sideby side in the same perceptual space from the outset, sincewe encounter numerous phenomena simultaneously. Thispresents the contrary problem to vicarious causation:namely, why do all the phenomena not instantly fusetogether into a single lump? There must be someunknown principle of blockage between them. If realobjects require vicarious causation, sensual objects endureabuffered causation in which their interactions are partly dammed or stunted.The situation is perplexing, but the general path of thisarticle is already clear. Real objects withdraw into obscurecavernous underworlds, deprived of causal links. Sensualobjects, by contrast, are so inclined to interact with theirneighbors that we wonder why they fail to do so at everyinstant. In other words, the only place in the cosmoswhere interactions occur is the sensual, phenomenal realm.Against philosophies that regard the surface as formal orsterile and grant causal power only to shadowy depths, wemust defend the opposite view: discrete, autonomous formlies only in the depths, while dramatic power andinteraction float along the surface. All relationships are195Harman – Vicarious CausationAdifferent sort of object is the basis for Husserl’s philosophy. Despite complicated efforts to save Husserlfrom charges of idealism, he does confine philosophy to aspace of purest ideality. Phenomenology cannot speak ofhow one object breaks or burns another, since this woulddeliver the world to the power of scientific explanation,which employs nothing but naturalistic theories. ForHusserl, the only rigorous method is to describe how theworld is given to consciousness prior to all such theories.Philosophy becomes the study of phenomena, not realobjects. But phenomena are objects nonetheless: in a new,ideal sense. For what we experience in perception is notdisembodied qualities, as the empiricists hold; instead, weencounter a world broken up into chunks. Trees,mailboxes, airplanes, and skeletons lie spread before us,each of them inducing specific moods and sparkling withvarious subordinate qualities. Since we are speaking solelyof the phenomenal realm, it does not matter if these thingsare hallucinations; even delusions perform the genuinelabor of organizing our perception into discrete zones.Note already that sensual objects have a different fate fromreal ones. Whereas real zebras and lighthouses withdrawfrom direct access, their sensual counterparts do notwithdraw in the least. For here is a zebra before me.Admittedly, I can view it from an infinite variety of anglesand distances, in sadness and exultation, at sunset oramidst driving rain, and none of these moments exhaust allpossible perceptions of it. Nonetheless, the zebra is alreadythere for me as a whole in all its partial profiles; I see rightthrough them and look to it as a unified object. Althoughsome specific visual or conceptual profile of the zebra is194COLLAPSE IIHarman-willust 8/2/07 11:26 Page 194"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"superficial. For this reason, we must discover how realobjects poke through into the phenomenal realm, the onlyplace where one relates to another. The various eruptionsof real objects into sensuality lie side by side, buffered fromimmediate interaction. Something must happen on thesensual plane to allow them to make contact, just ascorrosive chemicals lie side by side in a bomb – separatedby a thin film eaten away over time, or ruptured by distantsignals.2. A JIGSAWPUZZLEIt is well known that Husserl emphasizes the intentionality of consciousness. We are always consciousof something, always focused on a particular house, pinetree, beach ball, or star, and indeed on many such objectsat once. It is not widely known that Husserl also stumblesacross the fateful paradox that intentionality is both oneand two. For in a first sense, my encounter with a pine treeis a unified relation; we can speak of the encounter as awhole, and this whole resists exhaustive description. Butin another sense, I clearly do not fuse with the tree in asingle massive lump; it remains distinct from me in theperception. This gives the strange result that in myintention of the tree, we both inhabit the interior of thetotal intentional relation. This seemingly dry observationby Husserl has not sparked much interest in his readers.Even so, if combined with Heidegger’s insight into thewithdrawal of real objects behind all relations, it providesall the pieces of a new philosophy.To repeat, the pine tree and I are separate objectsresiding on the interior of a third: the intention as a whole.197Harman – Vicarious CausationHarman-willust 8/2/07 11:26 Page 196"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"accidental features shimmering along its surface frommoment to moment, not affecting our identification of itas one and the same. Finally, the pine tree stands inrelation to countless peripheral objects that inhabit thesame intention (neighboring trees, mountains, deer,rabbits, clouds of mist).We should also note five distinct sorts of relationsbetween all these objects:1. CONTAINMENT.The intention as a whole containsboth the real me and the sensual tree.2. CONTIGUITY. The various sensual objects in an intention lie side by side, not affecting one another. Onlysometimes do they fuse or mix. Within certain limits,any sensual object’s neighbors can be shuffled and variedwithout damaging the identity of that object, as whendrifting mists do not interfere with my focus on the tree.3. SINCERITY.At this very moment I am absorbed or fascinated by the sensual tree, even if my attitude towardit is utterly cynical and manipulative. I do not contain thesensual tree, because this is the role of the unifiedintention that provides the theater of my sincerity withoutbeing identical to it. And I am not merely contiguouswith the tree, because it does in fact touch me in such away as to fill up my life. I expend my energy in takingthe tree seriously, whereas the sensual tree cannot returnthe favor, since it is nothing real.4. CONNECTION.The intention as a whole must arisefrom a real connection of real objects, albeit an indirectconnection. After all, the other possible combinationsyield entirely different results. Two sensual objects merely199Harman – Vicarious CausationBut there is a fascinating asymmetry between the membersof this trio. We cannot fail to notice that of the two objectsliving in the core of the third, I am a real object but the pinetree merely a sensual one. The I sincerely absorbed in thethings it perceives is not the I as seen by others, but ratherthe real I, since my life actually consists at this moment inbeing occupied by these phenomena, not in being a sensualobject for the gaze of others or even for myself. Bycontrast, the real pine tree does not inhabit the intention,since the real tree (assuming there is such a thing) liesoutside any relation to it, withdrawing into depths neverentered by outsiders. Finally, the intention as a whole mustbe classed as a real object rather than a sensual one: foreven if my intention of the tree is the most depraved hallu-cination, the intention itself is in fact underway, quite apartfrom whether it relates to anything outside. To summarize,we have a real intention whose core is inhabited by a realme and a sensual pine tree. In addition, there is also awithdrawn real tree (or something that we mistake for one)lying outside the intention, but able to affect it alongavenues still unknown. Finally, the sensual tree neverappears in the form of a naked essence, but is alwaysencrusted with various sorts of noise. Elsewhere I havecalled it ‘black noise’, to emphasize that it is highlystructured, not the sort of formless chaos suggested by the‘white noise’ of television and radio.3Black noise initiallyseems to come in three varieties. First, the sensual tree haspivotal or essential qualities that must always belong to itunder penalty of the intentional agent no longerconsidering it the same thing. Second, the tree has198COLLAPSE II3.

There is a constant meeting of asymmetri-cal partners on the interior of some unified object: a realone meeting the sensual vicar or deputy of another.Causation itself occurs when these obstacles are somehowbroken or suspended. In seventeenth-century terms, theside-by-side proximity of real and sensual objects is merelythe occasion for a connection between a real object insidethe intention and another real object lying outside it. In thisway, shafts or freight tunnels are constructed betweenobjects that otherwise remain quarantined in privatevacuums.We now have five kinds of objects (real intention, realI, real tree, sensual tree, sensual noise) and five differenttypes of relations (containment, contiguity, sincerity,connection, and none). Furthermore, we also have threeadjectives for what unfolds inside an object (vicarious,asymmetrical, buffered) and three different kinds of noisesurrounding a sensual object (qualities, accidents,relations). While this may not be an exhaustive census ofreality, and may eventually need polishing or expansion, itoffers a good initial model whose very strictness will helpsmoke out those elements it might have overlooked. Whatremains to be seen is how these elements interact, how onetype of relation transforms into another, how new realobjects paradoxically arise from the interaction betweenreal objects and sensual ones, and even how sensual objectsmanage to couple and uncouple like spectral rail cars.201Harman – Vicarious Causationsit side by side. And my sincere absorption with trees orwindmills is merely the interior of the intention, not theunified intention itself. Hence, a real object itself is bornfrom the connection of other real objects, throughunknown vicarious means. 5. NO RELATION AT ALL.This is the usual state of things,as denied only by fanatical holists, those extremists whopass out mirrors like candy to every object that stumblesdown the street. Real objects are incapable of directcontact, and indeed many have no effect on one anotherat all. Even the law of universal gravitation only appliesamong a narrow class of physical objects, and even thenconcerns a limited portion of their reality. And in adifferent case, the sensual tree has no relation to me at all,even though I am sincerely absorbed by it. The oxygenI breathe comes from the real tree, not from myperception of it. The sensual tree is a phantasm survivingonly at the core of some intention, and takes up no independent relations even with its contiguous phantoms.They are only related vicariously, through me, insofar asI am sincerely absorbed with both. The objects populating the world always stand to eachother in one of these five relations. In Guerrilla Metaphysics,I suggested that causation is always vicarious, asymmetri-cal, and buffered. ‘Vicarious’ means that objects confrontone another only by proxy, through sensual profilesfound only on the interior of some other entity.‘Asymmetrical’ means that the initial confrontationalways unfolds between a real object and a sensual one.And ‘buffered’ means that I do not fuse into the tree, northe tree into its sensual neighbors, since all are held at bay200COLLAPSE IIHarman-willust 8/2/07 11:26 Page 200"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"These sorts of problems are the subject matter of object-oriented philosophy: the inevitable mutant offspring ofHusserl’s intentional objects and Heidegger’s real ones.

ONTOLOGY ANDMETAPHYSICSBeginners in philosophy often ask the exact differencebetween ontology and metaphysics. In fact there is no consistent distinction, since each philosopher redefinesthese terms to suit individual purposes. For Heidegger,202COLLAPSE IIHarman-willust 8/2/07 11:26 Page 202"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"the subject of a metaphysics. There could be a metaphysicsof artworks, the psyche, and language, and even ofrestaurants, mammals, planets, teahouses, and sportsleagues. Insofar as philosophy clearly differs from activitiessuch as singing and gambling, there could also be ametaphysics of philosophy itself, unlocking the crucialfeatures of this discipline, whatever its numerous variationsand degenerate sophistical forms.The distinction between ontology and metaphysics is proposed here for a specific reason. Along with real objects,we have also described sensual objects, which exist only onthe interior of some intentional whole. Yet intentionality isregarded by almost everyone as a narrowly human feature.If this depiction were correct, sensual objects would beconfined to a metaphysics of human perception, with noplace in an ontology designed to address plastic and sanddunes no less than humans. This confinement of sensualityto the human kingdom must be refused. Intentionality isnot a special human property at all, but an ontologicalfeature of objects in general. For our purposes, intentional-ity means sincerity. My life is absorbed at any momentwith a limited range of thoughts and perceptions. While itis tempting to confuse such absorption with ‘consciousawareness,’ we need to focus on the most rudimentarymeaning of sincerity: contact between a real object and asensual one. For instance, I may be sincerely absorbed incontemplating glass marbles arranged on the surface of atable. This is my sincerity at the moment, since I foregoother possibilities of greater and lesser import to witnessthis austere, Zen-like spectacle. But note that the glassmarbles themselves are sincerely absorbed in sitting on the205Harman – Vicarious Causationontology is the account of how being is revealed tohumans, while metaphysics remains a term of insult forphilosophies that explain all beings in terms of someprivileged entity. For Levinas, ontology belongs to theglobal war between beings, while metaphysics speaks ofthe infinite otherness that lies beyond such conflict. For myown part, I have generally used these terms interchange-ably for a realist position opposed to all human-centeredphilosophies; at times such flexibility remains useful, as inthe opening section of this article. Yet I would also like topropose a more exact difference between them, one notunrelated to their classical distinction. Henceforth, let‘ontology’ refer to a description of the basic structuralfeatures shared by all objects, and let ‘metaphysics’ signifythe discussion of the fundamental traits of specific types ofentities. In this sense, the aforementioned puzzle-piecesbelong solely to ontology, since no object is exempt fromtheir rule. These include the basic opposition between realand sensual objects, the five types of relation betweenthem, and the bondage of sensual objects to their variousqualities, accidents, and relations. Time and space alsobelong to ontology, since even eternal and non-spatialobjects elude only the narrowly physical spatio-temporalrealm, and by no means escape time and space in a broadersense. The question of universals also seems to be a globaltheme belonging to ontology as a whole, and there may beothers. As for metaphysics, which walls off and analyzesthe internal organs of any specific kind of entity, the most obvious possible topics include human being, language, artworks, and even God. Any type of object distinct fromothers, however hazy the boundaries may be, can become204COLLAPSE IIHarman-willust 8/2/07 11:26 Page 204"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"tabletop quite apart from its accidental coldness andslickness, though it probably registers these features insome way as well. If we heat the tabletop, or render itssurface sticky or granulated by pouring different materialsnearby, the table as an intentional object still remains thesame. The final question is whether the marbles can makea distinction between the table and its more essentialqualities, such as its hardness, levelness, solidity, and lackof perforation. Even humans can only make thisdistinction between objects and their qualities in veryspecial cases; since I will soon describe these cases underthe heading of ‘allure’, we should wait to ask whether glassmarbles are able to follow suit. What is already evident isthat all real objects inhabit a landscape of sensual ones, aplayground whose fluctuations enable new realconnections to arise. Some of these fluctuations are a meredomestic drama, while others provoke new relations withthe outside. But whatever is special about human cognitionbelongs at a more complicated level of philosophy thanthese sensual objects, though it must be expressible interms of them.Elsewhere I have used the phrase ‘every relation is itselfan object’, and still regard this statement as true. But sincethis article has redefined relations to include containment,sincerity, and contiguity, the slogan must be reworded asfollows: ‘every connection is itself an object.’ Theintentional act’s containment of me does not make the twoof us into a new object, and neither (for the most part) dotwo or three nearby perceptions of cars make a unifiedobject. But two vicariously linked real objects do form anew object, since they generate a new internal space.207Harman – Vicarious Causationtable, rather than melting in a furnace or hurtling througha mineshaft. (Though they may not be ‘marbles’ foranyone but humans or playful kittens, we need a nicknamefor the united object that we draw into our games.) Thequestion for us is not the panpsychist query of whetherthese marbles have some sort of rudimentary thinking andfeeling capacities, but whether they as real objectsencounter the table-surface as a sensual one.The answer is yes. We must ignore the usual connotations of sensuality and fix our gaze on a moreprimitive layer of the cosmos. It is clear that the marblesmust stand somewhere in reality, in contact with certainother entities that stabilize them briefly in one state oranother. The entities they confront cannot be real objects,since these withdraw from contact. Nor can the marblesrun up against free-floating sensual qualities, for in thesensual realm qualities are always attached to objects. Onlyone alternative remains: the marbles are sincerely absorbedwith sensual objects. This indirect argument becomes morepersuasive if we examine the landscape inhabited by themarbles, which turns out to share the basic structuralfeatures of human intentionality. First, notice that thesemarbles are perfectly capable of distinguishing between thetable and the contiguous relational environment, even ifnot in the panpsychist sense of a primitive judging ability.At present the marbles sit on the table, but are otherwisesurrounded by air; hence, this air is contiguous with thetabletop in the life of each marble. But if we now carefullyframe the marbles with bookends or melted wax, the tableitself remains the same intentional object, unaffected by oureccentric manipulations.

The history of thisconnection remains inscribed in its heart, where itscomponents are locked in a sort of kaleidoscopic duel.

ALLURE ANDCAUSATIONSome may find it disturbing to think of the world asmade up of vacuum-sealed objects, each with a sparkling phenomenal interior invaded only now and then by neighboring objects. A more likely problem, however, isindifference. There seems to be no need for such a weirdvision of reality, since it is easy enough to think of theworld as made of brute pieces of inescapable solid matter:‘primary qualities’ supporting a series of more dashing,volatile human projections. In my view, however,Heidegger has rendered this picture of the world obsolete.Though his tool-analysis aims to describeonly thewithdrawal of objects behind explicit human awareness,practical activity is equally unable to exhaust the depth ofobjects, and even causal relations fail to let them encounterone another in full.4Finally, even sheer physical presencein space is a concept shaken to the core by the tool-analysis: after all, to occupy a spatial position is to take uprelations, and however objects might occupy space, theirreality is something deeper. The world is neither a greymatrix of objective elements, nor rawmaterial for a sexyhuman drama projected onto gravel and sludge. Instead, it211Harman – Vicarious Causationan infinite regress: all of these objects are not contained infinitely in the situation from the outset, but are sequen-tially produced ad nauseumby an increasingly twisted andpedantic series of analysts. Back in stage one, even myrelation to the sensual pine tree is not a real object, butsimply a sincere relation of two distinct elements inside alarger one. Unified objects can be molded at will from thatclay-like interior. This already shows a way for sincererelations to be converted into real connections. Whether itis the only such way, and whether this method belongs tohumans alone, is still unclear.Another point is in order before passing to the final section. To say that every object is located on the sensualmolten core of another object undermines some of the keyassumptions of Heidegger. For him, human being partiallytranscends other beings, rising to glimpse them against abackground of nothingness. But the interior of an objectleaves no room for transcendence or even distance: a horseseen in a valley several miles away still touches me directlyinsofar as I witness it. Distance lies not in the sphere ofperception, where everything brushes me directly withgreater or lesser intensity, but only between the mutuallyexclusive real objects that lie beyond perception. We do notstep beyond anything, but are more like moles tunnelingthrough wind, water, and ideas no less than throughspeech-acts, texts, anxiety, wonder, and dirt. We do nottranscend the world, but only descend or burrow towardsits numberless underground cavities – each a sort of kalei-doscope where sensual objects spread their colours andtheir wings. There is neither finitude nor negativity in theheart of objects. And each case of human mortality is just210COLLAPSE II4.

Here too we have a merely binaryquestion: either the sensual pine tree and I are togetherinside a given intention, or we are not. Finally, ‘contiguity’does not give us what we need: at best, the shifting play ofsensual objects redistributes the boundaries between them,but cannot lead to real changes outside their molteninternal homeland. The only remaining option is‘sincerity.’ This must be the site of change in the world. Areal object resides in the core of an intention, pressed upagainst numerous sensual ones. Somehow, it pierces theircolored mists and connects with a real object already in thevicinity but buffered from direct contact. If light can beshed on this mechanism, the nature of the other four typesof relation may be clarified as well.It all comes down to the dynamics of sincerity, whetherof a human or any other real object. Sincerity contendswith sensual objects that are defined by their qualities andshrouded with peripheral accidents and relations. What weseek is the manner in which sincere relation with a sensualobject is transformed into direct connection with a realone. The coupling and uncoupling of real and sensualobjects is now our central theme. We know that a sensualobject is detachable from its accidents and relations. Theinteresting question is whether it can also be detached fromits qualities, which seem to belong to it more intimately. Byqualities I mean the essential qualities, without which wewould regard an object as no longer the same thing.Remember, there is no hand-wringing crisis of objectivityhere, since we are speaking of qualities that belong not tothe essence of a real object, but only to the sensual thingsthat command our attention – a realm where we ourselves213Harman – Vicarious Causationis filled with points of reality woven together only loosely:anarchipelago of oracles or bombs that explode fromconcealment only to generate new sequestered temples.The language here is metaphorical because it must be.While analytic philosophy takes pride in never suggestingmore than it explicitly states, this procedure does no justiceto a world where objects are always more than they literallystate. Those who care only to generate arguments almostnever generate objects. New objects, however, are the soleand sacred fruit of writers, thinkers, politicians, travellers,lovers, and inventors.Along with the distinction between real and sensualobjects, there were five possible kinds of relations betweenthem: containment, contiguity, sincerity, connection, andnone. Our goal is to shed some light on the origin ofconnection, the one relation of the five that seems mosttroubling for a theory of ghostly, receding objects. Aconnection simply exists or fails to exist; it is a purelybinary question. Furthermore, connection must bevicarious, since one purely naked object always recedesfrom another. An object simply exists, and this existencecan never fully bemirrored in the heart of another. Whatwe seek is some fertile soil of relation from whichconnections surge up into existence: a type of relation abletoserveas the engine of change in the cosmos.‘Connection’ itself cannot provide the solution, since this isprecisely what we are trying to explain; if two objects areconnected, then the labour we wish to observe is alreadycomplete. The option ‘no relation at all’ also fails to help,since if things are unrelated then they will remain so, aslong as the intermediary we seek is lacking. ‘Containment’212COLLAPSE IIHarman-willust 8/2/07 11:26 Page 212"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"has a unified and basically ineffable effect on us, one thatcannot be reduced to any list of traits. But if such listingof traits does not sever a thing from its quality, there maybe another way for this to happen. We have also seen thatvicarious causation – the enchanted unicorn we seek –requires contact with the essential qualities of a thingwithout contact with the thing as a whole. In this way,discovery of how the sensual object splits from its qualitymay be a stepping-stone toward discovering an analogousevent among real objects.The separation between a sensual object and itsquality can be termed ‘allure.’5This term pinpoints thebewitching emotional effect that often accompanies thisevent for humans, and also suggests the related term‘allusion,’ since allure merely alludes to the object withoutmaking its inner life directly present. In the sensual realm,we encounter objects encrusted with noisy accidents andrelations. We may also be explicitly aware of some oftheir essential qualities, though any such list merelytransforms the qualities into something accident-like, andfails to give us the unified bond that makes the sensualthing a single thing. Instead, we need an experience inwhich the sensual object is severed from its joint unifiedquality, since this will point for the first time to a realobject lying beneath the single quality on the surface. Forhumans, metaphor is one such experience. When thepoet writes ‘my heart is a furnace,’ the sensual objectknown as a heart captures vaguely defined furnace-qualities and draws them haltingly into its orbit. Theinability of the heart to fuse easily with furnace-traits (in215Harman – Vicarious Causationare the highest judge in the land. Now, it might beimagined that we could liberate the qualities of the marblesby overtly discovering and listing all the crucial featuresthat the marbles cannot do without. This was the greathope of Husserl’s method of eidetic variation. But the effectof this procedure is superficial, and does not grasp thesensual marbles in their essence. Notice that even as ouranalysis of these objects proceeds, we continue to takethem seriously as units, even if we brilliantly slice theminto thousands of separate features. Even in the case of asensual object, the essential qualities cannot be stated oranalyzed without becoming something like accidents: free-floating traits artificially detached from the sensual objectas a whole. Our sincerity is not really concerned with sucha list of detached features, as Husserl realizes when hegrants privilege to unified sensual objects over their myriadfacets. The unity of such objects even indicates that thereis just one quality at issue: this marble-essence, this pine-essence. The unified quality of the thing is not noise at all,but is the sensual object itself. Concerning Aristotle’squestion as to whether a thing is identical with its essence,the answer for sensual objects is yes. Although qualitieswere described as a form of noise earlier in this article, thisis true only insofar as they veer off toward the status ofaccidents, when broken free and itemized separately. Butthe existence of a unified quality of things means that thesensual realm is already home to a certain ‘I know notwhat’ that makes the marble a steady focus of myattention. Unlike the followers of Locke, we do not sayjene sais quoiin a spirit of gentle mockery, but as a truestatement about sensual objects. The sensual thing itself214COLLAPSE II5.

Thispertains to what has been termed the relations of sensualobjects. But accidents are a different case. The surface of asensual object does not merely lie side-by-side with it. Eventhough we look straight through these accidents to stayfixed on the underlying sensual thing, the accidents are notviewed as separate from that thing, but are encrusted ontoit. This frosting-over with peripheral qualities comes aboutin an interesting way. Recall that the sensual tree as awhole is made up of just one quality (the one from whichit is severed in allure). But notice that this unified tree-apparition still has parts. If we start taking away branchesand leaves, there will come a point at which we no longerregard it as the same tree; the tree is dependent on its parts.Yet these parts are only unified in the tree along onespecific path. It never devours them completely, butemploys only a limited portion of their reality. What weknowas the accidents of the sensual tree are simply theremainder of its parts, the remnant not deployed in thenew object. Each of these parts is complicated because it ismade up of further parts, and so on to infinity. Buthowever far we advance toward this infinity, we continueto find objects, not raw sense data. It would be wrong tothink that we confront a field of colour-pixels and thenmold them into objective zones. For in the first place, it isarbitrary to think that points of green are more qualitatively basic than a unified tree-quality or branch-quality; all are capable of filling up my sincerity, and all217Harman – Vicarious Causationcontrast with literal statements such as ‘my heart is thestrongest muscle in my body’) achieves allusion to aghostly heart-object lying beneath the overly familiarsensual heart of everyday acquaintance. Notice that theinverse metaphor is entirely asymmetrical to the first: ‘thefurnace is a heart’ draws cardiac traits into the orbit of asensual furnace, which is freed from bondage to its usualfeatures and evoked as a sort of hidden furnace-soul, onewhose animusnow powers rhythmic beating andcirculation. Humour does something similar: we can followBergson’s On Laughterand note the tension between acomic dupe and the traits he no longer freely adapts tochanging circumstances. These qualities are now exposedas a discrete visible shell beneath which the agent haplesslyfails to control them. There are countless examples ofallure. In instances of beauty, an object is not the sum totalof beautiful colors and proportions on its surface, but akind of soul animating the features from within, leading tovertigo or even hypnosis in the witness. When Heidegger’shammer fails, a concealed hammer-object seems to loomfrom the darkness, at a distance from its previously familiartraits. In language, names call out to objects deeper thanany of their features; in love, the beloved entity has acertain magic hovering beneath the contours and flaws ofits accessible surface. The list of possibilities is so vast thatthey deserve to be categorized in some encyclopedic workofaesthetics. Until now, aesthetics has generally served asthe impoverished dancing-girl of philosophy – admired forher charms, but no gentleman would marry her. Yet giventhe apparently overwhelming scope of allure, aestheticsmay deserve a rather vast role in ontology.216COLLAPSE IIHarman-willust 8/2/07 11:26 Page 216"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"connection. Hume and Malebranche face oppositeversions of the same problem. Although Hume supposedlydoubts the possibility of connection, note that for him aconnection has actually already occurred: he is neversurprised that two billiard balls lie simultaneously in hismind, but doubts only that they have independent forcecapable of inflicting blows on each other. In this sense,Hume actually begins with connection inside experienceand merely doubts any separation outside it. Conversely,Malebranche begins by assuming the existence of separatesubstances, but doubts that they can occupy a shared spacein such a way as to exchange their forces – leading him toposit God’s power as the ultimate joint space of all entities.Like Hume, we can regard the intentional agent as thevicarious cause of otherwise separate phenomena. The treeand its mountainous backdrop are indeed distinct, yet theyare unified insofar as I am sincerely absorbed with both.But more than this: when the parts of the tree fuse to yieldthe tree with its single fixed tree-quality, I too am thevicarious cause for the connection of these sensual objects.Even if I merely sit passively, without unduly straining eyesor mind, it is still for me that these parts have combined.Here, a real object (I myself) serves as the vicarious causefor two or more sensual ones. In the inverted case ofMalebranche, we cannot accept the pistol shot of the deityas our vicarious cause, since no explanation is given ofhow God as a real object could touch other real objects;fear of blasphemy is the sole protection for this incompletedoctrine. Instead, just as two sensual objects are vicariouslylinked by a real one, two real objects must be vicariouslylinked by a sensual one. I make contact with another219Harman – Vicarious Causationhave a specific personal style. And in the second place,even a supposed pixel of green at least takes the spatialform of a dot, and hence is a complicated object in its ownright. There are always largest objects in the sensual realm:namely, those that are recognized by sincerity at anymoment. But one cannot find a smallest, since there willalways be a leftover remainder of parts, and parts of parts,like the endless overtones of notes struck on a piano. Theseaccidents are the only possible source of change, since theyalone are the potential bridge between one sensual objectand another. For there can be no changes in the sensualobject itself, which is always a recognized fait accompli; atmost, it can be eliminated and replaced by a new one.Accidents alone have the dual status of belonging and notbelonging to an object, like streamers on a maypole, orjewels on a houka. Accidents are tempting hooksprotruding from the sensual object, allowing it the chanceto connect with others and thereby fuse two into one.But the relation of part and whole does not occur onlyin the sensual realm. A real object, too, is formed of partswhose disappearance threatens its very existence.The difference is that the parts of a sensual object areencrusted onto its surface: or rather, certain aspects ofthose parts are fused to create it, while the remainder ofthose parts emanates from its surface as noise. By contrast,the parts of a real object are contained on the interior ofthat object, not plastered onto its outer crust. In both cases,however, there is a vicarious cause enabling the parts tolink together. This can be clarified through the historicaldifference between scepticism and occasionalism, which arecomplementary in the same manner as encrustation and218COLLAPSE IIHarman-willust 8/2/07 11:26 Page 218"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"alluring tree is the vicarious link between me and the realtree. The exact dynamics of this process deserve alengthier treatment, but something unusual has alreadybecome evident. The separation of a thing from its qualityis no longer a local phenomenon of human experience, butinstead is the root of all relations between real objects,including causal relations. In other words, allure belongs toontology as a whole, not to the special metaphysics ofanimal perception. Relations between all real objects,including mindless chunks of dirt, occur only by means ofsome form of allusion. But insofar as we have identifiedallure with an aesthetic effect, this means that aestheticsbecomes first philosophy.221Harman – Vicarious Causationobject, not through impossible contact with its interior life,but only by brushing its surface in such a manner as tobring its inner life into play. Just as only the opposite polesof magnets make contact, and just as the opposite sexesalone are fertile, it is also the case that two objects of thesame type do not directly touch one another. Contiguitybetween sensual objects is impossible without a realintentional agent, and connection between real ones doesnot occur except by means of a sensual intermediary.This entails that all contact must be asymmetrical.However deeply I burrow into the world, I neverencounter anything but sensual objects, and neither do realobjects ever encounter anything but my own sensualfacade. The key to vicarious causation is that two objectsmust somehow touch without touching. In the case of thesensual realm, this happens when I the intentional agentserve as vicarious cause for the fusion of multiple sensualobjects: a fusion that remains only partial, encrusted withresidual accidents. But in the case of real objects, the onlyway to touch a real one without touching it is throughallure. Only here do we escape the deadlock of merelyrolling about in the perfumes of sensual things, andencounter qualities belonging to a distant signalling thingrather than a carnally present one. The only waytobringreal objects into the sensual sphereis to reconfigure sensual objects in such a way that they nolonger merely fuse into a new one, as parts into a whole,but rather become animated by allusion to a deeper powerlying beyond: a real object. The gravitational field of a realobject must somehow invade the existing sensual field.
