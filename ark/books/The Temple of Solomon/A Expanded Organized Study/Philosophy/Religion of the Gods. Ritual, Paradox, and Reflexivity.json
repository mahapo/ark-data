Making offer-ings to the divine was a potent, ubiquitous fact of ancient Greek reli-gious life: “The central ritual of Greek religion, from the pouring oflibations onwards, is the offering to the god.”2This particular altar isthe organizing axis of the register of a great three-handled kalpis-hydria, a water-carrying vessel. The vase is ascribed to the BerlinPainter, one of the great masters of ancient Greek vase-painting. Itdates from about 485 B.C.E., that is, from the very late archaicperiod—in fact between the two times of Hellas’s greatest menacefrom Persia.What stopped me was that the altar was not the focus of a sacri-fice performed by human beings. Instead, six Olympian gods andgoddesses converged on it from either side. The deities appeared tobe themselves worshipers at a sacrifice, forming their own pro-cession.3What did this majestic vase mean?A painted plaque from the archaic Saphtouli cave-site near Pitságives us the elements of canonical Greek animal sacrifice (no. C–27;Fig. 4). The animal victim, in this case a ram, is led to the altar in pro-cession, accompanied by the music of flutes. The atmosphere is oneof order, peace, and holiness. The worshipers bear the ritualimplements of wine jug, basket (kanoun), barley (oulai), and woolen"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"fillets, called stemmata.The wine jug, or oinochoe, was used to fill the libationbowl, or phiale, whose contents were poured out as an offering, either directlyonto the altar to the Olympian powers, or into the ground to the chthonianpowers or to the dead—that is, to the underworld.Despite the contemporary belief that “the normal sacrificial cult is a cultwithout revelation or epiphany,”4primary evidence suggests that the Greeksbelieved that the gods both attended and responded to sacrifice. In Book 12 ofthe Odyssey,the island Phaiakians are described as being so blessed that whenthey sacrificed they could actually see the gods’ huge, luminous forms superin-tending. The presence of the deity is often implied in art by a cult statue, as wesee in an archaic belly-amphora in Berlin, in which Athena Promachos re-ceives a sacrificial procession at a stone altar (no. C–30; Fig. 5) or in a trefoiloinochoe from the same museum showing a Dionysiac herm presiding overa flaming altar as two worshipers approach with basket and flute (no. C–31).But sometimes it is no stiff image that the vases show us at the altar, but thegod’s epiphany in his or her sacred animal or bird—as in a black-figure hydria4introductionfigure 2.Gods participate in a libation at an altar.

The divine bird is the focus for the worshiper, hand raised in acanonical gesture of awe or reverence at the appearance of a deity, and also forthe sacrificial beasts symmetrically ranged around the altar that is the bird’splatform. Finally, there are vases like the Louvre red-figure bell-krater from theclassical period (no. C–35) in which the “living god” himself, in this case theephebic Apollo with laurel staff and crown, serenely observes a sacrifice to him-self in full swing with grilling meat, cake offerings, and poured libations uponan altar behind which grows the tree that is special to him, the laurel.Except for those anomalous vases like the Berlin Painter hydria in Boston,the mechanism of Greek sacrifice seems transparent. Socrates is crystal clear onthe subject in the Euthyphro,helpfully articulating those formulas with which wehave grown so comfortable in describing the bargain-driven ancient religiousmentality. “Doesn’t sacrifice mean to give gifts to the gods; and prayer means toask (things) from the gods?”5A few minutes later, Socrates quizzes Euthyphro asto whether piety is not then actually the skill of trading with the gods (DmporikbtAxnh).6But what to think when an archaic Athena Polias, a seated urban god-dess, is depicted with a phiale in her hand (no. 7)?7Or stranger still, when the Del-phic Apollo beatifically smiles as he tips that phiale pouring out into the ground adrink offering of wine, energetically painted with added red (no. 59; Fig. 6)?6introductionfigure 5.Athena Promachos with shield and spear receives animal sacri-fice at a stone altar.

Perhaps the younger Olympic gods are making offerings to Zeus.

(no. 44; Fig. 7). Zeus shouldbe the recipient of worship, not the worshiper. Yet his ritual gesture, pouringfrom a god-sized phiale, clearly implies sacerdotal action, unavoidably convey-ing multivalency. What are we to make of a sacrificing Zeus, whose fixed de-cree, in the ancient Greek religious imagination, orders heaven and earth, andwho by the fifth century B.C.E. had acquired in Hellenic philosophy the role ofFirst Cause and virtual apex of justice? Who could possibly be the recipient ofthe libation of Zeus? The high gods who pour out wine have turned us into aclassical game show: “What is wrong with this picture?” The answer I proposewill be a radical one: nothing.“They Cannot Possibly Be Sacrificing”: Methodological QuestionsIn “a new breathing-field,” when a paradox emerges in the history of religion,theoretical premises are challenged and established theologies dissolve andintroduction7figure 6.Apollo, seated, with tortoise-shell lyre, extends phiale to pour a libation;raven watches.

The religiousimagination, which Henri Corbin, following Ibn ÛArabı ̄, calls imaginal knowl-edge,“apprehends its proper object with as much right and validity as thesenses and the intellect do theirs.”10Thus while theory about religious experi-ence based on either the methods of senses or those of the intellect may par-tially illumine, it will always be inadequate.The mutual exclusivity of the “history” and the “phenomenology” of reli-gion is no longer defensible. As Jonathan Z. Smith wrote over two decades agoof the pan-Babylonian school, whose exponents “saw clearly the need toground comparison and patterns in a historical process,” “the two chief optionsfollowed by students of religion since then have...been either to continue itsdiffusionist program shorn of its systematic and theoretical depth...or to cutloose the pattern and systematics from history....We have yet to develop theresponsible alternative: the integration of a complex notion of pattern and sys-tem with an equally complex notion of history.”118introductionfigure 7.Zeus, standing, with name inscribed, holding phiale with cas-cading wine.

One needs to look elsewhere, and to sub-ject these images to the multiple recombination afforded only through com-parative analysis. Such a survey reveals examples of the “religion of the gods”throughout history and across the globe.We cannot solve a paradox, yet we can consider how to ask whatever ap-propriate questions it may elicit. The approach that makes this work differentfrom the previous, often painstaking work done on this iconographic theme isthat I assert our knowledge of Greek religion, such as it now stands, cannotfully illumine the mystery of the divine scene on the Berlin Painter’s hydria.Rather, as W. Brede Kristensen suggested, the ancient Greek religious mental-ity is so alien to us in the present, so unsystematic, so apparently sui generis,despite its many Near Eastern and other influences, and, outside of the philo-sophical traditional, so chronically non-self-reflective that we are forced to lookoutside its boundaries.12We do this to locate an Other, that which will hold upa mirror to the original perplexing image, even if that image is reversed.13Jean-Pierre Vernant’s chastened statement still holds: “The era is past when onecould believe that it was possible to develop a theory of sacrifice embracing allcenturies and all civilizations.”14I believe, however, that to understand theseancient Greek images, the approach of comparative religion is the most fruit-ful. What other religions express in analogues both ideational and in praxispossibly represents something fundamental in the divine nature itself, or, ifone prefers, its human construction.With the exception of the Vedic hymns and Brahmanical commentaries,where it is impossible to deny that “the gods sacrificed to sacrifice with the sac-rifice” (R.gveda10.90.16; 1.164.50) because the texts are so explicit, legends oriconographic evidence of gods engaged in ritual performance are inevitably at-tended by conflicted interpretive responses—both ancient and modern.15Tradi-tional theological reaction within the closed system of religious thought to theparadoxical “ritualizing deity” tends to focus on the issue of the ways in whichritual actions, oriented to a higher entity as they are assumed to be, imply infe-riority and contingency. Omnipotence, or at least ultimate hierarchical superior-ity in the cosmic order, is intelligible as a defining attribute of the gods. The cru-cial restriction is that gods, since they are omnipotent, hence at the top of thescale of worship, cannot themselves worship. Ritual, worship, and in particu-lar “sacrifice” implies contingency, dependency, and hierarchically based actionoriginating at the subordinate level of a relationship: do ut des, “I give so that youmight give [i.e., in return].” The religion of the gods, that is, the divine capacityto perform rituals, is traditionally “unintelligible,” in that it seems to unequivo-cally compromise omnipotence. It is unseemly and unbefitting a god, or, as oneof the conversants exclaims in a discussion imagined by Plutarch at Delphiabout Apollo’s expiatory libations after slaying the Pytho, “terribly strange andparadoxical.”Modern scholarly objections to ritualizing deities, expressed from outsidethe tradition’s closed thought-world, often encode these assumptions aboutintroduction9"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"divine omnipotence and its compromise by the unacceptable idea of divine rit-ual: “this cannot mean what it seems to; gods cannot sacrifice.”16Contemporaryscholars who dobelieve that the gods in Attic vase paintings should indeed beinterpreted as pouring libations, or Odin as sacrificing “himself to himself ” inHávamál, or Alla ̄h and the angels as performing s.ala ̄tfor the Prophet, often doso from a stance that assumes that the human activity of religious action is be-ing projected onto the deity.The fountainhead of this idea might be located in the philosophy of Lud-wig Feuerbach, who, in his most important works The Essence of ChristianityandThe Essence of Religion,rebelled against the theistic thought of his teacherHegel. In contrast to Hegel’s notion of divine self-realization, Feuerbach’s the-ory viewed religion instead as a product of human self-consciousness, which,beyond “mirroring,” can and does create its own “other,” its own object of con-templation and relationship, the deity: for example, “the source of Monotheismisman,...the source of God’s unity is the unity of the human conscience andmind.”17Eventually characterized as a paradigm of “projectionism,” Feuer-bachian ideology, passionately albeit somewhat inconsistently expounded inhis lifelong writings, informed the philosophical platforms of Nietzsche, Marx,and Freud (Ricoeur’s “suspicious thinkers”), but also, in its insistence uponrelationship between self and other, shaped the theological schema of MartinBuber and the central preoccupations of Emmanuel Lévinas. At issue forFeuerbach was the nature of that transcendentalized other, whose origin andteleological function, paceHegel, was solely comprised in human attainments:“God is essentially an idea, a model of man; but a model of man does not existfor itself, it exists for man; its sole meaning and purpose is that man should be-come what the model represents; the model is simply the future man, personi-fied and conceived of as an independent being. For this reason God is essen-tially a communist, not an aristocrat; He shares everything He is and has withman; all His attributes become attributes of man; and with full right, for theyoriginated in man, they were abstracted in man, and the end they are givenback to him.”18Hence the image of worship by God or the gods must inexorably representthe human activity of worship, and it must do so for human ends. Typical ofthis approach, for example, are the remarks of the Islamicist Shelemo DovGoitein, who in his consideration of Islamic prayer wrote in 1968, “Finally,God himself is described as praying. ‘(The pious), from their Lord (are) prayersupon them and mercy.’ Since God is addressed in prayer, it seems strange thathe himself should be engaged in this pious work. Therefore, s.ala ̄t, while refer-ring to God, has been rendered in modern translations by ‘blessings’ and sim-ilar phrases. This is a misunderstanding of religious psychology. Since prayeris the most significant occupation of the pious, it is unimaginable that Godshould not pray himself.”19Through a Feuerbachian application, Gotein pur-ports to have said all that is necessary about the religious imagination.The classic work on sacrificial typology, Henri Hubert and Marcel Mauss’sSacrifice: Its Nature and Function, has exerted a profound influence on the phe-nomenological study of sacrifice. Yet it is driven by the same assumptions. As10introduction"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Elizabeth Pritchard observes, “despite the authors’ assertion that sacrifice isonly possible if there must exist for the sacrifier outside entities or forces towhich the sacrifier believes his/her existence is owed—indeed outside entitiesthat are so powerful that the intermediary or ‘victim’ is destroyed by the powerof intense contact with these ‘outside forces’,” they nevertheless collapse at theend with the assertion that the “ ‘outside forces’ are really only a hypostasiza-tion of the community and that sacrifices play a functional role in maintainingthe strength of the societal bonds.”20Not only unfazed by the apparent radical anthropomorphism of an obser-vant god but rather embracing it as an axiomatic explanatory device, exponentsof such theories reason as follows: Human beings as ritualizers tend to createritualizing gods. The human religious imagination, because it so consistentlyanthropomorphizes deities, is untroubled by the paradox that gods are tradi-tionally the focus of ritual orientation and the recipients of ritual action, notthemselves the instigators of ritual—for where then are focus and recipient?The logic goes that the gods are projected constellations of human nature, “bigpeople”; hence they do everything that people do, including worship, no matterhow theologically self-contradictory such an idea might appear.It is this second contemporary view about what is “really” operating fromwithinthe religious traditions that will interest us most in this book. This viewstarts from particular philosophical premises about the nature of the divine be-ing that are so embedded in the study of religion since Feuerbach, Marx, Freud,and Durkheim as to be accepted as sine qua nons, without internal problema-tization. It is not my purpose in this book to challenge the projectionist theoryof religion. Rather, I want to show that it is quite often set forward as an ade-quate explication of divine religious activity, as though there were nothingmore to be said. On the contrary, in the cases we will explore in these pages, itis entirely inadequate. Even if we concede its premises (which I do not, butthese cannot be debated here), what projectionist theory fails to do is to describehow the phenomenon of the ritualizing god manifests itself, functions, and is under-stood from within the tradition. Such a descriptive effort, rarely undertaken, isworthwhile because it can illumine both the subtleties and religious results ofthe relationships between ritual and theology that emerge in each of the cases Iwill consider. Among the subtleties is the fact that divine ritual almost invari-ably does notexactly resemble human ritual, as a purely applied Feuerbachianmodel might have it. Why not? Among the results “on the ground” are the waysin which divinely performed rituals, as represented textually and iconographi-cally, often have the historical effect of reinscribing and reinforcing particular de-votional forms at the expense of others. Why?Anticipating Feuerbach, wandering pre-Socratic thinker Xenophanes ofColophon famously wrote, “The Ethiopians imagine their gods as black withsnub noses. The Thracians imagine their gods as blue-eyed and red-haired.The Egyptians imagine their gods as light-complexioned with black hair. If ox-ens and horses and lions had hands, and could paint with their hands, and pro-duce works of art just as men do, horses would paint the forms of gods likehorses, and oxen like oxen. But the divine is one and has no countenance andintroduction11"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"no colour.”21The critique of the gods of antiquity as anthropomorphizing pro-jections of human desires and behaviors was to resonate millennia later inWestern philosophy and psychology, but during the late archaic period in an-cient Greece stood as a radical critique of both religious and civic structures ofthought.22The ritualizing deity, counterintuitive as it was, was perhaps themost extreme example of projection Xenophanes might have imagined. Yet theidea clearly existed contemporaneously in the ancient Greek religious imagina-tion, namely, in the form of hundreds of vases, the majority of them painted indark red and bright black between the years of 510 and 440 B.C.E.—not only bythe marginal vase-painters of Attica but also by its masters. The iconography ofthe over three hundred classical vases treated in this work is troubling at best ifwe retrace the steps of those scholars who have considered them. The Olympiangods, including Zeus, are shown pouring libations onto altars, and even tearinganimals or roasting sacrificial meat. As I hope to show, however, these represen-tations of ritual are not anomalous within the context of ancient Greek religion,but are rather a paradigmatic intensification of its categories of theologicalthought.In many other religions of the world, some dead, some alive, some histor-ically related to or interactive with ancient Greece, and some utterly remotefrom it in time and space, other “high gods” were also portrayed as themselvesengaged in worship. Therefore, we may have to rethink the category of ritualworship itself. In the self-understanding of religious traditions that portray thegods as religious actors, is ritual, when performed by gods, understood to bethe same thing as when it is performed by human beings?Certain categories of the modern study of religion such as “worship,” “sac-rifice,” and “ritual,” have been reformulated over the past century (e.g., by MaxMüller, Edward Tylor, James Frazer, Foustel de Coulanges, Robertson Smith,and Jane Harrison), and almost depleted through exhaustive definition (e.g., byHubert and Mauss, and Karl Meuli), redefinition (e.g., by Clifford Geertz,Georges Bataille, Victor Turner, René Girard, Walter Burkert, Bernard Malam-oud, and Jean-Pierre Vernant), and most recently, deconstruction (e.g., by FritsStaal) or anthropological critique (e.g., by Nancy Jay).I have found that despite the riches they offer in their variety, existingtheoretical models cannot help in the interpretation of these vases, nor anyother cases of what I will call “divine reflexivity.” This is for the simple reasonthat these models only “work” when God or the gods are the object,and notthe active subjector agent of ritual. When ritual has a divine, rather than a hu-man subject, these categories appear to be unusable. In the special but notrare image of an enthroned Zeus clearly pouring a wine offering onto an altarin a sanctuary, previous definitions and deconstructions lead to theoreticalparalysis.To whom are the gods sacrificing? The vases show that the Greek gods, an-thropomorphic to an extreme, could participate in every human behavior—notexcluding worship itself. I ask in this book whether some mystical identificationof roles between devotee and deity should be inferred, or whether this is betterunderstood as an ideal paradigm for human worship. Ultimately, solutions such12introduction"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"as the “humanization” of the gods; sacrifice to a higher, absent deity; and atone-ment for the overthrow of a previous divine generation prove inadequate. I pro-pose that a new phenomenology should be imagined, one that combines theol-ogy and cult and, I believe, solves the paradoxical deployment of normalsacrificial categories. I argue that the gods were seen in ancient Greece as thesource of cult, rather than exclusively as its object. Not only the instruments ofcult but also cultic actions—in other words, religious behaviors—were attrib-uted to the gods. Appropriate theological description must embrace that aspectof the divine nature that self-referentially and self-expressively engages inwor-ship. I call this concept “divine reflexivity.”“Divine reflexivity” I will define for the moment as the ritual performanceby a deity of an action known as belonging to the sphere of that deity’s humancultic worship. What I wish to stress initially in this coined phrase is the word“divine,” carrying with it the notion of “transcendent”; “immortal”; “other thanhuman”; “superhuman”; “godlike.” Whatever we may think about gods associal constructions or as metaphysical entities, what must be clear is that theyare not generally understood from within their given traditional context as “bigpeople.” Gods are different. Exegesis of their represented actions, then, re-quires a nuanced balance between emic epistemology and etic knowledge, withan eye to humility in deploying the latter, and an awareness of the limitations ofthe very distinction. The history of religion does not survey religious phenom-ena from a superior vantage point, but rather as a discipline with its own as-sailable premises, which are to some degree impoverished by the continuingideal of “objectivity” and “detachment.”23I hope to show in comparative context that gods who are portrayed as per-forming ritual actions are not, within the framework of the religious traditionsthat envision them thus, imitating mortals. Nor is it even accurate, in my view,to say that mortals are imitating them. I have come to believe that when thehigh gods pour out wine, they are in fact acting religiously through, on behalfof, and because of themselves. Their religious actions, even those such as sac-rifice that on a mortal level would certainly require a recipient, are not directedto a being higher than themselves.Religion itself is a part of the gods’ essence and domain; when they prac-tice human-type religious actions, they do so as gods.The causes and effects ofthe cultic mechanism in their case is, as Rudolf Otto termed it, “wholly other.”A ritual performed by a god is not aimed outside the god’s self as a human rit-ual would be. Instead, it refers back only to the god. The ritual emanates fromand is reabsorbed into the numinous parabola of his or her own inexhaustibleenergy. Humans practicing the same ritual are undeniably participants in thisparabola, which then return ritual energy to the gods. But human beings arenot the source of religion. The gods are.Furthermore, as Hegel has argued on the level of philosophical theology,particularly in “The Concept of Religion,” self-containment and self-referentialityare some of the most persistent attributes of divine nature, closely related to itsautonomy, self-subsistence, and self-expression.24Religion, itself directed to thedivine, is in Hegelian axiom revealed, in Dale Schlitt’s words, as “God’s ownintroduction13"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"coming to self-consciousness...a movement of self-positing divine inclusivesubjectivity.”25Hegel’s concept of religion may help to explicate the ways inwhich, since gods are not only superior but also ultimate beings, their actionstend indexically to refer to themselves, not to spheres of action outside them-selves. This self-referentiality, this divine reflexive nature, is called in Islam“Ipseity.” The actions of the gods express divine motivations, strategems, andnature, and are the basis for any human constructions, institutions, or actions,including religious ones.Let me illustrate with a case of divine reflexivity from a tradition other thanancient Greek. In at least five notable points in the Babylonian Talmud (formal-ized c. 400–600 C.E., but containing material centuries older), God himselfseems to practice Judaism. He observes mi.zvot,wears ritual garments, and ab-sorbs himself in scripture. As in the vase-paintings of Olympian gods who oddlypour libations, a divinity is associated not only with cultic objects but also withcultic actions. According to Berakhot6a, the incorporeal Hebrew God wearsscroll-bearing phylacteries. He wraps himself in the t.allit,worn by the Ba’alTefillah,the leader of prayer at the synagogue—the prayer shawl symbolizingsubmission to God’s will—in order to instruct Moses in a penitential service inRosh Hashanah17b. Tractate \\Abodah Zarahdiscovers him studying and reflect-ing on his own Torah (\\oseq battorah) for three hours each day.26In the com-mentary to the first tractate of the first order of the Mishnah, Berakhot(Benedic-tions), God offers a heartfelt prayer that the attribute of his mercy may overcomethat of his justice, which starts with the variant formula, “May it be Mywill thatmy mercy overcome my justice and all my other attributes.”27Challenged byone of the minimin Shabbat 30 as to where God ritually bathed to purify him-self after burying Moses, a rabbi retorts, without hesitating, not that God, thesource of ritual purity, had no need to purify himself after contact with a corpse,but rather that he bathed in a mikvehof fire.Do these nonphilosophical sermonic images indicate a clear-cut case of ex-treme anthropomorphism? In other words, when God performs a specificallyJewish religious action, is he still acting as Master of the Universe, or simply asa larger and more powerful Jew? Anticipating the reductionist arguments ofKarim W. Arafat on the Greek case, one early twentieth-century scholar callsthese examples of God’s practiced religion “the humanizing of the Deity andendowing Him with all the qualities and attributes which tend towards makingGod accessible to Man.”28Is this really sufficient? Or does God maintain a spe-cial role as the theurgic performer of ritual action by dint of his quintessentialholiness? If in the Talmud he is in fact still acting as God, does that in any wayaffect how he practices his own religion? If so, to what end?Similarly, talmudic translator and editor Arthur Cohen insists, “Howeverthese passages may be explained, it is impossible to maintain that their authorsactually believed in a corporeal God Who actually performed the actions as-cribed to Him.”29But why is this protest made, and is it at all helpful? Even oneof the most compelling new frameworks for the study of ritual, provided byCatherine Bell in two successive books, is theoretically applicable only whenone assumes that religion begins in one place and moves in one direction:14introduction"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"from earth to heaven (or to wherever the gods are conceived as dwelling),from the mortal realm to the immortal. Bell tells us that “the deployment ofritualization, consciously or unconsciously, is the deployment of a particularconstruction of power relationships, a particular relationship of domination,consent, and resistance.”30But what happens to this “deployment of powerrelationships” when God, than whom there is nothing higher or more power-ful, wears a prayer shawl, or even more disconcertingly, prays to himself ? Arethese not also ritual actions, performed in the context of Jewish piety, and fa-miliar from the realm of human worship? If we are to turn to Bell’s method-ology for help in understanding these playful and yet pointed fantasies of theamoraim, who dominates? Who consents? Who resists? Like so many others,Bell’s analysis of “ritual” requires a hierarchy. When the hierarchy is removed,we are adrift with the gods who are continually and cryptically practicingtheir own religion.In other words, how can God or the gods worship, sacrifice, or performa ritual? I will show that in the case of the divine libation theme on Atticvases there can be no logical explanation other than that the gods are indeedoffering—practicing religious acts. I will also show that once this interpretivepossibility is accepted without prejudice, far from being anomalous, these im-ages are entirely consistent with other theologically meaningful artifacts fromthe same historical and cultural milieu. Ancient Greek religion itself providesthe context for the images. The problem was always and only ours as religion-ists. If, in the historical evidence we will encounter in the traditions to be con-sidered, the divine is not the object (the recipient) but the subject and agent ofthe religious action (the sacrificer or devotee), I would suggest that it is heuris-tically unhelpful to persist in the idea that there is something peripheral or ex-ceptional about this phenomenon. Rather, we must rethink how we understand“religion.”The performative or devotional aspect of religion is conceived of fromwithin the religious perspective itself not as the realm of mortals but rather asthe appropriate sphere of the gods who are its object. As early as the Enuma El-ish,where we hear that “Marduk established his sanctuaries,” it is clear thatgods are often intimately involved with the establishment and many ongoingaspects of their own worship. In the “Comparanda” section of the cataloguepresented here, it will become clear that the Greek gods are no exception. Theyhover over their own altars with reverent gestures; they bring flowers and carryincense burners, libation bowls, and even animals. Why then should it besuch a surprise when in iconography they lay the flowers onto the altar, burnthe incense, or pour out wine from the libation bowls? Perhaps cultic action isas much an attribute of the divine as other attributes with which we are morefamiliar and comfortable, such as holiness, flight, kingship, a conch shell, or ascroll.The work of Mircea Eliade has shown that within religious frameworks,humans are theomorphic; that is, their religious acts imitate those of the gods:“A sacrifice, for example,” he writes in The Myth of the Eternal Return,“not only ex-actly reproduces the initial sacrifice revealed by a god ab origine, at the beginningintroduction15"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"of time, it also takes place at the same primordial mythical moment; in otherwords, every sacrifice repeats the initial sacrifice and coincides with it. All sac-rifices are performed at the same mythical instant of the beginning.”31Whendescribed as the actions of deities, religious actions surely have a didacticand also a stabilizing effect on human behavior—an Eliadean pattern or divineparadigm. However, I hope to nuance Eliade’s beliefs, and to expand on them:Divine religious actions also have an intensifying effect on human cult, whichsets up an ongoing parabola of worship between the transcendent and imma-nent realms, having its source in the former. In other words, human culticactions are far more than copies of a blueprint drawn long ago by masterarchitects.Undeniable is the relationship between the libation poured out by Apolloon his Delphic omphalos on the tondo of a classical vase (no. 204; fig. 8), andthat poured out by the mortal priest standing in Apollo’s sanctuary in fifth-century B.C.E. Delphi: This iconography implies profound reciprocity. Yet thesecases of divine reflexivity mean even more than this; in some cases, they inten-sify and elevate certain forms of observance. The gods do not sacrifice merely toinstruct human beings on proper religious observance; in other words, the ef-fect of the performance is not merely mimetic; it is, rather, generative and at-tributive. The gods sacrifice, rather, on their own behalf—in effect, because ofthemselves. They originate, perform, and thus ratify their own cults. Hence, inthe case of ancient Greek divine epithets, for example, as Walter Burkert observes,16introductionfigure 8.Apollo, with lyre, pours from phiale onto omphalos decoratedwith fillets. Artemis, Hermes; Leto with phiale. Attic red-figure bell-krater,manner of the Dinos Painter, 420–400 B.C.E."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"“Many [divine epithets] are taken from sanctuaries . . . or from ritual, as if thegod himself were performing the ritual act—Apollo Daphnephoros [laurel-bearing Apollo], Dionysos Omestes [Dionysos the raw-eater].”32Greek gods thuswere often called by the cultic functions that human beings practice in theirhonor. Apollo wears his own laurel, as one would in worshiping Apollo; Dionysoseats torn animal victims raw, as the Dionysos-possessed maenads were said todo. The god performs the ritual that is his.Burkert’s discussion of divine epithets makes it clear that a Greek god, likemost gods in pantheistic religious systems, is only one dimension of a multidi-mensional cosmos of power, but is also at the center of a sphere or domain of ac-tivity that is particularly dedicated to him or to her—and hence is susceptibleboth to human imprecation and to the theurgic activity and intervention of thegod: “Many [divine epithets] are formed spontaneously to denote the domain inwhich divine intervention is hoped for; in this way each god is set about with ahost of epithets which draw a complex picture of his activity. Zeus as rain god isombriosorhyetios, as centre of court and property herkeiosandktesios, as guardianof the city polieus, as protector of strangers hikesiosandxenios, and as god of allGreekspanhellenios.”33In other words, in the view of its adherents, practiced reli-gion may belong to the sphere of, and have its source in, the divine. The godspractice religion because religion in its essence belongs to them.Relying on the evidence of the history of religions, one may observe the re-ligion of the gods, driven by a cultic dynamic that I call divine reflexivity, is notsimply human ritual carried out on a cosmic plane.It is rather in some senseunique to the gods, and has unique cultic features following existentially andnaturally from their special status. “The religion of the gods” is also not alwaysfoundational, carried out once in primeval illo tempore,although it can havethat dimension; nor, on a related note, is it invariably some kind of memorialcelebration of that foundational act to be reenacted over and again. It is rather,frequently, ongoing consecrated action continuously occurring in a kind of paral-lel timein which the mythical past and ritual present collapse. This is a differ-ent kind of time; it is “cultic time.”34The gods’ ritual actions are synergistichappenings in the still vacuum of the other, suprasensible world, parallelingand perhaps even inspiring participatory religious action on earth, but still re-moved from it.The painted image of the classical god who sacrifices is not ritual itself butrather the representation of ritual. It is not injunctive of ritual action in thesame way that a ritual text might be; it does not prescribe the sequence of stepsin the choreography, but rather freezes and represents an idealized moment inthe offering, one that encodes the proper aesthetics of ritual. However, the telosof the representation goes beyond selection and elevation of a moment ofpower. Because the god is portrayed performing the sacrificial ritual—pouringout the libation—the ritual itself is inscribed with a kind of ultimacy, even ur-gency, which in turn necessarily energizes human ritual orientation and activ-ity. The vase-paintings show that cultic time is imagined as a multivalent ma-trix in which two communities of very different entities practice religiousaction that mirrors but does not mimic.introduction17"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"As Coenraad van Ouwerkerk says, Hans-Georg Gadamer postulates inWahrheit und Methodethat a representation “enhances [and, we might add, in-tensifies] the ontological reality of what is represented.”35“A representation...could not only reveal and throw into relief certain aspects of an object, other-wise hidden or unobserved, but could also make personal and intimate, whatin reality is distant and alien. Rendering an object present in a representation,is a specific way of having access and relating to it.”36The application of thisidea charts both intention and effect of such representations in ways that man-age to transcend simplistic notions of the god as human writ large.If, for example, we take the talmudic evidence cited above as neither mean-ingless nor as mere anthropomorphizing, we see that on its own terms, powerflows with a far more centrifugal force: from and around the deity. Then ourinterpretive task has become different. It would be to determine why religion isnot just consecrated to but also ascribed to God during this particular period in(in this case, Jewish) history. That is, what is the particular and special value ofthese types of religious observance that would occasion the need for their in-tensification using the paradoxical idiom of an observant God? I will show inchapter 8 that possible answers lie in the particular ways that God is observant,central as they are to Rabbinic Judaism in the first to sixth centuries C.E. afterthe destruction of the Second Temple.Within the parameters of this inquiry, I will allow the term “sacrifice” to re-tain its primary meaning, namely, “the act of offering something to a deity inpropitiation or homage, especially the ritual slaughter of an animal or person.”37The word’s etymology comes through the Old French and Middle English fromthe Latin sacrificium, which comes from sacer,meaning “sacred , ”+facere,“tomake.” By no means has the practice of sacrifice been confined to slaughteralone. Anything can and has been offered to a deity in propitiation or homage.In a larger context, I will view sacrifice as part of a larger sphere of humanreligiosity, namely worship, having as its primary canonical meanings “thereverent love and allegiance accorded a deity, idol, or sacred object and a set ofceremonies, prayers, or other religious forms by which this love is ex-pressed.”38The term “worship” comes to us through the Middle English fromthe Old English weoroscipe,meaning “honor,” from weoro,“worth” and scipe,“ship.”Both of these terms, sacrifice and worship, describe a dynamic transfer,within a religious context, of something to a numinous object or energy. One of-fers gifts (sacrifice) or ceremonially enacts a feeling (worship) toward a god orgoddess—at the very least, a power greater than oneself. Something of worth istransferred from a lesser to a greater being. Note that our usual use of theseterms seems to assume the mortality, and in a sense, the inferiority of the donor.The divinity, and implicit superiority, of the recipient sharply distinguishes itfrom the humanity and finitude of the donor.In light of the evidence to follow, I hope these definitions will begin toresonate ironically. What if the sacrificer—or, on a more general plane, theworshiper—possesses the quality of omnipotence? What becomes of this dy-namic, which we take so much for granted when we reflect on religious18introduction"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"thought, encoded in ritual, from its most exteriorized to its most sublimatedforms? For example, would the motive for sacrifice continue to be propitia-tion or homage? Of whom or what? What is worship if a deity, especially asupreme deity in a hierarchical system, performs it? Does it remain the “rev-erent love and allegiance accorded a deity”? Is it self-reverence? Or is it some-thing else?Are these very questions culture-bound? As Veena Das has noted, “whatare considered universal features of the sacrificial process draw rather heavilyfrom assumptions about man, society and God in Semitic traditions.” As an ex-ample, she gives one of the assumptions of anthropological discourse on sacri-fice as the concept that “the sacrificator is a bearer of pollution, sin, or guilt andthe sacrificial cult provides the means for cleansing the person or the socialbody of these moral stains. Further, the immolation of the victim becomes thecentral moment of the sacrifice since it constitutes the renunciation of a signif-icant object by the sacrificator to bring about a sudden and violent cleansing ofsin, the separation of that which has been wrongly united, and a release of pow-erful forces (Hubert & Mauss 1964; Evans-Pritchard 1956; Turner 1977).”39Sacrifice as a mechanism of renunciation and cleansing may be seen to oper-ate, if on a very muted scale, in ancient Greek sacrifice, especially in accor-dance with Meuli’s and Burkert’s theory of the sympathetic identification ofhunter and hunted, which had its genesis in the Neolithic Central Asiansteppes. But surely it cannot be said to operate if the gods themselves bring thesacrificial offerings to the altar.With these questions in mind, let us turn to some of the puzzling situa-tions in which hypothesis does indeed become reality. What does it mean forthe Greek gods to pour libations in the fifth century B.C.E.? For the ancestors ofthe Vedic gods, the Sa ̄dhyas, to sacrifice Agni, god of fire? For Indra to drinkSoma in texts from 1000 B.C.E.? For the God of Israel to demand the death ofIsaac in patriarchal times, then substitute a ram for Abraham’s firstborn so thatthe sacrifice might be accomplished? For the same God to immolate his ownfirstborn son in first-century Christian scripture, and for Christ simultane-ously to act as high priest and offer up himself in the Epistle to the Hebrews?For Odin to hang on the World-Tree as his gallows, having pierced himself withhis own spear in the same manner that sacrificial victims are hanged on treelimbs as dedications to Odin? And in the larger sphere of worship, what does itmean for the Talmud to portray YHWH as reading the Torah three hours a day,or as wearing a prayer shawl? For the Qur›a ̄n to describe All ̄ah as ritually inter-ceding for Muh.ammad?In his Religious Worlds, William Paden posits, “Religions create, maintainand oppose worlds. Their mythic symbols declare what the world is based on,what its oppositional forces are, what hidden worlds lie beyond or within ordi-nary life.”40A “world,” then, is the self-contained and self-validating realm cre-ated by a religion, which does not make it impervious to comparative thematicinquiry. “The idea of a world helps mediate the ideas of difference and com-monality. In spite of their differences, religious worlds have in commoncertain general forms of mythic and ritual behavior....The contentof thisintroduction19"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"behavior is always specific and historical. But the formof the behavior showstypical cross-cultural categories at work....So the idea of worlds deals with therealm of particular historical matrices, yet also allows us to see typical or analo-gous ways by which worlds are constructed.”41If we accept this both/and approach, then we do not have to make the arti-ficial and, in my opinion, bitter choice between a historical or a phenome-nological approach to the study of a religious question. For in making sucha choice, we are robbed. The methodological approach guiding this work isbased on the belief that religious evidence is at the same time culturally andhistorically specific as well as part of a larger picture in which common struc-tures emerge, and can be talked about interpretively. It is essential to start withprimary religious evidence, and equally essential that we assume that it was infact meaningful to those who created it. This may seem obvious, but in fact ithas by no means been conceded by scholars who have interpreted the sacrific-ing gods, as chapter 4, a history of previous scholarship, will show. It is espe-cially important in dealing with material evidence when no texts are availableto aid in interpretation.According to Turner, Paden, and others, all such worlds maintain what issacred, and maintain the integrity of their own views. Through acts of lan-guage and observance, through configuring activities, through gods and sym-bols, these worlds are made credible. Religion is as much encoded action as itis doctrine or accumulated belief. Religious action is represented repeatedly aspracticed by the gods. If we assume that the gods are “configuring activities,”then their worship becomes, to the “impartial” observer extreme anthropomor-phism. I will argue that this leads to distortion even within the framework ofthe traditions themselves.If, as Nancy Jay has said, sacrifice is a way to ingrain and differentiate sub-ject and object, sacred and profane, divinity and humankind, how should weunderstand sacrificing gods? What is the intended meaning when in the scrip-ture and religious art of a culture, the gods themselves configure and sacralizethe world through that ultimate world-shaping system, ritual, and especiallysacrifice? Objects correlate to subjects. Things are sacred in relation to some-thing. Do these specific and apparently anomalous phenomena negate a tradi-tional understanding of the devotional relationship between divine and hu-man? Or do they deepen it?On a related plane, when do sacrificing or worshiping gods appear in thechronological development of a religion? Do any factors appear to be sharedbetween the sociological situations of the religions considered, or the internalpressures it might have faced at the time? In other words, is there a time atwhich the notion of the divine itself engaged in an act of worship seems morelikely to occur in a given history of belief and practice—whether in art, scrip-ture, myth, oral tradition, or creed—than at some other time?This book proposes that the gods are as much the originators as the ob-jects or recipients of cultic action and that human religiosity falls into the di-vine sphere—rather than divine ritual falling into a range of human religiousphenomena, or as Jay puts it, “a god stands for the concept of a sacrificer’s20introduction"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"object . . . sacrificial religions cause what they signify.”42Jay calls for an “activepurifying of the gods through the recognition of them as human.” Contrary tothis, I call for a counteractive purifying of the gods through a cleansing of theintellectual prejudices of the past century’s insistence on religion as a humanprojection, for in the case of “religious gods,” it actually obstructs the processof interpretation from within. As Firozi Kotwal and James Boyd assert, “ritualpractices...have their own meaning and value as actions, not only as ‘sym-bols’ of concepts. A defensible hermeneutic demands an understanding of rit-uals on their own terms.”43The present work essays a defensible hermeneuticof what are in the most powerful of ritual actions—those performed not by hu-mans but by their creators, the gods—“on their own terms.” Normally “human”ritual actions can thus have the divine as their subject—in fact, as their engine.How can we see the images of the gods who pour out wine on classicalvases as the Greeks saw them? How can we respond to the challenge set forthby Folkert van Straten, who writes—in particular of the puzzling images of the“god’s portion” on the altar, but applicable to sacrificial iconography ingeneral—“It is not wise to try to identify the object by establishing what it lookslike to us.We should not try to recognize it, taking the visible world as weknowit as our frame of reference. The Greek vase painters painted these scenes withtheir contemporary compatriots in mind. It is theirframe of reference we musttry to reconstruct.”44Who, then, were the ancient Greek gods to the ancient Greeks? They werenot big people, nor were they ever thought of as such. Classicist MaryLefkowitz insists on the value of this simple but crucial methodological pointin her recent Greek Gods, Human Lives, and in the process highlights one of theimportant biases in the classical scholarship of the last century, when she ob-serves that “Modern writers and readers often find it very hard to imagine thatthe ancient Greeks could have believed in their own very different gods. Theyare sympathetic to the ancient thinkers and writers who themselves were criti-cal of how the gods were portrayed in epic, and they are comfortable with theportrayal of the gods in the works of later poets, where they appear to behavemore like human beings than like deities, without concern for the commongood or for justice.”45Lefkowitz shows how the Greek gods have been distortedin modern presentations, as for example in Edith Hamilton’s Mythology, pub-lished in 1940 and often reprinted, which renders the gods “more approach-able, more humane, and more closely involved in human life than they actuallywere in the tales the Greeks told. The gods were ageless, immortal, and power-ful.”46Lefkowitz writes of the authors of Greek and Roman literature, “I startfrom the assumption that the narrators of these works of literature composedthem primarily for audiences that believed those gods existed, and that themyths conveyed, however literally or figuratively, essential truths, even thoughthose truths are often harsh. That is not to say that ancient writers did not allowthe characters in their stories to question the motives and even the existence ofthe gods. I simply make the observation that they wrote about the world as if it werecontrolled by the gods, and as if action on the part of the gods was normal and not inany way artificial.”47introduction21"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Part of the thicket ensnaring previous scholars is the conception that godswere in fact big people, so their ritual actions were simply human actions writlarge. The other, diametrically opposed prejudice has been a rigid and hierar-chically based notion of what is and is not appropriate for a god to do so as to beconsistent with his or her god-nature. If, as scholars of the history of religion,we venture into the evaluation or even the description of phenomena, we arealso reluctant theologians. As the critique of phenomenology has shown, com-plete objectivity is an impossible telos. We are then left to attempt what Smithinvokes: “the integration of a complex notion of pattern and system with anequally complex notion of history.”In part I of this book, “The Ancient Greek Gods in Ritual Performance,”I hope to provide an overview of the Hellenic evidence for this problem. With afew startling exceptions (see “Comparanda”), our vase-paintings depict godsand goddesses using the vessels of libation, the oinochoe or phiale, or both.They are engaged in pouring what we might call drink offerings. In chapter 1,I consider the question of how best to understand the ancient Greek ceremonyof libation within its religious context. What kind of an offering was libation,and to whom, in anyone, was it offered? How did it reach its recipients? Inwhat sense is libation “sacrifice”? In chapter 2, I discuss some of the more im-portant iconographic issues pertaining to the Greek evidence for the theme of“gods pouring libations,” namely, that of red-figure vase-painting. This chapterrefers to a representative catalogue of such vases from the late archaic, classi-cal, and Hellenistic periods of antiquity, and includes an analysis of their culticfeatures. Chapter 3 treats the known ancient literary evidence that may bearupon the question of divine libations in classical art. Chapter 4, a history of in-terpretation, explores what has been said about the problem of the sacrificinggods, and the implications of each commentary. Chapter 5 addresses the intel-lectual reasons for why the Greek god with libation bowl in hand has been soproblematic. I analyze the common theoretical stumbling blocks I have ob-served in the secondary literature, both religionist and archaeological. I thensuggest a workable theoretical solution, based in what I believe to be an ancientGreek understanding of the relationship between their gods and their practicedreligion. I describe a new descriptive category, “divine reflexivity,” which candissolve some of the previous hermeneutical obstacles, in that it comprisesrather than avoids paradox, and allows religious worlds both self-referentialand self-organizing potentials. The chapter concludes with seven characteris-tics that are the signifying characteristics of divine reflexivity.Part II, “The Wider Indo-European World: Polytheism,” treats divine re-flexivity in three polytheistic religious systems that share an Indo-Europeangenesis with ancient Greece. The gods’ habit of sacrifice in a civilization that isdemonstrably historically related to that of ancient Greece, that of Vedic India,provides the backdrop for the two close studies presented here in chapters 6and 7. The extant corpus of Vedic literature offers two important featureswhich, while not exactly the same, are surely similar in outline to this particu-lar ancient Greek religious situation: sacrificing gods, and a strong focus onlibation—on the offering of consecrated liquids in order to sanctify. These two22introduction"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"features are found nowhere else, either in such force or in conjunction witheach other. Chapter 6 examines an ultimately heretical but historically influen-tial Zoroastrian creation myth, the thousand-year sacrifice performed by thehigh god Zurva ̄n. Chapter 7 analyzes the self-immolation of the hanging godOdin, self-told in Norse skaldic poetry.In part III, “The Peoples of the Book: Monotheism and Divine Ritual,”I consider a complex of related issues among three monotheistic faiths ofNorthwest Semitic origin. I will not treat intensively, but will refer to, the culticprescriptions set forth in the Pentateuch, the exegesis on the aqedah(bindingof Isaac) in Christian theologies of the crucifixion, and Christ’s multivalent sac-rificial and sacerdotal roles in the Eucharist. Chapter 8 treats the talmudic pas-sages mentioned above concerning God’s piety, and chapter 9, the problem ofthe God and the angels’ s.alla ̄tfor Muh.ammad described in S ̄urah 33:56 of theQur›a ̄n.As students of the history of religions we need to learn to tolerate, ratherthan to seek to rationalize or to reconcile the paradoxical when we encounter it.For encounter it we will, again and again. Epistemology alone bears out thisprognosis. Here, in what I call divine reflexivity, we have the apparently irrec-oncilable clash of theology (the omnipotence and ultimacy of the gods) and cult(the actions of contingent or lesser beings made in propitiation of noncontin-gent, greater and usually greatest ones).I hope that the issues I raise, summarized in the conclusion, will be seenas specific to the cultural context of each religious tradition and at the sametime more phenomenologically universal. My goal is to show how the paradoxof a god who practices religious action, which we understand as a seeming con-tradiction, does not imply religious deviance, heresy, or anomaly, but rather re-veals a deep, ubiquitous structure within the history of religions.introduction23"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"part iAncient Greek Gods inRitual Performance"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"1Is Libation Sacrifice?Before it is clear why a religious image is exceptional or unorthodox(“marked,” to borrow the Prague School term used in Indo-Europeanlinguistics), we need to know what the norm is—the “unmarked”case. The unmarked ritual case in ancient Greek religion would bethe basic mortal gesture of libation, that is, of pouring out liquid of-ferings in a gesture of reverence or of giving to the divine. Themarked case would be when a divine figure pours out an offering—on our vases, an urgent paradox. The immediacy and vividness of thespilling wine depicted in added paint in these scenes offer a strong vi-sual retort to any doubt as to whether the gods are receiving or offer-ing in their phialai. Depictions of both unmarked and marked casesproliferated in the fifth century B.C.E.1Drink offerings brought byboth mortals (to obtain the good will of the immortals) and by the im-mortals themselves (for reasons of their own) appeared in art withmore frequency than ever before. Occasionally, as the next chapter’sevidence will show, mortal and immortal libation scenes were paintedon opposite sides of the same vase—perhaps signaling, in the culticrealm, a kind of mirroring, reciprocity, or other relationship.Before seeking to comprehend the paradox that the Greek godsperform ritual, we might pause to consider what kind of ritual it isthat they perform. Overwhelmingly predominant in the corpus ofvases showing “sacrificing gods” is the performance of libation. Al-though there are several known examples of gods leading animals tothe altar or actually involved in their killing or cooking (see “Com-paranda,”nos. C–36 to C–43), these comprise only a handful; on theother hand, there are at least several hundred scenes of divine liba-tion.

Although thegreat sky-god praises sacrifice in general, using the revealing Homeric termdaAß(meal), he then specifies certain elements of blood-sacrifice as the gods’gAraß: “our portion of honour.” These are neither blood nor entrails nor meat;for in Greek animal sacrifice these serve, respectively, to mark the altar, tohonor the attending priests, and to feed the participants.3Rather, they are “thelibation and the savour”; these specifically belong to the gods. We know fromthe aetiological sacrifice of an ox by the Titan Prometheus to Zeus in Hesiod’sTheogony(535–561) that the gods inhale the sweet smoke, smelling it as it risesfrom the meat grilling in the altar-flames. But why is libation especially re-served for the gods on Olympus, and how can it ever reach them? Simply put,the offering goes downwhile they are always up.As Walter Burkert remarks, “the libation is usually accepted without ques-tion as a drink offering, a gift of food. That the earth drinks is said explicitlyenough. Mythology must then admittedly attribute curious needs to the deadand subterranean beings, and why wine is poured straight into the ground forthe Heavenly Ones remains unexplained.”4According to this line of reasoning,the phiale is put into the hand of the god so that the deity can “catch” the pre-cious stuff before it is lost. But then why do these gods pour out the liquid withsuch abandon onto altars? Why do they not seek to conserve and consume it?In the most general of terms, libation is that liquid which is poured out asan act of consecration. As an accompaniment to simple prayer or at a sympo-sium, a little is spilled out on the earth and the rest is consumed. In chthoniansacrifice it sinks into the ground—if honey, milk or oil, literally understood asnourishment for the dead, or if water, their bath; it may also head to the un-derworld in honor of the powers who dwell below—Pluton, Persephone, theheroes, or the Semnai Theai.5In animal sacrifice it is poured midway throughthe ceremony onto the toiling flames, making them leap higher and, accord-ing to the testimony of Euripides’ Ion(1032–1033), libation also concludes theproceedings, as wine is poured onto the smoldering altar. But the heavenlyconceit that wafts the smoke offering to the sky-dwelling ones is absent in the28ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"case of libations at an altar, where Zeus speaks of them. There is no way in en-acted cult that liquid offerings seem to reach the gods on Olympus. As Burkertcomplains, “Libation is quite a peculiar way of ‘giving’: you pour out wine onthe soil, and there it stays: How are the gods in heaven to get any of it? Myce-neans and Greeks tried to evade this problem by putting a libation bowl intothe hand of the god, or by pouring libations into the fire on the altar; but this issecondary, as especially Hittite evidence shows; and the Greek god with the li-bation bowl in his hand, as if pouring offerings to himself, becomes a newproblem of interpretation.”6Burkert suggests that the libation bowl wielded by the gods themselves,hundreds of examples of which we shall encounter in the next chapter, was aniconographic solution to an awkward problem. It was hard to envision “giving”to the gods by pouring wine into the ground or, we might note, even onto an al-tar, where as alcohol it evaporated in the fire or rolled onto the ground. Con-sider, for example, a cult scene like that shown on an archaic black-figure vasefrom Athens where Athena or her statue receives a libation poured directly by aworshiper onto her flaming altar (marked AQENAIAS, belonging to Athena)(no. C–14; Fig. 9). In a fascinating stamnos by the Eupolis Painter in the Lou-vre depicting a festival—perhaps that of the mysterious Lenaia held in Game-lion, or of the better-known Anthesteria—maenads bring oinochoe and kan-tharos with wine-offerings to the cult image of Dionysos standing on a base(no. C–25).7According to Burkert, the Olympians stretch forth their phialai toreceive the libation directly; and this solves our iconographic problem. Thegods hold these vessels because this is how they get their drink-offerings.There are a number of examples from vase painting where mortals seemto offer the libation to the god without the intervening step of pouring it outis libation sacrifice?29figure 9.Athena receives a libation poured onto her altar, inscribed AQE-NAIAS“belonging to Athena.” Attic black-figure vase fragment, late archaic."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"onto the ground. In a red-figure amphora from the early classical period by theSabouroff Painter in the British Museum, Athena, clearly not a statue, holdsher doffed helmet and contemplates a libation extended to her by a womanwith the ritual paraphernalia of oinochoe and phiale (no. C–17). In an amphorain Munich by the Waterkeyn Painter (no. C–23), she even stretches out herhand as if to take the proffered phiale from a female devotee. Astride a hurtlingpanther, Dionysos is greeted by a maenad with phiale and oinochoe in a fourth-century pelike in the British Museum (no. C–20). And the same god, “the onewith the black goatskin,” consistently extends his kantharos with great interestto someone who can fill it with wine from an oinochoe, as in the well-knownamphora by the Amasis Painter (no. C–21) in Munich, where the god is at-tended by young men.8These are not numerous, however, and they do not begin to aid us in ourefforts to interpret the vase-paintings of the years 510 to 450 B.C.E. This is be-cause far more frequently than receiving “a drink” of wine in a shallow bowl,the deity depicted in vases does the opposite. With a sacrificial assistant hover-ing nearby with the oinochoe that has been used to fill the bowl, the god or god-dess pours the wine out onto the ground or onto an altar. Lest there be anydoubt that the high gods are themselves performing libations rather than re-ceiving them, the Catalogue clearly shows in many examples that the wine as itrolls out is unmistakably depicted in added red—red as vigorous as that used toshow the leaping flames of the altar. These are not images of cult statues, butthose of real gods participating in vital cultic activity.It is to Burkert’s initial perplexity that we first turn our attention. Libation,“pouring out,” isquite a peculiar way of “giving”—a mercurial, strange form ofsacrifice. For unlike the case of animal sacrifice, from whose meat the Greeksmade splendid feasts for the whole community, the sacrificer could not recoverany of the substance offered. That seems to have been part of libation’s power.One surrendered something precious forever, in milk, honey, oil, or wine: “theprecious commodities of a society familiar with hearth and hunger were pouredaway irretrievably.”9One of the more famous libations in ancient history wasthe one made by the intrepid, manic Alexander in the late fourth century when,on his march through Asia, he poured a helmetful of scarce water into theGedrosian desert sands.10By “discarding” the liquid to the earth where it wouldbe lost, except to those powers for whom it was intended, the king underlinedhis faith in his mission and his arrogant freedom from human limitation. Healso revitalized the hope of his troops, showing that if they could not drink, nei-ther would he. This renunciatory aspect of libation points clearly to ritual’slarger function of transforming anxiety. As Burkert puts it, “what happens...is a concentration and shift of anxiety from reality to a symbolic sphere, andthis makes it possible to handle anxiety to some extent....Religious ritual, byproducing anxiety, manages to control it.”11Hans Dieter Betz comments on the question, “If at the beginning libationswere gift offerings, they were most likely understood as gifts to the deity in returnfor benefits received. By the seemingly wasteful giving up of some vital resources,libations constituted fundamental acts of recognition and gratitude as well as30ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"hope for future benefits. Thus they were part of the communication with thedivine sphere of life through the exchange of gifts. This may also explain whythe gods themselves are often shown offering libations.”12Frustrating is Betz’svagueness concerning how libation’s “communication” function explains whythe gods offer libations. And since the liquid disappears into the earth and can-not be visibly divinized, transformed, or redistributed, should libation even becalled “sacrifice” at all? The question is a challenge to historians of ritual, andalso highlights a thorny conundrum in two of the main scholarly languages inclassical studies: German and English. In German, the verb opfern(to sacrifice)and the noun Opfer(sacrifice) have their roots in the Latin operari, “to work”(hence, “to perform [religious service]; to worship”). This reflects an ancienttradition of using a more general verb as a euphemism for animal sacrifice,which was ritualized slaughter. That the Greeks used CAzein(to act) to mean“to sacrifice” is confirmed by Plutarch when he writes of the ancients that “be-ing frightened and alarmed, they use the terms ‘to accomplish’ (Grdein) and ‘toact’ (CAzein) when they are doing a great thing, namely live sacrifice (that is, thesacrifice of living things).”13Erika Simon entitled her 1953 study of gods who pour libations on AtticvasesOpfernde Götter(Sacrificing Gods). Martin Nilsson took strong exceptionto this, which he considered an imprecise and inappropriate extension of theGerman term Opfer.14Among other severe criticisms, he suggested that shechange the title to Spendende Götter(Libating Gods). However, Nilsson’s was alosing battle. The term Opferhas been (and will likely continue to be) used bymany German scholars in the same way that Paul Stengel did when he titledhis comprehensive Opferbräuche der Griechen—as a general term encompass-ing any kind of religious offering, including both animal and liquid votives aswell as that of cakes, boughs, and other gifts for the gods.15Thus, Krister Hanell’streatment of ancient Greek libations in the Real-Encyclopädie der klassischenAltertumwissenschaftis found under the general term “Trankopfer.”16Among English-speaking scholars, since it is more closely scrutinized andoften deconstructed, the general term “sacrifice” has been increasingly restrictedto the specific meaning of “animal sacrifice,” used exclusively to designate the rit-ual killing of animals, whether consumed or not. As a category, “liquid offerings”are excluded from the term “sacrifice,” the latter no longer being allowed to serveas an umbrella term for this sphere of religious action. But the discussion leavesopen certain fundamental questions about libation. As Jean Rudhardt asked oflibations, “in what sense are they sacrifices and what is their value or utility for thegods?”17Into what category of religious action does libation fall? Is it an offering?If so, how does it reach or even benefit its target? Are the gods who pour fromphialai really sacrificing gods? If so, for whom is their sacrifice intended?An Ancient RitualThe act of pouring or drinking a liquid offering is one of the oldest, most ubiq-uitous, and least understood forms of religious action in the world. The Iranianis libation sacrifice?31"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"cult of the consumed liquid of immortality, haoma,is very old, and predates thetraditional dates of Zoroaster, who, according to tradition, was at first vehe-mently opposed to it. That it became such a foundation of the cultic structureof Zoroastrianism attests to later, atavistic reforms that reappropriated the an-cient drink—and external sacrifice in general. The corresponding Vedic somais both a plant from which juice is pressed and mixed with water and milk tomake the elixir, and a deity (King Soma in the.Rgveda). Calvert Watkins hassuggested that there is a strong linguistic and thus, by inference, a religious tiebetween the Indo-Iranian usage of cereals in both martial and magical ritualtexts and the mixed potions of barley, honey, wine, and often cheese or milkprepared in Greek epic literature and archaic poetry.18These range from thedrink of wheat and wine that Andromache gives to Hektor’s horses,19toHekamede’s drink of hospitality filling Nestor’s famous cup and those of hisguests,20to the potion which Circe instructs Odysseus to prepare to summonthe dead.21These are all strangely reminiscent of the Eleusinian kykeondrinkof immortality first made up by Metaneira, at the behest of the grief-wrackedDemeter, out of water, fermented barley, and pennyroyal,22which some claimmay have contained a hallucinogenic pharmacologically related to the effectiveelement in Soma.23Babylonian and Assyrian texts seem to indicate a dual function for liba-tion. The king, as heaven’s regent on earth, was obligated to pour libations tothe gods, in propitiation or thanksgiving. However, libation was also used forpurification and magical purposes. This ancient Near Eastern function is re-flected in Egyptian magical papyri as late as the Hellenistic period.24That libation was a vital form of proto-Greek religious behavior, datingfrom as early as 2000 B.C.E., is attested by the numbers of elaborately carvedrhyta, libation vessels, from Minoan Crete. The shapes of those that areknown range from seashells to bull’s heads to beautifully polished conicalstone vessels with curved handles. Several of them, such as the Late MinoanI Peak Sanctuary Rhyton from Zakros (1550–1500 B.C.E.), have revealed im-portant religious information.25Wall paintings from the Palace at Knossosshow a rhyton bearer advancing in ceremonial procession, presumably to-ward the throne of king, queen, or goddess. Many seals and rings show sac-rificial scenes including libation pitchers set out with bread and fruit of-ferings.The initial temporal or functional separation that seems to have existed inthe Minoan period between drink offerings and animal sacrifice was later erad-icated. A combination of the two forms occurs as early as the importantfourteenth-century painted sarcophagus from Aghia Triadha in Crete with arare depiction of animal sacrifice, in which a procession of men and womencarry large buckets, while the priestess is shown pouring a container of liquidinto a large krater.26However, vestiges of this ritual separation remain in AsiaMinor up through the archaic period, notably at shrines of citadel goddesseswhose worship also preserved an older fertility cult, like that of Athena Lindiaat Rhodes.32ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Types of Libation in Ancient GreeceLibations, of wine pure or mixed, of honey, oil, milk, water, or blood itself cas-caded in and punctuated virtually every private prayer and every public sacrificein ancient Greece.27At least four technical names characterize drink offerings,with deployment depending on their composition and religious context—loibaA,xoaA,spondaA, and nhfalia. In the private sphere, libations were poured as partof every prayer. The term “libation” is derived from the Latinlibatio, “sacrificialoffering of drink,” which in turn is related to the Greek loiba.LeAbeinis an ar-chaic word at least as old as Homeric times meaning “to drip; to pour out dropby drop.”28Simple libation had three steps: one prepared the liquid; onepoured out a few drops of the liquid, usually accompanying the libation with aprayer;29then one drank what remained of the liquid. In the Homeric epics,sometimes a special cup is reserved for this purpose, such as Menelaos’s gift ofthe goblet to Telemachos “so you can pour libations to the immortals,”30andeven sometimes only for a special god, such as Achilles’s cup with which heonly poured to Zeus father.31Loibais a poetic word, virtually unused in in-scriptions, where it is replaced by sponda. But the union of this kind of liba-tion and spontaneous, often personal prayer remained throughout historicaltimes,32with perhaps its most poignant instance coming in the Phaedo117 B–C,where Socrates asks if he might pour a few drops of his poison (dpospePsai)as a libation to the gods before he drinks the whole draught; he is gently pre-vented by the prison official, who apologetically tells him that only just the doserequired to kill him has been prepared.The two more frequent words for libation, spondaAandxoaA, present achallenge for sacrificial typology. The dichotomized thinking of the earlier halfof the past century posited an Indo-European cult of “sky-gods,” to whom be-longed ritual spondaA, which merged during the Bronze Age with an oriental-Minoan matriarchal “earth cult,” featuring xoaAto form a later “synthesized”Greek religion. Contrary to this vision, the chthonian cult, and hence the liquidoffering poured into the ground, was extremely important in the Indo-Europe-an heritage. Possibly entering Greek culture from Anatolia during the BronzeAge (cf. the Hittite cognate ̆sipanti),spAndein-sponda, “libate”-“libation,” has aspecific range of meanings limited to the legal and sacral field; it appears inLatin as spondere.33The terms xAvandxoa, cognate with the Vedic h ̄utar,comefrom the Indo-European root *ˆgheu, “pour.” Whereas spAndeinis primarilya religious term, xePnhas a number of attested secular uses as a verb ofpouring.34In general, spondaAare assumed to be offerings to Olympian gods; xoaAto appease the deities of the underworld, or to summon the dead from theirgrim slumber.35SpondaAmoistened altars, whereas it was into the earth thatone poured xoaA, and the animate earth was said to drink them.36SpondaAwere often were poured out in short drops, with the remainder consumed en-tirely; xoaAwere poured out entirely, corresponding with holocaust sacrifices,is libation sacrifice?33"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"where the animal was slaughtered (undivided and uneaten by human beings),burnt whole, or thrown into the sea.37Usually, spAndeinimplies the pouring ofwine.38In the cult of the dead and of the xuanioi, so much in need of soothing,one frequently poured milk, honey, gruel, and oil; these were the main ingredi-ents in funerary cult and were called nhfalia.39In the private sphere, libations were closely associated with actions of hos-pitality, and with communal eating and drinking, all of these sacralized tosome extent. One poured libations to Zeus as a sign of hospitality to consecratea new friendship.40Drink offerings commenced a meal,41and as the meal wasending, one let a drop of unmixed wine fall to the Agathos Daimon(no. 15), thentook a small sip oneself.42At drinking-symposia, one sang a paean and pouredthree times to the gods: The first drink belonged to Olympian Zeus and the restof the Olympians, the second to the heroes, the third to Zeus Soter.43AncientGreek symposia were highly ceremonial gatherings in which almost all wine-drinking took place. They were a time-honored institution of the upper classes,as Herbert Hoffman writes in his recent monograph on the corpus of the clas-sical vase-painter Sotades, largely consisting of decorated drinking-vessels,phialai and rhyta.44Not only the participants drank: The gods and the dead wereritually included by pouring out libations for them. Thus drink offerings to thepowers above and below flowed into the drinking of the living, functionally unit-ing the multiple worlds of existence, just as drinking wine dissolves normal so-cial boundaries: “To the Greeks it was the most noble form of social activity, a tra-dition that combined the pouring of solemn libations (spondai) to the gods and tothe dead with manly fellowship, music, and other entertainment....Even fromearliest times, the table fellowship of the banquet, with the libations that werepoured, was aimed at establishing links between the living and the gods, as wellas with the heroes and the spirits of the dead.”45In both legendary and historical worlds, one poured libations before voy-aging or engaging in a perilous enterprise, as for example, a sea voyage.46Notraveler embarked on a journey (no. C–9)47and likewise no warrior departedfor battle (no. C–10 [Fig. 10], and C–11) without first pouring libations or havingthem poured by a friend on one’s behalf.48Beloved in vase-painting since thesixth century B.C.E., the theme of the departing warrior often took some inter-esting twists: The saddened wife who assists her husband’s libation is chroni-cally replaced by the goddess Nike herself, as in nos. 131 (Fig. 11)and132. It isnot only for a mortal departure that drink offerings are accomplished. In acommon tableau, the Eleusinian goddesses Demeter and Persephone pour forthe departing divine hero, Triptolemus, as he mounts his winged chariot on hismission to teach mortals the cultivation of grain.49In the public sphere, liba-tions accompanied by paeans expressed joy at victory or signified the reestab-lishment of peace.50Oaths were sealed with liquid offerings—in the case of thegods themselves, the waters of the Styx.51Contracts and peace treaties were socommonly concluded with libations, signifying a mutual entry into obligation,that such agreements came to be called, simply, spondaA.52Although they could be poured as autonomous offerings, “libations havetheir truly significant meaning for Greek cult as (an) accompaniment to other34ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"figure 10.Warrior in armor leaving home, extending his phiale to hiswife, who raises her veil and pours from an oinochoe.

That there were sacrifices without libations (gspondoi uysAai) isattested by the scholiast to Oedipus at Colonus100.55But sacrifices without li-bations are infrequent as a rule. To each type of sacrifice a particular form oflibation was attached, which was one of the cultic features that gave sacri-fice its special character.56Perhaps most important for this inquiry, libationswere performed at the beginning of what is often termed “Olympian” sacrifice,poured once during its progress onto the flames surrounding the cookingmeat, and once onto the remains to conclude the rite.

The phiale could be used for drinking; it appears in symposia scenes,including those of the gods themselves, such as the Kodros Painter’s red-figurestemmed cup with a reclining Pluton raising a phiale, accompanied by Perse-phone in the tondo (no. C–13; Fig. 13).58This usage, which as Heinz Luschey has emphasized, is particularly charac-teristic of the gods, the uppermost echelon of a striated society. Hoffman observesthat “Banqueting...was the pastime of the gods, who were thought of as en-gaged in an eternal symposium on Mount Olympus.”59At their symposia, theimages show us, the gods drank from phialai.The role of the hand-held phiale in the human realm is charged with nu-minosity; it is first a libation bowl, a drinking bowl for gods, and only second-arily a vessel for humans. It is this bowl from which the gods are always showndrinking. And it is this bowl from which they are almost always shown libating,except for those scenes depicting Dionysos and certain divine figures withchthonian aspects such as the hero Herakles, who all prefer the wine-god’s em-blematic kantharos.60Luschey has argued on the strength of this evidence thatthe phiale has a sacramental character and is sacred to the gods; it “belongs” tothem and not to mortals.61By extension this would imply that every sympo-sium on earth replicates a divine symposium held by the gods.Arguing from the antiquity and efficacy of the ritual complex of drinkingand libations at symposia, and from the mirroring image of the celestialbanquet—the “metasymposium” of those who never have to return to quotidienlives—Hoffman has proposed an intriguing solution to the statistical frequencyof ancient Greek vases in tombs and in sanctuaries: “The reason for the extraor-dinary importance attached to pottery vessels as temple and funerary offeringshas to do with banqueting. . . drinking vessels were conceived by the Greeksto possess the same magical power to establish a link with gods and heroes forthe benefit of the buried dead as they did for the benefit of the living in their ownritual observances on earth.”62In other words, if Hoffman is right, the gods andthe dead received from human devotees votive drinking vessels—charged ob-jects that were special to them—at their special places; the whole ancient Greekcosmos was in some sense a great drinking party, and the vases we now prize,and whose aesthetic values and purpose we continually debate—represented aneffort to keep the wine flowing between its various existential constituencies.Some have universalized the “banqueting” interpretation to other, far moreambiguous scenes where the gods hold phialai. Paradigmatic of this approachare the observations of John Kroll on the archaic black-figure kalpis on the Ro-man art market in the early part of this century, mentioned in the Introduction(no. 7).

On the other hand, whethershe extends her phiale to receive a drink or to pour one is far from certain. Manyof the vases in the catalogue presented here show Greek gods seated exactly asAthena is; and out of many of their extended phialai spill wine libations.Although not exclusively a sacrificial utensil, but rather an élite drinkingvessel, the phiale was primarily and almost exclusively used in libations.64Thebowl was an evolved form of libation vessel, different from other drinking ves-sels such as the stemmed cup and skyphos. It was flat and shallow, with no lip,no handle, and no foot. It had a raised boss in the center (omphalos), so that onecould grasp it from below for pouring (see, for example, the pottery example bySotades,no. P–6; Fig. 16).65In the more delicate of the vase-paintings, we canobserve how both mortals and gods held the bowl, with thumb on the edge andmiddle finger underneath at the center (see no.

The wine was poured into the phiale from another sacrificialvessel, a wine jug called an oinochoe. The phiale and oinochoe became aniconographic formula repeated endlessly in classical vase-paintings. They wereeither wielded together by one individual, as in the scene on a late archaicstemmed cup by Douris of a youth making an offering at an altar using bothvessels (no. C–4), or else the wine was poured into the phiale of the sacrificerby an attendant or another participant, as in the red-figure amphora in Bostonwhere a woman and a man offer libations at a blood-stained altar (no. C–5).66This familiar mortal tableau, then, is the model for the scene we observe in theBerlin Painter vase now in Rome (no. 29; Figs. 2 and 3), where the winged fig-ure Iris (or Nike) holds the oinochoe for the god Apollo, who is in the processof pouring a libation at the wreathed altar. But the mortal scene has been trans-figured: The gods are doing the pouring.Why are the Greek gods represented in Attic art holding phialai in theirhands from the early to the mid-classical period? At least one suggestion has todo with the image of the Orient, the home of the vessel, in the ancient Greek so-cial mind. The phiale came to Greece as early as the ninth century B.C.E. fromAsia Minor and the Near East, where fine examples in precious metals havebeen found such as the bronze examples from excavations at ancient Sam’al (no.P–2) and Karkemish (no. P–3).67In the great lion-hunt relief from the NorthPalace at Nineveh, the Assyrian king stands before an offering-table; he pours acascading libation from a phiale over his dead prey, heaped up in leonine splen-dor (no. P–1; Fig. 17).

Hoffman stronglysuggests that the phialai dedicated in Greek temples, conforming as they did tothe daric standard, were Persian: spoils of war (aristeia: “rewards of valor”), gifts,bribes.68Following Luschey, he notes the vessel’s lineage: “The shape was intro-duced to Greece from Persia, where gold and silver phialai were used for ritualdrinking and where such objects were traditionally presented by the Great Kingas royal gifts to faithful vassals and to ambassadors from foreign states.”69Phialai in their fundamental ancient Near Eastern form were ideally ren-dered in metal, and many phialai in precious metal are mentioned as votiveofferings in sanctuary inventories, including the treasuries of the AthenianAcropolis. Dietrich von Bothmer contends, “The function of the phiale madeit a vase of and for the gods, and almost demanded that it be made of noblemetal.”70Most extant metal phialai are silver; very few gold bowls survive. TheMuseum of Fine Arts in Boston owns a rare and beautiful example from thesite of the original Olympic games, dating from the late seventh century B.C.E.(no. P–4).71Chapter 3 presents evidence suggesting that the libation bowlsheld by the gods in our vase-paintings were, in the artists’ imaginations, gold:the superimposed painting of metallic lobes, for example, or embossing.72Most of the surviving classical Attic phialai are not metal at all however,but terracotta, as is the signed example by Sotades (no. P–6; Fig. 16)in Athensor the ivy-leaf decorated phiale from the Kanellopoulos Collection in Athens(no. P–7). In addition to images of precious metal phialai on red-figured clayvessels, there is also the highly complex art historical problem of whetherthe clay pots themselves substitute for golden phialai in votive contexts, andif so, why.is libation sacrifice?41figure 17.The Assyrian king, standing before an offering table, pours awine libation from a phiale over dead lions.

An initial survey of the icono-graphic evidence seems to point to the probability that the Olympians are prac-ticing their own version of Olympian cult. What arguments support thishypothesis? The first is the presence of altars, often with built fires and theblood stains of habitual cultic use, in almost a third of the catalogue entries (71out of 247). Together with the ubiquitous oinochoe and phiale, the altar is anindispensable element at the highly orchestrated uysAa. But this did not stop ascholar of the stature of Walter Otto from asserting that all of the libationspoured by the gods, even onto altars, were ultimately intended for the primor-dial earth, their ancestress Gaia.The second argument for Olympian sacrifice by the gods is the fact thatwhen the liquid offering is visible in the vase-paintings, which, as mentionedearlier, it often is, the divine libations are almost certainly all offerings of wine.A bold crimson stream, added in red by the pot painter, falls from the lip of thelibation bowl. The liquid offering par excellence of blood sacrifice was wine; inOlympian cult, milk, honey, and oil were almost completely obscured except asingredients to bind the crushed grain for sacrificial cakes. However, the liba-tions of xoaA(for the dead) and those which were part of sfaga(the ritualslaughter of an animal for the underworld powers) employed not only propitia-tory or nourishing liquids such as milk or honey, or purifying liquids such asthe water that Oedipus must pour as a kauarmaßfor his trespass in the groveof the Furies, “daughters of earth and darkness.”73Wine was also used in suchsacrifices. According to Lucian, wine for the dead was unmixed74—as it was insfaga75—perhaps because, in its purer potency, the dark, crimson flood was ahomologue for the blood of the victim as it rolled below.76As a rule, the wineused in uysAawas mixed with water, a consecrated drink-offering reflectingquotidian ancient Greek drink.SpondaAhave a fixed place in animal sacrifice (uysAa, literally, smoke), ap-pearing at the very outset and in ritual repetition thereafter. Aristophanes’Peaceshows how the cry sponde, sponde!inaugurated the sacrificial action.77Wine was poured onto the meat as it was roasted on the altar’s flames. Liba-tions also concluded the sacrificial meal, as Euripides reveals in Ion,whenwine was poured over the flaming remains.78“Thus the sacrificer with the liba-tion bowl in his hand above the flaming altar became a favorite iconographicalmotif.”79Vase-paintings do indeed show people (and gods) in the process ofpouring a cup on a piece of meat burning in flames on or above the altar—asin, for example, no.

C–27): a basket filled with grain (kanoPn)which hid the knife (maxaira), a water-jug, and an oinochoe for wine liba-tions.84An incense burner, called a thymiaterion, was also often carried in theprocession, set up and lit to fill the atmosphere with scent.85The destination ofthe pompawas the altar, already stained with blood from previous sacrifices—as we so often see it in our vases (see, for a gory example, no. C–32, a cult sceneof Apollo on a bell-krater by the Hephaistos Painter in Frankfurt).86A large re-ceptacle (sfagei∆on) was set before the altar to collect the blood, and the table(trapeza) for the division of the animal’s body.As is the case with simple depictions of libations, vase-paintings oftenimagine the cult image of the deity, with or without hierophant, receiving theprocession for an animal sacrifice. Examples are Athena Promachos on anarchaic black-figure cup (no. C–29) and on a belly-amphora in the PergamonMuseum in Berlin (no. C–30) or the Dionysiac herm on the oinochoe (no.C–31) in the same collection. Musicians accompanied the procession; all wasfestivity. “Nothing here suggests the coming death of the animal which is cen-tral to the ritual act”87; except, perhaps the great ropes that visibly restrain largeanimals as they were led in procession on the vases. Durand and Schnapp ex-tend Burkert’s nation of ritual as controlled anxiety further: Sacrifice euphem-izes, marginalizes, and even suppresses the anxiety—producing the violencethat is at its core. “The human order, etc. . . .” “The human order guaranteedand required by the gods is thus established, around a dangerous act whichcontains within it the seeds of a violence that could destroy that very order. Thisviolence, then, must be kept at a distance to prevent it from contaminating orinsinuating its way into the ritual procedure. The act of sacrificial killing istreated with discretion, being omitted, for example, from the depictions of theritual.”88The priest washed his hands in the water of a lustral basin (xArnic). It isthis moment that is captured in a krater in Boston in the manner of theKleophon Painter, dating from around 440 B.C.E.(no. C–28).

At thedeath-blow, the women screamed, which in Seven against ThebesAeschylus calls“the Greek custom of the sacrificial scream.”93The animal’s throat was swiftlycut, and, as was the case in ancient Israel, the altar was splashed with the bloodof the animal (aCmassein toBß bvmoAß) caught in the bowl. This ritually manip-ulated blood is often emphatically depicted in vases with added red, in manycases also apparently splattered by the artist onto the vase-picture of the altar,rather than carefully painted, in order to reproduce the effect in lived cultic ar-chitecture.94The animal victim was carved up on the trapeza.

The remainder of the meat were spit-ted and wrapped in bundles, and seared in the flame; prayers to the gods weremade and at this point, libations poured upon the altar, as in Odyssey3.459–460:“The old man burned these on cleft sticks, and poured the gleaming wine over”96(seenos. C–8,C–33,andC–35). “As the alcohol causes the flames to flare up, ahigher reality seems present. Then, as the fire dies down, the pleasing feast grad-ually gives way to everyday life.”97The body was spread out on the same table, which was used in the seconddivision of the meat.98The rest of the meat was cut into portions and boiled;“[t]he pictures show cooking, but never eating, since nourishment itself is not themain point.”99Often, everything must be eaten on the spot (oDfora); but themeat was sometimes brought to table and threaded on spits, whereupon it wascarried away to be eaten outside the sacred zone.100The same rite took place atthe end of the sacrificial meal—one detached the tongues of the victims, threwthem on the fire, then proceeded to pour the prepared wine onto the flames.101Then one drank the wine.102Intelligible on one level, then, is the late classical bell-krater at the Louvrein which Hermes, bearing a garlanded caduceus, festal wreaths, and a deco-rated phiale, leads a ram to sacrifice at a small altar (no.

The ceremony of makingsolid offerings at cremation (DnagAzein) and liquid offerings after burial (xePn)were often confused; Hesychios’s definition of DnagAzeinincludes the pouringofxoaA. And cathartic xoaAof pure water, called loytra,109are encompassedas part of the more general verb DfagnAzein—“to make offerings on a grave.”110Such libations clearly have a purificatory function; but they are intended for thedead to achieve purity (cgneAa), not the living who pour them. The Greeksspoke of all kinds of libations as the “bath of the dead”; they both functionallyand symbolically repeat the bath of the corpse, as is implied in the Oedipus atColonus.111Apart from catharsis, a primary role of xoaAis alimentary. The libationsare a necessity for the dead—they literally feed on them, according to Lucian:trAfontai taPß xoaPß(they are nourished by the libations).112The pAlanoß,a kind of gruel of grain, honey, and oil, could be offered to both the dead andto the gods. It is the pAlanoßthat Electra brings to her dead father in LibationBearers92.113Poured out with a prayer, it offers a bond between living anddead; in pouring it from the realm of light and air, the living both feed and de-mand the protection of those who lie below. Attic graves and monuments wereequipped with a number of contraptions to facilitate libations.114Beyond their alimentary role, xoaAwere apotropaic. When they weremade up of soothing liquids such as honey or milk, libations could appeasevolatile and dangerous powers of the netherworlds (the meilAgmataofEu-menides107). Such xoaAcan exorcise the evil brought by a vexatious presence,such as a nightmare or the apparition of the dead person for whom one poursthe libation.115Within the realm of xoaA, beyond those ordinary liquid offerings whichseek to bathe, feed, calm, or distance the dead, there is also a special groupwhose purpose is necromancy. These are libations that counterintuitively seekto attract the dead—to reinterest them in the world above, and to summonthem back into communication with the living.116Mighty examples are thelibation prepared by Queen Atossa to raise the dead Darius in Aeschylus’sPersians609–618, of milk, honey, oil, and wine,117and the Chorus’s plea madedirectly to the ghost of Agamemnon in Libation Bearers150–163 both in con-junction with and in condemnation of the atrocious funerary libations offeredby Clytaemnestra.Various spoken or sung rituals accompany libations to the dead. Atossa offers“chants and threnodies” as she makes her offering (Persians619–620). In LibationBearers22–23, the chorus comes “sent forth from the palace...to convey liba-tions to the accompaniment of blows dealt swift and sharp by my hands”;118songsof vengeance will follow at the tomb of Agamemnon (Libation Bearers158–164).is libation sacrifice?47"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Even Electra wonders what to pray when performing the rites prescribed byClytaemnestra for her dead husband; libations are offered with legamena.119What was the function of xoaA, and what were they intended to achieve?Betz notes of “the more magically oriented libations for the dead, of which wepossess literary accounts” that “their specific role and function, despite ancientattempts at explanation, remain somewhat ambiguous.”120InOdyssey11.34–50,the blood of the sheep slaughtered by Odysseus enables the “strengthless dead”to speak; they are otherwise mute. But the ritual logic of the blood of victimssacrificed on behalf of the dead, such as that of the twelve Trojan captives slainby Achilles on the bier of Patroklos (Iliad23.23–24),121is difficult to determine,that is, what did such sacrifice do for the dead? Did such blood bathe or norishthem as did water or milk? The answer again seems to lie in the potency of de-struction, of loss that cannot be recouped. Spilled blood is a good offering forthe dead because like them it is poured out, never to return.The utter irretrievability of libations to the dead seems structurally tied tothe nature of funerary customs of destruction.122In prehistoric warrior burialsin the Central Asian steppes and Asia Minor, we find destruction and burningof the dead one’s possessions, almost as a way of uniting him irretrievably withthe next world.123At Marathon, the tholos grave of a king or warrior datingfrom the fourteenth century B.C.E. features the symmetrically opposed skele-tons of two horses placed at the mouth of the dromos; they were sacrificed withhim when he died.124Similarly, libations are completely lost—“destroyed,” as itwere—as they soak into the ground.Is it conceivable that the Olympian gods on our vases are pouring libationsto the dead or to the earth? It is true that ancient Greek religious practices as-sociated with sky and earth, respectively, seem divorced from, rather than mar-ried to, one another. This was true even in the dichotomy between the sacrifi-cial blood of the holocaust animal, which was allowed to drain down, and thatof the Olympian victim, which gushed up toward the sky and onto the raised al-tar. However, symbiosis between remote Olympian gods of the sky and hero-ized ancestors occurred at sanctuaries throughout Greece; some well-knownexamples are the worship of Athena and Erechtheus on the Acropolis, or thatof Zeus and Pelops at Olympia.125In fact, although the shining splendor ofthe Olympian realm depends on its very remoteness from death, the eternalityof death strangely mirrors the eternality of the gods: Neither the dead nor thegods can ever change.126Depending on the interior logic of both ancient Greek myth and practicedcult insofar as we understand them, we would have to ask to whom or on whosebehalf would the Olympian gods pour xoaA? The ascendant generation of Greekgods, consisting of Zeus, his siblings, and offspring, gained power dibkra-terbßyÛsmAnaß(in cruel battles)127by overthrowing a previous divine genera-tion, that of the voracious patriarch Kronos and the race of Titans, children ofOuranos and Gaia (Theogony453–885).

Unlike theNorse Ragnarök, Greek mythology does not anticipate a time when the primor-dial forces—even those of Chaos, who first came into being (Theogony116)—willburst their fetters and destroy the divine order. Nevertheless, in Vedic mythicliterature, this is exactly the scenario. Sacrifices are performed by the currentgeneration of gods for the Sa ̄dhyas, an ancestral generation of gods who haveretreated from the universal playing field.GaPa, the Earth herself, is also a likely recipient for the gods’ libations, if arecipient there must be (and this is a very important “if ”). For she is ances-tress of all generations of the gods, both old and new. Who really receivedxoaA? That the earth was thought to drink them is indisputable. We know thisfromLibation Bearers,where the libation is twice called gapotoß, “to be drunkby the earth,” in 97 and 164; the phrase is repeated in Persians621. That theofferings were thought actually to reach the dead is also clear, as Electra’swords reveal: GxeAmengdh gapatoyß xoa¡ ß patar(my father has by now re-ceived the libations) (Libation Bearers164). In Persians219–220, the choruseven distinguishes them as two separate recipients: “Next thou must libationspour to Earth and dead.”128Jean Rudhardt notes, “The earth receives them [li-bations] in a manner so evident that sometimes one expresses oneself asthough they were destined for it.”129Chthonian offerings were utterly boundto the realm of the earth and the symbolic movement downward into theground that is their telos.The Identification of the Drink-Offering with the GodWe asked at the outset why the Greek gods are so often represented in the act ofpouring libations rather than performing some other ritual, and whether therewas some special relationship between the god who receives libations, the godwho pours them out, and the poured-out liquid itself. Throughout the historyof libation pouring in the ancient world, intimations of the liquid offering as aconveyer of divine identity continually surface. This has not been the case withanimal sacrifice.The correlation of ancient Greek libation with the “pouring out” of humanidentity—that acquired during a lifetime—is made by Burkert, who perceives thedying Oedipus’s prescribed libation to the Eumenides at the grove at Colonus(Oedipus at Colonus461–492) as an augury of and parallel to the king’s final exit,uniquely symbolic of his passage from life to death.130As he is to empty out therequired vessels of their pure water and honey into the earth, so, according toBurkert, the ritual anticipates Oedipus’s mysterious death, where he will be liter-ally “swallowed up by the earth,” like a libation. Ismene and Antigone are told bythe messenger that their father’s body, like a draught for the dead, is unrecover-able:dll›gtißDkuepn pompbßgtbnertArvn eG noyn diastbngpßdlAphtonbaurov (either it was some messenger of the gods or else the painless base of theis libation sacrifice?49"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"infernal earth opened itself by separating).131Oedipus’s body, and thus hiscontinued identity on earth, is gone for good; his daughters may perform nofunerary cult for him. “The act of ‘pouring’ is a paradigm of the state of non-reversal.”132The argument that can be made against Burkert’s thesis is the fact that itis not Oedipus at all but his daughters who must carry out the initial libationfor him, as he is too old and weak. Furthermore, even they do not accomplishthe ritual, since they are captured and held by the evil Creon. Whether or notBurkert’s analysis is valid, the concept of the libation as a religious conveyer ofidentity is far older than the Greeks. Not only was the ceremony integral to an-cient Indo-European religious ritual; “that which is poured out” also seems tohave been strongly associated with divine power itself. This is most striking inthe relationship of the various verbs for pouring.133The Vedic sacerdotal titlefor an important priest was hotar(hotr), which in the Avesta was zaotar.134Bothof these are derived from the Sanskrit verb h ̄utar, meaning “to pour a sacrificialoffering.” Calvert Watkins suggests that the English word “god” comes from thesame stem; he proposes the following etymology: h ̄utargives us the participlehutáh.(the god Agni, for example, is often called a ̄¬-huta-, “the libated one”).135The corresponding Greek verb xePnhas the verbal adjective xytaß;the “libationroot” is observable in proto-Germanic languages in forms such as the Gothicgiutan,finally becoming the German “Gott” and the English “god.” Thus, ratherthan only meaning “the one to whom offerings are made,” the word “god” mayalso mean “the one who is poured out as a libation.”136Controversial Hittite texts apparently speak of pouring the libation winethat isthe god from a large vessel into a drinking cup. An example of this is aKumarbi text, KUB 10.69.4.2–3: “The king [and] queen, seated, drink Simesu(a Hittite god).” In an effort to avoid Eucharistic connotations, this verb has of-ten been rendered as “gives to drink.” For example, H. Craig Melchert supportsthe view of Jaan Puhvel that the verb should be translated “drink to the honorof,” based on the argument that the verb ̆sipant-, “to libate” takes either the da-tive or the accusative, and that the verb “to drink” (eku-) should be translatedsimilarly.137However, Harry E. Hoffner, professor emeritus of the Oriental In-stitute at the University of Chicago, notes that these phrases alternate with “hedrinks the cup of God X,” which, according to Hoffner, “shows that the cupfulof beverage actually represented the god.”138And according to the late HansGüterbock, a phrase such as “they drink the god” means “that the liquid, pre-sumably wine, is the god, and [a] passage which says ‘they pour him into thecups’ seems to clinch this.”139Where the ancient identification of liquid with deity cannot be disputed—because it is unequivocally stated—is in the case of the wine-god Dionysos. InEuripides’ Bacchae,Teiresias says of his divine lord, oQtoß ueoPsi spAndetaiuebß gegaß,este dibtoPton tdgau›dnurapoyßGxein(he is poured out tothe gods, being a god himself, so that through this [action], good may be the lotof human beings).140E. R. Dodds comments on these lines, “He, being god, ispoured out in offering to the gods, so that to him men owe all their blessings(because the libation of wine was part of a prayer).

The vase-paintings of libation arein a sense generic ritual scenes just as libation itself is in a sense a generic rit-ual, not especially associated with any one type of petition, ceremony, or sacri-fice, but performed as an integral part of all ceremonies in which human be-ings interacted with the other world.Not all ancient Greek gods received honey-cakes or slaughtered animals; notall received their sacrifices by day, by night, on a bvmaßor on an Dsxara. But li-bation is also the generic offering of ancient Greek religion—all gods received li-bations. Furthermore, it was common for libations to be addressed not so muchto one particular god as to all of the gods, as in the Odyssey’s tale of the Phai-akians’ send-off of the wanderer Odysseus: oCdBueoPsinGspeisan makaressi,toBoDranbneDrBnGxoysin(they poured a libation to all the blessed immortalgods who hold wide heaven).146The scholiast to Iliad9.158 says that only Hades,whom Achilles calls “among all the gods the most hateful to mortals,” receivesneither libations nor sacrifices.Libation is often dismissed as a simple ceremony whose only ritual role isas a mark of deference to supernatural powers. However, legend indicates thatthe ritual had more efficacy. Serving an apotropaic role, libations could be a re-sponse to bad omens and to the “green fear” that ensues, as in the tremblingAchaeans’ response to the thunder of Zeus in Iliad7.480–481: “They spilledthe wine on the ground from their cups, and none was so hardy as to drink, tillhe had poured to the all-powerful son of Kronos.” Drink offerings from gobletshighlight the sacrifice made by Chryses to Apollo to alleviate the plague in Iliad1.462–474. “Libations and savour” seem to have a peculiarly persuasive powerover the gods, and can even weaken their Olympian resolve. In Iliad9.497–501,the aged Phoinix, begging Achilles to recover from his dangerous sulk, tells usthat even “the very immortals can be moved; their virtue and honour andstrength are greater than ours are, and yet with sacrifices and offerings for en-dearment, with libations and with savour men turn back even the immortals insupplication, when any man does wrong and transgresses.”147The singling out of “libations and savour” resonates in Iliad9.500 with thestatement of Zeus in Iliad4.49. These are the aspects of sacrifice, drink andsmoke offerings, which are specifically consecrated to the gods, and which, ifwe are to believe Zeus, they especially like. Indeed, drink offerings and animalsacrifice are often mentioned in tandem, as if of equal value, in great festivalofferings.148In his ode in honor of Aristagoras of Tenedos, Pindar celebratesthe devotion to Hestia of the people of Tenedos pollbmBn loibaPsindgaza-menoi pratan uepn,pollbdBknAs÷a(honoring you [Hestia] with libations asfirst among gods, and with much sacrifice).149To recapitulate, the act of libation, and the very liquid poured out in its per-formance, were special to the gods. Libation was a ubiquitous ritual in ancientGreece, associated with every form of sacrifice and appropriate for every kindof ceremonial transition. Libation had its own vessel, the phiale, which was52ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"also singled out in art as the special cup of the gods. As we have seen, ancientIndo-European religion may even have identified the liquid poured out with di-vinity itself, an idea preserved at least in the case of the wine of Dionysos throughthe fifth century B.C.E. and beyond, perhaps expressed in the consumed wine ofthe Christian Eucharist, where the wine becomes the blood of Christ and by ex-tension, of God himself.Ironically, this universal quality of the ritual may be part of the reason whyit has been so hard convincingly to decode the scenes of sacrificing gods, to of-fer an iconology rather than just a description of iconography. When the godspour libations on vases, the search for “invisible recipients” of the divine drinkofferings may be a distraction. Libation is, to use Pfisterer-Haas’s phrase, “par-adigmatic and exemplary” of the rituals that are consecrated to all the gods.However, libation is by no means the only ritual the gods perform in late archaicand classical vase-painting. As will be dismissed later, other, unique scenes ofparticular gods engaged to varying degrees in particular ritual actions—in fact,actions that are specific to their own individual cults—belong, I believe, in thesame “force field” as the original vases of divine libations.Is Libation Sacrifice?Let us return to our original question. Can we speak of the Greek gods whopour libations in fifth-century Attic vase-paintings as “sacrificing gods”? Whatkind of a ritual is libation? Is it sacrifice, which is defined as “primarily, theslaughter of an animal as an offering to God or a deity”?150This is certainly notthe case; in libation, nothing is killed.151Does libation even carry the implied,secondary meaning of sacrifice, namely, “the surrender to God or to a deity, forthe purpose of propitiation or homage, of some object of possession”?152It isparticularly tricky to imagine an accurate taxonomy for the ritual of libation. Itis debatable to whom libation is surrendered, and for what purpose.Two modern scholars have offered highly divergent theories on exactlywhat it is that libation accomplishes. In one of his more daring forays intosociobiology, Burkert suggests that libation is a kind of reinforcement of iden-tity in sacred topography, whose chief purpose is not to “give” something to thegods at all, but to make a “mark” that the worshiper has been there, at a certainplace. In considering the frequent nature of libation, he reiterates the conserva-tive nature of ritual, which “seems to bear rather a high survival value for thepious community.”153Along these lines he writes, “ ‘Ritual’ is something atavis-tic, compulsive, nonsensical, at best circumstantial and superfluous, but at thesame time something sacred and mysterious.”154The actions of ritual, thosethings that Plutarch and Pausanias call dramena(things that are done),155in-volve, according to Burkert, a strong similarity to ritual behavior in biology—namely, a “stereotyped pattern of action, independent of the actual situationand emotion; repetition and exaggeration, theatrical effect; and the function ofcommunication.”156Stressing the communicative function of libations, Burk-ert notes that libation produces a result; there is a solidarity among those whois libation sacrifice?53"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"drink as among those who eat together. For that reason, it is a ceremony closelyassociated with hospitality, alliances, peace treaties, departures, and separation.In other words, libation is deeply conservative in that it stands against anythingthat threatens to dissolve a valued bond of community.Burkert maintains that “once we adopt the biological perspective, we can-not overlook the fact that marking a territory by pouring out liquids is a ‘ritual’behavior quite common in mammals, especially predators; we are all familiarwith the dog’s behavior at the stone.”157Although he concedes that “to connectthis with libation seems to be an outrageous joke,” he also claims that some as-pects of twentieth-century folk “ritual behavior” at frontiers or boundary stonesare quite similar to what the dog does, namely, “the marking of ‘familiar, con-spicuous objects’ and ‘novel objects’—functioning “to maintain the animals’ fa-miliarity with its environment.”158That is, pouring out liquids from metallicor clay vases into the ground or onto altars to douse sacrificial flames is gener-ically related to the marking of stones and objects by dogs on their rounds. Pre-sumably, then, libation is a way of reinforcing the status quo of the relationshipbetween human community and sacred territory. Hence, “the similarity to li-bation ceremonies, from Hattusa to Delphi, seems to be more than super-ficial.”159Many objections might be raised to this potentially specious approach, notthe least of which is the fact that male dogs, when involved in territorial mark-ing, do not urinate on the ground; they urinate on bushes, trees, and stones.Burkert’s analysis, while it might seem to hold for spondaA, eclipses an entirecategory of ancient Greek libations which are every bit as central as libationsonto altars and herms, namely earth-bound xoaA. Burkert’s reference to biolog-ical comparanda seems to offer very little understanding of the solemn and ex-tremely diverse nature of libations. As we have seen, liquid offerings accom-plish many functions, some of which have very little to do with territory. Forexample, Burkert says that even funerary libations make marks at the tomb ofthe deceased, which, he maintains, is “a signal communicating that the familyof the dead person is still alive and flourishing.”160This can hardly be the pri-mary motive for grave libations, which are clearly meant as gifts for the de-ceased; white-ground lekythoi show family members, oinochoe in hand, ap-proaching the deceased who waits sorrowfully, seated at his or her tomb. But aswe have also seen, Burkert is particularly troubled about how the gods get anyof the liquid of libation. By reducing the ritual to a simple ceremonial mark ofrespect (that actually camouflages its even simpler role as a mark just made forthe sake of marking), Burkert resolves one of his more profound problemswith Greek cult in general: “There is no direct correlation with beliefs; wine forthe Olympian gods is poured onto the ground.”161Jean Rudhardt takes a very different view of this problematic religious act.He accounts for the interjection of libation in so many rituals by seeing the dropsof liquid dedicated to the divine powers as a kind of numinous catalyst that“mobilize[s] the religious force that operates the subsequent rites.”162For Rud-hardt, this activation of power is central to the sacral action of libation. Free ofthe literalistic concerns of Burkert about how the gods get the liquid, Rudhardt54ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"concedes that a poured libation does not constitute an actual gift for them. Infact, he asserts:Nothing indicates that the poured liquid is offered to the divinities;not only is it the case that the texts mention libations, ignoring theirdestined recipients in silence (Il.2, 341; 4, 159; Soph. El.270;Aristoph.Wasps,1216–17; Xen. Hell.4.7.4; 7.4.36, etc.) but oneshould note above all that the texts which are the most precise, distin-guishing between libation in the narrow sense of the word, the act ofpouring the liquid and the prayer which is associated with it, renderthe gods as auditors of the prayer but do not portray them as directlyinterested in the poured liquid (Xen. An.4.3.13–14;Cyr.4.1.6–7;Thrasymachus fr. 4 Muller).163Rudhardt finds, however, that the ritual has another role: “the dispersal ofliquid establishes a specific rapport between the divine world and that of hu-mans, and creates a situation favorable to the efficacy of prayer.”164He also sug-gests that when a part of the liquid is poured out in spondaA, the remainder ofthe contents of the vessel is also consecrated. Thus drinking the remainder of thewine unites the devotee to the divine forces evoked by the absorption of the liq-uid, and ensures his protection by them.165In Rudhardt’s view, an anthropomorphic relationship with the gods issuperimposed over this basic mechanism of activated power. Libation is aperquisite of the gods, as much as the smoke of the sacrifice. This is a way, asone invokes the gods, of interesting them in “the poured-out liquid” as in an of-fering.166Thus libation is associated with other rites to which one accords effi-cacy and prayer. “Libation plays a role favorable to the events which it inaugu-rates.”167Rudhardt’s interpretation takes Greek religion far more on its own termsthan does Burkert’s. But it contains a perfect internal contradiction. Becausethe recipients of libation are sometimes not mentioned as it is performed, it isRudhardt’s belief that the gods are interested in the prayers made to themrather than the liquid that is simultaneously poured out. The liquid is a kindof magical conveyer of power, a catalyst that ensures that the ritual will “work”and the prayer will be heard. However, one then has to contend with Iliad4.48–49,Nemean Ode11.6, and other passages that stress that libations areindeed treasured by the gods—not to mention some of our vase-paintings thatshow the gods happily stretching out phialai to receive them! In Rudhardt’sproposed framework, this can be dismissed as “an anthropomorphic overlay”of meaning.Literary, inscriptional, and iconographic evidence tell us that libation func-tioned independently of animal sacrifice; the ritual established boundaries,sealed oaths and treaties (especially treaties of peace), bathed, nourished, andsummoned the dead and propitiated the powers of the underworld. No warriorwould leave for battle without first offering a libation to the gods. But neitherwould any sacrifice be undertaken without first bringing the wine jug in solemnprocession to the altar. In classical Greek religion, the two types of ritual, theis libation sacrifice?55"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"pouring of liquid and the slaughter of animals, were structurally intermingled.Wine was poured on the altar, inaugurating the sacrifice, and doused the flamesat its conclusion.Libation may indeed be a marker of crucial limits, a supernatural mediumthat attracts the gods and the dead, fueling the efficacy of all rites. It is perhapsthe remnant of an earth-oriented Indo-European offering ritual that began aspure ancestor worship. The argument against libation as sacrificeis that it ispurely a sign of reverence, and not an actual gift. However, what else wouldit be? We can easily imagine how the Eumenides might receive water at theirgrove in Colonus, or Demeter Chthonia receive oil in the soil at Phigalia.168Theproblem in our limited imagination arises purely in the case of the Olympiangods. We cannot imagine that the Olympian gods were thought of as receivingthe wine of sacrifice directly, except in those numinous vase-paintings wherethey hold out their bowls; but “in reality” libations are “lost” in the altar-flamesor in the earth. But this is perhaps too literal-minded, and religion, while oftenconcrete, is seldom literal. Neither do the high gods receive the meat that iscooked on their altars, and yet they miss it mightily if it is absent. Zeus’s wordsare clear enough: The libation and the savor are not only part of animal sacri-fice but they are also the special part that belongs to the gods who live on high,their “fair portion of honour.” Ancient Greek libation of any sort is performednot in a vacuum but for the sake of divine powers, to importune or appeasethem. Libation, when poured, belongs to the gods. It thusshould be consideredas part of the larger sphere of ancient Greek religious action of sacrifice. Itwould be easier to interpret the vases if we did not classify libation as “a pos-session surrendered to a deity,” since deities are represented as doing the sur-rendering. But the paradox of gods who pour out libations cannot be so easilyresolved.56ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"2Iconographic EvidenceLet us return to the characteristically noble vision of the Berlin Painteras it is expressed in the vase in Boston (no. 29; Figs. 2, 3).1MFA1978.45 stands (max.) 40.2 cm in height, its kalpis shape bringing tothe hydria form a lower, fuller appearance. It has three handles, twosymmetrically placed on the shoulder and one connecting neck toshoulder. Below the symmetrical handles appear exuberant horizon-tal palmettes caught up in spirals with two lotus buds. In vogue forseveral decades during the subarchaic period of vase-painting, theshape probably has its genesis in bronze vessels.The entire decorative field of the vase, called the register, is in-volved in this sacrificial scene. Although palmettes, lotus buds, andspirals above and meanders below frame the gods, the Berlin Painterdoes not conventionally limit the actual field of depiction for thekalpis shape with ornamental designs. The Swiss connoisseur Her-bert Cahn, into whose hands the vase came, probably from an Etr-uscan grave, remarks: “[N]ew to this hydria is the concept of coveringthe whole body of the vase with large figures.”2It was one of the char-acteristics of the Berlin Painter that his divine figures tended to be aslarge and majestic as the shape of his pots would physically allow.The upper bodies of the gods fill the shoulder of the vase; the actionsof their sacrifice circles and encompasses its entire field; the sacrifi-cial scene is thus very difficult, if not impossible, to photograph with-out distortion. In the detail, strength, and resolution of the work,Cahn finds in this vase “the master at the apex of his artistic career, inhis finest script.”3We see that Apollo, the god of music and light, is closest to thealtar. In an apparently sacerdotal role, he bears his seven-stringedlyre, the kithara, over the altar, and with his right hand tilts a libation"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"bowl directly downward, at an angle perpendicular to the ground. He holds thebowl outward, facing the viewer, so that we can see its interior and centralboss—the mesomphalos.The god turns back to Iris, one foot—the one closest to thealtar—facing the viewer, with toes only visible, and the other visible lengthwise.Apollo appears to be about to pour the contents of his bowl, which Iris holdsher oinochoe to fill, onto the altar. The god’s hair is long, and a broad decoratedband attached to his lyre reaches almost to his feet. Like Athena and Hermes,Apollo wears a laurel crown; Iris, Leto, and Artemis wear diadems. Apolloflanks the altar with his sister Artemis and mother Leto. Artemis, in chiton andbeveled cloak, may well hold another phiale in her left hand; that section of thepainting has disappeared.4In her right, she raises part of her garment. Her quiverstands behind her. Her mother Leto, with lighter hair, brings in her right hand alotus bud to lay on the altar. Upon the altar itself a wreath has been laid with twoblossoms;5it is decorated with a frieze that has an ornamental band of Lesbiancymations.The messenger goddess Iris stands behind Apollo, proffering her winevase as if to fill the god’s phiale. Her wings extend well beyond the handlewhere, to her left, the intermediary god Hermes, conductor of souls, hurriesaway with petasos(traveling hat) and winged boots; his hand is raised in thegesture of reverence or awe associated with epiphany.6On the right, behind themother and daughter who so frequently appear in tandem in other examples ofthis scene, strides Athena, daughter of Zeus and goddess of war and wisdom.She approaches the sacrifice in grandeur, spear thrust in front of her. Her hel-met, removed and held at arm’s length, reveals disc-shaped earrings. The cen-tral scene of the composition breathes peace and sacrality; at its periphery, all isurgency, motion, and perhaps even ambivalence in the counter-moving figureof Hermes.7Hermes’s gesture will occur elsewhere on the vases in this cata-logue: It is the mortalgesture at the presence of numinous power, such as oc-curs at an epiphany or is concentrated in a sacrifice. We see it, for example, inthe reaction of the woman to whom Nike displays an oinochoe and phiale at analtar in no. 167, a red-figure lekythos in the early classical period from the Ash-molean Museum.Four of the gods have their names written in conventional retrograde AtticGreek script above their heads: LETVAPTEMISAUENAIA EPMHS: Leto,Artemis, Athen(ai)a, Hermes. Interestingly, Apollo and Iris, the most active par-ticipants in the sacrifice, are not named. Perhaps, to a contemporary eye, such re-dundant labeling renders the tableau more of an elegant cartoon than a greatwork of art. But this is not an uncommon feature of ancient Greek vases, andmakes identification of the principals in this startling scene indisputable. They areindeed the high gods, and they are indeed worshiping—or at the very least, takingactive part in the performance of a ritual.As we have said, the motif displayed on the Berlin Painter vase is notunique. It is an outstanding example from a corpus of several hundred icono-graphically related vase-paintings, some black- but mostly red-figure, most ofwhich date from between 510 and 450 B.C.E.—that is, from the late archaic to theearly classical period. With so many remaining examples, we can only wonder58ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"how many more variations on this theme have been lost to religious history.Although Erika Simon’s groundbreaking work (see chapter 4) offers a partialcatalogue, it has not been updated since 1953 in light of new discoveries. Nordoes Simon analyze these vases in specific sacrificial categories, other than anec-dotally.To illustrate the theme of divine libations in antiquity, I include in the cata-logue 247 artifacts, only a few of which can be illustrated. Vase-paintings areprimarily represented, but I have also included marble and bronze sculpturalevidence, including stone votive reliefs; I do not treat numismatic evidence.8The catalogue is arranged chronologically, with the period between 510 and 450B.C.E. divided by decades. Within the time period divisions, I have arranged thecatalogue entries by media, and within each medium, by deity. The artifacts aredesignated by the portrayed sacrificing deity who has primacy—so, for example,the vases where Athena attends with an oinochoe the libation of Herakles aregrouped under Athena, as are those where she herself pours from a phiale; butthose where she attends Zeus are grouped under Zeus.An exception to this rule is the case of Olympian sacrificial scene featuringmultiple divine libations on a relief or vase such as no. 35 (Figs. 21, 22), a red-figure stamnos in London by the Berlin Painter from his middle period (circa480B.C.E.). A thematic companion piece to the Boston hydria, the stamnos, likethe hydria, features a group of gods encircling the vase, in this case in a pro-cession of eight, culminating in the throne of Zeus. Hermes is there; Demeterwith her torches; Dionysos with the sacrificial vessel characteristic of him—notthe phiale, but the kantharos; at the handle, a winged Iris or Nike; Apollo withhis lyre and holding a tipped phiale; Artemis with an oinochoe; and Zeus, withscepter and libation bowl held up to his own eye level, parallel to the ground.These are grouped under the heading “Assembly of Deities.” Whenever possibleand relevant, I show photos of the front and back of the vases. Some of the scenesare obviously connected to mythical stories, such as Herakles’s entry into Olym-pus (e.g., nos. 5, 14, 25, 54, 55, 182), the birth of Erichthonios (e.g., nos. 92, 210),the presentation by Zeus of the infant Dionysos to the nymphs of Nysa (e.g., no.144) or the mission of Triptolemos (e.g., nos. 24, 173–175, 177–181, etc.) Othersseem to bear absolutely no relation to myth, a fact that cannot be minimized inany hermeneutical efforts of these images: Instead of a sacred past, even a reen-acted one, they seem to represent a religious present.Iconographic examples of “sacrificing gods” appear much earlier than thevases, virtually exclusively in sculpture. Typical of the archaic period is the bronzecult or votive statue of Apollo, a graceful kouros found in Piraeus in 1959. Hesteps slightly forward; in his left hand he is restored, on the basis of contempora-neous statues, holding a bowl. In his right, palm upturned, he extended a liba-tion bowl, of which a fragment remains (no. 2). He may have looked like the cultstatue represented on an early fourth-century Apulian fragment from Tarento(no. 218). A combination of threat and benevolence, the Piraeus Apollo withphiale dates from around 525 B.C.E.One may compare the even earlier votive male head of a statue of the mid-sixth century at Delphi from the Halos deposit; this work in ivory is part of aniconographic evidence59"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"extant chryselephantine statue of an enthroned figure, almost certainly Apollo(no. 1; Fig. 23).

Ionian in origin, these votives have been speculatively associated withCroesus’s dedications at the oracle in Herodotus HistoriesI.47.9Apollo is the most frequent libation bearer in ancient Greek art; perhapsthis is understandable. From his role as the prophetic mouthpiece of his fatherZeus at Delphi, and from his power as purifier (central to Pythagorean mysti-cism), Apollo’s priestly function might seem natural.10One of the more powerfulDelphic images from antiquity is the one already mentioned, found on the tondoof an Attic white-ground kylix from 470 B.C.E., discovered at the shrine itself (no.59; Fig. 6).11It shows the sacrificing Apollo, surrounded by his own particular at-tributes of laurel crown, tortoiseshell lyre, and raven, solemnly watching.

The altar’s referenceto human cult is reinforced by the mortal libation scenes on the outside of thecup: Around the interior column of a sanctuary stand a man with a scepter andphiale, a woman with oinochoe, and a man wearing a wreath-crown with a staff,also extending a phiale (Fig. 25).

In no. 108, another white-ground lekythos, thistime dating from the early classical period and shattered in the shelling of abunker in Berlin in 1945, Artemis stands at an altar with a flaming torch, heroinochoe held to pour. One of the simplest and yet perhaps most compellingscenes of Artemis in ritual performance is a classical black-figure lekythos inWürzburg’s Martin von Wagner-Museum by the Bowdoin Painter (no. 110).The goddess holds a branch in her left hand that ends in volutes; with her righthand, she pours a libation from a phiale onto an altar on which sits a fruit. Abird perches on the altar. A fawn, one of the animals sacred to the goddess,steps delicately behind her. Beazley, who originally called the female figure por-trayed on this vase “a woman,” later admitted the view of Möbius—that shewas Artemis, and that the bird was indeed a raven.12But Apollo and Artemis seldom pour libations in solitude. Because thebrother and sister, in relation to one another—or together with their motherLeto—are such a frequent iconographic grouping in the paintings we are con-sidering, it has been suggested that these vases emphasize a cult with its rootson Delos, birthplace of the twin gods. This idea is supported by an amphora af-ter the Nikoxenos Painter in Hannover which shows a vigorous palm, growingfrom or behind the altar, symbolic of the palm tree on Delos on which Letoleaned for support while giving birth to the divine twins (no. C–55). No divinelibations occur here, but the group is familiar enough, and believed by manyscholars of iconography to be the prototype of the “the Delphic triad” at liba-tion. The Berlin Painter rendered such a scene (one of the first) very early onin his career, soon after 500 B.C.E., on a hydria in Vienna (no. 17); As late as470B.C.E. he treats the scene again in no. 64, an amphora from Richmond, Vir-ginia, in which Apollo appears at an altar on one side of the vase with kitharaand phiale, and Artemis on the other, with quiver and oinochoe held out for herbrother beyond the handle. In the Getty’s Bareiss Collection we find a classicalexample on a beautiful trefoil oinochoe attributed to the Richmond Painter; thevase depicts the two deities offering a libation (no. 191; Fig. 27).In contrast, however, Athena, who is not a Delian, pours libations, too:One of a pair of small bronze statuettes discovered on the Sparta acropolisshows her holding a libation bowl as if pouring; the angle of the phiale is suchthat the liquid could not be retained if the goddess were meant to receive it (no.3; Figs. 28, 29). The way in which the phiale is held is comparable to that of aterracotta of Athena with polos from Rhodes (no. 202), a helmeted Athena withphiale from the Kanellopoulos collection in Athens from the late classical pe-riod (no. 239), a bronze Hermes from the same collection (no. 241), and abronze Zeus or Poseidon in Munich (no. 200), where the angle of the bowl isextreme.Scenes of divine libation on vase paintings begin in earnest in the years510–500B.C.E., the decade of the restoration of the Alcmeonids and the demo-cratic reforms of Kleisthenes. Most common in these scenes of divine libationis the enthroned god. A superb cup in Tarquinia shows Zeus enthroned withthunderbolt and phiale, and attended by Ganymede with oinochoe (no. 4).

Douris gives us a kylix now in the Getty, which showsthe pair making a libation at an altar (no. 41).Although Ganymede is undeniably identified with Zeus, it is not necessaryto attach any particular erotic significance to the figure of the boy in thesescenes. Ganymede’s role in pouring for the libation of Zeus is defined by hisrole on Olympus as cupbearer for the gods. In that capacity, he joins Iris orNike and Athena to him or to Hera, Artemis to Apollo, Aphrodite to Ares, andAriadne and maenads or satyrs to Dionysos as frequent sacrificial attendants tothe gods. For example, on a kylix from about 480 B.C.E. by the CastelgiorgioPainter from the British Museum (no. 46), while Ganymede pours from anoinochoe for an enthroned Zeus on the left, Iris or Nike is attending Hera’s li-bation on the right; Ganymede is one of two attendants for the libating royalpair.

Both are reversals ofthe normal hierarchical equation we observe in these vases, where a lesser fig-ure ministers to a more powerful deity, as Ganymede or Iris do on behalf ofZeus—although these two examples, interestingly, maintain normal genderroles for libation. Nike occasionally pours for Herakles, as in a stamnos frag-ment from Oxford, while Athena looks on (no. 26). Athena also holds the liba-tion bowl while seated, as in no. 16, a black-figure kalpis by the Athena Painter.The goddess is painted in her sanctuary flanked by two owls on altars (compareno. C–1).

A maenad to theleft of the altar seems to extend her hands beneaththe red stream of wine andtoward the flames. The scene is framed by dancing maenads. John Beazleyconjectures that the maenad is strewing handfuls of groats (oDlaA) on the altar,which she takes from the kanoPn, or sacrificial basket lying on the ground infront of the altar.16This vase in Boston is a miracle of cultic self-referentiality,for the kantharos is Dionysos’s special vessel, established as his own in ancientGreek iconography long before the first libating gods appear (as, for example,in the scene on the archaic black-figure amphora by the Amasis Painter in Mu-nich,no. C–21). Libations are poured to Dionysos from the kantharos, and he isvirtually never shown pouring libations from any other type of container.Hence the image renders the god performing a cultic action, within the sphereof his own cult, which appears on the same cultic vessel that it portrays. Inother words, the kantharos, belonging to Dionysos, portrays the god ritually deploy-ing the kanatharos.Both vase and god self-represent, and thus self-ratify and in-tensify the ritual focus.iconographic evidence71"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"72ancient greek gods in ritual performanceSome Dionysiac scenes occur in an apparently purely mythical context,when maenads or satyrs pour for the god’s libation, as in the case of no. 30, ared-figure pelike in which Dionysos with thyrsos and tipped kantharos receiveswine from an oinochoe poured by a maenad wearing the animal skins of thecult; that of no. 72, an oinochoe by the Dutuit Painter in Paris; or no. 71, anamphora by the Alkimachos Painter, one of whose sides features a satyr pour-ing for the god while the other side features a maenad doing the same.

Poseidon with his trident and Athena with heraegis and spear follow in the procession. The illustration of this mythical sceneis recapitulated in the scene on a red-figure stamnos in the Louvre (no. 144),where Zeus hands the child Dionysos to a Nysa nymph; a mysterious female fig-ure sits enthroned like a deity inside an architectural structure, holding out aphiale and the thyrsos, the wand of Dionysos; does she represent a nymph—orperhaps the heroized Semele and the building, a heröon?18The years 500 to 490 B.C.E. saw the continued political authority of Kleis-thenes, the tyrant-reformer, and the growing menace from Persia that culminatedin the invasion at Schoinia beach at Marathon. During this period Hermes, com-monly a peripheral observer at these scenes of divine libation (as in, for example,inno. 29; Fig. 3), suddenly has his own show. In a red-figure cup by the HermaiosPainter in London, the god appears with petasos and winged boots, earnestlywalking along, spilling wine from his phiale as he goes (no. 18). The BerlinPainter renders a Nike running (or perhaps alighting) with phiale and oinochoeon a lekythos now in Harvard’s Sackler Museum (no. 19); a few years later, be-tween 490 and 480 B.C.E., he creates an airborne Nike with ritual incense burner(thymiaterion) emptying a phiale onto an altar (an oinochoe in the British Mu-seum,no. 31, Fig. 38).19She holds the phiale at an angle reminiscent of the onethat her creator gives the Apollo in his hydria in Boston, also comparable to the ges-ture of the goddess identified as Hera in no. 38, a lekythos by the Brygos Painter.This decade also gives us the earliest of nine vases included in this catalogue inwhich divine libations on the tondo or one side of the vase are mirrored—or per-haps referenced—by a scene of mortal libation on the outside or the opposite side.Inno. 15, the tondo of a fragmentary cup from the Athenian Acropolis shows astanding Athena with armband and spear pouring a libation. On the cup’s out-side, on side B, a hand holds a short-footed kantharos. The inscription, presum-ably representing what is said by the owner of the hand, says: sp]Andv tudaAmonitudgau[pi(I am making a drink-offering to the Agathos Daimon).The threatening years between the Battle of Marathon in 490 and the inva-sion of Xerxes in 480, the decade of the floruit of Heracleitus of Ephesus, werethose which produced the magnificent hydria by the Berlin Painter in Boston thathas been our starting point. The same artist painted several other scenes of divinelibation at around the same time. On a stamnos by the Berlin Painter in the Met-ropolitan Museum of Art, Athena pours for Zeus and the polos-wearing Hera,both of whom proffer libation bowls (no. 22; Figs. 39, 40). On the reverse of thevase is the libation at the departure of a warrior. And an amphora in the Ash-molean Museum envisions a standing Zeus extending his phiale over a flamingaltar, while Nike pours (no. 23). During this decade we encounter for the first timethe Eleusinian goddess Demeter and the missionary hero Triptolemus involvedin a scene of libation—as in no. 24 (Fig. 41), a lost vase once in Berlin.

Overthe next two decades, this pair and Demeter’s daughter Persephone (Kore) be-come an “Eleusinian Triad” to balance that of Delos mentioned earlier; they ap-pear repeatedly in libation, as in no. 51, a bell-krater by the Oreithyia Painter inPalermo. These scenes are of an iconographic genre, and seem to represent liba-tions of departure; but the role of sacrificer continually rotates. Sometimes Trip-tolemos holds the phiale and offers the libation; sometimes he watches as Deme-ter or Persephone wields both oinochoe and phiale. It has been suggested that thevase-paintings depict the closing ritual of the Eleusinian Mysteries.21Zeus emerges as a frequent sacrificer on the vases painted in the decade of480–470B.C.E., as the walls of Athens were fortified and Pindar composed hisodes in honor of the Olympic victories of Sicilian dynasts. The Syleus Paintercreated two similar pelikai of the great god at libation, in one served by Nike(no. 42) and in one, by Ganymede (no. 43).

Zeus is identified by two features of the image: histhunderbolt, the numinous object which is uniquely his, and his inscribedname, ZEΥS. Athena is identified by her helmet and aegis, again, only associ-ated with her godhead; she could not be mortal, and she could be no other deity.These belong to the first category of the representation of divinity I want to high-light, that of divine attributes, which are a crucial feature of religious iconogra-phy from almost all of the world’s religions, whether dead or alive: Certain gar-ments are worn by particular gods in their visual representations, and certainobjects associated with them. These attributes are not transferable. They “be-long” to the gods’ sphere, as Vis.n.u holds a conch shell and Ka ̄lı ̄ has skull jewelry.There is a second category of religious “ownership” inherent in this image,however. Zeus holds a phiale, and Athena an oinochoe. These are recognizablemortal cultic paraphernalia. But because they are associated with the worship ofthe gods, they also belong tothe gods and are also attributive. To Apollo, for ex-ample, belong both his oracle, which he himself established on Parnassos, andany omphalos that represents his prophetic power. The shrine at Delphi isApollo’s, just as the shrine at Eleusis is Demeter’s: threshold, doors, altar, and rit-ual objects. The altar beneath the Athena Nike temple says “I am the altar ofNike.” Sacred and “set apart” as belonging to the gods are places or objects asso-ciated with the second category, that of the physical elements of religious wor-ship. We are not so surprised, therefore, when we encounter the cult statue of theiconographic evidence77figure 41.Triptolemus, on his winged throne, extending phiale.

Although this category of divine be-longing may seem incongruous, a moment’s reflection seems to endorse it bythe inner logic of religion itself. The elements of religion are, of course, in a cate-gory that is “other” than the elements of the secular world. The elements of reli-gion, building-blocks of meaning, belong to the gods whose worship they serve.But Zeus and Athena in this column-krater do not merely hold the phialeand oinochoe, vessels with which they themselves are so often offered libations.They take action. Athena brandishes her oinochoe as if having poured wine intothe phiale of Zeus. Zeus pours wine onto the ground; the wine is painted ontothe vase. Thus there exists, not only in the case of these vases but also in ancientGreek religion itself, a natural third category: the actions of ritual performance.These, also, belong to the gods. When we see a god performing an act of reli-gious worship, therefore, we are observing that god’s sphere of holiness and po-tency. Religious actionsare no less divine attributes than are distinguishing fea-tures such as the thunderbolt or aegis, or the physical elements of cult.This hierarchy might then be understood as follows:Belonging to the god:ZeusAthenaDivine attributesbeard, thunderbolt, helmet, aegisnameReligious objectsphialeoinochoeReligious actionspouring a libation pouring the wine for from a phialea libation into a phiale from an oinochoeIn other words, I suggest a “continuum of belonging” to the divine spherewhich includes religious actions as well as objects that are appropriate to thespecific divinity portrayed. Because libation, as we have seen, is a generic act ofworship, it “belongs” to all the gods, and hence this inclusive line of reasoninghas been overlooked.22During this decade, Poseidon makes a rare cameo appearance as a sacri-ficing god, holding a phiale in no. 49, a stamnos in which Nike attends himwith her oinochoe; Dionysos, with his thyrsos, waits holding a kantharosdownward as if having just offered his own libation. An amphora by the Provi-dence Painter in the Ashmolean Museum gives us a robust Poseidon, standingwith trident and phiale (no. 50). These rare examples of Poseidon as the pourerof libations are crucial for our overall understanding of these vases. As we haveseen, although some of these scenes can be interpreted according to myth, toour knowledge no myth recounts libations performed by Poseidon. Thus weare dealing with religious images that are not necessarily narrative, but per-haps more theological and descriptive.In two vases from the decade of 480–470 B.C.E., the theme of Athena as78ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"sacrificial ministrant to Herakles is notably treated.

In no. 78, a lekythos in London, the goddessholds phialai in both hands over a flaming, bloodstained altar. The love-godlingEros, who so often attends Aphrodite with the phiale in vase paintings, also flieswith phiale and oinochoe on the neck of a Dutuit Painter oinochoe in Munich(no. 85).23Finally from this decade, mention should be made of the enthronedfigures, one of whom holds a phiale, portrayed on the celebrated Locrian reliefsfrom Reggio di Calabria in southern Italy (no. 89). These divinities are probablyPersephone and Hades, and might be compared to the similarly chthonian pairinno. 195, as well as to the much earlier archaic plaques from Sparta that fea-ture anonymous underworld deities accompanied by serpents and dogs; theygrasp the kantharos rather than the phiale (nos. C–47 to C–49).The early classical decade of 470–460 B.C.E. began with Sophocles’s firstdramatic victory in 468 and Aeschylus’s Seven against Thebesin 467. It saw theascent of Cimon, commander of the operations of the Delian League, and thereturn of the “bones of Theseus” to Athens after his conquest of Skyros.24Itended with the fall of the Areopagus in 461 and the Athenian breach withSparta in 460. Zeus continues to pour libations in the vases of this period, asin a fragmentary lebes-gamikos by the Providence Painter found in the Athen-ian Agora (no. 90), where Zeus extends his phiale to Athena, who extends heroinochoe in a scene reminiscent of no. 44.In two scenes, one on a column-krater in Bologna (no. 91) and one on abell-krater in Palermo (no. 93), Athena ushers Herakles into Olympus beforethe enthroned Zeus, who extends his phiale in welcome; the proud god withhis paternal headache even holds the same welcoming phiale at the birth of hisdaughter Athena from his head in a hydria in Paris, as Hephaistos looks onwith his double axe (no. 94; Fig. 42). In a superb stamnos in the Louvre by theProvidence Painter (no. 95; Fig. 43), a bowl-bearing, enthroned Zeus tips hisphiale for Nike, who pours wine into it from her oinochoe; Apollo, standing withkithara, is the other figure in the center; while Hera, without bowl, is enthronedopposite Zeus.

Thewoman to the left holds an oinochoe and laurel branch; the central woman, hold-ing a scepter (perhaps a priestess?) holds the phiale over an altar. A woman to theright holds up her hand.After 460–450 B.C.E., the number of scenes of divine libations tapers offsharply on extant vases. The first two decades of the classical period proper(450–430B.C.E.) encompassed the construction of the Parthenon, and saw thepeace made with Persia in 449 blighted by the invasion of Attica by Sparta in446. Sophocles’s Antigonewas probably produced in the later 440s, and Euripi-des’s Alcestisin 438. In 437 the Parthenon and chryselephantine statue of AthenaParthenos were dedicated; her sculptor, Pheidias, was prosecuted for embezzle-ment and fled to Olympia. In 431, the Peloponnesian War began, a national hem-orrhage from which Athens would never fully recover.The classical pantheon is still represented at libation; on an amphora in theLouvre, Zeus extends his phiale to Nike, who pours from an oinochoe (no. 170);the scene is repeated with Hera as principal in no. 171, an oinochoe in London.Poseidon is regally enthroned with his trident, clutching a phiale on an am-phora by the Painter of the Louvre Symposion (no. 172). In no. 177(Fig. 53), ahydria depicting the departure of Triptolemos on his magic chariot with over-flowing phiale extended, and a crowned Demeter pouring from an oinochoe,gives us name-inscriptions for the deities: TPIPTOLEMOS DEMHTHP. Thetheme is also treated by one of the classical period’s vase-painting masters,Polygnotos (no. 178). Athena, too, continues her duties pouring for Heraklesand his kantharos, especially clearly on an Attic white-ground lekythos in London(no. 182); the goddess is labeled AQENAIA.No. 183, which also treats the Athena-Herakles libation, is a Boeotian lekythos found in the polyandrion(mass grave) inThespiai.A perfect example of the kind of mirroring of divine and mortal cultic ac-tions we sometimes encounter in these vases, a Boeotian skyphos in Athens bythe Painter of the Argos Cup depicts Apollo holding a lyre and maenad holdingthyrsos, both with phialai (no. 184). She pours into his bowl, from which theliquid spills.

As discussed earlier, two enthroned deities with phialai pre-side over a krater from Spina, which seems barely able to contain its subjects(no. 195; Fig. 32). Hades and Persephone have been suggested as identificationsfor the deities, but their divine attributes point further east; the god wears asnake headdress, and the goddess has a lion on her shoulder who helps her tograsp her scepter. Beazley, who once believed these deities to be Dionysos andAriadne (a reasonable choice, given the krater’s iconographic programme), hassince ceded to Erika Simon’s identification of the gods as Sabazios and Kybele.28An altar, piled with wood, stands before the pair. A priestess approaches with acovered basket on her head, as does a votary playing the double flute. A cele-brant approaches with a tympanon, a musical instrument sacred to Kybele’scult. Around the register of the vase, an ecstatic dance explodes.Are these gods dead or alive? They sit on a kind of pedestal or base in an in-terior or sanctuary scene; these elements suggest that they are cult statues. Yetconfusingly, liquid pours from their phialai, delineated in added white. ClaudeBérard and Jean-Louis Durand see in this scene a kind of participation mystiquebetween the divine and human figures. “This group [the two deities] cannot beseparated from the right-hand section of the frieze. In fact, the libation cups arenot merely decorative accessories or attributes; they are functional: liquid flowsand spreads to the foot of the altar in front of the pedestal. (This essential detailis scarcely visible in the photographs, since it is painted in added white, whichis extremely fugitive.) Although static, this mysterious couple thus participatesin the general action, carrying out a libation, as if in response to the musiciansand dancers who frame them.”29At the start of the last thirty years of the fifth century, Attica was devastated,first by the plague and then by the Peloponnesians. Sophocles presented Oedi-pus Tyrannosaround 430; Pericles died the next year, and Kleon rose to power.The peace of Nikias in 421, the year Aristophanes composed his Peace, gaveway to the perilous rise of Alkibiades, culminating in his doomed Sicilian Ex-pedition in 415 and the flight of its leader, charged with sacrilege, to Sparta. OfZeus or Hera we see no more until the marble reliefs of the fourth century,but on a lekythos in the British Museum (no. 203), Athena or her statue witha phiale sits on a rocklike formation in a sanctuary designated by a column,a pouring lion spout, and a perirrhanterion (lustral basin).

The reliefs do not quite pick up from where the vases leave off. The libat-ing gods of the reliefs are not so lively, nor do they operate in a world so rarifiedas that of the vases, where few mortals are ever present. In the reliefs, the godsare often approached by devotees intelligible as mortal by their much smallersize; human religiosity, then, plays a much larger role than on the vases. Mostfrequent is the depiction of a deity actually presiding at his or her altar, greetingworshipers as they approach, showing them a phiale as if to reinforce their de-votion. In no. 212, for example, a Pentelic marble relief from Attica fromaround 400 B.C.E. and now in the Louvre, a seated Zeus extends his phiale to aveiled goddess, presumably Hera, who holds an oinochoe. A helmeted god,perhaps Hermes, is also present; but so is a small male worshiper who enters,hand raised, at the right. This relief shares some common iconographic ele-ments with no. 213, a relief in the Vatican. A relief in the wall of a primaryschool in Megara shows Ares, an almost unheard-of sacrificer up until now,holding a phiale to Aphrodite’s oinochoe (no. 214). Once again, a small male isincluded, as is the case in a far more evolved and better-preserved version ofthe same scene on a relief in Venice (no. 215): Ares with chiton, chlamys, hel-met and shield, holds a phiale toward Aphrodite, who pours wine into hisbowl, held over an altar. In the Venice relief, the worshiper raises his hand inreverence as he observes the scene. A relief from Corfu depicts Asklepios andHygieia at an altar (no. 216); the ubiquitous mortal worshiper beholds their li-bation.

Three oversized phialai are suspended above her;one to the left and two, with mesomphaloi,to the right.

A number of much smallermortal worshipers enter to the right of the offering table with food gifts. InBerlin is an equally spectacular Pentelic marble relief of the “Mother of theGods” with phiale and signature tympanon dating from 390 B.C.E.(no. 235).The Thracian goddess Bendis even makes an appearance (no. 236) in a mar-ble relief from Piraeus, now in Copenhagen.

Is a given sacrificing god en-throned or standing? Is the phiale tipped downward, held parallel to theground, or held perpendicular to the ground? Is the libation visible (that is, canwe see the liquid as it falls)? Is there an altar or omphalos present in the scene?If there is an altar, is it flaming, blood-marked, or garlanded? Are mortals pres-ent at the scene of the divine libation?35Finally, in the case of vases, is a mortallibation scene depicted on the reverse of the vase?I have broken down the results in longer overall periods of time than I usein the catalogue, combining the decades and centuries into units that seem tomake historical sense.98ancient greek gods in ritual performancefigure 59.Drawing of Kyzikos relief."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The results are shown in the charts given in n. 36.36The majority of the di-vine libation scenes (71 percent) portray the gods as standing while pouring, al-though close to a third show the gods as enthroned.

No conclu-sions can be drawn about whether or not the god is meant to be seen as offer-ing libations based on enthronement or on the angle of the phiale; in a numberof cases, as we have seen in the catalogue descriptions above, even though thephiale is held parallel by either a seated or a standing deity, the liquid is stillshown spilling out of the bowl and falling to the ground. The presence of culticactions and elements is significant: The liquid of the libation is actually visiblein almost 17 percent of the images, and close to a third (28.5 percent) feature al-tars as part of the libation scene. Of that number, 41 percent are either flaming,blood-marked, or both; these are altars in active use. Mortals are present at thescene of libation in only 14 percent of the scenes, but that number is inflated bythe votive reliefs of the late classical period, which account for 60 percent. Mortalsare virtually never present in scenes of divine libations on vases, or their identifi-cation as such is controversial.

Contem-poraneous written interpretations of Olympian gods who pour outwine offerings from cultic bowls are lost, or never existed.

Although the date of thePolias has never been established, it is believed to date from the early archaicperiod; Plutarch thought it remarkable that the Athenians still preserved it tohis day, and Philostratos cites the Polias in his list of the most ancient imagesof the gods.1Pausanias says that the Athena Polias was venerated long beforethe synoikismosof Attica and that it was said to have fallen from the sky.2Was the Polias enthroned or standing? Among the four vase-paintings uponwhich Frickenhaus based his reconstruction of a seated Athena Polias holding aphiale is no. 7, mentioned in chapter 1, a scene in which the goddess sits beforeher altar, and in which she clearly holds a phiale.3No base indicates that she is astatue, however, and, as mentioned earlier, John H. Kroll, in his 1982 study of theancient image of the Athena Polias, has challenged this idea.4Inscriptions rendered by the “Treasurers of Athena” in the late 370s andearly 360s B.C.E. list the statue’s precious ornaments.5These are cataloguedamong the treasures kept in the drxaPoß neaß(the Erechtheion), and are listedasstefanh,fncuebßGxei¢ plastra,fcuebßGxei.gxuoiboß,fnGxeiDpBtpitraxalvi¢ermoi pAnte¢ glaBj xrysp¢aDgBß xrysp¢ gorganeion xrysoPn¢ fi-alh xrysp,fnDntpi xeirBGxei(a diadem that the goddess wears, the earringsthat the goddess wears, a band that the goddess wears on her neck, five neck-laces, a gold owl, a gold aegis, a gold gorgeoneion, and a gold phiale that sheholds in her hand).6Kroll notes that “the phiale is said to be of gold and held inthe goddess’ hand specifically to distinguish it from several, predominantly sil-ver phialai that were deposited in the cella of the Erechtheion as votive offer-ings.”7We know from Plutarch and Pausanias that the visible external elements ofthe Athena Polias (helmet, arms, gold ornaments) were later additions. There-fore, according to Kroll, “This leaves only one component that could antedatethe sixth century: its body or core, which was hidden beneath the peplosandmay very well have gone back to the time of the Bronze Age kings of Athens, ifnot much earlier still. If the nucleus of the image was indeed as ancient as thesources insist, we may readily envisage it as a primitive, aniconic, or quasi-iconic fetish of wood.”8But can a truly primitive, aniconic image hold a phiale?Since this was a common feature of large images of divinities in antiquity, atleast as early as the middle archaic period—as in our catalogue nos. 1–3, perhapsthe phiale was added as the Polias acquired accessories—at that time, or evenlater, much as very old Roman Catholic statues such as the Black Madonna orthe Infant of Prague have done.9Nemesis at RhamnousPausanias describes Pheidas’s statue of Nemesis as holding a phiale in herhand.

Greek legend had it that the Persians wholanded on the beach at Schoinia in 490 B.C.E. were so confident of victory thatthey brought with them a piece of Parian marble with which to make a trophy.11Years after the Athenians crushed the Persians on the plains of Marathon, Phei-dias is supposed to have made the statue out of this marble.12On her head,Pausanias says, was a crown with deer and “not-large statues” of Nike. “In herhands, in the left she holds an apple branch, and in her right a phiale; on thephiale are fashioned Aethiopians (taPßdBxersBnGxei tumBnkladon mhlAaß,tudejiudBfialhn, ADuAopeß dBDpBtufialipepoAhntai).”13An extant ana-logue to this wonderful bowl is the gold phiale also decorated with heads ofEthiopians from the Panagiurishte Treasure in Sofia.14“Bonus Eventus” (TAxh)InHistoria Naturalis34.77, Pliny the Elder (23/24–79 C.E.) describes the “BonusEventus” (presumably, the Tyche; like Nemesis, another concretized abstraction)of the painter and sculptor Euphranor as having a phiale in her hand.

Antiochus Epiphanes appears on the the obverse ofcoins that feature the statue.16Libanius was quite transported by this Apollo,which held a phiale: “Imagination brings before my eyes the countenance, thephiale, the lyre, the tunic reaching to the feet (tbprasvpon,tbnfialhn,tbnkiuaran,tbn podarh xitpna)...the delicacy of the neck in the marble, thegirdle about the bosom which holds the golden tunic together, so that someparts fit loosely and others hang loose....He seemed as one that sang (DAkeigbr ̈gdonti mAloß).”17The Dionysos of Ptolemy PhiladelphusIn his Deipnosophists, written around 192 C.E.,18Athenaeus of Naucratis quotesKallixeinos of Rhodes’s report of an ostentatious procession staged by PtolemyPhiladelphos.19The Hellenistic ruler was carried along in a decorated wagonwith a cult image of the libation-pouring Dionysos: “DpBdBtaAthßDppnggalma DionAsoy dekaphxy spAndonDk karxhsAoy xrysoP(upon this[ float] there was a statue ten cubits high of Dionysos pouring libations from agolden drinking cup).”20“terribly strange and paradoxical”103"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"It seems more than probable that like the karxasionof the massiveDionysos, the vessels held in actual statues of the gods were usually gold. Goldwas believed to belong to, and to be appropriate for, the Olympians. Although,as we noted earlier, Athena had silver phialai dedicated to her in theErechtheion, the Athenian temple inventory specifies that the phiale held byher cult statue was gold. A survey of the phialai dedicated during archaic andclassical times at Hera sanctuaries indicates that they were, without exception,made of gold.21Pieces of an archaic chryselephantine Apollo statue, togetherwith a related find—a splendid gold phiale—were discovered in 1939 underthe Sacred Way at Delphi, in trenches below the Stoa of the Athenians and theNaxian Sphinx. The statue’s fragments were reassembled by Pierre Amandry;on display with a sister statue of Artemis in the Delphi Museum, the Apollo isshown holding the phiale (see no. 1; Fig. 23).22And in the satirical libationscene of Aristophanes’ Peace, Hermes is especially susceptible to the manipu-lations of Trygaeus because the libation bowl offered him is gold; he commentsthat he has “always had a real weakness (soft spot) for gold (plate) (cßDleamvneGm›deBtpn xrysAdvn).”23The phialai of cult statues, as Rice has it “probably just positioned to sug-gest the action” of pouring libations, were actually gold; we probably even haveone in the archaic Delphi Apollo.24Similarly, the frequently embossed shapesin the libation bowls of the catalogued vase-paintings indicate that they werethought of as metal, not ceramic. It is at least likely that these gods and god-desses, frozen serenely in black and red, are pouring from golden phialai—with the action no longer suggested but realized in painted streams of wine.Early Literary Episodes of Gods in Ritual PerformanceAncient literature also includes several important if stylized testaments inwhich divine entities do indeed take part in a variety of cultic activities. These,in turn, occur in a variety of literary genres. One of the most important andcontroversial (the libation of Hermes in Aristophanes’s Peace) is from comedy,and the Hymn to Hermes, wherein the infant god sacrifices twelve cattle in anOlympiandaAß, also contains comic elements that call into question how seri-ously we can take these divine characters. In some cases where the gods ren-der offerings, there is no explicit recipient; in others, the gods “sacrifice to othergods,” or to themselves. Each is unique and irregular in its own way, whetherdue to the god’s disguise, the absence of cultic language, or the absence of aclear motive or context for the act. In all cases, the god’s apparently anthropo-morphic behavior may serve as a strategem of reduction—an effort to makehim or her more “manageable” and accessible, either to the other protagonistsor to the audience.These passages are grouped according to the more general cultic categoriesinto which they fall. The first group of passages shows the gods in the perfor-mance of divine dramena: “things done,” or ritual performance. Some treat li-bating gods; some deal with gods who offer animal sacrifice. In another category104ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"are literary episodes of gods who engage in cultic behavior, using ritual gesturesor disguised as hierophants; included in this group are gods who serve as theeponymous priests of their own cults.25Then there is the category of divinelegamena, “things said.” Oaths, as we have seen in chapter 1, are sworn in a rit-ual context and are frequently accompanied by libations; this is no less true of theoaths of the gods. Finally, there are instances in literature of deified mortals whorender offerings to themselves, and related ancient commentary on this exaltednarcissism.Howstrange is a god who worships? I have characterized the “offeringgods” theme as surprising, even troublesome. We may also assume that our re-action is due to the chasm of years that separate us from those who made andsaw these vases. It is true that our understanding of the religious world of an-tiquity will always be imperfect. Yet the first recorded “editorial comments” onthe idea of a god who pours libations—also reactions of confusion or evenrevulsion—come from ancient rather than modern sources. These passagesare not without insight. Occasionally (but not exclusively) in satire, we aremade to feel through the eyes of the ancient author the conceptual peculiarityof a religious god—or the irony, if the god is presented as actually worshipinghimself or herself.DPVMENA: Ritual Actions Performed by DeitiesEpisodes of Divine LibationIn the only clear-cut Homeric episode of divine libation, a disguised Athenapours out wine and prays to Poseidon (Odyssey3.55–61). When she visits thepalace of Nestor in disguise as Mentor, the companion of Telemachos, Athenais handed the golden goblet by Nestor’s son Peisistratos, who charges the dis-guised goddess to pour a libation and pray to Poseidon:My guest, make your prayer now to the lord Poseidon,for his is the festival you have come to on your arrival;but when you have poured to him and prayed, according to custom(aDtbrDpbn speAsißtekaBeGjeai,fuAmißDstA),then give this man also a cup of the sweet wine, so thathe too can pour, for I think he will also make his prayerto the immortals. All men need the gods. But this one [i.e., Telemachos]is a younger man than you, and of the same age as I am.This is why I am giving you first the golden goblet.26“Having spoken in this way, he put in her hand the cup of sweet wine (fßeDpbnDn xersBtAuei dApaßcdAoß oGnoy).”27An honored guest (although howhonored is unsuspected!), it is now incumbent on her to do the same. The dis-guised goddess is happy at his wise prudence “because she was the first towhom he gave the golden cup (xrAseiongleison).”28And so “straightaway sheprayed to the lord Poseidon (aDtAka d› eGjeto pollbPoseidavnignakti)”.29“terribly strange and paradoxical”105"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Hear us, Poseidon, who circle the earth, and do not begrudge usthe accomplishment of all these actions for which we pray you.First of all to Nestor and to his sons grant glory,and then on all the rest of the Pylians besides confergracious recompense in return for this grand hecatomb,and yet again grant that Telemachos and I go backwith that business done for which we came this way in our black ship.This passage raises a number of intriguing ritual and theological prob-lems. Athena prays to Poseidon just as Peisistratos did, and she pours a libationjust as he did. But unlike Nestor’s son, Athena knows that Poseidon is in theland of the Aethiopians; can he hear her? She is in disguise. Does that affect herstanding as a petitioner? Does her prayer to him have mortal or divine status?Which identity is paramount? Line 62 is highly revealing. “So then she prayed,and she herself was accomplishing everything (fßgr›Gpeit›drpto kaBaDtapanta teleAta).” The verb teleytpnis in the imperfect, conveying the senseof an ongoingprocess which seems to be happening in a universe parallel towhat is expected and visible.The scene apparentlydepicts a mortal guest of Nestor’s house praying tothe sea god on behalf of the assembled community. But the prayer is not whatit seems, because in reality it is a deity who prays it, and so neither is the resultwhat it seems. We do not next learn that Poseidon grants or denies Mentor’sprayer, which would be the usual Homeric sequence. Instead it is clear thatwhile Athena is at an equal level in entreating the power of Poseidon, she her-self is also fulfilling the demands of the prayer through the efficacy of her ownpower, summarized by the narrator in the word aDta.The Berlin Painter shows the god Hermes fleeing, as if in awe, from thecentral scene of libation in the hydria in Boston (no. 29). In Aristophanes’sPeace,written in 421 B.C.E. in anticipation of the ratification of a peace treatywith Sparta, the Attic comic poet portrays the one and only surviving case of agod who unmistakably pours libations in Greek literature: Hermes.The citizen Trygaeus begs Hermes to help the chorus, Greek farmers, in“hauling up Peace,” that is, the great statue of the goddess Peace, from a deep,rocky pit. Trygaeus claims that the Sun and the Moon, fattened because the bar-barians sacrifice to them, are growing obstreperous and plotting to take overGreece and the cults of the Greek gods for themselves. If Hermes will do this,“we will hold the great Panathanaea in your honour, and also all the other cultsof the gods—the Mysteries, the Dipolieia, the Adonia, in honour of Hermes:and the other states everywhere, released from their troubles, will sacrifice toyou as Hermes the Averter of evil, and you will have many other benefits aswell.”31Without a gram of compunction, Hermes’s greed and vanity inspirehim to take the bait.To accomplish this, Trygaeus persuades Hermes to offer a prayer for thecollective desire for Peace: “To begin with, I give you this as a present so thatyou’ll have something to pour libations with (prpton dAsoi/dpron dAdvmitand›,Ena spAndeinGxiß).”32The “something” turns out to be a wrought gold106ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"phiale; Hermes bursts out, “Dear me, what a soft spot I’ve always had for goldplate! (oGm›cßDleamvn eGm›deBtpn xrysAdvn).”33Seeing that Hermes will comply and publicly pray for their cause, Trygaeusorders the chorus to begin their construction work as soon as possible. Thechorus-leader flatters Hermes: “And you, cleverest of gods, you be in charge ofus and tell us, like a master-builder, what we need to do (sBd›cmPn,ruepnso-fatate,/etta xrbpoePnDfestbßfraze dhmioyrgikpß).”34Then Trygaeuspressures him: “Come on, hurry up and hold out the bowl, so we can get boldlyon with the job after praying to the gods (gge da,sBtaxAvßEpexe tbnfialhn,epvßGrgv ÚfialoPmen eDjamenoi toPsin ueoPß).”35Hermes complies:Libation, libation!Speak fair, speak fair!As we pour libation, let us pray [or: we pray] that this daymay be the beginning of many blessings for all the Greeks,and that every man [who zealously assists with the ropes] may neveragain take up a shield.spondbsponda\u0002eDfhmePte eDfhmePte.spAndonteß eDxamesua tbnnPncmAran·Ellhsingrjai ppsi pollpn k›agaupn,xgstiß prouAmvß jyllaboi tpn sxoinAvn,toPton tbngndra mblabePn pot›dspAda.36A repartee between Trygaeus and Hermes ensues about the evils of warand the joys of peace, including curses on those that would make war (forexample, “May he, Lord Dionysus, never-endingly be extracting arrows fromhis funny-bones!”)37until Hermes at last takes on the role of the chorusleader:(453) hermes:But for us may there be blessings. Strike up the paean:hail!(454) trygaeus:Leave out the striking: just say “hail.”(455–456) hermes:All right, I simply say: hail, hail, hail!

But what a complicated type he is, and how complex is his situation.Some exegetes have utterly ignored the religious problem; Cedric Whitman, forexample, provides a lengthy summary and analysis of the play without evenmentioning the fact that Hermes pours a libation; he simply says that the god“terribly strange and paradoxical”107"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"“has been bribed . . . with a gold cup.”38But lines 435–438 undeniably representthe common prayer accompanying libation. Here, according to Oxford editorMaurice Platnauer, the reader is in very hot water and must be rescued. Plat-nauer refuses to let Hermes act as the sacrificer. While conceding that the firsttwo lines (the ritual formula spondbspondb/eDfhmePte eDfhmePte) are Her-mes’s, at the spAndonteß eDxamesua(as we pour libations, let us pray), the edi-tor stops cold, and gives the difficult lines to the choregos. This even though, first,the entire, tightly knit dialogue up to the enactment of the libation has takenplace exclusively between Trygaeus and Hermes and, second, the entire importof the scene is that Hermes has been persuaded by Trygaeus to pour a libationand pray to the gods that the goddess Peace may be hauled up from her pit, in re-turn for which he will receive exclusive honors at festivals previously dedicated toother gods: the Great Panathenaia (Athena), the Dipolieia (Zeus), the Mysteries(Demeter and Persephone), and the Adonia (Adonis and indirectly, Aphrodite).“Hermes can scarcely himself pray,” Platnauer reassures us. “The lines are bestgiven to the coryphaeus; see app. crit.”39But the scholion on line 433 (toytoajAoysi tbn ÛErmpnlAgein,They claim that Hermes says this is the speaker ofthis) says the opposite.40The dilemma that Hermes’s libation presents the religious historian iscomplex. Hermes acts as a mortal by pouring out the libation on behalf of thecommunity, but then names himself as a recipient. At least one editor specu-lates that he drinks from the bowl when he says his own name, then pours a li-bation to the Graces, to the Seasons, and to Aphrodite, and to Pothos.41Is hethen acting as a mortal celebrant or, despite his narcissistic motives, as a godimportuning other gods? Brigitte Eckstein-Wolf, whose interpretation of sacri-ficing gods we will consider in chapter 4, claims that if Hermes pours, “hepours with Trygaeus and his associates to “the gods,” that is, all the gods exceptfor himself, [since he has] already placed himself on the side of themortals....The entire (construct of an) ambitious and therefore libation-pouring Hermes is thus a joke on the part of Aristophanes...therefore thesituation is to be rejected in any attempt at an interpretation of the divine liba-tion scenes.”42Gerhard Neumann takes just the opposite view, rebuttingEckstein-Wolf: Hermes most appropriately pours as a god to other gods: “Thesituation in Aristophanes Pax423 ff. gives us to understand the cultic sphereas the central domain of the association of the gods with one another, at leastin the classical period, if one does not take it as a joke of the author like BrigitteEckstein-Wolf.”43Ironically, this discussion clearly circles back to one of thecentral problems set forth by the vases: When the gods pour libations, are theyacting like people or like gods? It should be evident by now that to come downon either side brings with it a swarm of theoretical difficulties. Let us thenleave Hermes with his cherished golden phiale and press on to another divineoffering in comedy.In Latin literature we find the sacrificing god as the catalyst of domestic up-roar and the focus of satire. A raucous Jupiter, in disguise, pours libations andperforms sacrifices to himself in Plautus’s Amphitruo,written in the early sec-ond century B.C.E. The premise of the play is that the father of gods and mortals,108ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"lusting after the matron Alcmena, assumes the shape of her absent husbandAmphitryon while he is away defending Thebes. This predictably leads to an up-roar between the cuckolded mate and his wife, now pregnant with Herakles,when he returns. At lines 931–934, Jupiter, in disguise as Amphitryon, takes anoath by Jupiter (himself ); and at lines 966–983, the bogus “head of household”is obliged to perform the rites which he says he promised (at lines 946–947) ifhe returned home safely from battle.44These sacrifices as well will be offeredto—whom else?—Jupiter. The irony of this is not lost on the jolly deity as he am-bles around stage amid the wreckage of his mortal subjects’ lives. Jupiter tellshis gleeful servant Sosia (actually his son the god Mercury, also in on the fun), “Iwill perform that sacred offering inside which I vowed (ego rem divinam intus fa-ciam, vota quae sunt).”45He then commands Sosia to divert Amphitryon duringhis dalliance with Alcmena, and orders him to manage this as the servantknows he would want it; Sosia should “minister to me while I am sacrificing tomyself (atque ut ministres mihi, mihi quom sacruficem).”46The comic mechanism of this particular scene revolves around an absurdlyself-conscious portrayal of divine reflexivity. But it also underscores the pointthat, at least in comedy, the ancients regarded the imagined “sacrificing god”with the same ironic awareness that we might today. Rather than accepting offer-ings from groveling mortals while watching from an apex of remote splendor,a deity is caught up in a routine cultic action as it is performed on earth. Heseems to manipulate the action, to pull the very strings that facilitate his own gift-getting. Plautus’s play is the only instance in which it is specifically stated that thegod is pouring libations to himself, and that occurs in disguise as part of a farce.An explicit ancient comment on what was notappropriate for a god to doin the sphere of ritual appears in a short tractate by Plutarch called De defectuoraculorum(On the Obsolescence of the Oracles), dating circa 100 C.E. The readeroverhears an imagined symposium between five young intellectuals. In aquasi-doctrinal commentary thinly disguised as debate (an exegetical tech-nique favored by its author), they discuss an apparently burning issue in theGreece of their time: Why had so many long-hallowed oracles lost their powerand become moribund?Among the shrines of interest to the speakers is the famous temple of Apolloat Delphi, where the discussion takes place and where Plutarch himself served asa priest for thirty years. The character Cleombrotus angrily criticizes the tradi-tional aetiology of the Pythian oracle on the slopes of Mount Parnassus. Healso expresses his disgust with the tradition that Apollo had to flee and purifyhimself by pouring libations after the slaying of the Python: “For it is altogetherabsurd, my dear companion, for Apollo, after having slain a beastly creature, toflee to the ends of Greece needing purification (cgnismoPdeamenon) and thereto pour certain libations (xoaß tinaß xePsuai) and to perform those [rites]which people perform in order to make expiation and soothe the wrath of spiritswhom they call ‘the tormenting ones’ and ‘the blood-avengers,’ as if (those spir-its) were prosecuting the memories of some unforgotten, bygone acts of pollu-tion.”47Cleombrotus waxes even more scornful: “And the tale which I’ve alreadyheard about this flight and the removal from one place to another is terribly“terribly strange and paradoxical”109"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"strange and paradoxical (gtopoß mAnDsti deinpßkaBparadojoß) indeed; butif it contains any particle of truth, let us not suppose what was done in thosetimes about the oracle to have been any small or common affair.”48On the basis of the antiquity and ubiquity of this myth, and the commonoccurrence of tales in which the gods slaughter other creatures,49a strong casecan be made that it is notthe concept of a divine murder that outrages theyoung philosopher but rather the need for divine atonement in the form of li-bations. In the passage immediately preceding his outburst, Cleombrotusspeaks of the ritual reenactment of this tale, a poorly attested festival known asthe Septerion. A small boy, accompanied by the torch-bearing “Labyadai,” mustset fire to a wooden structure on the “threshing-floor” at Delphi, endure “wan-derings and servitude” across the wastes of Greece just as Apollo did, culmi-nating in “the purifications that take place at Tempê (oEte gignamenoi perBtbTAmph kauarmoA)”—the valley of Tempê in Thessaly. This was where Apollowas supposed to have fled after slaying the snaky Python.50Perhaps even more sharply than on the murder itself, Plutarch’s attentionis focused on the unacceptability of the idea of divine atonement for blood-guiltiness. Cleombrotus implies that a god does not himself require purifica-tion. Certainly he does not need to pour expiatory libations. Finally, he insiststhat if this unimaginable sequence did in fact occur, then one ought never con-sider it normal divine behavior. Thus at least one ancient source testifies thatthe idea that a god might enact a religious ritual typically performed by a mor-tal seems profoundly strange.Or does it? Perhaps it is not Apollo’s libation itself, but the one-time atone-ment for a “historical murder” that is problematic. This will become a crucialdistinction when, in chapter 4, we encounter the theory of Erika Simon, whoholds that virtually all depictions of the libating Apollo in the second half of thefifth century had as their aetiology this myth. One objection emerges immedi-ately: Cleombrotus refers to Apollo’s alleged libations as xoaA, blood-guilty of-ferings poured into the ground to appease the underworld powers. Yet the ma-jority of vase-paintings depict Apollo pouring from a phiale onto an altaroroccasionally an omphalos: Apollo is pouring Olympian spondaA, ritually thepolar opposite of xoaA.The Plutarch passage is also important on another level: It indicates apoint of myth concerning the gods beyond which the character in the discus-sion simply will not go; it violates his theological threshold. It is too absurd forhim to stomach. This repulsion has to do with his own understanding of thenature of a god, and what is appropriate (or even possible) for any god to do. Itis a theological dilemma that spans both ancient and modern worlds.51Animal Sacrifice by GodsMost notorious of Greek sacrificial aetiologies is the archaic account of the sac-rifice of the trickster god Prometheus in Hesiod’s Theogony535–561. The Titanretains the meat of an ox for himself while setting before the supreme god110ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Zeus its bones, covered with fat, “and since then the tribes of men upon earthburn white bones to the deathless gods upon fragrant altars (DktoPd›duana-toisinDpBxuonBfPl›dnurapvn/kaAoys›dstAa leykbuyhAntvnDpBbvmpn).”52Prometheus is, of course, a Titan, one of the older generationsoverthrown by Zeus.Zeus is enraged by Prometheus’s sleight-of-hand, yet the story becomes inGreek religious history the prototypical sacrifice, explaining forevermore whythe gods get only the savor of the roasting meat, while the mortals get the meat.But does the narrator understand this event as cult, or Prometheus’s actions asa sacrifice? Curiously, except for the concluding word bvmpn(altar), the ac-count contains no language that is explicitly connected with cult.Analogous to the sacrifice of Prometheus, although perhaps not as aetio-logical (and certainly more generous) is the sacrifice of the newborn Hermes tothe twelve Olympians in that god’s Homeric Hymnat 128–133. Dating from themid-sixth century B.C.E., this text offers the biography of a divine child. The in-fant Hermes invents the tortoiseshell lyre, and sings upon it; he steals the cat-tle of Apollo, and discovers fire in the course of slaughtering two of them,“clearly a Twelve-God sacrifice of a kind later recorded at Olympia.”53When the“curved-horned bellowing cows” have been pierced in the spine, and their fattedmeat hacked out, Hermes roasts their meat, the chine, and dark blood together.54The skins were stretched out on hard, dry rock, thenHermes, rejoicing in his heart, dragged the rich cutsonto a smooth, flat stone and divided them into twelve portions,distributed by lot.

In mundane Olympian sacrifice, as in this supramundaneoffering by Hermes, the gods get their portions, are assigned “perfect honour,”and deeply inhale the burning aroma.How, if at all, are the actions of the Titan Prometheus and the infant Her-mes related to the human choreography of sacrifice? It may be obvious to usthat extant practices created the shape of the story; in other words, that the shapeof mortal worship influenced that of its contructed immortal form. But does thestory know that? How self-conscious is the myth? Karl Kerényi comments onthese two divine sacrifices, “a sacrifice presupposes sacrificers as well as re-ceivers, and Hesiod proceeds on the assumption that men are already in exis-tence, participating in the sacrifice. In the Homeric Hymn to Hermes(1–137), nomention is made of men as sacrificers. Often the sacrificers and the beneficiar-ies of sacrifice are identical. In...[Hermes],the identity is not even yet mystical,for the sacrifice is invented before the existence of men. Hermes did not repre-sent mankind, but Prometheus did.”58Nowhere does the Hymn to Hermesstate that human beings have not yetbeen created. It is true that Hermes acts like a mortal by sacrificing the cattleand roasting their meat. His hunger seems human enough. There is noquestion of his piety.59But Kerényi’s comments are germane in the sensethat we are reminded that no human beings are in fact involved in this sac-rifice, as they were at Mekone. Do the sacrificing gods represent humanity?Or do they, like Hermes, present their offering in a golden vacuum, elevat-ing the act to a higher plane, much as they raised battle and its wounds inthe Iliad?60Are they overgrown devotees, or are they as remote from themechanisms of earthly sacrifice as Artemis is from the death throes of heronce adored Hippolytus?61Hermes is a deity with chthonian associations. But this is an Olympian sac-rifice. As Apostolos Athanassakis has observed, since this sacrifice takes place inthe morning, and involves slabs of sheer meat, with no grains or fruits, and as itis “both propitatory and expiatory,” it cannot be called a chthonian sacrifice. Su-san Shelmerdine maintains that the Hermes episode emerges with features thatare more those of a daAß(feast) than a sacrifice. Shelmerdine sees Hermes’s“preparation of this feast for the twelve gods” as “another part of his plan to wina place of equal honor among the gods through a challenge of and reconciliationwith Apollo.”62As a god, Hermes is even greatly affected by the “sweet savour” of his feastor sacrifice. Athanassakis ponders, “[S]ome scholars have thought that Hermesdoes not eat the meat that he roasted to conform with the chthonian side of hischaracter. We know that victims were offered to him by Homer (Odyssey14.435;19.396–8). That Hermes does not eat meat is very strange, since it was a crav-ing for meat that made him steal the cattle. I am afraid that the reason behindthis curious behavior will elude us for quite some time.”63Might it be possible that Hermes does not eat the meat because, as oneof the gods, he knows that his portion is only the smell of the sacrificialsmoke? Hungry as he is, Hermes actually behaves like a god in abstaining112ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"from consuming the meat, but rather savoring the smoke—just as Zeus toldus in Iliad4.48–49 that the gods love to do. This highlights one of the centraltenets of the present work: the religious actions of the gods resemble butslightly differ from those of mortals and are appropriate to their other, divinestatus.Ritual Gestures Used by DeitiesAt least part of the iconographic problem of gods holding phialai in Greek art isthat it is unclear whether in the case of cult statues and certain of the images onvases, particularly those of Zeus, the gods stretch out their bowls so as to re-ceive the wine, and not to pour it back out again in a libation. Aristophanes’sBirdsmakes reference to the custom of placing a piece of sacrificial meat intothe outstretched hand of the god—that is, the hand of his or her cult statue.64Peisetaerus explains that when Zeus has an eagle on his head, Athena an owl,and Apollo a hawk, “It’s so that when someone sacrifices and then offers [lit.,gives] the entrails, as is the custom, into the hand of the god, they [i.e, the birds]themselves can take the entrails before the god [does].”65The question ofwhether the gods ever stretch out their hands to give or confer rather thanreceive something comes up in a later Aristophanic effort, Ecclesiazusae(As-sembly Women), written around 392 or 391 B.C.E. Athenian women take overrunning of the city and introduce community of property. When cajoled by anenthusiastic enforcer to bring his property in for distribution, Citizen refuses,saying that it is unlikely that anyone with common sense will comply and sur-render their goods. “That is not the custom; rather, it’s incumbent on us only totake, damn it! The gods are the same way. You’ll know from the hands of [their]statues, [that] whenever we pray [to them] to give us good things, they [never-theless] stand holding out their hands turned up, not so that they can give, butrather so that they can take something.”66The Disguised GodThe gods depicted pouring libations on classical vases are most naturally seenas having not simply a mortal but more explicitly a sacerdotal function. Al-though private citizens could and did sacrifice animals and pour libations tothe gods, the majority of these functions taking place at altars (as in our vases)called for the services of members of an institutionalized priesthood. Priests,dedicated to a particular god, conducted the services of both urban and ruralcult; priesthoods were sometimes hereditary and/or made for life, but far morefrequently were periodic appointments or elections from the prominent citi-zenry of a given community. In effect, when Apollo or Athena pours a libationat a flaming sacrificial altar, the deity is acting like a mortal priest. It is not sur-prising, therefore, that one of the dominant themes in literary testimonia forgods performing ritual actions is the “god in disguise” as a mortal, and frequentlyas a priest or priestess. The divinity plays the part of an intermediary on his orher own behalf, performing the actions of his or her own cult or carrying cult“terribly strange and paradoxical”113"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"implements. Rarely do things bode well for the mortal who meets the super-natural hierophant, as the god is often bent on destruction, revenge, or at leastsome kind of mischief.The theme of the disguised god appears in the Odysseypassage consideredabove in which Athena as Mentor prays to Poseidon and pours a libation, and inthe Plautus comedy featuring a hidden Jupiter. It becomes far more commonlater on, especially in the Hellenistic period, when with the advent of the di-vinized Macedonian rulers, the lines between human and divine status gener-ally underwent a metamorphosis. We know of the Hellenistic phenomenon ofthe uePoßdnar; the following passages treat the brateioß ueaß.A fifteen-line fragment of Aeschylus’s play Hydrophoroi, also called Semele(part of a tetralogy with Xantriae, Bacchae,andPentheus,produced with thesatiric The Nurses of Dionysos), preserves a Hera disguised as her own priest-ess, who collects offerings for the river nymphs of Argos.67Semele was in-duced by Hera (disguised as an old woman) to persuade her lover Zeus to ap-pear in his true form, as a thunderbolt. The Theban princess was incinerated,and Zeus snatched up the fetal Dionysos from her womb, sewing it into histhigh until the god was ready to be born. These are later versions of the myth;in Aeschylus’s time, as Hugh Lloyd-Jones points out, it would be natural forHera to appear disguised as a priestess, arriving in Thebes from Argos, thecenter of her worship.68Her speech praises the nymphs, “glorious goddessesfor whom I gather [offerings], / the life-giving children of Inachus the Argiveriverk[ydraBuea]A,aQsindgeArv, / ›Inaxon›ArgeAoy potamoPpaisBn bio-daroi[ß].”69In one of the more haunting instances of divine disguise, Euripides’s Bac-chae, the god Dionysos arrives as the missionary leader of a band of Asiaticmaenads at his maternal home of Thebes. Thus, unbeknownst even to hisfaithful maenads, the god masquerades as the chief celebrant of his own mys-teries, and leading the women in roaming celebrations on the mountains—thedreibasAa. He comes to establish his worship in the polis,and to prove to thehubristic king Pentheus “who now revolts against divinity (ueomaxeP), in me”70that Dionysos is “god indeed.”71And thus “[t]o these ends I have laid my deityaside and go disguised as a man (qnoEnek› eRdoß unhtbndllajaßGxvmorfant›Dmbn metAbalon eDßdndrbßfAsin).”72This ruse proves to be thedramatic engine of the play, and its unmasking the climactic religious revela-tion at the end when Dionysos returns to pronounce sentence on the sacrile-gious Thebans.73Self-conscious literary pieces meant for recital to a select audience ratherthan devotional hymns meant for use in worship, the Hymnsof Callimachus(305–240B.C.E.) nevertheless contain important religious information. In theHymn to Demeter(40–56), the goddess suddenly metamorphoses into her ownpriestess in order to defend her magical and beloved grove of trees in “holyDotium.”74Erysichthon, the brash son of the king Triopas, tries to destroy thegrove with twenty man-servants armed with axes. When the first tree “reachingto the sky” (aDuAri kPron) is struck, it shrieks in pain to the others.75Demeter114ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"hears the tree and asks with fury, “ ‘Who is cutting [down] my beautiful trees?”The hymn’s narrative continues, “At once she took the appearance of Nicippe,her public priestess appointed by the city, and took in her hand fillets and apoppy, and she held the key on her shoulder.”76In an encounter reminiscent of the warning that the priest Chryses deliv-ers to the hubristic Agamemnon in Iliad1, Callimachus’s Demeter-in-disguise,a “priestess” holding symbols sacred to her own cult, thrice warns violentErysichthon to desist. He looks at her with the fierceness of a lioness who hasjust given birth, and threatens to kill her, claiming that he wants the tree tobuild a great banquet hall, where he plans to sate his comrades continually withdelicious feasts.77“Unspeakably angry,” Demeter changes her form back tothat of a goddess (geAnato d› aRueAß).78She curses the leader of the tree-murdering tribe with a limbnaGuvna, a “hellishly burning hunger” that driveshim to feast continually—a hideous parody of his original arrogant desire—and literally to eat his parents out of house and home.The religious reciprocity between gods and human beings during theHellenistic period produces a curious phenomenon in inscriptions from thatperiod found in Bulgaria, Edessa, and in Asia Minor: Gods are listed as hold-ers of their own eponymous priesthoods.79A fourth-century B.C.E. inscriptionfrom Dionysopolis in Thrace, initially misunderstood as listing Bacchic initi-ates (mAstaioruiasptai), is instead a list of eponymous priests of Dionysos,if one accepts the reconstruction of G. Mihailov for its title: [oEdeCArhn]taiDionAsoy metbtoBßCerhsamAnoyß dibbAoy(these are priests of Dionysosafter [i.e., replacing] those who are priests for life).80On a partially preservedpair of columns of names that give names and patronyms (for example, Col-umn B, Line 6 gives [P]edieBß ÛΥgiaAnontoß), one reads the single name Di-anysoß. Gods are known from other cities to hold eponymous magisterialoffice as king, archon, hipparch, prytanis, demiurge, and hieromnamon (thesacred recorder sent by each Amphictyonic state to their collective council).81But in this case, “the god was—in an undoubtedly difficult year—his ownpriest.”82Other examples exist: In the case of the stefanhfaroi, the “crown-wearing” magistrates at Miletos, Iasos, Amyzon, and elsewhere, “the epony-mous magistrates have a very apparent sacerdotal character and one could saythat in these cities the eponymous Apollo is his own priest.”83Robert believesthat the list of priests of Dionysos in Dionysopolis is also a list of eponymousmagistrate priests, and that is why, since a mortal could not be found to fulfillone of the slots, the god himself was named. When Akornion finally filled thepriesthood “after many years,” he was taking the place on the list of Dionysoshimself. This phenomenon cannot be separated from the deities serving aseponymous archons and such, but the sacerdotal nature of the appointmentdeserves special attention for this inquiry. Perhaps this may be seen as the nat-ural development of the mentality that allowed the “sacrificing gods” in thefifth century: If the gods can act like priests, then they can also hold priest-hoods.“terribly strange and paradoxical”115"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"LEGOMENA: Ritual Oaths and Prayers Spoken by the GodsGreek literature from the epic, archaic, and classical periods reveals several in-stances of gods who paradoxically use formulaic religious expressions—sometimes invoking their own power, and sometimes naming powers otherthan themselves. These divine oaths represent, and like the preceding pas-sages, effectively cast the gods in the role of “pious” individuals. But what kindof piety is the gods’ own?In the Iliadand the Odyssey,the Olympians swear by each other, the head ofZeus, and the waters of the Styx. In Iliad14.271–279, Sleep demands that Heracall on Kronos and the gods below to witness her oath that she will grant himPasithea, one of the younger Graces, as his wife:So she spoke, and Sleep was pleased and spoke to her in answer:“Come then! Swear it to me on Styx’ ineluctable water.With one hand take hold of the prospering earth, with the othertake hold of the shining salt sea, so that all the undergodswho gather about Kronos may be witnesses to us.Swear that you will give me one of the younger Graces,Pasithea, the one whom all my days I have longed for.”He spoke, nor failed to persuade Hera of the white arms,and she swore as he commanded, and called by their names on all thosegods who live beneath the Pit, and who are called Titans.84In the Homeric Hymn to Pythian Apollo,Hera actually prays to the Titans for achild apart from Zeus, and both before and after the prayer “lashes the earthwith her stout hand (Emase xuana xeirBpaxeAi),” a standard gesture of suppli-cation to the underworld deities.85The text of her prayer hearkens back to Iliad14.271–279:Then forthwith mighty, cow-eyed Hera prayedand with the flat of her hand struck the ground and spoke:“Hear me now, Earth and broad Sky above,and you Titans from whom gods and men are descendedand who dwell beneath the earth round great Tartaros.Harken to me, all of you, and apart from Zeus grant me a child,in no wise of inferior strength; nay, let him be strongerthan Zeus by as much as far-seeing Zeus is stronger than Kronos.”86InIliad15.36–40, Hera swears to Zeus (that she has had no part in afflictingHektor and the Trojans) by earth and heaven, and “the dripping waters of theStyx, which oath is the biggest and most formidable oath among the blessedimmortals,” the sanctity of Zeus’s own head, and their marriage bed.87InOdyssey5.184–186, Kalypso swears that she is not plotting against Odysseus byearth and heaven and the waters of the Styx, using the same formula.

As Gregory Nagy has expressed it, “the waters of the Styx arean elixir of life.”90We come to the heart of the matter in Hesiod’s Theogony793–805, where we hear of the high cost of oath-breaking among the eternalones; the poet tells us that “whoever of the deathless gods that hold the peaks ofsnowy Olympus pours a libation (dpolleAcaß) and is forsworn, lies breathlessuntil a full year is completed.”91The perjured god lies stricken in an “eviltrance” (kakbn...kpma) for a year, unable to be nourished by ambrosia ornectar, and is ostracized from the gods’ councils and feasts for a full nine yearsafter that. “Such an oath, then, did the gods appoint the eternal and primaevalwater of Styx to be.”92So the Styx is not only invoked in divine oaths; it is actu-ally poured out in the libations of the gods, just as libation accompanies mortaloaths. But there the mirror image ends: if their oaths are broken, the Olympiansface supernatural punishment of inhuman proportions, for they, the holiest ofbeings, have dipped their bowls into the holiest of rivers.The gods who pray and swear in the preceding passages clearly do not in-voke their own power, but that of other numinous entities. The examples inwhich “earth” powers are invoked once again raise the question we encoun-tered in chapter 1: Are we dealing with a hierarchy that envisions the old,chthonian divine order as more powerful than the newer, Olympian one, andthus able to guarantee the oaths of the gods? Are Kronos and the overthrownTitans, or the underworld in general—the world of the river Styx—more pow-erful than Zeus, his sister, and their offspring? Does Hera pray to the under-world powers in the Hymn to Apollobecause they can grant what Zeus cannot,or because she wishes to circumvent him? If the former, then this might pro-vide a possible explanation as to whom the gods are pouring libations in thevase-paintings. If the latter, then we must look elsewhere for answers to ouriconographic question.In the comic fantasy by Aristophanes, Birds, the birds are coaxed by theAthenian Peisetaerus to build a kingdom in the sky, and the gods are lampooned.Poseidon responds to one of the con artist’s ideas by swearing to himself:poseidon:“By Poseidon, you’re really hitting the nail on the head!”(nbtbn Poseidp,taPtagAtoi kalpßlAgeiß; lit: you’re saying thesethings well indeed!).93We laugh at this 2,400 years later, but why?

Bothtreat deified mortals who offer to themselves. Strabo, a Peripatetic historianfrom Pontus (64/3 B.C.E.–C.E. 21), became a Stoic whose writings tend towardskepticism on religion.94He quotes Artemidorus’s account of the visit ofAlexander the Great to Ephesus in Geography14.1.22 (C641). Alexander offersto pay for the restoration of the great temple of Artemis (which had beenburned by an ancient arsonist, Herostratus) “on the condition that the inscrip-tion should bear his name (as benefactor) (Df›Qte tbnDpigrafbnaDtbnGx-ein).” However, “they did not want this, just as they would have wanted evenless to seek glory by the robbing of temples and fraud. And he [Artemidorus]praises the Ephesian who said to the king [Alexander] that it would not be ap-propriate for a god to set up votive offerings to the gods (cßoDprApei ueuueoPßdnauamata kataskeyazein).”95This unctious episode describes Eph-esian pandering, or else could be interpreted as propaganda on the part ofArtemidorus. But no more explicitly negative answer could be given by an an-cient source to one of our initial questions: In ancient Greek religion, can a godbring offerings to another god?96Ironically, in the next passage (14.1.23) we find reference to a statue ofAlexander, the alleged god, making libations. Still paraphrasing Artemidorus,Strabo relates that Cheirocrates,97who completed the work on the Artemis tem-ple and was also the builder of Alexandreia, had apparently “promised Alexan-der to fashion [Mount] Athos into him [i.e., Alexander’s own image], [portray-ing him] as if pouring a libation from some kind of ewer into a phiale(CposxAsuai ›AlejandritbnˆAuv diaskeyasein eDßaDtan,csaneBDkpraxoy tinbßeDßfialhn kataxAonta spondan).”98The artist seemed to wantto incorporate the Macedonian ruler into the ubiquitous sculptural tradition ofthe god holding a libation vessel. We cannot be sure whether or not Alexanderwas already divinized when Cheirocrates made his promise. If he was not, thenthe Macedonian Mount Rushmore would depict Alexander the king in a colos-sal act of mortal worship. If he was in fact considered to be divine at the time,then an old ambiguity would be clarified: the god (Alexander) would explicitlybe pouring a libation (kataxAonta spondan) rather than merely extending alibation bowl. This would not be inconsistent with the import of Strabo’s previ-ous story about the scrupulous Ephesians.

Rejecting theAugustan principate for a more Hellenistic concept of monarchy and probablymentally ill to boot, Gaius’s career as emperor is chronicled by the political an-nalist Dio Cassius.99In the latter’s Roman history, written between 207–229 C.E,Gaius styled himself Jupiter Latiaris, making his wife Milonia Caesonia and“others who were wealthy” priests. The weirdness only escalates: “And more-over, he consecrated himself as a priest to himself and declared his horse to be aco-priest (kaBprosAti kaBaDtbßCaytuCerpto,tanteEppon synierAadpAfhne).”100Expensive birds were sacrificed (DuAonto) to him daily.In his Rituals and Power,a study of Roman imperial cult in Asia Minor,S.R.F. Price discusses the temple at Smyrna dedicated to Tiberius, whose cultstatue represented the emperor in a toga and perhaps with a veiled head. AsPrice notes, “the implication of the veiled head is that the emperor was shownas a priest.”101And as he further clarifies, “It might seem to break all the cate-gories to find the emperor as the object of cult himself shown as a priest andeven holding their sacrificial patera over an altar....But the gods often heldtheir own eponymous priesthoods...and are often shown making sacrificialofferings of this kind.”102The reflexive conflation and interchangeability of sac-rificial roles characterizing the imperial period was not an innovation, but drewfrom centuries of “breaking categories” in the ancient Mediterranean world.Gods had long behaved as priests when such an identification (already im-plicit) suited their purposes.In the next chapter we will explore how other scholars have reacted to this“breaking of categories” represented by sacrificing gods.“terribly strange and paradoxical”119"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"4“Divine Libation”: A Centuryof DebateModern AnxietiesAncient literary descriptions of cult statues holding libation bowlsadd to our catalogue of evidence, as well as give us a sense of theubiquity of this type. But they do not tell us whythe gods were carvedin stone or cast in bronze holding the phiale. As we have seen inchapter 3, occasions of divine libation in ancient literature are sparseand problematic: burlesques, stylized anomalies, and didactic philo-sophical tracts. With the possible exception of Hermes’s libation inAristophanes’s Peace,they also seem strangely divorced from the vi-sual evidence; neither myth, nor hymn, nor drama reflect the vase-paintings, and the reverse is also true. Thus we are forced to interpretthese surviving images on their own terms. However paradoxical tous, this divine behavior existed in the ancient Greek religiousimagination—and not at the periphery. What if we momentarily al-low the problem of divine libations to become central, rather thanperipheral—and to direct our questions about ancient Greek sacri-fice? How many of our categories must be revised?One of the recurrent aspects of this paradox as it is treated in thesecondary literature is that the sacrificing god seems to challenge, oreven to threaten, fundamental notions of what an ancient Greek godmight be. Later, in other religious traditions, we will find that the godas ritual participant emerges as not only natural but theologically es-sential.

Or does “theproblem” reside purely with our own limitations, and not with the serene eyesand golden bowls of the Olympians or their creators, the long-dead potters andpainters whose kilns clustered at the gates of the Kerameikos? As Paden puts it,“Other worlds and other gods do co-exist with our own world and our owngods, and they are threatening precisely because they have a different set ofpremises from ours and thus explicitly or implicitly call into question the ab-soluteness of our own assumptions and commitments.”1In this case, our spe-cific commitments may be to the hierarchy of sacrifice that wehave ascribed toancient Greek religion.That hierarchy is laid out in the principle of do ut des. More elegantly, Por-phyry’s PerBdpoxpßDmcAxvn(On Abstinence), a work of the third centuryC.E., preserves the beliefs of the late classical philosopher Theophrastus thattripnEneka uytAon toPß ueoPß(there are three reasons to sacrifice to the im-mortal gods): ggbrdibtimbngdibxaringdibxreAan tpndgaupn(for thesake of honoring them, or to express gratitude, or in order to receive certainbenefits).2Simply expressed, the individual or the community gives somethingto the god, who in turn confers favor or protection. The gods usually appear inworks on Greek religion as the gracious if somewhat detached recipients of sac-rificial offerings, whether on Olympus, embodied in cult image, or manifest insudden epiphany. They, in turn, confer favor or protection on the sacrificing in-dividual or community. The boundaries of canonical sacrificial roles have beenviewed as static, not fluid.3In the words of Jean-Pierre Vernant, “This presenceof the gods in the entire universe, in social life, and even in men’s psycholog-ical life, does not mean that there are no barriers between the divine and themortal creatures; indeed the barriers not only exist but are, in a sense, insur-mountable. The gods are a part of the same universe as men but it is a universewith a hierarchy, a world of different levels where it is impossible to pass fromone to another.”4This group of solemn gods from the mind of the Berlin Painter confrontsus with apparent anarchy. The fluid sacrificial activity challenges receivedopinion; and the “barriers” invoked by Vernant are dissolved in a powerful re-versal. Gods worship as mortals do. They join them at the level of obeisance. Toworship, as we understand the term, implies a recipient who is superior. Butwho is superior to the Olympians? Thus the barriers have become perme-able, in a way that extends far beyond the well-known visits of the immortalsto earth to rape, kill, or carry off mortals. Who, then, has invaded whose realm?Are the gods made more human by pouring libations? Or does it becomeclearer that human beings are projecting their needs and acts onto the world ofthe gods, up to and including even the practice of cult? Does the human actof libation make the gods seem closer to the human, or farther away andmore remote? Why are the gods themselves offering? By worshiping, are theyrendered, oxymoronically, as contingent omnipotency? And above all, to whomdo they offer? Scholars have responded to such questions with a range of con-tradictory answers.122ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The history of classical scholarship concerning this problem commandsattention in that it evokes much larger questions about what has been consid-ered normative in ancient Greek religion. The reactions of those who have writ-ten on this theme reinforce a sense of an unknown country; they have found itstrange or even disturbing.5Writing years after the explanations offered byscholars of the caliber of Erika Simon and Martin Nilsson, Eugene Lane stillcan comment on the Hellenistic god Mên, “it is clear that Men is holding a pa-tera for libations. This is a type which, as is well known, goes far back in An-cient Greek iconography, particularly numismatic....Still, I do not knowwhether it has ever been satisfactorily explained why a godshould be pouringlibations.”6The discussion that follows bears witness to the confusion that has at-tended efforts to interpret these images. With some exceptions, two intellectualtendencies prevail. In the first place, one notes a real reluctance on the part ofclassical scholars to confront or analyze the anomaly. Comments dating fromthe late nineteenth century onward are characteristically brief, and are some-times included almost as an afterthought to a more general discussion of liba-tion or the larger theme of sacrifice. More common, however, is an aside—a“stab in the dark” at an explanation of this religious phenomenon—in thescholarly publication of a particular artifact or group of artifacts that happen tofeature the libating gods theme.Perhaps for this reason, explanations tend to be dismissive. However, onemight also argue that their brevity and almost offhand tone illustrate the fact that“Otherness is a challenge that has always been met through the self-defensive ac-tivity of interpretation. The typical response to otherness—or foreignness—is todefuse it by explaining it in some fashion.”7The history of reluctance to ac-knowledge the importance and the admitted difficulty of the question of what Ihave termed “divine reflexivity” in fifth-century Greece is hard to understand inlight of the fairly extensive body of evidence left to us.Neglect tends to be accompanied by a second characteristic that is just asfrustrating: vagueness. Interpretations are often fragmentary in nature, answer-ing only one potential aspect of the question, “What can this mean?” Rather thanshedding light on whyit is so hard to offer a satisfactory answer, past scholarshiphas tended to lose itself in contradictory, non-historically specific generalizationsabout what developments in late archaic and early classical Greek religion couldhave precipitated this phenomenon.It is not my intention to offer yet another glib solution to a very difficultproblem. We may never be able to understand the mystery rendered by theBerlin Painter. In this chapter, I summarize and critique major interpretive ef-forts to date. Each scholar is aware of the work on divine libations precedinghim or her; each has responded to the hermeneutical challenge in a uniqueand nuanced way. Interpretive schools of thought into which the majorthinkers on the opfernde Göttermight be grouped do emerge.

Although the upper torso and head are missing, the arms andhands are feminine in aspect. Another figure (whose identity has also been lostsave an arm, hand, and a fraction of the entire vertical plane of the standingbody), also delicately rendered, fills the outstretched phiale with a wine jug.Furtwängler claimed that this scene depicted an offering poured out by Kore(Persephone) to Demeter. His explanation inaugurated a century of debateon the topic that would be almost exclusively dominated by German classicalscholars.10Furtwängler adamantly refuses to see any overtones of worship in the ges-ture he has isolated. He characterizes this particular scene as typical of an effort124ancient greek gods in ritual performancefigure 61.Libation scene: seated deity with scepter and phiale; standingdeity with oinochoe.

In the same league as Kore are grouped the “pouring” portrayalsof Nike, Iris, Hebe, Hygieia, Hermes-Kadmilos, Eros, the satyrs and maenads,and so forth. He connects this with the classical stone grave reliefs in which themother or sister of a dead hero brings him drink offerings at his tomb. In otherwords, the liquids are poured to the one who possesses a higher degree of sanc-tity than the one who pours. And the liquids are drinks. In no way should thegesture be thought of as prelude to mortal-style libation and prayer; he denies itany significance as an act of worship per se.12In Furtwängler’s time, of course, far fewer examples of offering gods assuch were known or studied. Subsequent analysis has revealed two importantfacts that contradict his fundamental premises. Foremost is the fact that we fre-quently find in both vase-paintings and reliefs a higher order of gods such asApollo, Artemis, Ares, and Athena holding phialai, as well as the highest godssuch as Hera and Zeus. So the phenomenon is not confined to members of theyounger, less empowered generation of gods such as Kore, Iris, or Hermes (allof whom, incidentally, ought not to be grouped so haphazardly with decidedlysupernatural creatures such as satyrs, or mercurial creatures such as maenads,who in any given image might potentially be construed as mortal). Second, thegods are in fact often depicted actually making libations, even (surprisingly)when they are enthroned.Furtwängler does mention cases of gods such as Apollo and Kore in admit-tedly religious actions by themselves, pouring spondaAnear altars. He accountsfor these as “a final consequence of the humanization of the gods, who now ap-pear as pious and in a certain sense conditioned beings.”13He is followed in thisby Christos Karouzos and Werner Fuchs, although Luschey only accepts his the-ory in the case of the guilty Apollo (see below).14Furtwängler locates the sourceof the motif in the iconographic influence of the epoch of Pheidias, with itsstrong tendency to “transfer to the gods typological scenes that have been formedon the basis of human circumstances.”15Thus, he explains, the ancient Greekseven went so far as to put libation bowls in the hands of cult statues, which di-rectly derived from their custom of depicting the higher gods as being serveddrinks by the younger gods. Since the gods poured for each other, human be-ings wanted to “imagine them (the gods) even offering libations.”16He does not say how this “final result” occurred from the supposedly nonre-ligious “enthronement” scenes found on the vase-paintings. However, it is clearfrom his language that he considers it somewhat of a degradation of the divine.The pure, deathless Olympian realm is compromised by mortals anxious todrag their gods down to their level by having them perform familiar activities,even religious ones. Yet the majority of the vase-paintings were executed beforePheidias was twenty years old. Neither of Pheidias’s monumental chrysele-phantine statues at Olympia or Athens held a phiale, nor do any of the gods inhis “humanizing” reliefs such as the seated retinue on the east frieze of theParthenon, generally thought to be reviewing the Panathenaic procession.17“divine libation”: a century of debate125"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Crucial in this early stage of the modern discussion is the notion of Übertra-gung(transference) of human ritual activity to the gods.18It arises from the fun-damental concept that human beings project their own attributes and behaviorsonto the divine, and that every representation of the divine always encodes thehuman habitus. Taken to its final conclusion, it has formed one of the more pow-erful arguments against the objective reality of a supreme being. It has formedthe stylobate for intellectual systems as stark as Marx’s dialectical materialismand as clinical as Freud’s theory of infantile, father-obsessed religiosity. Whetheridentified as “anthropomorphizing” the divine or “projecting onto” God attrib-utes of our own nature, the idea, which we trace in antiquity, has both anthropo-logical and theological aspects.Furtwängler’s hypothesis assumes that the phenomenon of transferencecan extend as far as worship. In other words, the immortals are seen by mortalsas imitating human behavior. The model is not one of humans aspiring to di-vine imitation (as is so often the case in the lore surrounding the ancient Greekhero). This explanation would also therefore imply that gods in the images weare considering, like people, worship the gods. However, as they arethe gods,the result is entrapment in a disturbingly circular idea. Circularity does notmake it wrong; but it is necessary to spell out its implications.One of the important problems with Furtwängler’s concept of a classical“moment” of Vermenschlichung der Götteris that the quality of “anthropomor-phism” in the ueoAhad been evident long before the period during which thesevases were painted.19That the gods seem to reflect human behavior and not theother way around was most radically expressed in the Homeric epics and Hes-iodic poetry, where the Olympians appear as subject to every aspect of humanfrailty, but on a titanic scale. In The Birth of Tragedy,Friedrich Nietzsche com-mented that they “justified human life by living it themselves—the only satis-factory theodicy ever invented.”20Centuries of Greek tradition proposed an in-sanely jealous Hera, a sex-addicted Zeus, a vicious Aphrodite, a churlish Ares,a thieving, lying Hermes. Although they have their moments of majesty, thesewere the gods of ancient Greece; they may have been exemplifying “humaniza-tion” as early as the thirteenth century B.C.E., if we are to believe the latest re-search in Homeric philology.21Not until the second half of the sixth century do alternative, sublimated reli-gious movements become visible in Greece: the archaic Orphic and Pythagoreancults centering on purity, the afterlife, mathematics, or music, and the earlypre-Socratic philosophers of Ionia such as Anaximander of Miletus and Hera-clitus of Ephesus, who began to build the first speculative bridges between reli-gion and science. Xenophanes of Colophon, whom we have mentioned, seesanthropomorphism in religion as degenerate. His complaints about the immoral-ity of the gods of Homer and Hesiod are notorious, supported by the claim thathuman beings fashion deities exactly in their own depraved image (see Intro-duction). Believing this to be a primitive phenomenon, he is not singling outhis own age in particular, but Olympian religion in general. And he precedesPheidias’s floruit by a century. Furtwängler does not address the question of126ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"why this phenomenon became so prevalent at this particular time. Why do thegods begin to sacrifice on so many Attic vases from 510 to 460 B.C.E.? TheirVermenschlichungsurely did not begin with the era of Pheidias.A captivating elaboration on the theme of Vermenschlichung der Götterwasadvanced by the noted classical art historian Karl Schefold in 1937, but with asomewhat different spin. He does agree with Furtwängler that mortal religiousbehavior has been transferred (übertragen) to the gods. However, rather thanmerely consisting of the pathetic spectacle of human beings ascribing their ownrituals to the divinities, the gods are presented as having also autonomously andcalmly assumed human ritualism.22Furthermore, once they have appropriatedan act of worship, as they do libation in the vase-paintings, that ritual act as-sumes a certain aura that it does not have when simply performed by mortals.Schefold’s comments are characterized by a degree of respect for these scenesthat is absent from those of his predecessor.As is typical of many others, Schefold makes his remarks in passing; theyoccur in the context of a long article concerning the treatment of cult images inthe fifth century. He correctly notes that the “living god” and his or her cultimage could appear in the same vase-painting during this period.23On a sub-tler and far more problematic plane, images that are not easily categorized arealso common. Their status is ambiguous. These show the god or goddess in thephysical attitude (and with a trace of the solemnity) typical of a cult image.However, they lack the stiff, staring quality that makes their identification ascult images certain; they seem to be rendered with an intentional flexibility. En-throned deities are the most obvious example, but standing examples are alsocommon.The focus of Schefold’s observations is an image of Zeus on a hydria by theProvidence Painter in Warsaw from about 460 B.C.E.(no. 45).24Seated on asplendid throne which in turn is depicted standing upon on a statue base, thegod holds a thunderbolt in his left hand, and in his right a phiale, into whichAthena is about to pour. Nike stands behind Zeus, ready to crown him with awreath. “The sacrifice and ceremony of the scene are transferred from the(realm of ) mortals to (that of ) the gods. No gestures are so powerful as the gen-tle movements from the calm tranquillity of these higher beings.”25Schefold’s brief remarks are important in two ways. He does not shrinkfrom calling the proceedings “sacrifice” and “ceremony.” For him, they areclearly religious in nature, although the scene would certainly fit Furtwängler’scriteria as that of a more powerful, older god being “served” by a younger onewho pours for him. He also touches on the supernatural atmosphere that sur-rounds these scenes, one of timeless omnipotence and calm. The very ordinary“gesture” of libation (which is what the ritual is called in the work by GerhardNeumann in 1965) assumes a special kind of power when the gods perform it.The ritual itself is elevated to a higher plane. This observation of Schefold’stouches on what I believe to be a crucial aspect of the “worshiping god” phe-nomenon not only in the ancient Greek but also in other religious traditions, aswill be shown.“divine libation”: a century of debate127"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The last word on the subject to date is also Furtwängler’s most recent intel-lectual heir. In a monograph by Karim W. Arafat, we have a specific treatment ofthe image of the libating Zeus in late Archaic and early Classical art.26The Zmneßof his study are divided into two groups: those which portray the Father of Godsand Mortals in libation scenes with Hera, and those which portray him pouringofferings alone.27Why are these scenes so perplexing and what do they mean? “It is impos-sible to know whether these matters were so unclear to the Greeks. Unlike(other vase-painting)...scenes, it is not immediately apparent what is hap-pening on these vases. But it may be that nothing is going on beyond the liba-tion that we see. There need be no reference to the hieros gamosor Theogamiaor other rite, cult, or festival. If there were such a reference, we might expect itto be made explicit, although it must be acknowledged that there is a differencebetween what would be explicit to us and what would be to a fifth-centuryGreek, particularly an Athenian.”28Arafat’s refusal to pinpoint the aitionfor a divine libation scene, thusallowing it to be just what it looks like, is similar to the priestly tone ofHimmelmann-Wildschütz, whose theory is discussed below. If it looks like a li-bation, why not simply let it be a libation, and look no further? Both reject ErikaSimon’s “detective” search for mythogical and sometimes real cultic allusionsin the art. Beyond that, however, he diverges sharply from any attempt to as-cribe special religious meaning to libations poured by the gods. Arafat seemsconvinced that a mountain has been made out of a molehill. “Libations wereeveryday events, the gods indulge in other everyday activities familiar to mor-tals (fighting, drinking, loving, etc.), so why need there be any implicit mean-ing to scenes of libations among the gods, without whom libations were, in anycase, unintelligible? This does not mean that libations were carried out casu-ally, however, and many of the scenes show a considerable deal of solemnity.”29In the work of Arafat and others, classical scholarship has seen a reassertion ofthe “humanization of the gods”; it is against this tendency that Mary Lefkowitzwrites (see Introduction). For Arafat, sacrifice is not a special category of divineactivity. He is willing to concede its “solemnity” as setting it apart from othermortal activities performed by the gods. Beyond that, he does not see why itshould be singled out by the scholars preceding him as having any particularmeaning.This attitude is typical of a purely archaeological approach to an icono-graphic problem. Reductionism is mistaken for objectivity. A serious theoreti-cal obstacle arises to our acceptance of Arafat’s structurally careless approach.Libation is notnormal, undifferentiated mortal behavior, in which the transac-tion is merely between mortals. Rather, it is an act of worship. The concept of“worship” brings with it the assumption of a hierarchy of offering:Mortals bringgifts to beings superior to themselves. We circle back to the vexing question: If“worship” as performed by the high gods means exactly what it does when per-formed by human beings, then what power would be an appropriate object ofthe gods’ worship? Who receives the religion of the gods?128ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The Phiale as Mediating Element between RealmsAnother broad school of thought seeks to find an answer to the question, “Whyare the high gods pouring out wine?” by focusing on the instrument of cult it-self, the libation bowl. Whatever their differences, these scholars agree on thecentrality of the sacrificial vessel (occasionally a kantharos, but usually a phiale)as the visual and ritual focus of the vase-paintings. According to this concep-tual approach, the vessel itself assumes the most importance in the image—serving as a kind of mediator between the realm of human and divine, or, inone case, between the gods themselves. The ritual itself, and its paraphernalia,are stressed as paramount; any mythological etiology for them is denied orminimized. It is interesting to contrast this line of thinking with that of ErikaSimon, which finds divine ritual libations as essentially meaningless withoutepisodic myth to illumine them. Although “myth-and-ritual” has often been ex-pressed as an interlocked idea in the history of religions, perhaps it is tellingthat a paradox such as a “sacrificing god” in art provokes the proponents ofeach to a polite brawl.A ritualistic focus first occurs in the thought of Heinz Luschey, who madethe important observation that the libation bowls in some sense belonged tothe gods who held them. In an entry written for the Supplement to the Pauly-WissowaReal-Encyclopädieover a decade after his Munich doctoral dissertationon the phiale, Luschey briefly interprets the iconography of the mysteriousphiale-bearing deities of the classical period.30He maintains that a natural de-velopment from the custom of pouring libations tothe gods out of ritual bowlswas the notion that the libation bowls themselves also actually belongedtothem.31Presumably it would then be a short logical leap to portray the god whoreceived the liquid offering as the one who held the phiale, the cult instrument,rather than the mortal who poured out the wine. In support of this line of rea-soning, Heinz Luschey invokes the passage in Iliad16.225–227 in which Achillesdedicates a certain golden goblet (dApaß) exclusively to libations to Zeus.32Heclaims that at the beginning of the fifth century B.C.E., phialai were added tosculpture depicting the gods, especially to cult statues, “as an expression of the[idea of ] the reception of libations, and later [as an expression] of [their] bestow-ing blessings.”33The idea of the transference of a cult instrument from devotee to deity isfascinating, but Luschey does not explain how we (and the phiale) are to makethe leap from the hand of the libating mortal to the hand of the receiving god.This argument depends heavily on the confinement of the motif of divinephiale-bearing to cult statues, and that is exactly where Luschey tries to keep it.One could concede that a ritual bowl might be added to an immobile, ceremo-nial cult statue as an attribute. But it does not explain why the god would beginto use it! The evidence we considered in chapter 2, from the late archaic Acrop-olis sherds on, shows more dynamic scenes of the gods actively pouring offer-ings, with red wine added on with paint as it splashes onto an altar or toward“divine libation”: a century of debate129"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"the earth. These are clearly not cult images. Luschey’s transition from the ideaof “the reception of libations” (which makes the deity passive, the one who ispoured to) to that of their “bestowing blessings” (in which the deity is active,the one who distributes, presumably by pouring) is facile. The first half of theargument appears to undermine the second.Sculptural dating shows that the god-with-libation-bowl theme becomesprominent in sculpture as early as the late sixth century (e.g., nos. 1–3); al-though the Piraeus Apollo discovered in 1959, and the Halos deposit found atDelphi (with the libating Apollo) the same year as Die Phialewas published,may have been unknown to Luschey, he also does not seem to take the vase-paintings into account. The scene of Dionysos pouring wine from a kantharosonto a burning altar by the Nikosthenes Painter in Boston discussed in chapter2 appears as early as 510 B.C.E.(no. 9; Fig. 35).34Reliefs do not pick up thetheme until the last quarter of the fifth century, and libating gods are especiallyprominent in reliefs of the fourth century. In the case of these reliefs (as in no.228, showing the Brauronian Artemis greeting a throng of worshipers) we mayin fact be dealing with a cult image, but it is very hard to distinguish betweenwhat portrays a statue and what a “living god,” as Schefold’s work shows.Perhaps in response to Furtwängler’s stance, Luschey maintains that “ahumanization of divinity” can only be properly attributed in the case of the rit-ual atonement for Apollo’s slaying of the Pytho.35His main argument lies inthe concept of transference from the human to the godly sphere. This is notsimply transference of the general behavior of worshiping. For Luschey, it is ac-tually symbolized by the transfer of the phiale itself, from mortal to immortalhand.Due to its timing, an important article by Brigitte Eckstein-Wolf was ob-scured to a large extent by the meteor of Erika Simon’s Opfernde Götter.36Eckstein-Wolf saw the phiale as a symbol or signifier of the connection betweenhumanity and the majestic, remote gods of fifth-century Attica. For her, the li-bation bowl added a new dimension to the images of the gods, but only as anattribute borrowed from the human realm.37A bell krater from Syracuse depicts Artemis and Leto flanking the citharodeApollo who stands holding a phiale; Ganymede, Hermes, and a deer are also inattendance (no. 193). Eckstein-Wolf rejects the concept of each god sacrificing tothat god who surpasses him or her in power, mirroring a normal human hier-archy, since there always remains the thorny challenge of the libating Zeus.Nor, she claims, should we think of Apollo’s libation as a thank-offering after acitharodic victory, even though he holds the lyre. She accounts for the laurelwreath that Artemis is about to set on Apollo not as a victor’s crown but simplyas a special expression that renders him honor. “But then the question remains,to whom is the god pouring?”38Although in this vase-painting the wine is clearly visible as it flows fromthe slanted bowl, Eckstein-Wolf insists that if we focus with intention on thebowl, we will arrive at a strange conclusion. “Apollo is certainly not pouringthe wine out. Rather, he holds the bowl gently, and without his action, the wineflows onto the ground. The assumption that Apollo would be depicted in the130ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"act of a libation seems highly unlikely. The bowl is pouring libations, not the god:“Die Schale spendet, nicht der Gott” [italics mine].39Eckstein-Wolf ’s radical claim is that not the divinity but the bowl was pour-ing the libations we see clearly flowing out. The god’s portrait, the old archaic di-vine “image of existence” (which she called Seinsbild) was transformed into anaction image in classical times. Despite such a change in the content, she ar-gues, the form was not affected. “The libation utensil appears as an attribute”;rather than a separate mythological aitionfor each case, the same idea underliesallthe offering divinities.40The phiale assumes a pivotal mediating role, just likethe frequently appearing winged sacrificial ministrant, Nike: “[T]he phiale as aholy cult apparatus of drink offering has a part in both spheres: the human aswell as the divine, which it is Nike’s duty to bind together.”41Here she antici-pates the views of Herbert Hoffman, discussed in chapter 1, of the phiale as akind of magical, autonomous cultic emblem that can bring realms together.In Eckstein-Wolf ’s decisive vision, however, divine libation clearly derivesits meaning from human libation. The ceremony of libation thus becomes afluid connector between gods and mortals. The gods sacrifice in a kind of “sec-ond dimension or sphere,” which makes clear that the divine is a realm apartfrom the human; paradoxically, a human ceremony is the vehicle for this parti-tion. But then Eckstein-Wolf strays into deeper waters. She says that the pres-ence of a human cult instrument, the bowl, in the hand of the god “thus showsthat he has attained a new, peaceful loftiness as the result of a greater distancefrom humanity, but that nevertheless a relationship with human beings be-longs to his being.”42Eckstein-Wolf believes that the instant in which the godswere depicted holding the phiale ushered in a development no less significantthan the classical separation of the human from the divine realms. Accordingto her reasoning, the alliance must first be evidenced, if the dissolution is to befulfilled. “The libation images of the gods unite both images in themselves: thebowl in the hand of the god assures a new, peaceful loftiness out of the greaterdistance....The bowl of the gods is the expression of the distance and a si-multanous striving towards nearness, and it is no accident that the floruitoflibation depictions of the gods coincides with the floruitof the divinities ren-dered as statues, [as well as] with the depiction of human libation and that ofthe ministrant Nike.”43“Nah ist und schwer zu fassen der Gott,” as FriedrichHölderlin wrote in his poem “Patmos”—“the god is so near and yet so difficultto grasp.”44Eckstein-Wolf ’s theoretical reasoning is a closed circle. To accept any oneof its results, one must accept all of its premises. The notion that the images ofdivine libation of the fifth century “unite two conflicting poles in themselves” isproblematic because there is no evidence from the history of Greek religionthat such poles existed.45Gerhard Neumann rightly points out that the gods in classical art adoptmany gestures of reverence or of prayerful awe (sAbein). He examines gesturesin vase-painting, including those adopted by gods. One good example is the mor-tal gesture of raising the index finger with the other fingers folded, indicatingreverence or awe before altar or statue of deity.46Like the gesture of libation,“divine libation”: a century of debate131"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"this was not confined to mortals. In the archaic period, vase-painting saw Her-akles transformed from a boastful character to an unmistakably solemn and pi-ous one through his cultic gestures, like the raised index finger and libation.47In first half of the fifth century, Herakles approaches the gods during his in-duction into Olympus using the former gesture.48As we have seen in chapter2, he is also depicted pouring libations originating from an oinochoe held byhis divine patroness, Athena.49In a black-figure vase in Naples, Apollo uses thegesture of two raised fingers toward an altar.50Such a human gesture of rever-ence used by a god indicates a special warning that the temenos area is near, aswell as the solidarity of the gods toward one another. Neumann sees divine li-bation in classical times as expressing relation between the deities. They adopta human means of communication between themselves, that is, a conventionalgesture.According to Neumann, the change in Herakles’s iconography indicatesthat cultic gesture has been elevated to the solemn and social customs of thegods.51The gods often use such gestures toward each other. When they do, “itreflects the relations of the gods to one another under the auspices of culticform.”52Neumann’s “reductionist” approach to votive gestures can illumineour thinking about the gods who sacrifice, if we accept these representations“as an agreed-upon mutual expression of the bond among the gods betweeneach other as denizens of Olympus.”53In this sense, the special cultic gestures can, in the case of divinity, beunderstood as an analogy to the elementary conventions of humans,which are governed by practical rules. From this perspective, theproblem of “libating gods” may be seen in a new light. The libation ofthe god, too, can be considered as a conventional expression of theconnection and solidarity of the gods as denizens of Olympus. How-ever, it remains as a question whether in each special case the holything, the altar, beside the other god honored through thesegestures—and independently of him—should also be paid reverence.Such an interpretation would be consistent with that [line of think-ing] according to which the act of libation can be rendered indepen-dently.”54Neumann cites contemporary literature of the period as making clear thatthe conventions of the cultic realm had been elevated to the realm of the gods.It is noteworthy, however, that he denies that the religious overtones of thatrealm have in any way affected the Olympians, even when they adopt its con-ventions. They might as well be pouring each other cups of tea.Although a lifelong focus of the thought of Zurich’s Walter Burkert hasbeen ancient Greek sacrifice, he exhibits relatively little interest in classicalscenes of divine libation, beyond the acknowledgment that they are, indeed, apuzzle.55His view of libation, as we noted in chapter 1, is problematic. Al-though he recognizes the antiquity and ubiquity of the ritual and concedes that“libations which the earth drinks are destined for the dead and for the godswho dwell in the earth,” as we have seen, he finds it odd that the Olympian132ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"gods could not conceptually receive any of the liquid; it was lost forever.56Thismay be closely related to his view of the “fundamental sense of libation: raisingto hope through serene wastefulness.”57An otherwise careful mind seems to lose itself in the speculative recon-struction of the function and meaning of ritual. “Even the gods themselves,however, are shown holding the libation phial in real statues and especially inpaintings. Perhaps the priest would pour the wine into the divine libation bowland the wine would flow from there in turn. The god, as it were, makes the of-fering to himself, or rather, he is drawn into the giving and taking of theserenely flowing stream, an epitome of self-sustaining piety.”58Burkert offersan interesting hypothesis about how an actual cult statue with phiale may havebeen used, how the wine was manipulated, and so forth. However, he thengroups together without justification the “libating gods” of an actual cultic set-ting (in a sanctuary on Aegina or Delos, for example) with the highly problem-atic, and perhaps otherworldy, setting of the vase-paintings, where we are clearlynot in a historical place or time.The only way Burkert’s remarks about the priest pouring the wine into thegod’s bowl and the wine flowing thence make any sense for the vase-paintings isif they depict cult statues; whereas, as we have seen, the sacrificing gods are farfrom static. One has only to see the many images of the phiale-bearing Artemisas she strides or the hovering, airborne Nike at an altar to know that this cannotbe true. On the ornate register of the Berlin Painter vase—as on other vases—itis not a priest, but another deity who pours the wine.The inadequacies of this treatment in terms of the history of religion lie notonly in its oversimplification but also in its vague mysticism. “Self-sustaining” isanticipated by Himmelmann-Wildschütz; but Burkert’s use of the word “piety”conjures up, again, the hierarchical issues of sacrifice. The concept of a god“making offering to himself ” has no known religious context in ancient Greece.We are told by Hesiod in Works and Daysof the disastrous silver age, in whichhuman beings could not raise enough food or livestock to offer sacrifices uponthe altars of the gods; so, too, in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter310–313.59In nei-ther of these accounts do the gods contemplate making offerings themselves, inan effort to restore religiosity. Burkert leaves them dangling, as vaguely symbioticparticipants in an exchange of liquid. While offering some noteworthy insights,Burkert does not seem to have solved what he calls this “new problem of inter-pretation.”60The Hope of Mythology: “Die Götter opfern wirklich”The first and only thorough study of the topic of these vase-paintings datesfrom 1953, the published Heidelberg dissertation of Erika Simon: OpferndeGötter.61Her controversial main assertion was that libation scenes should beinterpreted mythologically; and she was willing to propose such explanationsfor at least five of the most frequent of these scenes. Simon has three centralpremises, which focus, respectively, on the relationship between cult statues“divine libation”: a century of debate133"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"and vases, on the religious influence of Aeschylus and Pindar on their time,and on the interpretation of the phiale when held by a god.First, she asserts that there was no iconographic continuity, and hence nocontinuity of religious meaning, between the stiff cult statues of the sixth cen-tury and the vital depictions of gods carrying libation bowls on fifth-centuryvases. Archaic cult statues occasionally carried phialai as attributes. These stat-ues are themselves sometimes depicted in fifth-century vase-paintings as partof a cultic or ritual scene. Thus she refutes Furtwängler’s and Schefold’s con-tention that the strange vase-paintings of the gods offering sacrifice were di-rectly influenced by the archaic cult statues holding phialai that preceded themin the sixth century.62She summarizes this position: “Therefore it could be as-serted that the ‘sacrificing gods’ are in reality not the pourers but the recipients[of the libations], to whom the gesture of sacrifice has been transferred fromthe human sphere.”63She maintains that there was no “transference forward”between the two genres of religious image.64Simon takes the opposite path from Eckstein-Wolf, who claims that thephiale itself, rather than the god, does the pouring. For Simon, the gods inthese situations pour in the actual sense of the word. She limits herself to theanalysis of scenes in which the libation is unequivocally depicted. She also dis-tinguishes between the few images in which the wine is being visibly pouredfrom the phiale, and the many gods who “peacefully” hold the bowl. Therefore,for each separate deity, separate situations out of the mythological traditionmust be found, in which these bring an offering. She concedes that in the case ofthe phiale-bearing cult-images, as well as the depictions of them in vase-paintings,“[T]he bowl in the hand of the cult images must be interpreted in the sense of thereception of [sacrificial] offerings.”65She fully believes that the cult statues weremeant to receive libations in their outstretched bowls. Yet the same interpretationcannot be true for the gods of vase-paintings who move and sacrifice. “Athena isdepicted...not as an archaic Palladion, but as a living goddess....Situations inwhich they [the gods] appear in vase-painting with phialai should hardly bethought of as a transferal of attributes from cult-images. The libation bowls in thehand[s] of the gods must at any given time be inferred from the situation that is de-picted” (italics added).66Part of the argument that the two groups of images belong to completelydifferent categories rests heavily on the notion that the Greeks themselves sawthe cult statues as very different from the imposing deities who strode freelyabout the registers of classical vases. Most of these are not stiff cult images but“living, breathing gods,” as Simon puts it, who are themselves sacrificing.67As evidence for this, she points to a krater depicting the Iliupersis fromabout 460 B.C.E., which features an Apollo sanctuary.68This religious precinct,whose identity is established in typical fashion by the use of a column, containsa small, naked, phiale-bearing statue of Apollo. It has the fixed stare and markedlyrigid demeanor of a cult image. However, nearby stands the living god himself,fully clothed, and towering above the statue. Simon’s point is that these are twodifferent entities in the Greek religious imagination. Thus the phiale meantone thing in the hand of a cult statue and something very different in the hand134ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"of a “living, breathing god.”69And the gods who appear in images such as thosewho form the tableau of the Berlin Painter’s vase in Boston must themselves bemaking and not receiving libations.70Simon’s second, important point concerns the vitality displayed by the gods inthese vase-paintings. The motif of the sacrificing gods enjoyed only a short, idio-syncratic florescence, which was highly localized in Attica. According to Simon,the idea resonated with the early fifth-century trend toward anthropomorphiza-tion, or perhaps a revitalization of a sense of the numinous, such as is reflected inthe dramas of Aeschylus, on whose stage the gods “walk,” and in the poetry ofPindar.71In support of Simon’s theory, one might consider, for example, the strikingconfrontation between the angry Apollo in his Delphic sanctuary and thehideous Erinyes awakened on its very floor (Eumenides179–234). In theseplays, the gods are actually dramatic characters, who interact with the humanprotagonists—Athena converses with and offers to protect Orestes (397–489);the goddess appears at the play’s end as supernatural chairman of the jury tocast the deciding ballot to absolve Orestes and in the end mollifies the Erinyes(566 ff.). The lifespan of Aeschylus (525/4–456 B.C.E.), the earliest of the greattriumvirate of tragedians, exactly corresponds to the rapid iconographic ascen-dency and equally precipitous decline of the sacrificing gods theme in vase-painting.Simon claims that in the plays of the slightly later tragedians Sophocles(496–406B.C.E.) and Euripides (485–406 B.C.E.), the gods are far more re-moved from human affairs; nor do they act or move upon the stage. In the caseof Sophocles, the gods are as a distant thunder (especially illustrative are thethree Theban plays), even when they appear in the play (Ajax,prologue scene).In the hands of Euripides, things are even worse; the gods are cold, distant, andexploitative. The most chilling scene of this style of treatment is the dialoguebetween the dying Hippolytus and his adored queen of heaven, Artemis, whogives a clinical farewell to her devotee and promises to avenge him (or morecorrectly, herself ), while also telling him not to get too close lest he pollute her(Hippolytus1391 ff.).The lifespan of the great Boeotian lyric poet Pindar (518–438 B.C.E.) simi-larly encompasses the late archaic period, the watershed decade of the PersianWar, and the buildup of Athenian thalassocracy. Pindar’s elaborate poetical lan-guage, often reminiscent of Homeric themes and style, was that of a politicaland religious conservative whose main concern was honor. His gods receivepraise, whether in hymns, paeans, encomia, or dirges; they are very much apresent and luminous reality in his universe.72Through the reverent lens Simon trains on Aeschylus and Pindar, a rich,multivalent symbolic form becomes an isolated anomaly in the history ofGreek art. Yet the multivalency necessarily attending an iconographical para-dox like that of a sacrificing god cannot be explained completely by religiousfashion or literary influence, even if Simon analyzes the latter as symptomaticrather than causal. Rather, its roots must run historically or symbolicallydeeper. She rejects the traditional explanation of the “humanization” of the“divine libation”: a century of debate135"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"gods because in most cases traditional occasions of human libation, such as awarrior’s departure, are not depicted.Simon’s third argument is that any legitimate interpretation of the phialeshould be dictated by the context. For example, she maintains that the sceneson vases that depict Aphrodite bringing a phiale to the Judgment of Paris, or of-fering a golden libation bowl to Sappho,73or to a young love whom she pursuesin the woods, are not to be considered within the sphere of ritual activity. Simi-larly, she dismisses the liquid carried so frequently in the ritual bowl byAphrodite’s son Eros for his mother as a “love potion.”74She also deliberatelyexcludes libation scenes with “messenger” gods like Iris, Nike, and Hermes.Simon is also unequivocal in classifying those symposia scenes in whichthe gods lie on couches and extend phialai as truly borrowed from the humansphere. Interestingly, as noted above, she is not willing by the same token to ex-tend the principle of transmission of behavior from the human to the divinesphere to the libating gods who appear on the vases she analyzes, but main-tains that they must be involved in a unique form of piety that pertains only totheir divinity.We return to that persistent question: To whom do the gods sacrifice? Si-mon relies heavily on the idea that the libating gods were offering to another,unseen power. The actual recipient of the divine sacrifice is only pictured in li-bations of greeting; otherwise, he or she must be “imagined” by the viewer.This could be a higher god (Athena to Hera on behalf of Herakles; or Zeus inthe case of the penitent Apollo). Far more common proposed Simonian recipi-ents were the chthonian powers, specifically the overthrown Titans. With these,she maintains, the new order sought a kind of rapprochement. Like Oedipus atthe grove at Colonus, the Olympians also were constrained to propitiate theseunderworld powers. This she bases on various texts, among them the oathscited in our chapter 3, such as those taken by the waters of the Styx by Hera inthe Iliadand in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo.75Simon’s mythological explanations for the scenes of divine libation are credi-ble to varying degrees; but all of them require, to a certain extent, the suppressionof iconographic evidence. In the case of Athena, she focuses on the scenes show-ing the goddess pouring for Herakles. According to Simon, she is welcoming thenew god to the divine realm—“the graduation of her protégé,” as Boardmannotes.76But, as we have seen, on the vases Athena sometimes offers by herself(e.g.,no. 8) or pours for her father Zeus (e.g., no. 22).77The theme of the “Delian triad” of Apollo with Leto and Artemis, she says,stems from the earlier monumental group, perhaps sculptural, with Apollo ascitharode; the phiale was added.78Simon claims that Apollo is pouring libationsto Zeus and to the chthonian powers in expiation for the slaughter of the Python.However, the occasional presence of the omphalos in some of the vases whichwe have seen suggests Delphi and not the Tempê valley. Furthermore, Apollo of-ten pours at an altar. These are spondaA; for Simon’s argument of chthonianpropitiation to make sense, Apollo should pour xoaA, into the ground.79Simon believes that the libation scenes involving Dionysos started out assimple scenes of pouring, where the god first receives wine into his kantharos136ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"(e.g., chronologically, nos. C–21, C–15, and C–19). From there, she thinks, it wasa short step to showing the wine as overflowing and spilling out; for the kan-tharos of Dionysos is inexhaustible.80Scenes that depict Dionysos’s libationwithout an altar (a visual reference to mortal religion) are are an expression ofhis double nature as victim and perpetrator of the chase, as hunter and hunted,and thus, presumably, as sacrificed and sacrificer.81She insists, however, thatthose libations poured by Dionysos at an altar are very different; she views themas iconographically dependent on the common type of the libating Apollo. Si-mon maintains that the similarity of the scenes of Apollo and Dionysos at an al-tar are a visual expression of the two gods’ cultic symbiosis at Delphi.82When considering the vases that show Dionysos performing an animalsacrifice (nos. C–38andC–39), it is interesting that Simon seems to draw clos-est to surrendering the notion of a divine recipient. “The question of in whichgod’s honor Dionysos performs these ritual actions can only be answered thus:The tearing of a fawn, an act of maenadic ecstasy, does not point outside theDionysiac circle, but expends itself in its own being.”83She cannot conceive ofan object for Dionysos’ sacrifice: “nor does there exist beyond the Dionysiacrealm which represents something total and self-contained a recipient of the li-bation offered by the god in [his] drunken dancing.”84In Simon’s interpretation, the enthroned Zeus and Hera, served by Iris,celebrate their sacred marriage (Derbßgamoß) and pledge the ̃Hraß teleAaßkaBDibß pistamata.85The oinochoe of Iris, she says, is filled with the watersof the Styx for the marriage oath. But as Arafat objects, there are many repre-sentations of Zeus, and some of Hera, in which these gods appear alone hold-ing the libation bowl—quite apart from each other. Some of these portray redwine as the libation liquid, not water.In the case of the Eleusinian deities, Simon interprets the libations pouredfor or by Triptolemus as departure libations before that hero’s global missionwith the gift of grain. Those which simply show the two goddesses holdingphialai represent departure libations poured on the occasion of Persephone’sdescent to Hades—even though the Homeric Hymn to Demetermakes clear thatthere would not have been much opportunity for this ceremony when theyoung maiden was snatched by Hades from below the meadow where she wasplaying with her companions! In those rare scenes where Plouton appears atEleusis, he is welcomed by the goddesses just as Herakles is on his entry intoOlympus, with libations.86As we shall see, the merit of Simon’s approach was hotly debated. How-ever, we might now call into question one of its central tenets, which is the con-nection between myth (stories about the gods) and portrayed ritual (on thevases); this notorious marriage is by no means universally accepted.87As PaulVeyne comments,I am not even sure that it is necessary to make an exception for etio-logical myths. Very few Greek myths explain rites, and those that doare less the invention of priests, wishing to lay the foundations for arite, than the imaginings of ingenious local minds, who fabricated a“divine libation”: a century of debate137"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"fanciful explanation for whatever cultural peculiarity intrigued thetraveler. Myth explains rite, but...[certain] rite is only a local curios-ity. Varro’s Stoic distinction is still fundamental: the gods of the city,to whom men made cult; the gods of the poets, that is, those ofmythology; and the gods of the philosophers.”88Veyne’s skepticism is entirely appropriate when applied to Simon’s ap-proach, which works for scenes such as the entry of Herakles into Olympusand for the libations that attend the birth of gods—the nymphs who welcomeDionysos; the libation of Zeus at the birth of Athena; and the libation of Athenato welcome the hero Erichthonios. But we can find many more gods and ritualsituations in this genre of theme on classical vases than Simon has myths for.As we have seen, even her mythological explanations for certain individualgods can be questioned; but, on an even more dubious note, to whom does Po-seidon pour, or Ares? Hermes? And where are the myths for the later classicaland Hellenistic adaptations of the theme in votive reliefs, as when Asklepios,Cybele, Bendis, or Mên pour from phialai?In the Wake of Opfernde GötterWithin two years after the publication of Simon’s book, it was reviewed in fourmajor publications; all of the authors were prominent in the field of classicalart and archaeology.89From the time it appeared, it was cited in any discussionof divine libations in ancient Greek art, and without exception this has contin-ued to be the case to the present. Before the end of the 1950s, however, thebook was also censured by other scholars, even for its very title; some tooksharp exception to its uncomfortable premise that the high gods were indeedoffering sacrifice, a form of religious worship.90The work of a young woman in her mid-twenties, Opfernde Götterreceivedsuch attention for two reasons. It was only the second in a select series of disser-tations published by the Deutsches Archaölogisches Institut. It also offered a thor-ough treatment of a theoretical problem simmering for decades, and advanceda new and controversial hypothesis: The fifth-century scenes on vases of the ma-jor deities pouring libations were all inspired by events from their respectivemythologies. The intensity of the responses to Opfernde Göttershow that Simonhad hit a nerve. Although initial scholarly response, as represented in Boardman’sreview, was affirmative, criticism grew to a crescendo until Simon’s approach wasbluntly and perhaps unfairly rejected by Nilsson, and then elegantly controvertedby Himmelmann-Wildschütz. The latter offered a nuanced critique that con-vinces far more than Nilsson’s in that Himmelmann’s alternative explanation is somuch more adaptable to the wide body of evidence. Yet the attention that Simonfocused on these strange scenes and the questions that she asked, even when heranswers were rejected by many, continue to be important.91In the Journal of Hellenic Studies,John Boardman notes that the old idea ofthe “humanization of the gods” would not stand much longer.92In support ofSimon, he points out that none of the scenes under consideration reflects any138ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"familiar “mortal” libation scenes (such as the departure or homecoming of awarrior); in fact, in the sixth and early fifth centuries, the opposite seemed to betrue in iconography. Mortals were portrayed in a divine fashion, such as in thecase of the heroic setting of secular marriage scenes.Of Simon’s quest for mythological occasions “on which divine libationsmight be expected,” Boardman comments, “Such occasions are not easy tofind, some are rather obscure, others lacking completely; but the approach tothese seems correct, even though the explanations are not all equally convinc-ing.”93Noting the appearance of Eckstein-Wolf ’s work on the same subject, hesays that the latter’s skepticism about divine sacrifice is understandable but un-duly pessimistic.He reviews Simon’s explanations for the various deities; Apollo pouring toatone for the murder of the Pytho he seems to accept, but comments onDionysos, “such scenes are more a demonstration than an occasion, althoughthe Anthesteria festival is reflected in some.”94In the end, he calls the book a“tidy, new, and therefore welcome attempt to interpret an important series ofscenes: more remains to be said, but it is refreshing to find an iconographicsubject on which too much has not already been said treated in this way.”95Marjorie Milne in the American Journal of Archaeologyhas much more tosay.96She is essentially positive about the book, giving it high marks for carefularchaeological documentation. Like Boardman, she recognizes its importance.97Contra Eckstein-Wolf, Milne believes that Simon makes a good case for the “li-bation-purification” interpretation of the Apollo scenes on vases, citing theoinochoe in which Apollo arrives fasting at the village of Deipnas, and is servedwine by a local nymph.98Simon’s interpretation of scenes of Zeus and Heraserved by a winged goddess as the Styx-bound marriage oath of a hieros gamosstrengthens Roulez’s suggestion.99Milne points out the novelty of Simon’s in-terpretations for the Eleusinian deities.Milne’s chief quarrel is with the religious inferences drawn by Simon fromthese scenes, calling the author in this aspect of her work “sometimes less happy.She fails to prove that there is a special nuance of appeasement and reconciliationin libations offered by the gods.”100She also strongly calls into question the no-tion of the Olympian gods seeking to propitiate or in any way sacrifice to the un-derworld or older powers.101As for the so-called libation of Athena to the Erinyesin Aeschylus’s Eumenides1006, Milne also complains thatMiss Simon is too apt to treat the Titans and the Erinyes as if theywere beings of much the same kind. This no doubt springs in partfrom her conviction that Aeschylus is a better guide than “Religions-geschichte” to the vase paintings of his day. For his Eumenides,how-ever, Aeschylus created a new myth. Athena’s involvement in theaction, the Erinyes’ reproach of the younger gods (778–808), andAthena’s reference to the thunderbolt of Zeus (827)...are all merelya part of the dramatic development of this new myth. They are not ev-idence that the Athenians of that day believed there was conflict be-tween the Erinyes and the Olympians.102“divine libation”: a century of debate139"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Probably the most categorical rejection of Erika Simon’s work came fromthe Swedish scholar Martin P. Nilsson, in his work on the Hellenistic and Ro-man mysteries of Dionysos.103His objections hinge primarily on one of themost natural questions that occurs when anyone, classicist or otherwise, con-fronts these images: To whom are the gods sacrificing? Finding no satisfactoryanswer, and no objects of worship depicted in the vases or sculptural evidence,Nilsson rejects the term “sacrifice” altogether as implying the normal hierarchyof sacrificer, victim, and recipient deity.104His discussion is inspired by a marble relief in the Carl Milles Collection atLindingö near Stockholm, which portrays a bearded, priestly figure, wearingchiton and hide, and having archaic, spiralized hair and beard. The man,whom Nilsson refers to as “either Dionysos or his priest,” holds a cluster ofgrapes in his left hand, and in his right, a horn from which a libation is pouredonto a square garlanded altar before him.105On top of the altar is a pile of fruitand the head of a goat. At its corner stands an ithyphallic herm of Priapus; italso wears a hide, which is knotted on its chest. The liquid poured out onto thealtar appears to be rendered clearly in stone.It is interesting that Nilsson rejects his first impression, which is the obviousone. “At the first glance one would say that Dionysos is represented sacrificing toPriapus, but there are very serious objections to such an interpretation.”106Hethen attacks the conceptual premise of Simon’s title, Opfernde Götter.Although heconcedes that it is “an interesting book,” he says “it is misleading, for it suggestsa god offering a sacrifice to some other god. In fact such a god is never repre-sented; the gods of the vase paintings which she treats pour out libations, holdinga phiale in their hands. They are not comparable to our relief. The book ought tohave been called ‘Spendende Götter in der attischen Vasenmalerei.’ ”107Nilssonfeels that the German opfern, representing the general idea of sacrifice, impliesan object or recipient of devotion, whereas the ancient Greek spAndein, “to pourout a libation,” does not. As we have seen in chapter 1, it is far from clear that theact of libation in antiquity had become so stylized; the recipient of libations isspecified at some times, and not at others. The distinction ends up being coun-terproductive to his own case.He goes on to suggest that two other reliefs, both Hellenistic, are more rel-evant to the one he is considering. One is of Artemis Eupraxis, “carrying a sac-rificial basket and kindling the fire on an altar with a torch.” The same objectionis made: “Here too there is no god who receives the sacrifice.”108Two wor-shipers, a man and a woman, also stand before the altar. The second is abronze relief from Delos that depicts Artemis holding two torches and kindlinga fire on an altar with her right hand. A satyr on the other side seems to placewood on the altar and to blow the fire. To the left behind Artemis, another satyrapproaches, carrying a jug in his right hand and a liknon, a fan-shaped wickerbasket common to the cult of Dionysos, on his head. To the right is a small cultstatue standing on a pillar.109Nilsson insists that “both reliefs show the god-dess Artemis...not performing a sacrifice: she looks away from the idol. Thesacrifice is made by the Satyrs. The interpretation is that the goddess receivesthe sacrifice by purveying the sacrificial fire.”110Yet a Hellenistic vase painting140ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"that depicts Themis appearing with a sacrificial basket and a torch beforeBendis is dismissed by Nilsson as “allegorical: it is right to venerate the newlyintroduced goddess Bendis.”111Several observations might be made about this allegedly corroborative evi-dence. In the first place, Nilsson bases his argument on the idea that the DelianArtemis is not worshiping, even though she carries cultic implements andlights the sacrificial fire. He bases this on the convenient presence of the satyrs,casting them as the worshipers. This is faulty reasoning. In fact, the wholegroup, including Artemis, is depicted as engaged in the offering. Furthermore,in the original relief he is discussing, there is no mortal or semidivine figureother than the Dionysiac character in sight, so he cannot say that anyone otherthan the figure at the altar is making the sacrifice.Nilsson’s second complaint is that no god receives the sacrifice (as on thefirst Artemis relief, on his Dionysos relief, and on Simon’s vases). This seemsan odd argument against the possibility of anyone, god or mortal, making asacrifice, as a diachronic survey of Greek figural art reveals that it usually failsto depict a recipient in a sacrificial scene, except for an occasional cult statue.Yet in the two cases he presents where there clearly isa cult statue present (thePriapus in the Dionysos relief and the little pillar statue with long robe on thesecond Artemis relief ), he disqualifies these statues as being too ridiculous toconsider as recipients. Why? Because it is a god who is shown sacrificing.When there is incontrovertibly a divine recipient, as in the Themis-Bendisvase, Nilsson seems to insist on a dubious distinction between what he calls“veneration” (the goddess Themis bringing a sacrificial basket to the goddessBendis) and “sacrifice.” Suddenly, it is not that he considers there to be a dif-ference between sacrifice and libation, as he earlier seems to suggest. Rather,there is now a difference between sacrifice and any other kind of worship. Inother words, even though the goddess Themis is clearly bringing something (asacrifical basket and a torch) to Bendis, she is not sacrificing to her. She is ven-erating her.“That a god should sacrifice to another god implies a contradiction. TheGreeks felt so.”112Nilsson makes much of the Strabo passage discussed inthe previous chapter, in which Alexander’s offer to the Ephesians to dedicatethe temple of Artemis is rebuffed on the grounds that it was not proper fora god to make offerings to another god.113He combatively adds, “It does notmatter if the anecdote is historical or not, it shows what the Greeks thought.”114Again, Nilsson assumes that sacrifice, even divine sacrifice, must have a recip-ient.115That recipient must logically be another god, which is cause for moderntheoretical confusion; but can we say that such offense was taken by the an-cients, and construe an entire theology of images based on one propagandisticincident? Nilsson continues,If then it is impossible to take the said representations as sacrifices inthe common sense of offerings brought to a god, another explanationmust be found. In certain cases the representations are similar to a li-bation at a farewell or banquet, but this is not sufficient for the scenes“divine libation”: a century of debate141"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"adduced. Vase paintings sometime represent statues of gods withphialae in their hands. It cannot be meant that the statues are pouringout libations. Likewise a cup or a kantharosis the common attribute ofthe gods on the votive tablets from Locri in South Italy. The gods arestanding or seated, sometimes a sacrifice is brought to them. Theycannot possibly be sacrificing or pouring out libations.116He also refers to the passage from the Ecclesiasuzae780 ff. considered in chap-ter 1: “One is reminded of the words of Aristophanes that when we pray to thegods for something good, their statues stand stretching out the handupturned—not as to give anything, but to get something.”117Nilsson’s solution? “I think that the most common act by which venerationwas paid to a god was transferred to the representations of the gods themselvesin order to show their divine nature. The god’s attitude is, so to speak, a projec-tion of the worshipper’s attitude.”118He then repeats his adamant objections toapplying Simon’s interpretation to this particular piece. “The idea of the greatgod Dionysos sacrificing to Priapus seems to me to be really too strange to beaccepted. If this seemingly obvious interpretation is rejected it must needsbe supposed that the majestic figure is the priest who has donned the attire ofthe god.”119With this final flourish of circular reasoning, Nilsson has talked himselfinto an “ironclad” interpretation for his Hellenistic relief at Lindingö. Let us ex-amine the course of this reasoning: 1) He begins by saying that the relief por-trays a figure clad in the clothing typically worn by Dionysos, so that the obvi-ous interpretation is that it isthe god. 2) He notes that Dionysos seems to bepouring a libation onto a burning altar, immediately behind which stands asmall ithyphallic herm of the god Priapus, so that the obvious interpretation ofthis scene would be that Dionysos is making an offering to Priapus. 3) Hestates that it “implies a contradiction” for a Greek god to sacrifice to anothergod, that the gods in art “cannot possibly be sacrificing or pouring out liba-tions,” and finally, to put the nail in the coffin, that the idea of the “great godDionysos” sacrificing to Priapus (or any other god, one infers) is “really toostrange to be accepted.” 4) He concludes that, because he has decided the scenecan’t mean what it seems to mean, that the figure is a priest dressed as Dionysos,and not the god himself.120Unfortunately, even if these controversial gods “cannot possibly” be sacri-ficing or pouring out libations, that is exactly what they are doing. If only thered wine pouring out from the bowl were not so often emphatically painted onthese vases! But it is. As van Straten implies, it is perhaps wiser to concede thatwe are limited in our capacity to understand these images than to state em-phatically that they cannot mean something simply because, as yet, they makeno sense to us. No phenomenology of religion is ever ultimately flexibleenough for the troubling exceptions.121And the silently sacrificing gods are acritical exception to what we thought we “knew” about ancient Greek religion.Writing in Gnomona year later, Hans Möbius conceded, “That divinities,to whom sacrifice is due, themselves are depicted bringing sacrifice, appears to142ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"be a paradox; and yet such images do appear, by no means infrequently, onGreek vases of the fifth century B.C., especially during the first half.”122LikeBoardman and Milne, Möbius notes that these images had never been properlytreated until the two independent theses of Eckstein-Wolf and Simon appeared.He notes that Simon takes the opposite hermeneutical path from Eckstein-Wolf. Having limited herself to scenes of certain major deities in which the li-bation is clearly depicted, she makes it incumbent upon herself to “find” amyth in the lore of each deity that “must” inspire the respective scenes.Echoing Milne, Möbius says that not all these pictorial aetiologies are per-fectly convincing; but he goes further than she does, by saying that to attributea mythologically meaningful approach to the vase painters, and especially tothe crucial offering scenes, seems to him methodologically correct.123Never-theless, he has some form of quarrel with each explanation.For Athena, his substantive criticism of Simon’s approach lies in the fact thatwhen she offers a libation to Poseidon in Odyssey3.41 ff., she does so in her roleas Mentor. He agrees with Milne that Athena’s “sacrifice” to the Eumenides inthe drama of Aeschylus (of which Simon’s identification is already highly ques-tionable) is an invention of the poet. He complains that only two of the Athenaand Herakles scenes include an altar. These, he says, are borderline cases of thecanonical vase-painting scene in which Athena fills Herakles’s vessel with wine.No sign of cult is manifest in the many examples of the latter, and Herakles doesnot necessarily appear to be pouring an offering. “Here we have, as the authorherself concedes, an instance in which a standard image of the time is changedinto a sacrificial scene.”124He also believes that it is entirely reasonable to look toHera (the divine antagonist, and later Olympian hostess of Herakles) as a recipi-ent of these offerings.Möbius believes it to be unnecessary to postulate a larger sculptural groupof Apollo as citharode with Leto and Artemis as inspiration for the trio on liba-tion scenes; he points out that the trio (without oinochoe, phiale, or altar) wasubiquitous in late black-figure vase-painting, until it disappeared just after500.125He says that the aitiondetermines a new religious standard, one thatdistinguishes it considerably from the formal, related musical trio. However,he is entirely convinced that the libating Apollo must always be Pythian, andthat it is the Delphic Septerion festival to which his “sin-offering” is alwaysrelated; Apollo was purifed at Tempê so that he could be consecrated as a puri-fier.126He notes that Eckstein-Wolf has refused to consider this explanation, be-cause the ancient texts tell us that xoaAwere poured in the Tempê Valley, thatis, into the ground, whereas on the vase-paintings, the action clearly takes placeat Delphi, and the libations are poured onto an altar (spondaA) or onto theomphalos.For the pouring Dionysos, Möbius notes that there also existed suchscenes in preliminary black-figure form, but under the influence of the sacri-ficing Apollo, they were changed and made to resemble the Delphic sphere.A specific reason for the libation in Dionysos’s case does not present itself,even if the recollection of the Anthesteria festival does glimmer a bit. In the im-ages where Dionysos “circles the altar in a wild dance, one gets the impression“divine libation”: a century of debate143"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"not that he’s actually offering, but rather that his kantharosis automatically over-flowing as a symbol of inexhaustible abundance; correspondingly, [these scenes]also lack a sacrificial ministrant with a pitcher.”127Möbius believes that the of-fering is not intended for any other god, but that myth and cult combine in aunity of revelation of the Dionysiac being.128This parallels the thought of Him-melmann, discussed later in this chapter.Möbius agrees with Simon that when Zeus and Hera seem to pour to eachother, that is not a visual excerpt from an assembly from the gods, but that “theceremony must have its own indwelling sense,” concerning which, he concurswith Simon, is the Styx-sworn oath of the hieros gamos.As the human custombefore marriage has in that case been transferred to the divine realm, it alsomakes sense, in his opinion, that the customary departure libation is poured byDemeter and Kore before Triptolemus leaves to promulgate the gift of agricul-ture. He enhances Simon’s argument that this transference, which also ap-pears in the “welcoming” libations of Kore to Hades and Plouton to Eleusis, isaccounted for by the “immediacy” which brings the human and the divine to-gether in the context of the Great Mysteries at Eleusis.129Möbius notes that thedepictions of the libating gods in the second half of the fifth century were gradu-ally detached from cult scenes, and the actors were no longer deities, but mortals.Nike, the ubiquitous sacrificial ministrant, is the only offering god who remaineda longer-lasting iconographic influence.130InRevue Archéologique,Charles Picard delivers an ambivalent, often self-contradictory review.131He seems more entranced by Simon’s style (“stimulat-ing, subtle, and engaging”) and her iconographic fluency than by the substanceof her argument. He calls the “mythological” hypothesis into question, and em-phasizes as well that Opfernde Göttermakes only a limited contribution to a vastsubject. In choosing only a limited series of ceramic “documents,” “the authorcould not claim to offer us a solution which is valid in every case.”132InvokingNilsson, he also attacks the title, which he finds enigmatic and misleading.133How can a true sacrifice by the gods be supposed? “Could a Greek god make asacrifice to another god?”134Also like Nilsson, Picard complains that no divinerecipient is ever visible in these scenes. Dramatically, he asserts that “the liba-tion from the outstretched phialeis destined nowhere but into the void.”135He agrees that the ceremony of libation, when the gods perform it, “has arevelatory nature strictly adapted to the celestial personality of the (specific) li-bating deity.”136Like previous reviewers, he is willing to accept the Tempê-Delphi purification aitionfor Apollo, whom he says pours to Zeus (note thatZeus is not visible, either, but is accepted by Picard as the recipient of Apollo’slibation!) for the second half of the fifth century.137He believes that the offeringDionysos was the result of his association with Delphi, and the subsequent in-fluence of the ubiquitous offering Apollo. In an original vein, Picard suggeststhat Dionysos does not have a ministrant with oinochoe because the overflow-ing kantharos is so large.138Picard says that the libations offered to Triptolemus could express his initi-ation as a young hero by the Eleusinian goddesses into their mysteries, in fact,a presentation of the kykeondrink. He also says that some vase-paintings as144ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"early as the fifth century treat Triptolemus as a god. In any case, Picard main-tains, whether it emphasizes Triptolemus’s civilizing mission at its departurepoint or his initiation, the scene is special. It is difficult to see in it the tradi-tional “stirrup cup” offered to a traveler.139Highly insightful, he believes, are Si-mon’s analyses of the libations made by Demeter on the occasion of the descentof Persephone into Hades, which, although they have the normal overtones ofdeparture, at the same time also evoke specific ideas of birth, marriage, anddeath.Picard notes that Simon’s analysis is refreshing, happily contrasting with“dull ceramic catalogues”; she is in control of the evidence, but also seeks to ex-press what the Greeks of the fifth century thought about the world (and sacredactions) of the gods. Finally, he takes the opportunity to condemn the work ofEckstein-Wolf as ill-founded scientific pessimism, written in an obscure man-ner. “For Miss Eckstein-Wolf, the statues with phiale do not say what they wouldseem to say: They would show the god [proper] pious activity to humankind byhimself performing the libation, so as to urge people to offer it [the libation] tothe superior powers.”140Sarcastically, he says that it is the right of “certain eru-dites” to stop there, that it does seem “strange” that suddenly at the beginning ofthe fifth century there began to be such a diversification of the simple rite of li-bation into special circumstances appropriate for each god. He notes Eckstein-Wolf ’s total rejection of any reflection of the purification myth in the sacrificingApollo scenes, which corresponds with her reticence to accept any interpreta-tion bearing overtones of mysticism.141Simon may be guilty of the somewhat glib concordance of her own theorywith diverse, often ambiguous evidence, according to Picard, but he defendsthe book as comprehensive and articulate in a field of inquiry neglected up tothe time it was written. “The essential thing, said a French poetess, is to go be-fore the gods.”142That is what he feels Simon was willing to do in her book, andtherefore he forgives her occasional “audacity” on some points: “felix culpa.”143Olympian Libations to the Chthonian Earth?In 1956, Walter F. Otto defended the Greek gods against those who sought to“spiritualize” them, or to attribute to them mystical or redemptive overtones.In his most ambitious work, Die Götter Griechenlands(1934), Otto had assertedthat there is in ancient Greek religion “no soulful devotion, no sacrifice of whatis most precious, even of self, no communion of heart with heart, no bliss ofoneness.”144These were gods, he said, who “could have no thought of redeem-ing man from the world and raising him to themselves.”145Such dangerousanachronisms resulted from the influence of Christianity, Judaism, or “orientalreligions.”146Otto relentlessly opposed the notion that the worship of the Greek gods en-tailed any kind of magical or supernatural belief. He cast Homer as a reformer;“natural idealism or ideal naturalism remains the basic character of this newand in a true sense Greek religion.”147He strongly believed that the “perfect“divine libation”: a century of debate145"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"moment” represented by Zeus and the gods, although it elevated humanity,was indicative of a great, nontraversable boundary between them: “Always theinterval between deity and man remains, even when deity loves man. Indeed,the delimitations are purposefully accentuated. The gods retain their own exis-tence, from which man is by his nature forever kept apart.”148He was stronglyinfluenced by the German romantics Goethe and Hölderlin, from whom hequotes freely. However, his books are notable for their lack of critical apparatus;they acknowledge no secondary literature.The “sacrificing gods” theme arises only once in Otto’s work, in the impas-sionedTheophania. True to form, neither Simon’s work nor that of any otherscholar is mentioned. Otto does not probe, question, or speculate on the topic;he states his opinions as fact. He claims that when Zeus pours out offeringswith a libation bowl in Greek vase-paintings, “he is thus offering to theprimeval godhead, which embraces and upholds everything, including thegods, and has a name no more, if one does not want to name it, in the Greeksense Gaia (Earth), the original, archaic essence, which out of herself gave birthto the Heaven (Hesiod, Theogony126), or, as Höderlin has it, ‘Nature,’ “ ‘whichis older than Time and above the gods of evening and the orient.’ ”149Otto’sstatement is important in two ways. First, he claims that Zeus isin fact offeringto another power, which although he does not explicitly claim is greater thanthe ruler of the universe, is certainly older. Second, he claims to know whichpower it is: the earth, Gaia, ancestress of Zeus, and mother of all things. Thecritical upshot is that, like Simon, he believes that an Olympian power is relat-ing to an underworld power by pouring liquid down into the earth.This is very much in keeping with Otto’s romanticizing of Gaia as a mani-festation of the Urgöttlichen, who once passionately embraced Ouranos andnow yearns toward him.150Ancient Greek religious genealogy, in his opinion,offers a primal source to which it makes natural sense for even Zeus to offer.This is corroborated by the fact that libations were poured downward, whereEarth could drink them.Two obvious flaws appear in Otto’s assertion. It is not only Zeus who pours invase-paintings, but nearly every other god. To whom are they offering? To Zeus?To Gaia also? Furthermore, the majority of the offering-god scenes, includingmany of Zeus, feature an altar onto which libations are poured, as if the preludeor conclusion to an Olympian sacrifice. How then can we construe all offeringscenes as chthonian?But with a curious mixture of scorn for mainstream interpretation and ele-vated awe toward the ancient Greek gods, Otto’s aim was not so much to de-scribe their worship as to illumine their being. For, like them, he did not seem tocare too much about the world of mortals. He was an ahistorical visionary whocast himself as a kind of lone protector of the gods in the modern era, defendingthem against nefarious appropriation.In this respect a disciple of Otto, Werner Fuchs entered the controversywith a repudiation of both Simon and Eckstein-Wolf.151Like many scholars,Fuchs relied on one piece of iconographic evidence as his springboard for amuch wider discussion. This is a superb votive relief in Pentelic marble dating146ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"from the second half of the fifth century B.C.E. It depicts a small worshiper ap-proaching two much larger, presumably divine entities: a standing female deitywho draws back her veil, holding an oinochoe, and a bearded, enthroned godstretching forth a phiale, whose central boss is plainly visible, in his righthand.152Despite earlier interpretations of the pair as Zeus and Hebe, Heraklesand Hebe, and Hades and Persephone,153Fuchs calls for the identification ofthe figures as Hygieia and Asklepios, invoking comparable fifth-century Atticreliefs now in Corfu,154Brocklesby Park,155and elsewhere.156Although affirming that the libation scenes in the reliefs do not so muchexpress the heroic character of Asklepios as place them squarely in the greatclassical tradition of sacrificing gods, Fuchs has firm opinions of their inter-pretation. He does not dismiss Simon’s mythical-episodic interpretation on thegrounds that her theory requires divine recipients of divine libations to bemainly imaginary; he points out that recipients of animal sacrifice are seldomdepicted, either. While characterizing her explanatory myths as “unsatisfac-tory,” he stubbornly insists, in defense of her basic approach, that “there is nocult or sacrificial rite without myth.”157Therefore, he also waxes scornful ofHimmelmann’s mystical, hard-to-grasp notion of divine libation as a “self-affirmation of their own divinity.”Fuchs believes that the prominence in the classical period of depicted liba-tions, both those made by gods and those made by mortals, share a commonsource. He rejects Himmelmann’s complaint that to posit any recipient for thedivine libation would impose an unacceptable conditionality on the deity whopours.As suggested above, the depiction of an offering in each case requiresas a condition one who offers. Even if the god holding the phiale asan attribute is interpreted as the recipient of sacrifice, as has beendone, he does not escape this condition either. The recipient of sacrificefirst acquires his significance through the one who sacrifices to him. Over-all, it should not be so hard to find the mythical reason why gods sac-rifice. Every Greek theogony contains the fundamental notion thatthe Olympians were not always Olympians; they overthrew older,more fearsome or more gracious divine powers. Within this frame-work one ought to seek the myth for the sacrificing god, not in thepredominantly late antique view of a “self-portrayal of [one’s] own ho-liness.”158Like Otto, Fuchs believes that his explanation is the simplest and most self-evident: The high gods pour out wine to Mother Earth. As corroboration, hecites a personal conversation with Walter F. Otto in the late fifties, which seemsto take on numinous proportions in the retelling. Fuchs related his dissatisfac-tion with Simon’s explanatory myths for the scenes: “Otto asked in returnwhere the libation went. ‘To the earth,’ I replied. ‘Well then, when they pour,the gods pour to Her, to Mother Earth.’ ‘So as to remind themselves of theircommon origin with mortals?’ I asked. After a long pause, the venerable mansaid, ‘Perhaps. Yes. It might be so.’ ”159“divine libation”: a century of debate147"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Fuchs’s model, which has the Olympians pouring to Earth, does not ade-quately address the fact that the majority of the gods in vase-paintings in fact pouronto altars. Such libation was a common enough prelude or postlude to anOlympian, rather than a chthonian sacrifice. Fuchs does note that even in the caseof altars, the wine ultimately trickles onto the ground.160However, that argumentis far from tenable: If the gods are making libations to Gaia, why depict an inter-mediary altar at all? Of course, his choice of evidence in the reliefs is selective;they do not show any altars. As one can see from a brief glance through the cata-logue, such scenes are far from the rule. Altars are ubiquitous in scenes of divinelibation.We leave Fuchs agog with the imagined radiance of classical Greek reli-gious “freedom,” the “true religiosity” evidenced by the phiale-bearing gods. “Intheir classical period the Greeks appeared as free and humane people, becausethey were determined by the gods, and their gods (appeared) as free and at thesame time contingent, humane deities, who demanded no human victims....Through the new, classical theme of libation-pouring gods and sacrificing mor-tals, true religiosity could be maintained in freedom. The bowl in the hand ofthe gods indicates not the divinity of the gods, but their humanity; in the handof the human, it expresses the mortal’s participation in the divine realm.”161This ahistorical and rudderless idea of a “golden age” of Greek religion, signi-fied by these vase-paintings, stuns with its romanticism. And what is “true reli-giosity”? Fuchs does capture the reciprocity that seems to bind sacrificing godto offering mortal; however, I will suggest in the next chapter that the gods’ li-bations do not indicate their “humanity” but underline their divinity.“Not Mythical Episodes but Images of Being”Erika Simon has identified the work of Nikolaus Himmelmann-Wildschütz asthe most important response to her pioneering Opfernde Götter.162One can un-derstand why. Rather than offering a superficial defense such as Nilsson’s(which ends by collapsing upon itself ), this scholar dives deep into the heart ofSimon’s ideas, as well as those of Eckstein-Wolf and others, and thoughtfullyrefutes them on their own terms. He is familiar with and respectful of whathas already been written on the subject, even though he profoundly disagreeswith his predecessors. His own explanation for the numerous images of the“spendende Götter” completely differs from the preceding general hypothesesoffered as alternatives to Simon’s.Far from dismissing the frequent portrayal of the libating gods as an an-noying footnote in ancient Greek iconography, Himmelmann calls it “the mostimportant religious phenomenon in all of classical art.”163He claims that whatwe have is in a fact a brand new category of picture, in which the gods are ex-empt from all episodic contingency. He conceives of the world of the ancientGreek gods not as a mirror of the overheated, turbulent human world, but ratheras a timeless, self-sustaining universe. Greek gods exist only for themselves.Their purpose is to be,not to do.Human beings may react to, importune, or148ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"seek to emulate them. But that is not the gods’ concern; they are unaffectedby the human drama below them, even though it is so drastically affected bythe divine. This immortal “state of being” in splendid isolation takes place ona different, higher plane than the mortal.164Accordingly, Himmelmann be-lieves that archaic cult statues did not relate in any way to their viewers, evendevotees.165Even more important, he feels that research indicates that “the phiale inthe hand of a [cult] statue or an unmoving solitary figure cannot be related tomythical events.”166Rather, “it functions as a formulaic designation of a sacrifi-cial recipient, intended to make visible his (the recipient’s) relationship to thesacrificing mortal.”167Furthermore, he maintains that the god with the libationbowl from fifth-century vase-painting, whether motionless or animated, has anunassailable iconographic heritage in the earlier phiale-bearing cult statues.168As in the case of the earlier plastic images, the gods’ libations are an expressionof their divine nature. These he calls Daseinsbilder: “images of being.”The scholarly consensus dissolves when confronted with the far more fre-quent representations of actively libating gods. The first is the school of Eckstein-Wolf, which Himmelmann describes as an elevation of a literal interpretation oflibation scenes, which finds in the phiale a symbol of the connection between hu-man and god.169Even if one concedes this possibility in the case of individual di-vine figures, Himmelmann claims that it is inadequate for the “self-sufficient,”self-contained world of the actively libating gods of vase-painting. His criticism isreinforced by the evidence from antiquity: Human beings virtually never appearwith libating gods until the Athenian reliefs of the late fifth and the entire fourthcenturies, and then they are invariably distanced from the offering scene by theirsize and servile attitude.170His main dispute, however, is clearly with Simon. Himmelmann insiststhat unique mythogical explanations for each of the major scenes of divine li-bation are untenable for two reasons. The first is that there are so many sceneson vase-paintings for which myth and legend do not provide us with an aition.He concedes that in myth there certainly do exist times when gods “apparentlyor actually” pour libations on occasions of prayer, oath, purification, reception,departure, or carousing. But these instances do not suffice to explain the abun-dance (or, one might add, the variety) of images that appear at the beginning ofthe fifth century.That one cannot always find a narrative episode for each one of the abun-dant number of themes points to more than just a preliminary deficiency inSimon’s approach; rather, it indicates a serious hermeneutical breakdown. Forexample, if one recognizes that the “sacrifice of marriage-oath” for the scenes ofZeus seated across from Hera as one or both deities pour out a libation, thenwhat does one do with the presence of Athena, Apollo, or Ares, or Nike in thesame scene, or with Zeus alone? The image must then be given a completelydifferent explanation. What mythical episode is being portrayed? What aboutthe libating Poseidon, Ares, or Athena shown offering with an unnamed youngwoman (perhaps Pandrosos)?171He especially cites the depiction of the fourseated deities on the pyxis in Athens (no. 138), arguing that “it does not portray“divine libation”: a century of debate149"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"a unique mythological episode,” but rather is presumed “to belong in the rangeof timeless images of being, that is, images of appearance.”172In sum, Himmelmann has made a new contribution to the discussion.His critique highlights the fact that Simon’s evidence is selectively drawn to il-lustrate potentially mythological scenes. Simon ignores a wide range of exam-ples which do not do that at all, but which clearly seem to belong to the sameiconographic corpus—yet almost certainly contradict her interpretation. In-stead, Himmelmann implies that they offer various aspects of a specific, andhomogeneous, religious consciousness.His second objection is more conceptual, and lies at the heart of our orig-inal question, which is one for the history of religion. It is as follows: If, in thevase-paintings, we are dealing with a mythical episode (that is, a story about agod who performs a literal offering), the depicted sacrificing god cannot also si-multaneously be a recipient of the offering.173Erika Simon characterizes the di-vine cult statue peacefully holding the bowl as a recipient of offerings. Therefore,in the case of the same god clearly pouring out a libation with the same bowl ona vase-painting, she is compelled to postulate an undetermined recipient.174Si-mon’s interpretation assumes that the mysterious recipient is “off-camera” in thevases. This is frustrating, since the sacrifice of libation is so often also genericallyoriented, without necessarily implying a specific recipient on the other end.Himmelmann uses the already familiar case of the libating Apollo, therange and depth of whose images dominate the corpus of vases under discus-sion. He notes the almost universal acceptance of the idea which, although notoriginal with Simon, she brought to the fore, namely, that the vase-paintings re-flect the transmission through both legend and cult of the god’s performanceof a purificatory offering in the Tempê Valley after the murder of the Python.But who are the recipients of the expiatory sacrifice?175As we have seen, Simonproposes Zeus and the Erinyes;176Himmelmann adds as a candidate the slaindragon itself. However, referring to a typical scene of Apollonian libation on aamphora in Würzburg (our no. 162),177he paints a bleak picture of what ismissing, but which, if Simon is right, should logically be there: “These [that is,potential recipients such as Zeus or the underworld gods] are neither presentthemselves, nor does the kind of sacrifice [depicted] give a hint of them. Thepurifier is absent, the slaughtered piglet, whose blood takes away the stain. Achthonian libation is not intended; for that [normally] takes place on the bareearth, not on an altar, such as the pictures often show.”178Himmelmann’s point? This shows no sign of being either a purificatory ora chthonian sacrifice. Although we might argue that it is not for us to deem di-vine sacrifices deficient in light of what is expected in human sacrifices, he isthe first scholar to question the hitherto unchallenged interpretation of Apolloscenes on the grounds of actual sacrificial practices. He also claims that thekiller of the Python must appear as a naked hero, not a solemnly clothed cithar-ode; the scene cannot be thought of as a ceremony, however expiatory, occa-sioned by the slaying of the Python.179Himmelmann’s objection to the concept of an actual sacrifice performedby the gods and, hence, of an unseen recipient, is profound. The implication of150ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"such a concept, he claims, is to malign the gods’ omnipotent nature. “Certainlyit is scarcely thinkable that the images of the gods show them in a conditionedrole, in the service of an uncertain recipient.”180Thus both interpretations arerejected on the grounds that they violate the meaning of the images them-selves. The first does so by claiming that the pictures of the gods sacrificingmake an intellectual reference to humanity. The second does them an injusticeby positing an unknown recipient. “Neither finds support in the monumentsthemselves: It is too obvious that the sacrificing gods are the central figures ofthe representation; too deep is the intentional autonomy [lit., ‘for-itself ’] of self-sufficent action.”181His final, and perhaps his most intriguing argument in favor of this thesisis that the kind of worship depicted in these scenes is appropriate to the god orgoddess. The principle of the individuality of divine sacrifice, unique and pecu-liar to the divinity who offers it, is corroborated mainly by two cases: theincense-burning Aphrodite, and the kantharos-pouring Dionysos.182Himmelmann notes that by virtue of Simon’s insistence on mythologicalinterpretations for the scenes, she has talked herself into a corner in the case ofAphrodite. Since there is no myth of a libation-bearing Aphrodite, and no logi-cal recipient for such a gift on her part, Simon dismisses the possibility of asacrificing Aphrodite. This, we might note, is the same close-minded reason-ing that tripped Nilsson: If one denies that a particular religious phenomenonexists, then therefore one must be seeing something other than that phenome-non. We recall Simon’s explanation of Aphrodite’s libation bowl as a containerfor a love-potion.183As proof, she cites the scenes with Eros, who spills the con-tents of a phiale into the eyes of a raging Menelaos, who drops his sword andforbears slaying his untrue Helen.184However, on a vase at the Louvre (no. 137), Eros is also portrayed com-pletely alone, where he pours out his phiale onto the blood-sprinkled altar; thiscan only be meant as a true libation.185Furthermore, on another rescue of He-len on a vase in Rome, Aphrodite herself appears, but holds her libation bowlwith the inside facing her.186The phiale belongs to the goddess, as does thescepter.187Most interesting is the frequent appearance of the thymiaterion (ritualincense-burner) held by Eros or Aphrodite.188It seldom appears outside of herrealm, and is associated with no other divinity with the same consistency. “Inthe presence of the limited employment of this device, these images obtain aheightened interest, in which the goddess is occupied with it [the thymiaterion]while actively sacrificing.”189Nilsson’s problem, which he stated repeatedly,was that there was no recipient in sight. He therefore insisted that theDionysos and Artemis in the Hellenistic reliefs were not sacrificing. Himmel-mann’s argument implies (although he stops short of saying so outright) thatin a sense, the goddess Aphrodite herself is the recipient, not some “strange,unknown divinity.” But she is most definitely also the sacrificer.It is the unique sacrifice due to her. This is the rite which she herselfonce established as a means of sanctification of those who worship“divine libation”: a century of debate151"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"her with it. She herself performs and enjoys this act in her image ofself-sufficient manifestation. She is the power and the conditionalityof her divinity. Sacrifice is holy, godly activity; the sacrificing gods arenot taking over a human activity; the sacrificing human is rathermore imitating the gods, who entrust him with the potential of hav-ing a share in their holiness (“as mortals we follow the laws of thegods” [unhtoBuemnnamoisi xrameua] Euripides, Hippolytus98).190One of the earliest depictions of a sacrificing Dionysos, on the kantharos inBoston discussed earlier (no. 9; Fig. 35), shows the god as he empties his kan-tharos onto a burning altar. Again, there is little hope of finding an unknownrecipient of these libations; on the contrary, the presence of the kantharos thatis peculiar to Dionysos alone proves that the god is executing a rite intendedonly for himself.191For Himmelmann, the libation scenes constitute epiphanies. They are por-traits of the gods “whereby they show their holy being as self-sufficient.” Theydo so by bringing that offering which is unique to them. However, this is onlytrue in the case of Aphrodite and Dionysos. Himmelmann sides with Luscheyin claiming that since the phiale is virtually the only bowl held by the gods inart, it is “the vessel of the gods.”192By “self-sufficient,” he means that the godsdo not require or reflect human practices of worship. Rather, the practices areseen in the vase-paintings as emanating from them. “These pictures are cer-tainly not mythical-episodic, nor do they intend to relate the god and his actionto humanity; they are rather timeless images of existence, which serve only thecontemplation of divinity and its essence....Libating gods are manifest godsin the self-portrayal of their own particular holiness.”193Any god holding aphiale in classical art is involved in both receiving and pouring; in the world ofthe gods, no real distinction should be made between the two conditions. “Wenow do not any more admit as valid in divine images the artistic distinction be-tween the attributive, held cup and the actively executed libation: for one can-not be the opposite of the other, but rather, both indicate the same thing, the di-vinity of the deity.”194This of course evokes the concept of the gods as themselves paradigmaticof forms of worship. In Die Gestalt und das Sein,W. F. Otto wrote, “The holiestcelebrations in the worship of all peoples are a recollection and an exact rep-etition of what was performed by the gods themselves in the beginning oftime.”195According to Plato’s Laws(653D), the gods taught humans to celebrateceremonies so as to keep them occupied and to relieve their boredom. “Thepower of the Greek gods comes not out of their will but rather out of their exis-tence, out of their situation, out of their archetypal essence. What is depictedin the ‘image of existence’ in visionary ways, is the gods’ necessary fidelity to[their] being, which belongs to their functional archetypal nature.”196Ulti-mately, Himmelmann’s approach can be described as Platonic. He cites thegreat myth of Phaedrus, in which the Olympian gods move through the heav-ens at the apices of eleven groups led by Zeus the orderer (Phaedrus246 ff.).Each human soul fixes its gaze upon that divine leader most congenial to itself152ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"(252–253). For “there exist now many holy plays, dramas, and revolutions inheaven, which the race of the holy gods execute, of which each does that whichis according to their being (prattvnEkastoß aDtmntbaCtoM)” (247A).Himmelmann’s belief is that “these images are related to the Platonic ideas,and their eternal power is of the same sort as these, namely to be ‘functioningarchetypes.’ ”197Each god offers according to his or her own being. Becausethey cannot be conditioned or subsumed, the gods do not sacrifice to any otherentity; they simply and eternally sacrifice. History of religion or anachronistictheosophy?For Himmelmann, the bowl in the hand of the god was meant to evoke noth-ing less, but just as important, nothing more, than the divinity of the god. A god’spartipation transformed the act of libation from an outwardly to an inwardly di-rected ritual.198Proceeding from Eckstein-Wolf ’s observation of the function ofthe phiale, the vision of classical Greece he has given us is one in which the godsdwelled at an extreme distance in self-sufficient, frozen sanctity.The logical conclusion of this brilliant exegesis, and its major weakness,must be that the gods’ connection to the world of practiced human religionis nil. Divine ritual exists in a vacuum. But was the religious world of classi-cal Athens so noticeably divorced from divine activity? The construction ofthe Parthenon, Nike Temple, and especially that multivalent cultic home, theErechtheion; the continuing preeminence of the Eleusinian Mysteries; the in-troduction of the cult of Asklepios, the purification of Delos, and even the des-perate pleas to and ultimate rejections of the gods during the time of the greatplague—all testify to the tremendous Athenian sense of divine proximity.199Himmelmann’s classical theology seems to have gnostic resonances. By con-trast the notion of “cultic time,” implied in the theory of divine reflexivity, ac-cepts the uniqueness of divine ritual but at the same time argues that theGreeks imagined continual human ritual interactivity with the prototype andsource. As I will argue, ritualizing gods in ancient Greek art are not depicted ina vacuum, but rather, in a parabola.Divine Libation as Ritual PrototypeIs this a divine paradigm of ritual, performed in illo temporeby god, ancestor, orhero? The Vedic Taittirı ̄ya Bra ̄hman.asays, “Thus the gods did; thus men do,” towhich Mircea Eliade responds, “This Indian adage summarizes all the theoryunderlying rituals in all centuries...therefore, every ritual has a divine model,an archetype.”200To take an outstanding example, the religious evidence atBrauron clearly supports the idea that “In mythology Iphigeneia is the victim,priestess, and double of Artemis.”201As we have observed, on Greek vases thatdepict a scene of divine libation, one sometimes discovers on the reverse amortal priest also pouring a libation onto an altar. The “doubling” of sacrificialscenes suggests a mutual mirroring of the ideal and real worlds of worship.The excavator at Strymi, and for many years Ephor of Antiquities in Mace-donia, Giorgios Bakalakis was a forceful proponent of such an approach. He“divine libation”: a century of debate153"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"believed that libation by deities in Greek art constituted a divine prototype formortal behavior.202His views are offered in the report of his excavation atStrymi, during which a shattered Attic red-figure pelike surfaced. Side A fea-tures a phiale-bearing Apollo, flanked by Artemis with an oinochoe and Letowith a laurel branch; side B, a maenad with arms upraised fleeing from a satyr.On two grounds, Bakalakis rejects the arguments of Otto and Fuchs advo-cating Earth as the object of divine libation. First, he complains that the Earth isvirtually absent from the scenes. “She is absent not only in the [specific] repre-sentations of libation, but in general; few and [highly] circumscribed are theways in which she is depicted in Greek art.”203Hermes can pour libations tothe earth; “not, however, the godly lords of Olympus, because in this way they“abolish themselves” (aDtokatargoPntai).204The concept that Olympian of-ferings to chthonian powers constitute self-negation is original with Bakalakis.One might almost call it an aesthetic judgement, but one that compels becauseit is so visceral.Bakalakis’s solution is inspired by the archaic “Marketplace of the Gods” atDelos published by Charles Picard in 1951.205Picard describes areas in the mid-and late-archaic period consecrated as meeting places for the gods. These con-sisted of a temenosoutside of the walls, but just as often inside the communalenclosure, which were reserved for epiphanies of the gods—for the times whenthey assembled on earth.206He postulates that these legendary apparitionsbecame “fixed” by the erections of statues.207He also suggests that the divine“prototypes” may have inspired the open places of human commerce known asagoras, as the latter were not organized until a much later date. Thus the “reli-gious need” to group the cult places of the deities in the same peribolosof the sanc-tuary, ubiquitous throughout the Hellenic world, must have in turn influencedthe contrivance of Greek agoras. These primitive dgoraBuepn“were the divinemodel offered...as early as the archaic period, for future human agoras.”208Picard describes no fewer than fifteen such “agoras of the gods” set apartfrom but close to human agoras throughout Greece and Asia Minor.209Hegives special attention to the Delian temenos of Peisistratid cult statues (Zeus,Hera, Athena; Leto, Apollo, and Artemis) and altars not on Mount Kynthos butin the marshes of Inopus, near the sixth-century Letoön.210Later the DelianDodekatheon, a small hexastyle Doric temple of the fourth century B.C.E., waserected near the Peisistratid statues. Although divine agoras are not the sameas altars of the twelve gods, Picard states that “it seems to me that the dgoraBuepninfluenced, at least, the celebrated cult of the twelve gods and on the otherhand, the establishment of human agoras.”211Bakalakis believes that the process of conversion (or reduction) of the godsto some common human institution—such as a place to assemble on earth—was characteristic of the classical Greek temperament. He also thinks that itcan help us to understand why scenes of divine libation date from the fifth cen-tury B.C.E. If, built by members of newly emerging city-states, ancient Greekagoras depended on the divine protoypes from late archaic times, then why notancient Greek libations? The Greeks actively sought and therefore imagined di-vine prototypes for their actions, both political and spiritual.212“Exactly as the154ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Greeks had slightly earlier conceived of a “sacred prototype” for their [own] ago-ras, and had established the “agoras of the gods” nearby, so they felt the needfor [such] a sacred prototype in their libations in classical times, because thiscorresponded to the spiritual condition of the age. And by the original influ-ence of mortals who always were very pragmatic in their ‘relations’ to divine be-ings, they were at least raised to a divine archetype.”213In a terse but interesting 1975 monograph that is often overlooked on ac-count of its idiosyncratic English, Elpis Mitropolou published and analyzed acomprehensive survey of the fifty-nine late-classical marble votive reliefs knownup at that time which depict “a libation scene in which one figure holds a phialeor kantharos and the other holds an oinochoe, or one figure holds both ves-sels.”214Although most were made in Attica, there are others whose provenanceis Thessaly, the Peloponnesos, Delos, or Corfu. She classifies these according tothe five identities of the figure holding the oinochoe: If female, it is designatedas a goddess, “heroine,” or priestess; if male, as “a god or an oinochoos.”215Mitropolou reviews and critiques interpretive scholarship on the meaningof libation. She dismisses Simon, saying “It is not necessary to try to find a dif-ferent meaning for the libation in the case of each god and each pair ofdeities.”216She favors the notion of a “divine prototype,” advanced by Bakalakis,whose root lies in “social conditions” (namely, the rise of the polis during theclassical period).Mitropolou notes among her reliefs, where a phiale or kantharos is held bya male figure, that there is only one example where the kantharos is held by amortal; the rest are held by deities or heroes.217On these grounds, she thus up-holds Furtwängler and “humanization”: “The performance of the libation sceneby the Greek deities or heroes is seen as a symbolic representation of man per-forming the libation scene to get the help of the deities or to thank them....Sothe act of making libation was simply transferred in votive reliefs from humanbeings to the deities or heroes.”218As is typical of previous categorical state-ments on the subject, this is simply asserted; we are not told why, except for thestartling implication of a kind of imagined atonement theology: “The deitiesmake the libation to themselves on behalf of the people.”219What can this pos-sibly mean, and what in ancient Greek religion upholds this?Mitropolou vastly confuses the issue by also subscribing to a “libation tothe earth” theory, pointing out that “Greeks made the libation to the earth be-fore the start of their meals (as people nowadays say prayers)...and thesescenes imitate that votive act.”220She consequently disagrees with Bakalakisthat the representation of the earth is necessary for the idea to work, and she re-jects his prophecy that Olympian deities would “abolish themselves” by pour-ing libations to the earth. Thus, according to Mitropolou, either this theme is adivine prototype (the gods are imitating people and heroes by performing actsof worship to themselves) or else they are offering reverence to a greater ances-tral power (that is, to Gaia). That these explanations are logically exclusive ofone another, at least as she presents them, does not seem to bother Mitropolou.But perhaps she is entitled to the same kind of paradoxical thinking that seemsto have produced this iconography.“divine libation”: a century of debate155"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Ongoing Confusion (Kunst der Schale: Kultur des Trinkens)In 1991, the Antikensammlungen of Munich exhibited some of its finest an-cient Greek vases in a show that focused on the art of the drinking cup. Entitled“Kunst der Schale: Kultur des Trinkens” (The Art of the Cup: The Culture ofDrinking), the show explored the culture of wine. Although this theme is oftenassociated with the popular topic of the ancient symposium, the show also in-cluded vases that depict the pouring of libations. An entire display case was de-voted to vases illustrating the ritual of libation. Another was called “SpendendeGötter.” However, even within its limited scope, the short entry in the show’scatalogue offers serious internal contradictions. The author, Susanne Pfisterer-Haas, attempts a smorgasbord of interpretation for four different vases.221Culled from previous scholarship, the four approaches offered by the articleseem to assume that each scholar’s interpretation only makes sense for oneparticular case.Pfisterer-Haas takes Himmelmann as her springboard when she claimsthat when libation is executed by the gods themselves, it becomes “the essenceof self-delight in their own divinity.”222In the next sentence, she contradictsherself in the interpretation of a potent gathering of deities at a libation por-trayed on a red-figure belly amphora by the Nikoxenos Painter, dating from500B.C.E.223Zeus, identified by lightening bolts and his eagle scepter, andHera receive a bare-breasted Iris bearing an oinochoe and phiale. Athena ispresent, as is Hermes; seated in a throne across from his two siblings is Posei-don. The author tells us not that Zeus is rejoicing in his own divinity, but thathe is about to pour a libation “either as a proxy for the rest of the gods or to ren-der to them the libation which is due them.”224But why assume that the divinelibation has a specific object in this case? Close examination of the vase leads tothe real question: Why assume that Zeus is about to make a libation at all? It isnot he, but Iris, who holds the sacrificial paraphernalia.In an early classical stamnos in which Zeus extends the phiale while Nikeholds the oinochoe, Pfisterer-Haas decides that Zeus is no longer the sacrifi-cer.225“On the picture on the stamnos, the scepter characterizes him as theruler, the libation bowl as the foremost sacrifical recipient.” This is a completeinterpretive switch from the previous vase. But how are the two scenes differ-ent? On what basis can one argue that the first Zeus is offering, whereas thesecond is receiving a libation? Both figures are enthroned. There are moregods present in the first one, on whose behalf she says (without foundation)that Zeus might be offering. If anything, the first Zeus would be more likelyto be a recipient, since Iris brings him the bowl and vessel, whereas the sec-ond holds the phiale and would seem far more likely to be pouring theoffering.On a third vase, the goddess Athena and a crowned female figure bearinga libation bowl stand opposite each other.226Both are “enthralled by the solemnityof the action which takes place in honor of the goddess.”227Athena is neither156ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"offering nor receiving, but is somehow contemplating a sacrifice that is spon-taneously and autonomously occurring. The idea of the ritual executing itselfis derivative from Eckstein-Wolf ’s electrifying but far-fetched “die Schalespendet, nicht der Gott.” However, Eckstein-Wolf meant her idea to apply toallthe vases in her catalogue. Here the eclectic approach acquires a third vari-ation, applied to only one example.Things get even murkier in the case of a kalpis hydria featuring Aphrodite.The goddess appears frontally with scepter and a goose, a bird often associatedwith the goddess, between two female figures. The left figure holds a sacrificialvessel and a richly decorated libation bowl. “The question of whether the god-dess herself is performing sacrifice between two goddesses, or whether she ap-pears to two mortal women who will execute the wine-offering to her glory,poses itself only to the modern observer. For the people of antiquity, the sacri-ficing goddess was identical to the goddess who received sacrifice.”228Thisprovocative (and somewhat categorical!) statement is delivered without justifi-cation. Why were the two identical?Pfisterer-Haas rushes on to Dionysos, whom she observes is “more fre-quently...presented wine by his companions than the other gods,” as on ared-figure krater by the Brygos Painter.229She asserts that because Dionysos’sspecial vase is a kantharos, the meaning of his action is also different from thatof the other gods; no distinction should be made between drinking (receiving)and pouring.230As in the case of the Aphrodite scene, the question is based ona series of theoretical assumptions, which, taken as a starting point, lead to theremaining confusion.Recent IdeasThe more recent past has seen only sporadic treatments of the problem of thesacrificing gods on Attic vases. We have already mentioned the work of K. W.Arafat. Paul Veyne has argued that when libation bowls appear in the hands ofthe gods, libation should be understood as a “rite of passage” on the way to sac-rifice and not as sacrificial offerings at all.231He rejects the notion of the gods“making a gesture which humans must imitate and repeat . . . [whereby] thegods exemplify pietastoward the gods,” that is, setting a good example for hu-man beings. Veyne’s objection is almost aesthetic: “The subtlety of the thoughtofhomo religiosusis so majestic! Can we not think of a more poetic explanation?Can one not explain these gods with libation bowls in some way other than di-dactic intentionality?”232Although Veyne clearly admits that the altar was un-derstood as the possession of the god (and was sometimes inscribed as such),he also subscribes to the view of libation (and incense) offered thereon as “ap-parently without a precise divine destination.”233This leaves him with the famil-iar problem of no recipient for divine libations; he concludes that thereforelibation should be classified separately from sacrifice. After reviewing theancient Greek evidence, and concentrating on later Hellenistic and especially“divine libation”: a century of debate157"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Roman votive reliefs and sculptures, Veyne concludes that because libation-pouring is a prelude to sacrifice proper (in which sacred action he claims theancient gods are never represented), it must represent a kind of ritual zone inwhich both deities and mortals can participate in inaugurating a heilige Hand-lung.234Thus, Veyne muses, divine libation serves as a kind of passport or foyerto the real destination, a geste as opposed to the gift-giving action of sacrifice.As such, the phiale (or Latin patera) in the hand of the god is to be understoodonly semiotically as “a qualifying adjective: sacred, holy,” tautologically reiterat-ing the divinity of the god who holds it.235Veyne is right to look beyond the unsatisfying concept of divine libation asparadigm or lesson for mortals. His notion of the ritual bowl as “adjective”about the god comes close to the concept of both bowl and act of libation as di-vine attributes explained in chapter 5. Yet his sharp distinction between liba-tion and animal sacrifice, geste and action, misses the mark, in that apparentlyboth gods and humans participated in a ritual continum that included all ofthese; the red wine painted streaming from the bowls in the images of godswho poured it out was surely a sign of efficacious activity on their part, extend-ing beyond the simple signification of their status.Finally, Herbert Hoffman, whose work we have already cited, offers an ex-planation growing out of the Oriental origin of the phiale, its royal pedigreeand function, and the Athenians’ fascination with things Persian during thefifth century.236The reason why a characteristically Persian shape of drinking vesselshould be shown in the hands of Greek gods and heroes (and be usedby Greek mortals for pouring libations to these spirit entities) has todo with a utopic fantasy widely held in Greece at this time: Persia wasidealized as the paragon of luxury and of superior material civiliza-tion. “Persianism,” the copy of Persian style and fashion in the fifthcentury not only permeated the very fabric of Greek life, it also pro-foundly influenced Greek eschatology. The Great King’s banquet, em-bodying the utmost in imaginable extravagance, had come to definethe Greek ideal of paradise.237Like Veyne’s, Hoffman’s semiotic approach seems to bracket the fact that thegods not only hold these vessels but time and again are shown actually pouringlibations from them. This fact is interpretively impossible, hence ignored.The modern history of scholarship on the sacrificing gods reveals a fascinat-ing series of interdependent reactions to ancient religiosity. Does divine libationmean something different in each god’s case? Or can one unified iconographictheory explain the ancient Greek vase-paintings? In chapter 5, I outline the inter-nal philosophical contradictions in the preceding theories. I then offer a theoret-ical solution to this iconographic problem, which takes as a starting premise theidea that most or all of the sacrificing gods’ scenes reflect a single religious idea.I believe that this pictorial “idea” is a tree with its roots in a particular outlook onritual: Ritual has its source in divine agency and action. We are left with only the158ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"“branches” of the tree—the artistic expressions of this outlook—the gods pour-ing libations. Because only the branches are visible, we have been left benightedby the Greeks, who sometimes did not explain themselves.I will try to show how and why these images depict the relationship ofGreek immortals to forms of ancient Greek religion, and what the nature ofthis relationship might be.“divine libation”: a century of debate159"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"5The Problem Defined and a Proposed SolutionDivine Reflexivity in Ritual RepresentationThose scholars whose thought has evolved beyond the sacrificialmodel of do ut des—such as Meuli, Gernet, Bataille, Burkert, Girard,Vernant, Detienne, and Jay—have created elaborate, often contradic-tory paradigms: Sacrifice is institutionalized violence, it substitutesfor the murder of human beings, or else preserves the symbiotic rela-tionship between hunter and hunted, originating in the Central Asiansteppes. It articulates and reinscribes hierarchies of gender and sta-tus, or is merely a pious pretext for the communal distribution ofscarce protein, with the veneer of worship appearing later. It is a re-sponse to an excess of resources, or alternatively, to their dearth.Hubert and Mauss have explored the magical power of the god asvictim, from Osiris to Dionysos to Purus.a and Christ.1But what is thetheoretical foundation in Greek religion for the god as sacrificer? “Thestructuralist approach to myth, represented by Claude Lévi-Strauss,sees myth as a language that reconciles social oppositions. There ismuch value in showing the detailed way in which myth contains socio-cultural structures and dynamics, but structuralism does not deal withwhat myth meant religiously in the lives of its participants.”2The samecritique might also be made of much of contemporary ritual studies.Sources of Theoretical Confusion Occasioned by Libation-Pouring GodsThe “libating gods” in classical vase-painting and other media havecaused five major forms of theoretical confusion for the historian ofGreek religion.

Some of them are dependent upon each other;"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"that is, once a problematic assumption has been made, rather than having itlead to clarification, other interpretive problems arise therefrom. Most beginwith a problem of classification; the artistic phenomenon of a “god who poursa libation” cannot be accurately classified or theorized according to “known”categories of thought in Greek religion. The attempt to apply these inadequatecategories has led to interpretations that necessarily exclude some or a greatdeal of the iconographic evidence, or that suffer what is portrayed to undergo asea change into what cannot be portrayed or intended.Problem #1: “Divine” Omnipotence versus “Human” ContingencyThe ancient Greek gods were not understood as contingent, mutable beingswho recognized any power greater than themselves. Human beings, on theother hand, were seen in ancient Greek religion as both contingent and muta-ble. At every phase of Greek religious history, mortals oriented themselves byworshiping the gods, whom they regarded as superior to themselves. No matterhow anthropomorphic the gods may seem to us or to Xenophanes, this hierar-chical separation was, in the parameters of the Greek religious imagination, ab-solute; myth dwells on the times in the remote past when those limits weretransgressed, to the agony of all. As Jenny Strauss Clay notes, “menisis the reac-tion of the gods to conduct which is superhuman or which tends to erase thedistinctions between gods and men. Patroclus and Diomedes arouse the menisof Apollo at the moment they are characterized as daAmoniGsoß, ‘equal to a dai-mon’ [Iliad16.705, 5.438].

Therefore, when the immortals themselves make offerings,they are acting in a way that seems contradictory to their essential nature. Thatis, they are acting like mortals—not insofar as they are adulterous or quarrel-some, but far more paradoxically, insofar as the performance of ritual actionseems to imply their inferiority, contingency, and mutability.Resulting Theoretical Confusion #1: Anthropomorphic Explanations of Divine RitualIf worship is by definition an activity dedicated to some power greater thanone’s own being, how can gods worship the way mortals do? These scenes162ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"seem to present a hierarchical impossibility, and for that reason, as we haveseen, some scholars go so far as to deny that they represent gods in the actof sacrificing. The category of “worship” is seen as “humanizing” the gods,that is, making them less than omnipotent. Historical and literary trendsin the period from 510 to 460 B.C.E. are then sought to justify this allegeddegradation.Problem #2: “The Hierarchy of Sacrifice”To what power would the members of the Greek pantheon owe worship? If thegods of the vases are actually performing ritual actions, then one must provethat there is a logical reason for the actions, and a logical cultic “direction” inwhich they should work. This is a comfortable lens through which to view thesacrificial ministrations of “lesser” or “younger” gods such as Iris or Perse-phone, who pour for more powerful or older gods such as Athena or Demeter.Furthermore, members of the second generation of deities, the children ofZeus—such as Athena—are often portrayed on the vases serving Zeus andHera. Yet this assumption of a hierarchical model of sacrifice in the case of thegods falters when Zeus or Hera pour libations; then they are regarded as offer-ing to the Titans—their predecessors, whom they were compelled tooverthrow—or to Gaia, Mother Earth, their primeval ancestress. This accordssome kind of vestigial superiority to these assumed, shadowy recipients, whomwe never see, despite literary evidence from the Theogonyto the pseudo-AeschyleanPrometheusthat makes it clear that Zeus is the unchallenged leaderof the dominant divine order in the Greek cosmos.An attendant confusion about the vase representations concerns the ques-tion of whether the act of pouring the wine from the oinochoe into the phialerepresents a sort of obeisance to the god holding the phiale, or whether it rep-resents simply a mutual act of sacrifice. Does the oinochoe bearer have lesspower than the phiale bearer? The concept of “obeisance,” implicit in a hierar-chical model, might certainly apply when Iris fills the oinochoe of Apollo, orAthena pours for Zeus; but what to think when Artemis, the sister and twin ofApollo, pours for her brother—or, even more confusingly, when the mightyAthena ministers for the libation of a hero such as Herakles, or the goddessNike pours for a departing mortal warrior?Resulting Theoretical Confusion #2: “Invisible Recipients”The need to establish familiar and ritually “logical” hierarchies of sacrifice isapplied to the libations poured by deities. This reflects the assumption thatgods must worship for the same reason that people do, namely, to honor or im-portune beings greater than themselves. But if this assumption is true, inmany cases the alleged “divine recipients” must therefore be invisible, sincethey are not portrayed in the central scene of the image.the problem defined and a proposed solution163"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Problem #3: The Enthroned God: Recipient or Sacrificer?The “sacrificing god” scenes, whether represented on vases, coins, statues, orreliefs, all fall somewhere along a spectrum of three different votive aspects.A. They are clearly cult statues, or, in the case of vase-paintings, portray-als of cult statues of divinities who extend the libation bowl from anenthroned or standing position. All “cult statues” in all forms of mediahave been assumed to be “recipients” of libation by virtually all previ-ous scholars. In this first case, the gods as represented are themselves cul-tic objects.B. They are clearly animated divinities who are holding a cultic object,such as a libation bowl or an incense-burner or standing in proximityto one, such as an altar or lustral basin. It is not clear in these in-stances how or whether the gods are using these objects. In the caseswhere no wine is visible pouring from phiale to altar or ground, it isimpossible to tell whether these gods are intended by the artist to beunderstood as giving or as receiving offerings; the question is insolu-ble from the iconographic contexts. These are clearly not cult statues,but“living gods” portrayed in association with cultic objects.C. They are animated deities who are unmistakably performing an act ofworship. For example, if they hold a libation bowl, the wine is visiblesplashing onto an altar or onto the ground. In this category fall “livinggods” performing cultic actions.Resulting Theoretical Confusion #3: False Criterion for the “Direction” of SacrificeThere is often no way of telling exactly into which category any given imagefalls. Is it a seated cult statue? Is it the real god or goddess? Is he or she pouringout of the phiale, or is he or she stretching out his bowl to receive the wine? Theinterpretation of the image has often hinged on subjective opinion as towhether it portrays categories A, B, or C—the god as an object of cult; the godas a living entity, holding or in proximity to cultic objects; or the god as a livingentity who actually uses a cultic object to perform an act of worship.Based on these limited categories, we might well wonder whether the “en-throned” deities who stretch forth the libation bowl belong in the category ofsacrificing gods at all. If the god is enthroned, the phiale is almost without ex-ception parallel to the altar or to the ground, rather than tipped. Although thegod may watch with lively delight as his or her bowl is filled (as in the tondo ofthe kylix by Douris at the Getty Museum [no. 41] in which Zeus’s vessel is filledby Ganymede as the highest god is seated before an altar), these are clearly themajestic, if animated, descendents of seated cult images.The “enthronement” of the goddess, and, correspondingly of her viceroyon earth, the king, was a crucial feature of Minoan-Mycenaean religion. In fact,164ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"the identification of divine figure, mortal ruler, and throne was so completethat many small “chair gods” survive from the Mycenean period—small terra-cotta idols that resemble thrones, but that have breasts and sometimes facialfeatures. The throne of the god was one of the few religious features that sur-vived the Dark Ages, to emerge in the Geometric and Archaic periods in themyriad statuettes of the seated goddess offered at sanctuaries.5These are smallreplicas of the main cult image, which was also seated; the archaic statues ofAthena Lindia at Rhodes, Athena Polias at Athens, Hera at Samos, and manyothers were shown enthroned, rather than standing.The seated god’s extension of the vessel may be a symbol of divine or royalauthority, having as its iconographic ancestor the frequent Mesopotamianscenes of “the king and the cup,” such as are found on Ur III seals.6This is re-peated in many scenes from the Minoan-Mycenean period, most notably, a goldsignet ring dating from 1450 B.C.E. from Tiryns, now in the Athens National Mu-seum. Four animal-headed worshipers approach an enthroned goddess, whohails them with her upraised cup. Each bears a jug that distinctly reflects thelater form of the oinochoe, the vessel used to fill the phiale. Fascinating icono-graphic parallels exist from Sparta on archaic reliefs depicting chthonian deitiesextending that infernal vessel, the kantharos (nos. C–47andC–48). And inscenes in vase-paintings such as that of the enthroned Cybele and Sabazios inthe underworld scene on a Polygnotan krater, the gods preside on a kind ofstatue base in divine majesty, their bowls extended as a symbol of regal author-ity (no. 195). And yet the matter is not so easily resolved. For from these gods’bowls spill libations, while the sacred dance of an orgiastic chorus whirlsthrough their sanctuary. The “enthronement” of gods in vase-paintings, whetherthey represent cult statues, living gods, or something in between, cannot be usedas a valid criterion for determining whether the gods are offering or receiving li-bations in their outstretched phialai.Problem #4: Frequency of Libation as a Ritual Act by the GodsThe scholarly discussion tracked in chapter 4 has centered on scenes of libationas a specific act of divine worship, since it is by far the most popular one duringthe sixty-year period in question. As a result, the debate has gotten sidetracked,speculatively focusing solely on the role of liquidofferings when the gods pourthem. This ignores the fact that the same time period produced a number ofother representations of the gods involved in a wide spectrum of ritual perfor-mances other than libation. Libation is only one element of the religious activityundertaken by the Olympians.In vase-paintings, gods frequently hover near their altars—but not in a pas-sive, waiting mode, as if expecting offerings, but in an active, attentive mode,almost as though they were tending the altars. For example, in no. C–54,a Panathenaic-style amphora by the Nikoxenos Painter in Berlin, Athena presidesat her altar with a kithara; in no. C–58, an amphora by the same artist in the Lou-vre, the goddess draws even closer, bending almost tenderly as she extends herthe problem defined and a proposed solution165"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"hand over her flaming altar. In nos. C–52andC–53, red-figure lekythoi in Athens,Artemis appears with flaming torches before her altar. There is a palpable energyin the atmosphere of these images. It is that of the attentive bond between the godand his or her own offering-place—and there is arguably no more central featureofhumancult in Greek religion than the altar.That bond intensifies in a votive relief in Copenhagen (no. C–62). ArtemisEupraxia does not merely superintend, but actually lights her own altar with hertorch, holding a sacrificial basket aloft, as a retinue of smaller, mortal worshipersapproach. On the hydria by the Berlin Painter now in Italy (no. 29; Figs. 2, 3), inaddition to the libation of Apollo, we find another divine offering: Flowers and agarland are laid on the altar, and Leto is bringing a blossom. In an early classicalcup from Capua by the Euaion Painter (no. C–61; Fig. 62), Demeter lays a bunchof wheat—her own sacred emblem, province, and gift to humanity—on an altar;the cup is inscribed DEMETPOS, “belonging to Demeter.” Aphrodite often burnsincense using a ritual burner, the thymiaterion—as in no. C–68, a calyx krater inTübingen, and no. C–63 (Fig. 63), a hydria in New York that depicts a similarscene. A Roman copy of a monumental Eleusinian relief, no. C–65(Fig. 64),shows the great goddesses of Eleusis dropping incense onto a small burning altar.Apollo washes his hand in an act of ritual purification at a lustral basin in a neckamphora by the Nikon Painter dating from about 475 B.C.E.(no. C–66; Fig. 65).Gods can appear with sacrificial animal victims at altars, or even lead themthere, as in a spirited design on an early Hellenistic bell krater in the Louvre(no. C–42) in which the god Hermes, wearing a cape and winged boots, andholding a garlanded caduceus, festal wreaths, and a decorated phiale, leads aram to sacrifice at a small altar. Interestingly, as is sometimes the case with166ancient greek gods in ritual performancefigure 62.Demeter lays a wheat bunch on an altar. Genitive of name isinscribed:DEMETPOS.

Perhaps the greatest shock value is afforded by the ecstaticDionysos who tears a hind in no.

C–34). The scene becomes explicitly sacrificial in a pelike in theBritish Museum (no. C–38) where the god rends the animal in the presence ofan altar. A black-figure olpe in Ferrara’s Museo Nazionale finds Athena withhelmet, shield, and aegis, holding two spits with her left hand, around whichare wrapped the entrails of a sacrificed animal. The goddess roasts the meatover a fire which probably burns on an altar beneath, although it is hidden;with her right hand, she pours a libation from a phiale onto the flames.

Therefore it is highly misleading to focus ex-clusively on libation, as has been done, or to analyze its unique features in aneffort to shed light on this iconographic paradox. As we saw in chapter 1, li-bation has been difficult to ignore because it is the most frequent ritual ac-tion performed by the gods. But in these images, libation is not the only sub-ject; the gods display many kinds of religious behavior—all of it recognizablefrom the mortal realm. A continuum of cultic involvement on the part of thegods is presented in this iconography, ranging from fairly passive associationwith the physical elements of cult to active, even ecstatic enactment of ritualactions.Problem # 5: Mythic Episode versus “Immediate” Cult SceneHermeneutically, there seem to be only two possible ways of interpretingGreek gods shown pouring liquid offerings. These are drastically opposed.168ancient greek gods in ritual performancefigure 64.Roman version of an Eleusinian relief of Demeter and Perse-phone, who drop incense onto a small flaming altar.

As we notedin chapter 4, this may work in certain cases—such as the entry of Her-akles into Olympus, the departure of Triptolemus with the gift of grain,or the birth of Erichthonios. But it presents problems in cases such asthat of the mutual libation of Zeus and Hera, or the offerings of Apolloand Artemis poured over omphalos or altar. The approach breaks downcompletely when there is no known mythic episode to explain thescene, that is, Poseidon pouring from a phiale assisted by Amphitrite,the sacrificing Ares, or Athena pouring libations unaccompanied byHerakles. Freestanding statues holding phialai are impossible to ex-plain with this line of interpretation except by arbitrarily deciding thatthey are the “recipients” of mortal libations (this is related to problem #3). Such a decision, however, presents difficulties in that the generallysharp angle of their libation bowls would seem to preclude pouringanything into it; the wine would spill out onto the ground.B.

But in these vase-paintings, there is no recipient in sight.Divine Reflexivity: A Proposed SolutionBy now I hope it is clear why there has been so much confusion in previousscholarship on the vexing topic of the sacrificing gods. I would like to suggestthat if we hope to understand these scenes, it is not helpful to rely on the“canonical” model of ancient Greek sacrifice in which mortals offer gifts to thegods, who in some way receive them.Rather, I would propose, as an approach to this iconographic mystery, thatthe gods be considered not only as the object of cult but more important, re-flexively understood within the tradition as the source or subject of cult—thatis, as the origin and catalyst for religious behavior, including human. The ideathat the gods conceive and introduce their own solemn festivals to mortals isnot alien to ancient Greek religion. The Homeric Hymn to Apolloreminds thegod that he said to Telephousa, “here I intend to build a beautiful temple to bean oracle for men who will always bring to me here unblemished hecatombs.”7In the Hymn to Demeter,we listen as that great goddess ordains her own mys-teries: “Let all the people build me a great temple and beneath it an altar underthe steep walls of the city, above Kallichoron, on the rising hill. I myself shallintroduce rites (grgia d› aDtbDgbnCpouasomai) so that later you may propri-tiate my mind by their right performance.”8In Plato’s Laws,as Himmelmannreminds us, the author recounts the divine origin of religious festivals: “Nowthese forms of child-training, which consist in right discipline in pleasures andpains, grow slack and weakened to a great extent in the course of men’s lives; sothe gods, in pity for the human race thus born to misery, have ordained thefeasts of thanksgiving as periods of respite from their troubles; and they havegranted them as companions in their feasts the Muses and Apollo the master ofmusic, and Dionysos, that they may at least set right again their modes of dis-cipline by associating in their feasts with the gods.”9Religious activity is part ofthe natural sphere of the Greek god.10But it is not just any religion the gods practice. A closer look at some ofthe examples from the “Comparanda” section which we considered above in170ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"problem #4reveals a crucial aspect of the gods’ religious behavior: gods practicethose forms of religion that are specific to their own particular form of worship. Him-melmann first observed that Dionysos tends to pour only from the kantharos,which is his special vessel, and the vase which is emblematic of his cult—andthat Aphrodite often burns incense, incense-burning being an important as-pect of her cult.11This observation if pursued, leads into a world of thought thatrequires new models.For me, the case was sealed when, on one hot summer day at the AshmoleanMuseum in Oxford, I met Apollo, the god of purification and Pythagorean mys-ticism, washing his own hand at a lustral basin—a perirrhanterion.The scenewas painted on a classical amphora (no. C–66: Fig. 65). Ritual purification withwater at just such a basin is a central aspect of the cult of Apollo; purity is hisdistinct sphere.12Apollo practices and reinforces his own religion. The searchfor a recipient for these religious actions performed by the gods, including li-bations, is endlessly problematic. Iconographically, the gods naturally “attract”both the votive objects and the votive actions associated with their worship.This I call “divine reflexivity”—cultic behavior appropriate to the sphere of theindividual deity and which thus is ascribed to his or her agency, reflexively iter-ating the god’s particular characteristics and powers.With divine reflexivity as an explanatory method, pieces began to fall intoplace. For example, in no. C–61 (Fig. 62), the cup in Brussels in which Deme-ter lays a wheat bunch on an altar, the goddess does not lay a flowering branch,a cake, or a fish, but a bunch of wheat; as is characteristic of all ritual action,this is not an arbitrary choice. Wheat is Demeter’s own attribute—a possessionand signifier of her sacred sphere of influence. The genitive of her name in-scribed on the cup, DEMETPOS, surely means that the cup itself is dedicatedto her and belongs to her. But we may also take it to mean that the grain isuniquely hers. The altar is hers. The offering act itself is also hers.In these scenes of divine libation we have neither the iconographic represen-tation of myth nor aggravated anthropomorphism. We have many vase-paintingsthat superbly display these attributes, for example, no. C–44 (Fig. 66), a black-figure hydria in Berlin, which depicts a gathering of Olympians, each with his orher unique, identifying attribute; and no.

It is the appropriate province of the divine.The Introduction referred to the Hegelian delineation of the “self-enclosed,” self-subsisting nature of God, and the complete difference of God’sontological nature from that of other things. In Hegel’s phenomenology of reli-gion we have perhaps the most articulate expression of reflexivity as a neces-sary aspect of the divine. In his lecture “The Concept of Religion,” Hegel said,The things and developments of the natural and spiritual world con-stitute manifold configurations, and endlessly multiform existence;172ancient greek gods in ritual performancefigure 66.Attic black-figure hydria.

If we ascribe a being to particular things, it is only aborrowed being, only the semblance of a being, not the absolutely in-dependent being that God is. God in his universality, this universal inwhich there is no limitation, finitude, or particularity, is the absolutesubsistence. Whatever subsists has its roots and subsistence only inthis One. If we grasp this initial content in this way, we can express itthus: “God is the absolute substance, the only true actuality.”17Hegel goes on to argue that God as Spirit mustmanifest itself, and in so doing,allows for the possibility of consciousness:Spirit is an absolute manifesting....The making or creation of theworld is God’s self-manifesting, self-revealing. In a further and laterdefinition we will have this manifestation in the higher form thatwhat God creates God himself is, that in general it does not have thedeterminateness of an other, that God is manifestation of his ownself, that God is for himself—the other (which has the empty sem-blance of [being] an other but is immediately reconciled)....Here forthe first time we have consciousness, the subjectively knowing spiritfor which God is object. From this it follows that God can be knownor cognized, for it is God’s nature to reveal himself, to be manifest.18Hegel’s critique of the Greek gods, echoing that of Xenophanes, as “products ofhuman imagination or sculptured deities formed by human hands,” whose “fini-tude” and “particularity,” the production “of phantasy for phantasy”19does notnegate the potential value of his theory of God’s necessary self-manifestation inconsciousness—and, I would argue, in cult—for the interpretation of the gods’rituals in ancient Greek or any other religion. It is a mistake to think that becausethe gods of pantheistic systems of antiquity were so easily pictured in art, litera-ture, and cult that the ancients believed them to be thereby easily circumscribed,a divine that is “grasped neither by pure thinking nor in pure spirit.” Rather, di-vinely performed ritual would seem to be an exemplary illustration of Hegelianphenomenology, an expression and manifestation of divine being.Ritual itself is an intensely reflexive phenomenon. As Roy Rappaport notes,the performer of the ritual subordinates himself to the “order that the ritual en-codes simply by performing it.” However, “the reflexive act of subordinationalso establishes that to which there is subordination. To exist, a liturgical ordermust be performed. Liturgical orders, the orders encoded in ritual, are substan-tiated—provided substance, or realized—made into resonly in instances of theirperformance. The relationship of performer to performance is extraordinarilyintimate, or even inextricable. By participating in a ritual, the performer be-comes part of an order which is utterly dependent for its very existence upon in-stances, such as his, of its performance.”20Ritualizing gods pose a challenge toalmost every attempt to theorize ritual. When a god is the performer, one canthe problem defined and a proposed solution173"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"argue that the ritual is even more dependent “for its very existence” upon itsperformance than if a human being is the ritualizer. One cannot, however,argue that the god is somehow “subordinate” to the order of the ritual. In thecase of the ritualizing god, the reflexive relationship of performer to perfor-mance is even more intimate, in that the divine performer not only origi-nates the ritual order he or she follows but also imbues it with the onlymeaning it can have. The origin and “purpose” of the ritual order is one andthe same: the self-expression of the god performing it. The ritual, not thegod, is subordinated.I have attempted to show in the previous chapters that the phenomenon ofthe ritualizing god occurs in any number of other religious traditions, and thatwhen this idea is found, it “describes” the divine realm as the source andagency for the world of all ritual action, including human religious behavior.The representation of sacrificing gods, or gods performing other rituals, bothself-referentially comments upon the religious system as a whole and at thesame time intensifies it.Barry Sandywell writes of the philosophical question of reflexivity, “Generi-cally every self-referential system can be described as reflexiveto the degree thatit possesses the capacity to turn back upon its own organization and operationsin order to perform work on itself as a routine practical feature of its function-ing....Minds routinely engage in ordered forms of reflexion and self-reflexion.Systems which are capable of self-directed movements are today described asbehavioural systems. Unlike inert objects they engage in behaviour, acting uponand changing their environments.”21Religious systems, of course, because theyaspire to a Weltanschauung that is total, comprises everything, and thus aims atepistemological comprehensiveness, are supremely self-referential. They chron-ically turn back upon and maintain their own operations, partly through theprocess of the ongoing reinterpretation of new historical realities in light of es-tablished, eternalized paradigms.The gods in ritual performance are surely nothing if not self-referential.Their religious actions point to their own numinous selves, and refer to theirown worship as practiced by mortals.22It is important, however, for the nu-anced construction of the category that it is understood that gods worshipuniquely as gods. Thus in the Hymn to Hermespassage which we considered inchapter 3, Hermes does noteat the meat of the sacrifice he has prepared be-cause he is not a mortal performing a mortal sacrifice—he is a god, and so, likethe God of Genesis 8:21, enjoys the “sweet savour,” the part that the gods ap-propriately receive. This issue of the special nature of “the religion of the gods”will occur repeatedly in the comparative material presented in the second halfof this book. Divine ritual is not the same as human ritual.How it WorksI set forth this interpretation not simply because it differs from those preced-ing it but because I believe that it is the only one flexible enough to account for174ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"all the evidence. It requires that no exceptions be made and no evidence sup-pressed in order to make sense. Let us briefly return to the five major problemsresulting in theoretical confusion that we have identified, to see if this particu-lar interpretive approach might help to resolve some of them.Problem #1: “Divine” Omnipotence versus “Human” ContingencyAmong others, W. K. Arafat assumes that worship originates in the mortalrealm. But if we start from the premise that sacrifice, and in fact all forms ofworship, might have been seen in antiquity as originating with the gods andbelonging to them, then we do not have the problem of the gods being “hu-manized” by a mortal act.The notion of divine libation as divine reflexivity or self-referentiality doesnot see the performance of religious ritual as rendering the gods “like” hu-mans, or “humanized” in some way that degenerates their powers. An act ofnormally human worship thus becomes an expression of the god’s role as thesource of human cult, rather than ballast that drags him or her down to the hu-man level of contingency or inferiority. In this way, it is faithful to the ancientGreeks’ conception of the deities as perfect and omnipotent. It does not requirean interpretation that does violence to the indigenous ancient Greek concept ofthe gods’ immortality or perfection.Problem #2: “The Hierarchy of Sacrifice”Introducing the idea of divine reflexivity, it is no longer necessary to establish thata superior god is an inferior one in the libation scenes. If both cultic objects (flow-ers, grain, phiale, wine, blood, lyre, sacrificial animal victim) and cultic actionscan be associated with the deity as numinous attributes, there is no need to positan invisible “divine recipient” of the offering made by that deity. The god is in re-lation to no other entity than herself and the mortals who also practice the rite.Problem#3:The Enthroned God: Recipient or Sacrificer?It is also not necessary to determine whether a deity is a portrayed cult statue, aliving god standing with a bowl in hand as if either to receive or pour, or a liv-ing god definitely pouring. Not only cultic objects but also cultic actions are attrib-utes of divinity, and thus “belong” to the god or goddess.Thus it is as appropriatefor Aphrodite to carry a thymiaterion as it is for her actually to burn grains ofincense in it, and as appropriate for Dionysos to hold a kantharos above an al-tar as actually to rend an animal. It is appropriate for Apollo to wash his handsat a perirrhanterion, for this is an important purifying action associated withhis particular cult. The god’s self-originating ritual may be construed as para-digmatic, but does not need to be seen as so. Neither is it necessary to decidewhether an individual god is pouring or receiving libations, as both actions arepart of the larger divine sphere of religious activity.the problem defined and a proposed solution175"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Problem # 4: Frequency of Libation as a Ritual Act by the GodsIf libation is seen as but one of the multiple cultic actions associated with thegods in Greek art, it is not necessary to distinguish it from any of the others. Asnoted in chapter 1, libation is a ritual that is generic to the worship of all thegods, as opposed to the specificity of some of the other ritual acts consideredthus far. The ubiquity of scenes of libation in classical art have confused thepicture, because the phiale and the act of pouring from it belong to all the gods.In this approach, libation surrenders its privileged place and takes a properplace on a broader spectrum of ritual actions that can be both dedicated to thegods and performed by them.Problem # 5: Mythic Episode versus “Immediate” Cult SceneThe explanatory device of divine reflexivity does not require a mythical episode,known or unknown, for each scene. It allows for mythical influences, but doesnot require them. The gods are actually worshiping in a recognizable culticcontext, but they are not worshiping exactly as mortals do—that is, they are notworshiping something or someone else. They are worshiping because they arethe source of, and reason for, all worship. The paradox is not resolved, but ithas its own internal logic.“Dances with Gods”: Cultic ReciprocityBy no means do I wish to imply that the “religion of the gods” has no relation-ship to human religiosity. In fact, divine reflexivity entails the opposite: an inti-mate, dynamic relationship mediated by the parabolic ritual action itself. AsPaden observes,A god is not just a bare object—like a statue in a museum—but partof a bilateral relationship. A god is a god ofsomeone or tosomeone.Only in the eyes of a religious person can a god be a god as such.A god is a category of social, interactive behavior, experienced in a waythat is analogous to the experience of other selves. With gods one re-ceives, gives, follows, loves, imitates, communes, negotiates, contests,entrusts. A god is a subject to us as objects and an object to us as sub-jects. We address it, or it can address us. Part of this relational qualityis even evident in the etymology of the English term god, which tracesback to a root that means either “to invoke” or “sacrifice to.”23I suggest that these vases iconographically imagine the gods not only as havingestablished but as themselves continually performing their rites in ongoing“cultic time,” just as the talmudic God prays each day that his mercy mightovercome his justice. Unlike the picture of a kind of pristine vacuum impliedby Himmelmann, the gods’ worship seems to both parallel and respond to hu-man cultic observance. This is why mortal libation scenes appear on the oppo-site side of the vases. As the gods pour, so do mortals. As mortals pour, so do176ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"the gods. From an emic perspective within the ancient Greek tradition, how-ever, ritual action originates with the gods, not with humans imitating gods.The distinction is pivotal, in my view, to an accurate and nuanced “translation”of this corpus of iconography.Essential Features of Divine ReflexivityIt is now possible to articulate the characteristic and even recurrent features ofthe phenomenological category of divine reflexivity, a self-referential operationin the sphere of the religious imagination that unites cultic semiotics and theo-logical meaning. These might be set forth as follows:1. Its representation in text and artifact offers a kind of intensificationand ultimacy to the ritual portrayed as performed by a deity.2. Such intensification can function conservatively to reinscribe thecentral significance of the ritual during historical periods of crisiswhen the religious system itself is threatened or changing; it strate-gically allows the religion to maintain its most valuable forms ofexpression.3. The rituals performed by gods are notgenerally identical to those pre-scribed for mortals, and hence cannot be said to be simple anthropo-morphisms; they usually are modified by the sacrifier’s divine status.Divine religious acts are both likeandunlikehuman ones. The aspectthat is unlike human behavior is related to the nature of a god asOther—ontologically “bigger” in scope and potentiality than a humanbeing.4. Nevertheless, ritualizing gods undertake religious behavior in the inter-locking condition of “cultic time”; their religious practices are correla-tive to the ritual actions of mortals.5. Such divine religious actions usually are not understood as havingceased with a primordial ritual event at the beginning of time, butrather as occurring on an ongoing basis, continually in symbiotic ten-sion and relationship with human religious actions and structures. Theimage is one of “mirroring,” but does not include the notion of static orpassive mutual reflection that mirroring implies. It is a dynamic, inter-active process.6. Divine reflexivity is paradoxical in hierarchical religious systems, inso-far as deities generally are imagined as focal cultic entities and the nat-ural recipients—not the instigators—of cultic behavior and gifts. Whenthe phenomenon occurs, it can create theological discomfort within theself-referential thought-world of the religious system, which imaginesultimacy, not contingency, for the divine; ritual is seen at first glance ascontingent, subordinate behavior.7. Such emic conceptual discomfort in the face of paradox is often laterechoed by etic discomfort. This can be found either in the form ofthe problem defined and a proposed solution177"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"condemnation in the religious polemics of other traditions, or in theform of dismissal by modern scholarly treatments of ritualizing godsas anomalous or in certain cases cast as “misunderstood” by the tradi-tion itself.Historical QuestionsWhy do these images appear and then disappear during such a brief period inAttic history? Do the classical Greek images of sacrificing gods serve somekind of didactic function? Are they intended to inspire piety, to urge specific rit-ual actions on the part of mortals, as was clearly the case in the myth ofZurva ̄n’s priestly sacrifice (see chapter 6) or the observant God of the Talmud(see chapter 8)? This is a possibility that cannot be ruled out, especially giventhe short duration of their appearance. Divine libations arrive on the vase-painting scene at a time when a dissolution of aristocratic social and religiousauthority was precipitated by the reforms of the Athenian statesman Kleis-thenes. Returned to Athens in 511/10 B.C.E. by the Spartan Kleomenes at thetime of the expulsion of the Peisistratids, and elected archon in 508/7 B.C.E.,Kleisthenes passed far-reaching democratic reforms such as land redistribu-tion, representative taxation, and tribunal government, and all but legislatedaway the lavish funeral ceremonies at the ancestral tomb so popular among thearistocratic clans of Attica.24The subsequent invasions of Attica by Persia, a“barbaric” foreign power that menaced Greek autonomy, and which in 480B.C.E. devastated the shrines of her holiest high place—the Acropolis—mayalso have contributed to an atmosphere of collective religious anxiety.The most important “fact” about the first half of the fifth century B.C.E., asAthenian society responded to the reforms of Kleisthenes, is that, in words ofMargaret Miller, “the society profoundly moved from aristocratic to democraticdominant ideology.”25This was a radical shift, as Delian League funds were re-moved to Athens, and Perikles’s political success in the 440s extinguishedlong-entrenched internal struggles. It is possible that during this radical ideo-logical shift that overturned archaic organizational units of power, a shift tak-ing place over only a few decades, the highly conservative social institution ofsacrifice was reinforced and upheld by the images of sacrificing gods: Nothingmore strongly reinscribes the significance of a ritual than the representation ofa god’s performance of it.Here then the nature of religious systems as self-referential and self-reinforcing behavioral systems may have played itself out historically, duringan era where patterns of crisis and response are discernible. The reinforcementof ritual in the ubiquitous vase-painting images, dedicated in sanctuaries,buried in graves, and traded in Magna Graecia and Etruria, may have matteredmost at a time when the connection between mythic order and mimetic ritualwas threatened. As Gregory Nagy observes, “[T]he concept of mı ̄m ̄esis, in con-veying a reenactment of the realities of myth, is a concept of authority as long178ancient greek gods in ritual performance"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"as society assents to the genuineness of the values contained by the frameworkof the myth.”26The theme of the sacrificing gods in the art of the late archaic and earlyclassical period in Greece was only quasi-mythic; yet images of divine libationsrepresented an ongoing enactment of the realities of religious ritual itself.Therefore, as the notion of “divine reflexivity” implies, worship performed bythe gods might have been an institution referencing itself. As the archetypaloriginators of ritual, the Olympians reinforce ritual in the vase-paintings bythemselves performing it. Ritual is, above all, conservative. If the archetypeis lost or threatened, then reenactment and imitation will help to recreatethat link.The libating gods in vase-paintings mostly exit the iconographic stage,around 450–440 B.C.E.—a time beginning with the Peace with Persia (449B.C.E.) and concluding with the construction of the Parthenon—in other words,at a time of Athenian political self-confidence and religious stability, even opti-mism. By the end of the shift, “the people of Athens could see themselves asglobally aristocratic vis-à-vis the rest of the Greek world,” building upon the no-tion of a pure and autochthonous blood line, and the city’s role in winning thewars that had threatened all of Greece from the East. Observes Miller, “One maysee the ‘Periklean building programme’ as symptomatic of [collective Athenian]confidence when that thought revolution has been largely effected.”27By thetime of Thucydides’s account of Perikles’s funeral oration in 431/0, Athensthought of itself as “a school for all Hellas.” Perhaps it was no longer necessaryto reinscribe foundational ritual piety so strongly, since the threat to those formsand practices had diminished.The sacrificing god offers a perfectly interlocking metaphysics, in whichthe divine agent of ritual can certainly be construed as a projection of humanbehavior, so mirroring the human. But even admitting this possibility, crudeprojectionism does not satisfactorily exegete the sacrificing god, who assumeswithin the closed semiotic system of the tradition an autonomy that is capableof instigating and affecting human religious behavior. Such an idea about agod is more than a model for religious actions; it is a pure absolute with itsown independent power. In other words, scholars who argue that the gods onthe vases poured offerings in imitation of the ancient Greeks as they them-selves worshiped may be correct. But conversely one might argue that the an-cient Greeks saw themselves as imitating the gods as they, that is, the godsthemselves, worshiped. Which world reflected which? Both views are equallydefensible, and perhaps their apparent mutual exclusivity is due only to ourown inability to think paradoxically—“beyond what is expected.” The libationsand other forms of ritual performed by the gods serve an important function:They insist that we expand our appreciation of the omnipotence, rather thanthe contingency, ascribed to the Greek gods.This paradoxical thinking is just what is required for a scholar of compara-tive religion if he or she is truly to comprehend the heart—the internal logic, the“root metaphor”—of a religious tradition, be it weighted on the side of the culticthe problem defined and a proposed solution179"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"or the theological, praxis or theory. Paradox is the rule, not the exception, in re-ligion. Christ was fully human, and yet also fully divine. Buddhist philosophyeschews the mundane world as unreal, and yet st ̄upas containing the Buddha’srelics abound in Eastern Asia and are centers of great religious power. TheQur›a ̄n in one passage calls for Alla ̄h alone to judge heresy, and yet mortal mul-lahs can call for the death of a heretical author on the strength of another passage.In each of these cases, both categories are to be thought of as paradigmaticallyrepresentative of the tradition; yet they are also apparently mutually exclusive.The forays into other religious traditions in the following chapters are notintended to confuse the questions raised by the Greek case, nor to deny itsuniqueness. However, this survey is intended to investigate how and why othergods in other religions worlds perform ritual actions, in the hope of betterunderstanding divine libations on classical vases. Over and again, whether themodel is a foundational cosmic act that is then reenacted in mortal ritual or anongoing divine ritual activity in which mortals participate, the intimate relation-ship of the divine to the specifics of worship emerges as a ubiquitous phenome-non, built into the very structure of cult and marrying it to enacted theology.The gods do not merely receive veneration or sacrifice; they perform ritualand thus ratify it, conferring upon it ultimacy; the same ritual performance isthereby inaugurated in the mortal realm. The ritual, whether in the form of pi-ous observance or sacrificial gift, is returned to the gods who began the processand from whom religion is born. Religion is thus best understood as purely re-flexive; it is created and self-referentially enacted by the divine for its own sake.Because Alla ̄h prays for Muh.ammad, a believing Muslim is enabled to pray forhim as well, so that the prophet may pray for the believer. Do ut des,by allmeans; the inscription on a bronze geometric figurine of Apollo in Boston ded-icated by Mantiklos can mean little else: “Mantiklos dedicated me to the Far-Darter of the silver bow, as part of his tithe, do thou, Phoibos, grant him gra-cious recompense.”28I give so that You may give in return.The testimony of the traditions explored in the following chapters, how-ever, restores the other half of the reciprocal equation: das ut dem.

Past efforts to interpret the Attic vases may have beencrippled by the frequently narrow methodologies of classical Religions-wissenschaft,since the evidence of ancient Greek religion is only spo-radically considered in the context of the comparative study of worldreligions. Liberating the sacrificing Greek gods from “the Classics” al-lows them to “breathe” and to recombine in a wider sphere of reli-gious history.1Part II considers sacrificing gods in several traditions that appar-ently share linguistic, cultural, political, and cultic genealogies withthe ancient Greek world: Vedic, Zoroastrian, and ancient Norse reli-gions. Rituals performed by deities were known throughout the poly-theistic traditions of Indo-European heritage, which perhaps origi-nated in ancient Central Asia and were believed to have reached theMediterranean during the Bronze Age—around the time known asEarly Helladic III.2Although Vedic Sanskrit and Homeric Greek havelong been recognized as linguistic relatives, the systems of thoughtthey express also share a number of elusively similar religious con-cerns including related names and functions for deities and a strongorientation toward sacrifice, especially libation. Indo-Iranian tradi-tions developed along related if distinct lines, and also featured divinesacrifice.3Parallels do seem to exist between certain features of Vedicand Bra ̄hman.ical sacrificial texts and the Attic vase-painting thatwere being produced within a century of the latter. In ancient"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Indian tradition, the gods’ unceasing sacrifice is the vital artery of the Vedic cir-culatory system; this hieratic performative idea, attested in sacred literature, isparadigmatic rather than problematic.4Vedic literature spans a thousand years from the time of the entry into, mi-gration to, or emergence through cultural transformation in, the Indus valleyby Indo-Aryan peoples—at a time around 1500 B.C.E.—to the completion of theUpanis.ads in the sixth century B.C.E.5The primordial sacrifice of the giant Pu-rus.a by the gods provides raw material for the creation of the cosmos, as R.gveda10.90.16 sings of the gods’ prototypical (and highly ritualized) act, “The godssacrificed to the sacrifice with the sacrifice.” As Bruce Lincoln has shown, thisdivine immolation of the First Person is reiterated in other Indo-European cos-mogonies.6Animal sacrifice is part of the range of Vedic sacrifices, classically occur-ring within and without the sacred circle of the vedi(hourglass-shaped altar,and three offering fires). But liquid offerings, as in the Greek case, not onlypunctuate all forms of sacrifice but are also constitute a crucial form of offeringin and of themselves. Libations mentioned in the texts include milk, clarifiedbutter (ghı ̄), rice and vegetable preparations, and the potent elixir Soma. Inmyth, the latter has its fiery origin in an oblation offered by the gods them-selves.7In the Cha ̄ndogya Upanis.ad,The world is the fire, the sun is the firewoodits rays are the smoke, day is the flame.The moon is the ember, the constellations are the sparks.In this fire the gods offer their oblation,and from this King Soma arises.8According to R.gveda8.14.15, the god Indra is the supreme Somadrinker, in hiseffort to gain strength for battle. His action is imitated in the ritual use of Soma,which, as was true of Greek spondaA, was both poured out and partly con-sumed by the priests as a sacrifice.Within the context of the agnihot.ra, the conspicuous, repetitious oblationsacrifice in which the sacred fire is fed with milk and other liquids at earlymorning and at sunset, the Vedic gods as poet-priests create, offer, receive, andoften are themselves the sacrifice. In fact, the sacerdotal function of the Vedicgods, in a sense, defines them. As Christopher Minkowski observes, “Thedeities addressed in the Vedic yajñas are not, as a class, the same sort of deitiesworshipped in later Hindu bhakti devotionalism...the deities are in a certainsense the performers of the rite as well as its recipients.”9In the very concept ofsacrifice (yajña), sacrificer and recipient of sacrifice are continually conflated,interchanged, and even identified. This is expressed centuries later in the Bha-gavad Gı ̄ta ̄,The (sacrificial) presentation is Brahman; Brahman is the oblation;In the (sacrificial) fire of Brahman it is poured by Brahman;Just to Brahman must he go,Being concentrated upon the (sacrificial) action that is Brahman.10184the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"R.gveda10.90.16 tells us that the dharmas, ritual laws or “foundations”created by the sacrifice of the primal giant Purus.a, reach the Sa ̄dhyas, a previ-ous generation of shadowy divinities who live in the “dome of the sky”;R.gveda1.164.50, an obscure hymn called “the Riddle of the Sacrifice” (AsyaVa ̄masya), reiterates the language of R.gveda10.90.16: “With the sacrifice thegods sacrificed to the sacrifice. These became the first ritual laws. These verypowers reached the dome of the sky where dwell the Sa ̄dhyas, the ancientgods.”11The Sa ̄dhyas were on earth even before the archaic Devas.12They were thefirst to go up into heaven, shutting the door behind them.13They took Sacrificeand Soma with them. Like the ancestors of Zeus in the Greek theogony, theSa ̄dhyas were a deposed generation of divinities; like Hermes and Prometheus,the Sa ̄dhyas were the first sacrificers.14InKa ̄thaka Sam.hita26.7, when therewas nothing to sacrifice but the god of fire, Agni, they sacrificed Agni; and Agniis himself high priest of sacrifice, bearing the smoke of the offering to the ce-lestial realm. R.gveda1.1 says, “I praise Agni, the one who is set before, the godof the sacrifice, the priest, the invoker” (yajñasya devam).The Vedic sacrifice seems to have been understood as a process that sus-tained the continuing existence of the cosmos; hence its proper performance,including pronunciation and metrics, was attended with an increasing anxietythat is reflected in the sacrificial texts themselves. Later crtiques, such asBrahma Pura ̄n.a79.9, go so far as to insist that without sacrifice, neither thisworld nor the other world can have any existence.15Significantly, perhaps, in Vedic religion, as in Greek, the sacrifice onemakes to one’s ancestors, the pin..dapit.r-yajña, is a reverse mirror image of thesacrifice one makes to the gods; the dead, the living, the terrestrial, and celestialare one. The sacrificer, whether divine or mortal, becomes in a sense the objectsacrificed: The offering substitutes for him, after the sacrificial model of primalman-god Praja ̄pati. The “doctrine of sacrifice,” which Renou has written “as-sumes a force of magical origin which compels the gods,” is greater and at thesame time separable from them.16Although the gods receive and in fact require sacrificial offerings as food,when they themselves sacrifice, there is no explicit recipient. The gods’ contin-ual sacrifice is not directed to other gods, but rather, as R.gveda10.90.16 and1.164.50 have it, “to the sacrifice”; it is an energetic cultic act of creation that re-news and sustains the universe. And indeed, ́Satapatha Bra ̄hman.a2.3.1.5 saysthat “the sun would not rise, were he (the sacrificer) not to make that offer-ing.”17But the sacrifice is also quintessentially aboutitself and productive ofit-self as an act of meaning. In these accounts in Vedic literature, the divine is asource of ritual, not a recipient of it. Sacrificial ritual itself is the efficaciouspower. As the performance of sacrificial rituals themselves became increas-ingly axial in Vedic ritual, “only gods directly associated with the ritual retainedpriestly interest.”18The pantheon waned in power as the sacrifice itself and theBrahmans, its human agents, waxed more potent; concurrent with this devel-opment, however, came an expression of instability that may be comparable tothe rise of sacrificing gods as “priests of their own cults” on Greek vases.introduction185"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"In an enigmatic development in the history of Vedic literature that mayparallel our suggestion about Athenian response to radical change in the clas-sical period, the Bra ̄hman.as, the later ritual commentaries on the R.gvedic po-ems, are preoccupied with the theme of the loss of the sacrifice by the gods orthe failure of the sacrifice to work properly. “Sacrifice,” autonomous, willful,evanescent—and speedy—arbitrarily departs the celestial sphere over andagain, “leaving the gods in a big jam,” as Brian K. Smith has put it.19The gods’anxiety over its disappearance, perhaps reflecting historical religious concernswith the compromise of the rite, animates them to search throughout the cos-mos for it. Most conspicuous in later Vedic commentarial literature such as theS ́atapatha Bra ̄hman.a, the Aitareya Bra ̄hman.a, and the Taittirı ̄ya Sam.hita, thistheme is reminiscent of the strange persistence of marine chaos in biblical nar-ratives of times well after the creation account, requiring God to vanquish themonster and restore order on an onoing basis.20Smith observes that in thesepoems, “Simple creation is insufficient and is to be followed up by a organiza-tional effort that rectifies chaos....The sacrifice must be ‘restrained by’ andreturned to those to whom it properly belongs, namely the Brahmans.”21Al-though the gods are both performers and recipients of the sacrifice, in theevent of the its loss or flight, it is the proper metric recitation of the mantrayicsyllables—the knowledge of whose performance is controlled by the Brahman-ical (priestly) caste—that will restore it. “The sacrifice as food departed fromthe gods; the gods said ‘The sacrifice as food hath left us; this sacrifice, food, letus search for. They said ‘How shall we search?’ ‘By the Brahman and the me-tres, they said.’ They consecrated the brahman with the metres; for him theyperformed the sacrifice up to the end; they also performed the joint offerings tothe wives [of the gods]. Therefore now in the consecration offering they per-form the sacrifice right up to the end.”22The rectification is almost invariably aneffort to recover the proper recitation of the sacrificial mantras, whose abroga-tion is assumed to have caused the flight of Sacrifice.Why this theme surfaces at the time of the Brahmanical commentaries isunclear. Not only are the gods the ubiquitous agents and arbiters of sacrifice,but they are represented as agitated, bereft, and in a state of ritual anxiety. Therecurrent theme of the gods’ effort to recover and reestablish the lost sacrificethrough the conservative reinscription of ancient mantrayic recitation, insepa-rable in the Vedic religious imagination from the sacrifice itself (as ritual andas divine entity) and in fact encoding its efficacy, may have arisen during a his-torical period (the sixth century B.C.E.) when the appearance of Buddhism andJainism, both philosophically oriented away from the practice of exterior sacri-fice and instead to its interiorization, were experienced as threats to ritualtransmission, memory, the preservation and superiority of the priestly caste,and to the “perfect” continuation of sacrificial forms.23Here there may be a par-allel to the proliferation of the representation of divinely performed sacrifice inancient Greek vase-painting of the fifth century as a response to the disman-tling of archaic political, social, and religious structures by democratic reforms.The divine scene in the Berlin Painter vase in Rome takes place in a con-tained, timeless world that does not include mortals; yet half of the other vases186the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"that show divine libations also show mortals libating on the reverse. The godsperform an act more than simply “typical” of humans; it is quintessentially hu-man in that it represents obeisance to and reverence for omnipotent beingswhose powers transcend the human condition. Despite the primordial theo-machy that tells how the Olympians overthrew the Titans, the ancient Greek ev-idence does not seem to point to an aboriginal, foundational act of sacrifice bythe gods, as in the Vedic myth of the primal sacrifice of Purus.a. Rather, as inthe other Vedic myths of the continuinginvolvement of Praja ̄pati, Varun.a, Mitra,Agni, Vi.sn.u, and Indra in the yajñain all its forms, the Greek iconographypresents the viewer with an aetiology of ritual that is intended to inspire and in-teract with “present” cult and perhaps, like the case of the Bra ̄hman.as, to reflectimmediate cultic concerns. The repeated acts of the gods generate the repeti-tion of libation as a generic act. The gods “ceaselessly” pour, apart from and yetin concert with their human worshipers; all are caught up together in the largersphere of the ritual action, libation.In both Vedic and Greek cases, the sacrificing gods are more than “rolemodels”: in effect they create and maintain their own religion. In the late nine-teenth and early twentieth centuries, rationalist theories of the origin andmechanism of religion have explicitly assumed and influentially argued thanhumanity “creates” not only the gods but also the religion that links the two.This idea has skewed assumptions about how ancient sacrificial traditionsthemselves saw the origin of ritual practice, creating anthropomorphic godswho are given human ritual behaviors. The Indo-European testimony seems tosuggest a divine genesis for ritual action; in the Vedic case, the gods “create”sacrifice in a cosmos that is then maintained by their ongoing sacrificial activ-ity, facilitated and even eventually eclipsed by their human counterparts. Anxi-ety over an unspecified threat to the hypostasized Sacrifice then creates an at-mosphere wherein the gods lose track of it continually and can only restore itby reinscribing Brahmanical power: the power to recite. In the Greek case, ar-chaic ritual may, similarly, have been experienced as threatened by aristocraticAthenians, and hence was reinstantiated through the artistic theme of the godsas priests of their own cult.We will go on to consider in detail two Indo-European cases of divine re-flexivity in polytheistic theologies: In heterodox Zoroastrian cosmogony, thegod of time, Zurva ̄n, sacrifices for a thousand years in order to conceive histwin children, Ohrmazd and Ahriman. And an Old Norse skaldic poem offersthe startling image of the highest god of the Norse pantheon, Odin, self-immolated upon the World Tree. That the religious morphologies in thesecases are comparable is surely a function of their shared genealogy. But at thesame time, it must be more: the god who is the central actor in his own cult isalso an apparently irrepressible phenomenon, the ultimate example of whatHenri Atlan calls a “self-organizing system.”introduction187"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"6Zoroastrian HeresyZurva ̄n’s Thousand-Year SacrificeFor him [the Christian apologist Eznik] the perfection of God is ax-iomatic; therefore if the Zervanites admit that Zurvan is imperfect, itfollows that there must be a perfect being higher than he. Moreover,does not Zurvan’s performance of sacrifice argue the existence ofsuch a higher being to whom the sacrifice is directed? To whom didhe offer sacrifice?1—R. C.

Now known primarily as anobscure Zoroastrian heresy, the religion of the god Zurva ̄n (Zurva ̄n iakana ̄rak, “Limitless Time”) was a persistent element in the religioushistory of ancient Iran.3It may even have been a feature of Iranian reli-gion during the Sasanian period (early third-early seventh centuriesC.E.)—before the forces of Islam met and decimated those of YezdigirdIII at al-Qa ̄disı ̄yah in 635.4What brought about the sacrifice by Zurva ̄n?

These were implacable enemies, familiar fromorthodox Zoroastrianism as Spenta Manyu, Bounteous Spirit, and Angra Manyu,Destructive Spirit.5In their pitched battle the universe still writhes—goodagainst evil, light against darkness, the truth against the lie. This egalitarian-seeming “twinship” of the two spirits was both the result and the cause of an in-exorable dualism.“They say—that whereas absolutely nothing yet existed—,” writes the Ar-menian Christian apologist, Eznik of Kolb, at the time of the late Sasanian pe-riod, “neither skies, nor earth, nor any other creatures which are in the skies oron the earth—there existed one named Zurva ̄n....For a thousand years hehad offered sacrifice in order to have a son who had the name Ohrmazd, andwho would create the skies and the earth and all they contained.”6Then came adivine moment of doubt, disastrous for the cosmos. “And after offering sacri-fice for a thousand years he began to ponder, saying, ‘Are these sacrifices whichI offer of any use, and shall I have a son Ohrmazd, or do I strive in vain?’ Andwhile he considered thus, Ohrmazd and Ahriman were conceived in theirmother’s womb.”7Three other contemporaneous writers offer parallel texts de-scribing the Zurvanite cosmogony: the Armenian Eli ̆s ̄ e Vardapet, and the Syri-ans Theodore bar Kônai and Yohannân bar Penkayê.8With some slight varia-tions, their stories are essentially in agreement. From Zurva ̄n’s “doubt”—adefect in an otherwise perfect and omnipotent godhead—Ahriman, the Ag-gressor, “full of the lie” (drugvant) is conceived.9From the untainted divine na-ture, Ohrmazd, “sweet-smelling and radiant,” and eventual author of the uni-verse, is later born. However, it is crucial that both sons be incarnated aspectsof the deity himself.When the great god perceived that there were two sons in the womb, Zurva ̄nswore that whichever son was born first would receive his kingdom.10The fetalOhrmazd guilelessly revealed this to Ahriman, who was blocked at the birthcanal by his twin. The evil one ripped open his mother’s womb at the navel, pre-senting himself to his father as firstborn. According to the account of Eli ̆s ̄e, thehopeful parent was horrifed by this vision.11“Zurva ̄n said to him, ‘Who are you?’He said, ‘(I am) your son, Ohrmazd.’ Zurva ̄n said to him, ‘My son is luminousand sweet-smelling, but you, you are dark and love to do evil.’ And after havingwept bitterly, he gave him sovereignty for (nine?) million years.”12When the long-awaited Ohrmazd, the son “for whom he had offered sacri-fice”13was finally born, the rejoicing Zurva ̄n handed over the barsom (bursem ̄e)or a bundle of sacred twigs to him. He bid his heir offer sacrifice for him, justas he had previously sacrificed for Ohrmazd. “And having taken the twigswhich he held in his hand, with which he offered sacrifice, he gave them toOhrmazd, and said, ‘Up until now it is I who for you offered sacrifice; hence-forth it is you who will offer sacrifice for me.’ ”14Yohannân bar Penkayê adds areport of Zurva ̄n’s resolve. “I will give him these sticks [rings]—they are calledb ̄ursem ̄e[bursum ̄e]—and I will give him power to create heaven and earth.”15Ohrmazd, holder of the sacrificial emblem, who was conceived in order to “cre-ate heaven and earth and all that they contain” proceeds to do just that.Ohrmazd’s name is a form of the name of the supreme Zoroastrian deity Ahura190the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Mazda ̄, who sacrifices in the Avesta, and who will again offer up a great sacri-fice at the end of time.Zurva ̄n did not simply engender two sons, Ohrmazd and Ahriman; he sac-rificed to do it. As we will see, his sacrifice employed the hymns and cult in-struments of the ancient Mazdean liturgy. Zurva ̄n did not just give his celestialkingdom to Ohrmazd; he gave him the most important cultic implement ofpriesthood, the barsom, and demanded that the son take over his sacrificial du-ties. We are dealing, then, with a familiar problem: the collision of cult and the-ology. The implications of this collision greatly troubled the Christian Eznik;did they trouble the Zurvanites? Why, how, and to whom does Zurva ̄n sacrifice?In this ancient and complex case of divine reflexivity, I suggest that boththe sacrifice of Zurva ̄n and his conferral of the hierophantic mantle to his ce-lestial son were in fact related to the actual authority of the historical zoroas-trian clergy, and aimed to ensure and reinforce its conservation. This heredi-tary priesthood was in a sense, the unchanging core of Persian religiouspower. Its multivalent Indo-Iranian religion long preceded Zoroaster’s allegedreforms. Rather than being expunged, its pantheon and practiced rites seemto have been recast by the prophet in the forge of ethical monotheism, observ-able in the sacred oral tradition of the Avesta. Zurvanism tried to “rescue”Zoroastrianism from dualism, but it, too, not only preserved but actually val-orized and promoted the priestly cult. This is the “intensification as historicalresponse” described as the second feature of divine reflexivity in chapter 5; thegod as high priest, as I noted there, “strategically allows the religion to main-tain its most valuable forms of expression.”Historical evidence may suggest the origins of Zurvanism in the Hellenis-tic Arsacid periods, when native Iranian religion was all but submerged inAlexander’s Hellenizing wake—only to resurge strongly in the centuries thatfollowed. In fact, Alexander is specifically blamed for the religious chaos andthe dispersal of Avestan teachings in the D ̄enkart(Acts of the Religion), a diffi-cult document in Pahlavi written in the ninth century C.E. but whose primarymaterial dates from the late Sasanian period.16It has also been suggested by anumber of scholars that the Zurvanite religion reached its apex of influenceduring the monarchical rule of the Sasanian dynasty. This correspondedchronologically to an unprecedented expansion of sacerdotal influence in thecourts approaching theocracy. Was the centrality and even autonomy of Maz-daism’s oldest rite in the Zurvanite creation myth an accident—or rather, was ita deliberately ritualizing conception of the highest deity during an especiallymercurial period in the history of the religion?Because the cosmogony we have just briefly considered explicitly makeshim the sovereign and preexistent power in the universe, Zurva ̄n’s action ofsacrificing for a thousand years in order to conceive a son legitimates andcentralizes the ritual. As in the story of the Indian Praja ̄pati, creation must beinaugurated by means of a sacrifice. And as we have seen throughout theVedas, the god’s sacrifice itself has a theurgic power. But unlike in the ancientIndian hymns, sacrifice is the prerogative of a single divine power who willcreate two more.zoroastrian heresy191"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"By giving the twigs to Ohrmazd, Zurva ̄n also hands over his religious au-thority as high priest.

In fact, as the present highpriest of the Parsi fire temple in Bombay explains, it is to Ohrmazd that the priestof the Zoroastrian fire ceremony (yasna) is homologized. I propose that the highprofile of ritual sacrifice in the Zurvanite cosmogony was introduced for reasonsthat were external to the myth. However, these motives bore a strong correlationto developments in Zoroastrianism and its priesthood during a decline in theArsacid period and aggressive renaissance during the Sasanian period in Iran.“As the Holy One I Recognized Thee”: The Fire of ZoroasterAs is so often the case in the history of religions, the orthodoxy that ultimatelybranded Zurvanism heretical was itself born in heterodoxy. What changed verylittle through the transformations of the Persian religious landscape was ortho-praxy: the sacrifice itself. In fact, the persistent conservatism of ritual speaks toa hierarchy of power that transcends doctrine, even during the times of themost intense persecution of “foreign” and heretical elements. More powerfulthan kings were the members of the ancient hereditary caste of priests, and be-cause their power derived from their ability to perform the sacrifice, in a veryreal sense the sacrifice was more powerful than they were—as in the later Vedicritual commentaries.The date (sometime during the second millennium B.C.E.?), manner (inva-sion or gradual migrations?), and directionality (from Central Asia or the Cau-casus?) of Indo-European entry into ancient Iran remains highly difficult to de-termine; the Medes ultimately inhabited the northwest and the Persians thesouthwest of the country. Ancient Indo-Iranian religion has been recon-structed from the Indian Vedas and the Avesta,the ancient Iranian scripture—the latter, thanks to the faithful observance of the Bombay Parsis, the efforts ofAntequil-Duperron, and nineteenth-century philology. The earliest stratum ofthe Avesta reveals innumerable religious correspondences with India; for themost archaic period, the linguistic connection with Vedic India probably alsorepresents religious realities, as discussed by Calvert Watkins.17Some more im-portant examples are terms for the class of supernatural beings called (Indic)deva/Avestanda ̄evaand for those called asura/ahura, for the god Mi.tra/Mithra,for the sacred liquor (soma/haoma) and the words “priest” (hot.r/zaotar) and,most essentially, “sacrifice” (yajña/yasna).On both sides of the range of the Hindu Kush, the pantheon divided itselfbetween the asuras and the devas. There was also an important choice to be madebetween good (.rta/a ̆sa) and evil, “the lie” (druh/druj). There was a shared beliefin the existence of a realm of celestial life after death for those who chose thegood, and in a kind of apocalyptic revelation or return of a golden age at the endof time. On the level of cult, animal and somasacrifices were offered; religioncentered in the household, with liturgical specialists paid to assist. Gradually,their power grew until it eclipsed but did not eradicate the domestic cult.18192the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"According to the traditions of his life told in the 9th-century Zoroastriantexts, Zoroaster was collecting pure water for a h ̄om(Av. hao ̄ma) ritual when hewas brought into the radiant presence of Ohrmazd, in western reconstruction,Ahura Mazd ̄a. Zoroaster tried to forge out of this polytheistic matrix a kind ofethical monotheism.19Yasna43:5 describes that moment. “As the holy one Irecognized thee, O Wise Lord, / When I saw thee at the beginning, at the birthof existence, / appoint a recompense for deed and world; Evil reward to the evil,good to the good, / Through thy wisdom, at the last turning-point of cre-ation.”20Those scholars who subscribe to the historicity of Zoroaster think thathe may have lived in Chorasmia, or in Sogdiana, in the upper basin of theAmu Darya. Sasanian orthodox tradition puts his birth at 628 B.C.E. and hisdeath at 551B.C.E., and the name of his royal protector, Vi ̆st ̄ asp, from AvestanVi ̆ st ̄ aspa, is the same as that of Darius’s father. But philological research hasshown the language of theGa ̄ua ̄s,the five ancient Avestan hymns attributed toZoroaster—because of their different meter, dialect, and literary genre—to be-long to a much earlier linguistic stratum than the rest of the Avesta, whichdates from around 1000 B.C.E. In fact, the language of the Ga ̄ua ̄s resemblesquite closely that of the.Rg Veda. Thus the life of the prophet has been set backby some scholars to the dawn of Aryan Iran, between the eighteenth and fif-teenth centuries B.C.E.21P. Oktor Skjærvø suggests that lost origin of the myth of Zurva ̄n’s millen-nium sacrifice may lie in an exegesis of Ga ̄uic passage Y. 44.3: “Who is theprimeval father of a ̆s.a[cosmic/ritual Order] by virtue of its conception (z ́aua ̄)?”22The Ga ̄ua ̄s (songs) remain obscure to us because they are embedded in a losttradition, one that probably included initiatory training and the oral transmis-sion of sacred knowledge.23Within the Avesta,they are contained in a longertext called Yasna, one of the main divisions of the scripture which was, and con-tinues to be (as its name implies), recited by the priests during the ceremony ofpreparing the sacrificial haoma.24Of the other texts surviving in the Avesta,25we shall have reason later to referto the Ya ̆sts (hymns). These are liturgical poems, grouped according to the timefor specific prayers, which are each addressed to one of the twenty-one Zoroas-trian deities such as Mithra, the goddess Ana ̄hı ̄t ̄a, or Verethraghna, the god ofvictory. Transcribed and fixed in its definitive form in the major rehabilitative ef-forts of the Sasanian period, only one-fourth of the Avestais thought to remain;the rest of its twenty-one books were lost under Arab rule, and are available to usonly in the summary of the Middle Persian D ̄enkart,a ninth-century com-pendium of Zoroastrian doctrine.Zoroaster the zaotaris historically cast as a radical theologian who was putto death in his old age; class struggle can clearly be detected in his recasting ofthe Vedic pantheon. He is thought to have attacked the rites of blood sacrificeand the haomasacrifice;26these religious features were strongly identified withthe gods of the warrior class, the da ̄evas, whom he demonized.

Zoroaster con-centrated on his Wise Lord, on whom he conferred a divine entourage againstevil; yet it is hard to tell whether he intended exclusive monotheism for AhuraMazda ̄. Yet at the same time, Zoroaster acknowledged and hypostasized evil.27The struggle between truth and falsehood, with its Indo-Iranian ancestry, waselevated to a universal struggle to the death. The two spirits, Bounteous Oneand Destructive One, were polarized at the beginning of time between these.But they are not just two spirits; they are twins. In what is believed to be thevery oldest of the Avestan texts lay the seeds of a disastrous theology: “In thebeginning the two Spirits (Manyu) who are the well-endowed (?) twins wereknown as the one good, the other evil, in thought, word, and deed. Betweenthem the wise choose the good, not so the fools. And when these Spirits met,they established in the beginning life and the absence of life that in the end theevil should meet with the worst existence, but the just with the Best Mind.”28The ahuras chose, with most becoming a ̆savans, partisans of a ̆sa, while theapostates became drugvants, partisans of the druj. After them it was the daevas’turn; all chose wrongly. Ever since then, the da ̄evas have tried to influence hu-man choice as well. Armies headed by the spirits oppose each other in a fright-ening symmetry of exact counterparts, Good Mind opposing Bad Mind, and soon. In the struggle between them the whole universe, celestial and terrestrial,is enlisted.According to indigenous legend, Zoroaster was born in Azerbaijan andfled to Bactria. In the western reconstruction, persecuted, he had to flee south,probably to eastern Iran, where he converted King Vi ̆st ̄ asp, who gave him asy-lum. Conversion to the new religion in Iran was a slow process. That of theclergy was a major triumph, but it took place long after Zoroaster’s death.29These were members of the ancient polytheistic priestly caste, the Magi, whoare said by Herodotus to have been a Median tribe with skills both liturgicaland oneiromantic.30Darius I (522–486 B.C.E.) and the other Achaemenids incised the name ofAhuramazda ̄ in their inscriptions, but neither he nor his successors mentioned194the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Zoroaster. Nor did they mention the Ame ̆sa Spentas,The Bounteous Immor-tals, his divinized attributes.

Artaxerxes II (405–359B.C.E.) boasted of being the protégé of Ahura Mazda ̄, Mithra, and Ana ̄hita ̄. Thebas-reliefs from Persepolis offer us some idea of the Mazdean cultus; they por-tray ritual gestures, costumes, altars, and the mortar used to pound the haoma.32The god Ahura Mazda ̄ appears iconographically within a winged disk, some-times said to symbolize the sun. The body of a small bearded man often growsout of the disk, which can accompany winged lions or bull-men.Herodotus gives us our first foreign description of Persian religious cus-toms. He notices that they have no statues of gods, sacrifice in the open air, killanimals whose flesh they consume, and do not bury or cremate their corpsesbut expose them on hills where they were devoured by vultures.33He calls theirchief god “the Sky.” Zoroastrian doctrine must have reached western Iran be-fore the time of Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.), who alludes to its dualism in his OnPhilosophy, noting that the Magi preached the existence of two principles, Oro-masdes and Areimanios.34By the time of Plato and Aristotle, Zoroaster was already cast as an arch-mage.35The Greeks attributed the “wisdom of the Magi” to Zoroaster, whomthey considered to be a demigod—“the son of Ahura Mazda ̄.” He was thoughtto have instructed Pythagoras in Babylon and inspired the Chaldean doctrinesof magic and astrology.36In fact, the MagoiorMagoysaPoiknown in classicalGreece were no longer natives of Iran, nor were they orthodox Mazdeans.They probably migrated west at the time of Xerxes—perhaps, as some havespeculated, in response to his purge of da ̄evaworship. They probably came toAsia Minor by way of Mesopotamia; their spoken language seems to havebeen Aramaic. Zaehner suggests that in Babylon, exiled heretical Zoroastriandaeva-worship encountered the idea of Time, represented by the boundlessfirmament, whom its adherents adopted as its supreme deity.37By the classi-cal period, there were temples of Ana ̄hita ̄ at Hypaepa in Lydia and Hierocae-sarea.38A bas-relief from Daskylaion in Istanbul portrays two Magi performinga sacrifice.39Cumont maintained that “it was the Zervanite system that the Mazdeansof Asia Minor taught the occidental followers of the Iranian religion.”40How-ever, their teachings also included de ̄va ̄snı ̄h,referred to by Clement of Alexan-dria: “The Magi worship angels and demons.”41It is a tantalizing fact that theMithraic mysteries, that strange hybrid cult adopted by the Roman military,placed Kronos-Zurva ̄n at the head of their pantheon—and that it allowed for of-ferings to Ahriman. Nowhere is the co-equal potency of the good and evil prin-ciples so thoroughly realized as in Zurvanism.It is widely speculated that Zoroastrianism, refracting Iranian beliefsabout angels, apocalypse, resurrection, the eternality of the soul, and the returnof a golden age, influenced Judaism and perhaps both orthodox and Gnosticzoroastrian heresy195"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Christianity.42Following Jewish precedent, Christian writers identified Zoroasterwith Ezekiel, Nimrod, Seth, Balaam, Baruch, and even Christ. However, theGreeks, including Plato and Aristotle, also saw in Zoroastrianism a dualisticview of world and destiny.43But Zoroastrian dualism pits life against nonlife, rather than matteragainst spirit. Despite the later Gnostic and Manichaean legacy, both matterand spirit are enlisted in the fight against disorder and death, a fight whose tri-umphal outcome is already guaranteed. God’s omnipotence is conceived asonly temporarily limited. Human beings must enlist in the struggle, and keepthemselves pure, avoiding defilement and contact with dead matter, so thatthey can regain their heavenly homeland, dwelling in perpetual light. “ThusZoroastrian ethics, although in itself lofty and rational, has a ritual aspect thatis all-pervading.”44Just how all-pervading is visible in the myth of Zurva ̄n’s sac-rifice.Whatever its fluctuating degree of popularity during Sasanian times,Zurvanite cosmogony eventually disappeared (or perhaps was expunged)from the Mazdean religion. Preserved in the Greater Bundahi ̆sn,“Primal Cre-ation,” a cosmology written in Pahlavı ̄ from the same period, but “clearly con-taining material from the Older Avesta,”45and in the Selections of Za ̄dsparam,46we have the orthodox Zand version of the beginning of all things.47TheBundahi ̆snteaches that Ohrmazd once existed in infinite time, in infinite light.48Ahriman dwelled below him in infinite darkness. Between them was theVoid. Seeing a ray of light, Ahriman hustled up to the light-world, bent onits annihilation. The divine worlds were no longer separated and inviolate.This created that despicable “mixed state” of creation, of evil blended in withgood, which was the nemesis of Zoroastrian dualism. Omniscient Ohrmazd,foreseeing the battle that the two principles would fight while Ahriman was “ig-norant and unobservant,” tricks Ahriman into agreeing to fix a time for battle,knowing that “in this wise the Destructive Spirit would be made powerless.”Ohrmazd “knew that if he did not fix a time for battle against him,” then Ahri-man “would do unto his creation even as he had threatened; and the struggleand the mixture would be everlasting; and Ahriman could settle in the mixedstate of creation and take it to himself.”49The millennia are divided into a measured structure comprising twelvethousand years. For the first 3,000 years, Ohrmazd’s utterance of words ofpower, specifically, the Ahunawarprayer, which predicts the gloomy fate ofAhriman, cause the diabolical one to swoon back into the darkness. When Ah-riman is awakened, Ohrmazd first sacrificially creates the world of thought andsixAmahrspandsthe Avestan Ame ̆sa spentas, “Bounteous immortals.” Ohrmazdthen creates the material world, over aspects of which each of the Amahrspandspreside: Good mind over cattle; Best Righteousness over fire; Desirable Do-minion over metals; Holy Devotion over Earth; Perfection over water; Immor-tality over vegetation.50Primal Man, Gayo ̄mart, was a bright, spherical being,like the creator, and he is presided over by Ohrmazd himself.

The wicked will be horribly burned, but the hotmetal will be as warm milk to the righteous. Everyone will drink white haoma,the liquid of Immortality, prepared from the sacrifice of the cosmic Bull. TheEarth will be “made excellent” and elevated to the stars, where it will be metby paradise, the House of Song. Ahriman will be immobilized or destroyedforever.51Thus in the Bundahi ̆snone important difference from the Zurvanite cre-ation myth emerges. Both Ohrmazd and Ahriman preexist. Zurvanism was aneffort to solve this theological problem of origins. Although systematized, con-demned, transcended, and reformulated by later Iranian theologians, the prob-lem had its origins in the teachings of Zoroaster himself, in the doctrine of thetwin spirits. Where did they come from?52History and HeresyAfter the end of Zoroaster’s career, traditionally, in martyrdom, the old religionseems to have reasserted itself. The abstract divine entities were reduced tomere deities, with male and female characteristics; deities were never againdesignated by words for human faculties: “triumphant Zoroastrianism ‘recov-ered’ the essential part of the archaic religion, at the price of changing its per-spective.”53To do so, it had to give up its monotheism and succumb to dual-ism; it had to give up its purely ethical trajectory and center itself in archaicritual as well as reintroduce its multiple gods and divine figures as servants ofAhura Mazd ̄a. In the later Avesta,all the gods unmentioned by Zoroaster in “his”five poems had reemerged: Mithra, Ana ̄hita ̄, Apa ̄m Napa ̄t, and Vayu, and manymore.The Arsacid (Parthian) period, which began with the occupation of the Se-leucid satrapy of Parthia by the seminomadic Parni in 247 B.C.E. and endedwith the replacement of the Arsacid line by a collateral branch from Atropatenezoroastrian heresy197"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"in 10 C.E.,54saw the submersion of Iranian religion by the Hellenism broughtabout by Alexander’s conquest of Persia. Despite some coins depicting the per-sistance of five temples at staxr for example, most numismatic evidence seemsto indicate that the thoroughly Hellenized Parthian princes had lost interest inindigenous religion; no coins from Susa, the administrative capital, portrayIranian deities. In the first century B.C.E., Iranian religion reemerged at Com-magene in billboard, syncretistic style: The ruler Antiochus I erected a tumu-lus populated by colossal seated stone figures with Greek-Iranian names: Zeus-Oromazdes, Apollo-Mithra, and so forth.55Finally, the name Zarathustraappeared in the third century C.E., and through a roller-coaster ride of ortho-doxy and heresy, “the Good Religion” became the official religion of the Iranianempire.When the older gods resurfaced in new forms, another change also oc-cured, one of perhaps even greater import. The original good twin, SpentaManyu, lost his autonomous existence; he was absorbed into Ahura Mazda ̄ andidentified with him in the struggle against the Adversary. Zurvanism was pro-voked, in a sense, by this collapse. Whereas in an ancient ya ̆stthe two spiritsfight each other, in the later Avestan Vide ̄vda ̄t,Ahura Mazda ̄ is countered by An-gra Manyu as they respectively create good and bad things. Ahura Mazda ̄,Ohrmazd, was no longer uniquely transcendent or one and only, as Zoroasterhad envisioned him. He now faced the antigod as an equal. This failure to “inte-grate the Ahura par excellence (the sole Ahura: Mazda ̄) in opposition to theDaevas, on pain of falling back into the ‘sin’ of dualism’ ” had profound conse-quences.56As we might assume from the inherent theological conundrums inYasna30 and the Bundahi ̆sn,the collapse demanded a response. “Since AhuraMazda could no longer be the father of the two adversaries, the question of theirorigin was inevitable.”57Zurvanism tried to solve these problems of theodicy by positing oneprimeval divine parent of the twins. As Zaehner observes, “the history of reli-gion proves that the nature of man seems to demand a unified godhead. Thisreaction duly appeared: it is what we call Zervanism.”58It is Zurva ̄n (InfiniteTime, also called “Fate”) who is the father of Ohrmazd and Ahriman. A contro-versial disc-shaped fragmentary bronze pinhead from Louristan, at one time inthe Harramaneek Collection in New York, shows the great, wide-eyed Zurva ̄nand the two spirits who are his children emerging from the side of his head(see catalogue, no. O–1).59It is generally held that Iranian Zurvanism took shape in Alexander’swake. One proof of this is the Mazdean “divine quaternity,” which seems to bean adaptation of the Zurvanite one.60The latter is attested in several texts citing,besides Zurva ̄n, three other names given as those of separate gods—but whichmust be hypostases of the first one, also called “the god with four faces” inManichaeism. In the Zurvanite quaternity, Zurva ̄n is associated with Light,Power, and Wisdom. In the Bundahi ̆sn,Ohrmazd is associated with light (histhrone), his goodness, and his (infinite) time. It would seem that orthodoxMazdaism replaced Zurva ̄n and his names with Ohrmazd, whom they put atthe beginning of the series.61Evidence of this Mazdean quaternity appears as198the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"early as the first century B.C.E., but may have originated in the first centuries ofthe Arsacid period in connection with the spread of astrology.”62Zurvanism is most strongly associated with the Sasanian period. Howprevalent was it? Was it the form of the aggressive state religion that persecutedso many religions, including the Babylonian talmudic academies?63Assem-bling the relevant sources for the first time in his problematic Zurvan: AZoroastrian Dilemma, R. C. Zaehner maintains that the answer is probablyquite complicated, and that Zurvanism was alternately in favor and con-demned.When Arda ̆sı ̄r I overturned the Parthian rulers, under whom Persian reli-gion had sunk into a swamp of obsolesence, a new hyperbole set in at everylevel of the autocracy. The Persian monarchy was centralized under the “Kingof Kings.” The term maguswas still in use in the Arsacid period; the Sasanianscreated the role of the magupat(chief of magi) and later, its superlative magu-pata ̄n magupat.For the first time in Iranian history, the Mazdean cult was ele-vated to official status. And for the first time in its long history, Zoroastrian-ism developed as an organized religion with a veritable pontiff, and ahierarchical ecclesiastical structure that may have been a defensive responseto Christian and later, to Manichaean structures—both of which it fought withvigor.Book IV of the D ̄enkart tells us how the Zoroastrians went about resusci-tating their faith, and bespeaks the unprecedented power of the priesthood. Wehear a tale of the ingathering of the Avesta, in either written or oral form, to theking’s court: “His Majesty, the King of Kings, Artsax ̆ saur (Arda ̆sı ̄r I), son ofPa ̄pak, following Tansar as his religious authority, commanded all those scat-tered teachings to be brought to the court.64The mysterious Tansar, an ehrpat,or theologian, about whom we know very little that is not legendary, undertookto establish a fixed canon. The De ̄nkartreports that “Tansar set about about hisbusiness and selected one and left the rest out of the canon.”65S ̆a ̄pu ̄ r I, the captor of Valerian, was crowned in 242 C.E. According to atradition in the Fihrist,66Mani was present; the Kephalaiasays that Mani wasgranted an interview with the king and that his followers were given com-plete freedom to preach their doctrine.67It appears that the Manichaeans en-joyed high favor during ̆Sa ̄pu ̄ r’s reign. Telling is the fact that Manichaeanshad taken for the name of their supreme deity, also called the “Father ofGreatness” or “Father of Light,” not that of Ohrmazd—who has a far less am-biguous connection with light—but Zurva ̄n. Adopted during the reign ofS ̆a ̄pu ̄ r, it strongly suggests the ascendency of Zurvanism during this period.68In the northeastern section of Iran, large Buddhist colonies had begun totranslate Buddhist scriptures into Sogdian. To translate the supreme god-head, “Brahma ̄,” they used Azrua(the Sogdian form of Zurva ̄n); the nameO ̄hrmazd was Xurmazd. “The conclusion, therefore, is ineluctable: at thetime of Ma ̄nı ̄, who began his mission in A.D. 242 in the reign of S ̆a ̄pu ̄r I,Ohrmazd was not regarded as the supreme god. There was one higher thanhe, and that was Zurva ̄n. Zervanism was the current form of Zoroastrianismat the time.”69zoroastrian heresy199"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"According to the De ̄nkart, S ̆aa ̄pu ̄ r “further collected those writings from the Re-ligion which were dispersed throughout India, the Byzantine empire, and otherlands.”70S ̆aa ̄pu ̄ r was interested in writing “which treated of medicine, astronomy,movement, time, space, substance, creation, becoming, passing away, change inquality, growth (?) and other processes and organs.”71These were added to theAvestaand deposited in the Royal Treasury. S ̆aa ̄pu ̄ r seems to have incorporated a va-riety of Greek and Indian texts into the Avesta,“and he examined (the possibility)of bringing all systems (?) into line with Mazdayasnian Religion.”72Of special in-terest to us are those texts sought by the king that treated space and time. Thesewere the centerpieces of Zurvanite theology, and it is entirely likely that if he re-sorted to Western texts in this collection process, S ̆aa ̄pu ̄ r drew from Zurvanitematerial under the name of Zoroaster in the Greek-speaking world. “S ̆aa ̄pu ̄rstrengthened and supported that belief (Manichaeism) by the introduction of for-eign matter akin to the already current Zurvanite ideas.”73The Pahlavi sources are silent regarding the years between S ̆aa ̄pu ̄ r I and S ̆aa ̄pu ̄rII: an odd silence, because these years span the career of one of the longest-livedzealots in religious history, the high priest Kartı ̄r. Zaehner claims that during thisperiod, Zurvanism was out of favor and was, in fact, vigorously persecuted. Thecareer of Kartı ̄r extended over the reign of six kings, from S ̆aa ̄pu ̄ r I to Ohrmazdthrough the three Vahra ̄ms (242–293 C.E.). He was still there under Narseh I, ac-cording to the Paikuli inscription. Just a simple ehrpatunder S ̆aa ̄pu ̄ r I, Kartı ̄r wasmade by Ohrmazd “magupatof Ohrmazd” (Chief of the Magians of AhuraMazda ̄).Under Vahra ̄m I (273–276 C.E.), there was a severe reaction to the religioustolerance of S ̆a ̄pu ̄ r, instigated by Kartı ̄r. According to Hamza,74Mani, who hadbeen tolerated under the previous two monarchs, was captured on the chargeof anti-Zoroastrian heresy, cross-examined by a council of learned doctors, andput in prison, where he died. Under Vahra ̄m II, Kartı ̄r was named “Savior ofthe Soul of Vahra ̄m,” “grandee of the realm” and “judge of the empire.” He wasalso elevated to “master of rites” and “ruler of the fire of Anahit-Ardashı ̄r atStaxr and of Anahit the Dame.”75Kartı ̄r proclaimed in an inscription discov-ered at KaÛbeh i Zartru ̄ ̆st, dated from the reign of Vahra ̄m II (in the early 370s),that under his authority, “the affairs of Ohrmazd and the gods prospered, andthe Mazdayasnian religion and the Magian hierarchy received great honour.”He also boasts of propitiating “the gods, water, fire, and cattle” and of expelling“the teaching of Ahriman and the demons” from the empire. He says that hechastized “Jews, Buddhists, Brahmans, Nasoreans (Judaeo-Christians?), Chris-tians, Maktaks (Mandeans or Manicheans?) and Zandı ̄ks (Mazdean heretics).”He then goes on, “Heretics and (apostates?) who were within the Magian com-munity were spared for the Masdayasnian religion and Magian community butnot for propaganda: I chastised and upbraided them and improved them.” Hesays that that he converted “demon-worshippers to worship of the gods.”It is clear that, goaded by Kartı ̄r’s religious imperialism and zeal, the Ma-gians became all-powerful. “Kartı ̄r, in fact, is interested in reviving the charac-teristic aspects of Zoroastrian religious practice which were almost certainly200the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"common to Mazdeans and Zervanites.”76More tantalizingly, Kartı ̄r’s incriptionat Naq ̆s-i Rajab tells the reader to remember “that heaven exists and that hellexists, and that whosoever is virtuous will go to heaven, and whoso is viciouswill be cast into hell.” The S ̆ikand Guma ̄nı ̄g Viza ̄r,chapter 6, mentions theDaharı ̄s, those who worship Dahr,the Arabic word for Time. “They considerthat this world...and the intermixture of the one with other is derived fromthe principle of Infinite Time; and that . . . virtue remains unrewarded and sinunpunished, that heaven and hell do not exist, and there is no one who attendsto virtue and sin; and further that phenomena are only material and that thespiritual does not exist.”77This description of the Time-worshipers is strikinglysimilar to the position refuted by Kartı ̄r.S ̆a ̄pu ̄ r II, who ascended to the throne in 309 C.E., called one of the earliestversions of what we might now call an “ecumenical conference”: “He sum-moned men from all lands to an unprejudiced (?) disputation to examine andinvestigate all creeds.” As is often the case with such gatherings, things gotugly. Although the De ̄nkartjust tells us that the priest A ̄durba ̄d was “vindicatedby the consistency of his argument,” we learn from another source that he wasin fact vindicated by refusing to recant when molten bronze was poured ontohis chest. Satisfied with the frank and unprejudiced disputations, S ̆aa ̄pu ̄r an-nounced to the assembled, “ ‘Now we have seen the Religion upon earth, weshall not tolerate false religions and we shall be exceedingly zealous.’ And thushe did do.” The reign of S ̆a ̄pu ̄ r II may have been “the high-water mark of or-thodox Mazdeanism.”78Under Vahra ̄m V (420–438), the title magupata ̄n magupat(chief highpriest) was created. A certain Mihr-Nars ̄e, who also served under Vahra ̄m, wasmade prime minister under Yezdigird II. The Ma ̄tiya ̄n i haza ̄r Da ̄tasta ̄nsaysthat Vahra ̄m V had kept this man in the service of fire-temples, a vocationwhich, according to MasÛu ̄dı ̄, Arda ̆sı ̄r also pursued when he abandoned theworld.79The frequenting of fire-temples by Mihr-Nars ̄e seems to signal more ofa forced retirement from public service than a monastic commitment, in that“at the command of His Majesty, the King of Kings, Yezdigird, son of Vahra ̄m,he was received back into a position of trust because of his reputation as a sin-ner.”80According to the Armenian Christian Eli ̆s ̄e Vardapet, whom we have al-ready met, it was Mihr-Nars ̄e who issued an edict to convert the rebellious Ar-menian Christians, whom he said were “deaf and blind and deceived by thedemons of Ahriman.”81The edict reported by Eli ̆s ̄e, who was an eyewitness, in-cludes the Zurvanite cosmogony we have already mentioned—one that isclearly derivative from the same source as the other three we mentioned ear-lier.82We know that when his proselytizing was rebuffed and its recipients, theArmenian clergy, responded with violent language, Yezdigird II sent a punitiveexpedition to the province of Armenia, followed up by a large contingent of Ma-gian priests. It is highly unlikely that if Eli ̆s ̄e wanted to win converts to Chris-tianity by describing the edict, he would include some document other than anorthodox one if the learned men in his own country could refute him.83Hence,“we are...justified in believing that the so-called edict of Mihr Nas ̄e, thoughzoroastrian heresy201"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"derived from other sources, nevertheless represents approximately the officialdoctrine at the time of Yezdigird II.”84King Quba ̄d (488–496 and 498/9–531) granted an interview to Mazdak, areformer inspired by the teachings of Ma ̄nı ̄.85Quba ̄d was convinced, and dur-ing his first tenure, Mazdak held religious sway. The Mazdakites favored theabolition of social inequalities, especially ownership of private property. Thearistocracy and the clergy naturally howled, and Quba ̄d was deposed for hisbrother Ja ̄ma ̄sp. When he regained the throne two years later, he had seen thelight: The Mazdakites were liquidated.86However, he had set the stage for an-other reactionary purge.The D ̄enkartrelates the contemporary state of affairs under the rulingking of kings, Xusrau I (ruled 531–589), son of the pathetic and controversialQuba ̄d. It is highly probable that Zurvanism enjoyed a resurgence before Xus-rau I reestablished “true” Mazdean doctrine.87In religious and other texts,Xusrau is called Ano ̄ ̆sarvan,“with the immortal soul,” a unique title of ap-probation. “After he had put down irreligion and heresy with the greatest vin-dictiveness according to the revelation of the Religion in the matter of allheresy,” says the D ̄enkart,he strengthened the caste system and issued a de-cree encouraging more religious “discussion.” However, it is clear from therecorded text of the edict, which most scholars believe is genuine, that he putfar more emphasis on praxis as determined by religious authorities than onfree thought.The truth of the Mazdayasnian religion has been recognized. Intelli-gent men can with confidence establish it in the world by discussion.But effective and progressive propaganda should be based not somuch on discussion as on pure thought, words, and deeds, the inspi-ration of the Good Spirit, and the worship of the gods paid in ab-solute conformity to the word. What the chief Magians of Ohrmazdhave proclaimed, do we proclaim; for among us they have beenshown to possess spiritual insight.. . . we have recognized that, in so far as all dubious doctrine, for-eign to the Mazdayasnian religion, reach this place from all over theworld, further examination and investigation prove that to absorb andpublish abroad knowledge foreign to the Mazdayasnian religion doesnot contribute to the welfare and prosperity of our subjects as muchas one religious leader(rat) who has examined much and pondered muchin his recital [of the ritual]; with high intent and in concert with theperspicacious, most noble, most honourable, most good Magianmen, we do hereby decree that the Avesta and Zand be studied zeal-ously and ever afresh so that what is acquired therefrom may worthilyincrease and fertilize the knowledge of our subjects.88The author of the De ̄nkart,a theologian supposedly descended from thesaintlike A ̄durba ̄d, had as his goal the creation of the triumphal tale of theMazdean form of Zoroastrianism. Hence the De ̄nkart,which betrays far lessvestigial Zurvanism than the Bundahi ̆sn, consistently emphasizes a dualist doc-202the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"trine whereby the two spirits, completely separate from and opposed to eachother, both preexisted the world.89Zurva ̄n is unknown to the De ̄nkart,exceptwhere he is described as an hypostasis of Ohrmazd. Apostate kings such asQuba ̄d were not dear to the hearts of the authors of the De ̄nkart, which glori-fies the reigns of S ̆a ̄pu ̄ r II and Xusrau I, both of whom violently suppressedan onslaught of heresy and reestablished “the good Religion” with theocraticbrutality.However, the De ̄nkartdoes mention the heretical worship of “devil-worshipers” (Pahlavi de ̄va ̄sn): “Their power to propagate the religion of Ahri-man in the name of Ohrmazd is restricted and they keep their heresy hid-den.”90As Zaehner points out, “This brief remark is particularly instructive: itamounts to an admission that the sorcerers did not worship the powers ofdarkness exclusively, but also paid tribute to Ohrmazd.” This is born out bycertain observations of Western writers concerning the two separate viewsabout Ahriman among the Magi they knew, such as those of Plutarch: “Thelord of the opposite fate, whether a god or a daemon, they call Hades (Ahri-man).”91Zaehner’s (by no means uncontested) analysis of the evidence leads to thefollowing outline of the religion of the Sasanian dynasty. Zoroastrianism wasrevived by Arda ̆sı ̄r I, assisted by the theologian Tansar. S ̆aa ̄pu ̄ r I attempted to in-gather foreign and speculative elements to the Avesta,which may have in-cluded Zurvanite texts; the priest A ̄durba ̄doffered a single canonical view onwhich the king based his religious platform, and which became a standard forMazdean doctrinal purity thereafter. Under Vahra ̄m I, there was a Mazdean re-action to S ̆aa ̄pu ̄ r’s eclectic tolerance, and the powerful career of the Magian priestKartı ̄r was launched. Persecutions of both non-Zoroastrians and heretics withinthe religion were widespread. Under S ̆aa ̄pu ̄ r II, a council was summoned to con-sider religious questions; the dualist view of A ̄durba ̄dprevailed. Under Yezde-gird II, the Zurvanites prevailed, and Mihr-Nars ̄e as prime minister was theirchampion. Quba ̄d’s affair with the teachings of Mazdak produced doctrinalchaos and roused the wrath of the Magian clergy. Under Xusrau I, A ̄durba ̄d’sdoctrine was again upheld.92In the tolerance of Xusrau II, all religions wereequal, but Christianity was probably more equal than others.Why was Zurvanism considered heresy? Scholarly views on this questiondiffer greatly. Duchesne-Guilleman says that it “upset the very essence of Maz-daism and was therefore condemned as heretical.”93Zaehner claims that itthreatened dualism; according to him, the Zurvanites tried to “re-establish theUnity of godhead by positing a principle superior to Ohrmazd and Ahriman,thereby doing away with that essential dualism which is the hub of the Zoroas-trian position.”94However, while the very Avestan passages in the yasnaattrib-uted to Zoroaster sow the seeds for this dualism of good versus evil in the storyof the twins Spenta Manyu and Angra Manyu, neither the priest-prophet nororthodoxy afterward appears to have endorsed it: Ahura ̄ Mazda, the Wise Lord,was the supreme “champion of the Arta[a ̆sa].”95It is true that there doesnot seemto be one god, but two who are intimately related—twin brothers—in originalZoroastrianism, which is neither monotheistic nor polytheistic. It is also truezoroastrian heresy203"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"that outside observers, including the Greeks, believed that the worshipers them-selves saw them as coequal in power. But contra Zaehner and the standard, legit-imately founded assessment of radical dualism, one can also agree with Varennewhen he says that “it does not seem that the Zoroastrians had ever professed aradical dualism. For the orthodox, Ahura Mazda ̄ is the only sovereign god: thetwo Spirits are a projection of his omnipotence into two opposed but comple-mentary forces.”96In other words, although it tried to provide a solution to the theologicalproblems that had vexed and continue to vex Zoroastrianism, Zurvanism mayhave been condemned for two reasons. In the first place, it posited a deity, infi-nite and preexisting, which was greater than Ohrmazd (Ahura Mazda ̄). Zurva ̄nactually had to bring the good into existence as his son. Its heresy may not havebeen that it tried to resolve the dualism that resulted from the collapse ofSpenta Manyu into Ahura Mazda ̄ by creating one supreme god, but that in sodoing it was not classically monotheistic enough: it undermined the sover-eignty of Ahura Mazda ̄ by implicating him in a cosmogony in which he wasonly a dependent cocreator. A second, perhaps more profound reason, was thatthe religion of Zurva ̄n traced both good and evil to the supreme deity. OrthodoxMazdaism could always view Ahriman as a force completely other thanOhrmazd. But if both Bounteous and Destructive Spirits could be conceived byone supreme god, then God himself was of a dual nature and notcompletely ofthe realm of light. The disturbing doctrine of Zurva ̄n’s “doubt” as the origin ofevil left no other conclusion; and as we have seen, some sources strongly sug-gested that Zurvanites honored both aspects of the godhead, a ̆saanddruj,ahuraandda ̄evaalike.Upon their condemnation as heretical, Zurvanite texts were lost fromthe Pahlavı ̄ corpus, and consequently are extremely hard to reconstruct to-day. Except for the very late \\Ulema ̄ i Isla ̄m,we are compelled to rely on non-Zororoastrian texts that are Christian and Manichaean, and therefore im-plicitly hostile. However, they are far from useless. Mazdean orthodoxycontains some otherwise inexplicable traces of Zurvanism. For example, theMazdean orthodox writer Ma ̄nushchihr writes that “Ormazd, the lord of allthings, produced from Infinite Light a form of fire whose name was that ofOrmazd and whose light was that of fire.”97The phrase can only be accountedfor as a clumsy adaptation of a Zurvanite text that said that Zurva ̄n createdOhrmazd.What Is the Yasna?The defeat at al-Qa ̄disı ̄yah in 635 of the forces of Yezdigird III, the last Sasanid,sounded the death knell of the domination of Mazdean religion.98Islam toler-ated its predecessor in principle, but in practice, persecutions and forced con-versions were the rule. Called Gabars by the Muslims, the Zoroastrians sur-vived in Iran as a persecuted minority at Yazd and Kirman; at Persis, theAchaemenid seat, some remnant of the cult of Ahura Mazda ̄ survived. From204the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"the tenth century C.E. onward, they migrated to India, finding asylum in Gu-jarat. There they surrendered the religious elements that offended Hindus,such as blood sacrifice, and the study and practice of astrology and theosophy.Ever since they were attacked for dualism by Christian missionaries to India,they have been emphasizing monotheism.We have seen that Zoroastrianism integrated the mythology and worshipof the older Indo-Iranian religion. It could not eradicate Mithra or the haomasacrifice, but had to claim them as its own. We have also suggested that thesame is true for the Zurvanite reform of Zoroastrianism—in fact, to a greaterdegree. The cosmogony of Zurva ̄n, which purports to tell the very begin-nings of the world, is completely ritual-centered. That ritual is the ancientyasna(cognate with the Vedic yajña), whose proper performance, as we haveseen, was so critical to the maintenance of reborn Zoroastrianism. Thekilling of the primordial bull by Ahriman in the orthodox cosmogonic ac-counts and the withering of the first plant, later pounded and mixed withwater by Ohrmazd’s creations to allow plant life to develop on the earth, mayhave formed the prototypes for the yasna, which was, as Philip Kreyenbroekdescribes, “intended to create a link between heaven and earth through ritualofferings of the juice of the haomaplant, and initially also through animalsacrifice, in the presence of the life-giving elements water and fire, whichalso received offerings.”99Boyce suggests that, as is still the case in modernPersian Zoroastrian ritual, the rite was conducted in the early morning, justafter sunrise.100Certain important features of the ancient Indo-Iranian liturgy performedby Ohrmazd in the orthodox, and Zurva ̄n in the heterodox creation myths wehave considered are recognizable in the modern Zoroastrian fire sacrifice.Other sacraments, such as those of initiation of the young (naojote,in whichchildren at the age of twelve are adopted by the fire), repentence and confes-sion, and three distinct ceremonies of purification have survived and are stillpracticed in modern Zoroastrianism. Funerary rites and ritual aspects of depo-sition in the Towers of Silence persist, as do six seasonal festivals, the Gahan-bars, in addition to the days celebrated with prayers for the dead at the end ofthe year. However, the ancient yasnawas and is the central cultic activity of thereligion.There is speculation that in the service of Ahura Mazda ̄, Zoroaster mayhave demanded the incorporation of some liturgical reforms. Nevertheless, it isgenerally understood that in the essence of its worship Zoroastrianism re-tained the ancient sacrificial rituals of the Magi. Three main fires, the Farnbag,Gushnap,andBurzen-Mihr, were associated (in Dumézilian tripartite style)with the priestly, warrior, and agricultural classes. These in turn were desig-nated Aduran(village fire) and Varhran(provincial and royal fires).101Herodotus thought that the devotees of ancient Magian religion wor-shiped, among other natural elements, fire.102He also tells us that they heldtheir ceremonies in open spaces, out of doors. But contra his assertion that thePersians had no temples, cultic structures have been found in the form of ter-races, towers, or square rooms. These rooms contained openings throughzoroastrian heresy205"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"which the fire could be seen, eternally ablaze. The ruins of ̆cah ̄ar·t ̄aq’s, whichhave four gates or doors, have been discovered throughout Iran; and from thetime of the Sasanian kings, numismatic evidence shows altars aflame on raisedplatforms, not sheltered but visible as a sign of the marriage of imperial and sa-cred authority.103These structures did not house statues of the god or goddess,which signified his or her real presence on earth, but the living fire without whichno worship was possible.The fact that Zoroaster instigated no purge of the fire icon, such as Muh.am-mad undertook of pre-Islamic idols at Mecca, is significant; rather, while preserv-ing its role as ritual axis, he insisted on its sublimation. Fire-centered orthopraxy,prominent in the Vedas,104was appropriated and spiritualized in Zoroastrian rit-ual. As the high priest of the Bombay Parsis, Dastur Kotwal, explains, AhuraMazda ̄, Good Mind or Bounteous Spirit, was quickly thought of as perpetual,pure light itself—and fire was concentrated light made manifest on earth.105Themaintenance of its purity thus became—and continues to be—a powerful con-cern having both ethical and ritual dimensions for the Iranian and IndianZoroastrian (Parsi) communities.According to tradition, the spiritual meaning of fire—called “son of AhuraMazda ̄”—was discovered by an ancient king, Hoshang. Dastur Kotwal says,“He assembled all his court and said, ‘This is a divine glow.’ A person who haswisdom would praise it.” According to Kotwal, “Zoroaster spiritualized fire.”When Ahura Mazda ̄ approaches Zoroaster, Zoroaster tells us thatTo his question: “To whom wilt thou address thy worship?”I made reply: “To thy fire! While I offer up my veneration to it,I will think of the Right to the utmost of my power. (Yasna43:9)“According to us,” says Kotwal, “all naturally lustrous objects are worthy ofveneration. The sun, moon, the stars, lights, all light. Now, what is God? What isOhrmazd, or Ahura Mazda? Our religion teaches that Ahura Mazda is a streamof light. When we consider fire in the material world, we remove its earthly im-purities through ceremony, and make it as pure as it is in the mansion of AhuraMazda. After consecration, a ray of light descends on that earthly fire and a linkis established between devotee and God....[W]e do not worship fire, as hassometimes been said, but we worship Ahura Mazda through the agency offire.”106Fire is “gladdened” by taking away the impurities from it (whereas firefrom a corpse is “harrassed”) by sifting, purifying, consecrating. The first fire,the hearth fire, is worshiped as the presence of Ahura Mazda ̄ on earth. Personalprayers and hymns are offered to it. After a sacred rectangle is demarcated by afurrow in the ground, or a rectangular room established, the second fire is lit.This fire, to whom sacrifices are fed, is the eater of dedicated offerings; its job asmessenger is to carry and distribute them to the world beyond. An elaborate cer-emony is required to establish a new fire; purification and regeneration havetheir own rites.In tribute to its characteristically Indo-European domestic origins, Zoroas-trians keep a sacred fire burning in their house (usually a lamp) before which206the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"they recite their daily prayers. In fact, the Vedas and the Avestamake clear thatthe head of the household is the sacrificer; the liturgist, originally only a paidadvisor. Hence it is thought that the zaotarZoroaster had to search far andwide for a sponsor before he was finally hired by Vi ̆st ̄ asp.The holy fire cannot be allowed to extinguish itself. It must be fed at leastfive times a day. Every feeding of the fire requires the recitation of prayer. Theprincipal Zoroastrian ceremony, the yasna,is a sacrifice of haoma(sacreddrink) conducted before the sacred fire, accompanied by the recitation of largeparts of the Avesta.107There are also offerings of bread and milk. Initially, be-fore the Parsi conformation to Hindu sensibilities that became normative,there were animal offerings of meat or fat. The scrupulous maintenance of rit-ual purity, so characteristic of Zoroastrianism, is critical during the perfor-mance of the fire ceremony.108One may only approach the fire having bathedand changed one’s clothes and with a cloth over one’s mouth. A stone relief ofthe Achaemenid period in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum shows a priestwearing a mouth-cover while presiding at a sacrifice nearly identical to the oneworn today by modern Zoroastrian priests in the fire-temples of Bombay.109Aspecial light is strongly associated with the yasna,which has its own name:kwarrah,meaning “radiance” or “glory.” “A priest who performs his cere-monies sincerely, in touch with the spiritual powers, acting as a servant of God,haskwarrah—a sort of glory or aura on his face.”110Kotwal observes that the purpose of rite is to allow “man to establish con-tact with the spiritual world” (the archangels, angels, and guardian spirits, theAvestaname ̆sa spentas,yazatas, and fravashis) and “to invite the powers to theearth, because they are the guardians of all things.” In fact, in ancient Iran, asin Vedic India, the role of ritual fire is above all meditative: “the gods were ableto keep their immortality only to the degree that mortals nourished them withoblations, just as mortals won their place in Heaven by preparing their offer-ings and consuming them together with their divine guests.”111Without the di-vine fire-god who graciously dwells on earth, there is no access to the invisibleworld of the immortal ones. There can be no communion and no feast.In the ritual of the yasna,every level of creation is present. The divine hier-archy, that of the seven Ame ̆saSpentas, is homologized in the ritual elementsthemselves.Ohrmazd, the first of the seven archangels, presides over man and isrepresented by the priest. The second archangel, Bahman, GoodMind, is the guardian of the cattle and is represented by clarified but-ter. Ardavahisht, Best Righteousness, is the lord of fire, which is pres-ent in all our ceremonies. Fourth is Shahrevar, Desirable Dominion,who presides over metals, present in our metal utensils. Fifth isSpenda ̄rmad, Holy Devotion, ruling over earth, and of course we per-form our ceremonies on earth. Then there is Horda ̄d, Perfection, thelord of water.

Despite their Christianagenda, these four accounts bear a close resemblance to the \\Ulema ̄ i Isla ̄m(Doc-tors of Islam), which although late (ninth to eleventh centuries), is the only extantZurvanite text.113The template for our texts may have been the Pahlavi work ofTheodore of Mopsuestia, known to us only from a summary in Greek given bythe Byzantine scholar Photius. Patriarch of Constantinople in the late ninth cen-tury C.E., Photius heaps scorn on Theodore’s story of creation.A scroll of Theodore was read, On Persian Magic,which concernedwhat constituted [their] religious difference(s), in threediscussions....In the first discussion he sets forth the loathsomedoctrine of the Persians, Zarada explained, namely, that of Zurva ̄n,whom he presents as ruler of everything, and whom he also calls For-tune [or Fate]. And because he [Zurva ̄n] sacrificed [literally, “poured li-bations”], so he gave birth to Ohrmazd; he bore him and also Satan,and [Theodore also tells] about the mixing of their blood. And thus hemakes his case in the first discussion, openly advancing, as thephrase goes, [this] sacrilege and most shameful doctrine.114Who is Zurva ̄n? What are his divine attributes? He is preexisting, whenthere was nothing, “neither skies nor earth.” He is Great; Eli ̆se calls him“Zurva ̄n, the great God.” This title is often corroborated: the \\Ulema ̄ i Isla ̄mtellsus of that prehistoric time, “in spite of all the grandeur (buzurgva ̄rı ̄)that sur-rounded it (Time), there was no one to call it creator.”115The repetition in thetexts of vazurg, vazurgva ̄r(great) was a “standing epithet of the infinite Zurva ̄nwho as such is the source and origin of all things good and evil.”116Similarly,the Syriac writer S ̆aahrista ̄nı ̄ calls Zurva ̄n “the greatest of the light people” or sim-plyzurva ̄nu›l-kabı ̄r,“the great Zurva ̄n.”117In Manichean texts, Zurva ̄n is theIranian equivalent of “the Father of greatness” of Theodore bar Kônai.The Syriac writer S ̆ahrista ̄ni notes than Ahriman arose from Zurva ̄n’s “sin-gle reflection,” that momentary, cosmic divine mistake, whereas “Ohrmazdarose from that wisdom.”118Good is born out of the inherent nature of the di-vine, evil from its imperfection; they are condemned to battle until the end oftime. Despite that distinction, we are still left with a god who is purely bina-tured, composed of both light and darkness; he is the father of good and evilalike.119Continues S ̆ahrista ̄ni, “some of the Zurva ̄niyya think that there was al-ways something evil with God, either an evil thought or an evil corruption, andthat is the origin of Satan.”120“Always something evil with God!” No wonderZurvanism became anathema to Mazdeans, Christians, and Manichaeans208the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"alike. It was neither ethical monotheism nor pure dualism; it was somethingmore frightening, or more existentially authentic.What is crucial about the births of these twins, these opposing moralforces, and about the roles they play, is that the entire cosmic drama takes placeand is to a great extent determined by the requirements of sacrifice. In the Zur-vanite story, sacrifice resulted in the creation of Ohrmazd, just as all creation issaid to have been created by sacrifice. This is very much in line with the ortho-dox idea of sacrifice being created in illo tempore,“before the fall,” as the Bun-dahi ̆sntells. “For [Ohrmazd] knew that when the Aggressor came, the day wouldbe divided into five periods; for before the Aggressor came, it was always mid-day, that is Rapiuwin. At the Rapiuwin time Ohrmazd and the Ahmraspandsfashioned the “idea” [m ̄eno ̄k] of sacrifice. By the performance of sacrifice all cre-ation was created.”121Theodore Abu ̄ Qurra, christian bishop of Harran (c. 740–820 C.E.), whosesource is Eznik, fills out the picture of this sacrifice. Writing in Arabic, Abu ̄Qurra tells us that a group of Magians told him to drive out some star-worshipers, saying that “ ‘what we possess is the truth.’ They stated that thegreat god was called Zurva ̄n, and that Zurva ̄n was Fortune (Persian baxt, thesame word used by Eznik).”122After his wife had been pregnant with Ohrmazdfor seven hundred years, the great god doubted whether his son had been con-ceived. From this doubt, Ahriman was conceived and born after a short inter-val, but Ohrmazd did not then follow right away. Ohrmazd was born only afterthe completion of the thousand years: Only after the supreme deity has fulfilledthe prescribed period of the sacrifice are light and goodness born.Of what cultic elements does Zurva ̄n’s sacrifice consist, and why? Photiususes the participle spAndvn(pouring libations) to describe the sacrifice ofZurva ̄n in his mighty effort to create Ohrmazd. This is reproduced by Yohan-nân bar Penkayê, whereas the other sources simply give “sacrifice.” In fact, aswe have seen, the pressing, pouring out for the fire, and drinking of the sacredplant-juicehaomawas the central rite of the yasna.Eznik uses the word ya ̆sttodescribe Zurva ̄n’s action, which derives from the Iranian and means “sacri-fice”; the hymns of the Avestaare called Ya ̆sts. “Zurvan, then, is performing theMagian liturgy, the interminable mumblings of which so struck the Greek andSyriac writers.”123S ̆ahrista ̄nı ̄ writes: “the Great Zurvan stood and mumbled[prayers](zamzama)...that he might have a son.”124Mas\\u ̄dı ̄ tells us that za-mzamat, “mumbling,” was the disrespectful term by which the Arabs satirizedthe Avesta.125It is the Avestan hymns, the ya ̆sts, that, according to Eznik andother sources, Zurva ̄n murmurs as he sacrifices. We have seen the importanceof the recital of the Avestain the decree ofXusrau I: No foreign knowledge con-tributes to the good of the king’s subjects “as much as one religious leader whohas examined much and pondered much in his recital.”126Eznik and barPennkayê specify that it is the bundle of twigs, the barsom, with which Zurva ̄nconducts the sacrifice. Finally, the presence of the ho ̄mtwigs implies the sacri-fice of the haoma.Thus three key ritual features are alluded to in the variousversions of the Zurvanite cosmogony: the pouring out of libations, the recita-tion of the hymns of the Avesta,and the use of the barsomor ritual twigs, whichzoroastrian heresy209"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Kotwal calls “the center of the yasnaceremony.” Zurva ̄n has performed a com-pleteyasna.Thus we form a picture of a god who exists “when absolutely nothing yetexisted,” a First Cause who is omnipotent, hermaphroditic, and who containsboth darkness and light as well as moral good and evil in his nature. This GreatGod undertakes a yasnawhose components, albeit evolved, date from at leastone and perhaps two millennia before. As Zaehner puts it, “This, then, is theMagian liturgy transported into eternity”;127and this, then, is also a paradoxwhose implications did not go unnoticed, a contested divine reflexivity.To whom does Zurva ̄n sacrifice? Eznik alleges that when asked, the Ma-gians reply that he sacrificed to Fate or Fortune (p\\a.rk\\).128However, as we haveseen in the works of Theodore, Zurva ̄n is called fnkaBTAxhn kaleP. Fortuneor Fate was a hypostasis of Zurva ̄n, and perhaps, like its sister the HellenisticTyche, was the most adamantine force in the universe. As expressed in the textMe ̄no ̄k i Khrat,“though one must be armed with the valour and strength of wis-dom and knowledge, yet it is not possible to strive against fate.”129A ̄dur-Hormizd mentions the “Fortune” hypothesis, but suggests that the sacrificewas offered rather to the natural elements.130“The sense, however, is fairlyplain. Zurvan offers a sacrifice to Fortune as an hypostasis of himself. He is atthe same time priest and God.”131Sacrifice assumes a major role in the ponderings of Eznik about whetherZurva ̄n was perfect or imperfect.132He asserts that if Zurva ̄n were perfect, hewould not have needed to sacrifice to produce a son. If imperfect, there musthave been something superior to him. As a Christian apologist, Eznik mustposit a being that is supremely and unquivocally good. Our usual question, ap-pearing in an ancient mouth, may in this case be answered by the glorified au-tonomy and preeminence of ritual itself. As Zaehner notes, “the Magian sacri-fice has virtue in itself, irrespective of its object, for Ohrmazd too performs asacrifice at the end of time.”133The result of Zurva ̄n’s sacrifice is Ohrmazd, the demiurge. When the ex-hausted divine father hands the twigs to Ohrmazd, thereby investing him with thepriesthood, he says, “It was for your sake that I sacrificed; now it is you who mustsacrifice for me.”134Ohrmazd will both create creation by sacrifice and then renewit in the same way in the last days. Thus, in the creation myth, we find a legitima-tion of the priest’s identification with Ohrmazd as manifested in actual cult.In orthodox Mazdean scripture, the priesthood of Ohrmazd is confirmed.The Bundahi ̆snsays: “[Ohrmazd] himself donned a white garment and it hadthe stamp of priesthood: for wisdom is ever with the priests who are guides tomen, and all men are their pupils. And the office of Ohrmazd was the act ofcreation, and it was through wisdom that creation must be created. Thereforedid he don the robe of the wise [which is the robe of ] priesthood.”135But in theZurvanite vision, “[it] was from the hands of Zurvan himself that he receivedhis priestly investiture.”136In its central myth, Zurvanism invested the priest-hood with the signal authority of Ohrmazd from the highest possible source.137It is Ahriman, whom bar Kˆonai calls “dark and ugly,”138who “went forth andmastered the world”;139winning his father’s kingdom through treachery, but it210the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"is to Ohrmazd that Zurva ̄n gives the barsom. It is Ohrmazd who will be theMelchizedek of heterodox Zorastrianism.Why Does Zurva ̄n Sacrifice?Its latter-day heretical reputation notwithstanding, historical Zurvanism actu-ally betrays a deeply conservative mythical element. In its creation story, its sov-ereign deity appears as his own high priest, performing the central sacrifice ofpracticed religion. This endorses and reinforces traditional Mazdean liturgy.The cosmogony then further legitimates the priestly function by making thedeity’s “good” son, who is light incarnate and ruler of the celestial realm, theone to assume the sacerdotal role. As Zurva ̄n sacrificed for him, so Ohrmazd isnow to sacrifice for Zurva ̄n, both at the present moment and at the end of time.In handing over the sacred twigs, Zurva ̄n becomes inferior to Ohrmazd. Whatthen, is paramount in the myth? It is the practice of sacrifice and exchange ofthe ability to sacrifice, played out on a universal scale.Zurva ̄n divests himself and invests his son with the office of priest. DasturKotwal notes that, during the yasna,Ohrmazd “presides over man and is rep-resented by the priest.” Here in the Zurvanite myth we have an emphatic foun-dational consecration and installation of Ohrmazd, Ahura Mazda ̄, as the greatdivine priest. Therefore we also witness a reemphasis of the divine model en-ergizing the mundane, flesh-and-blood priesthood.We have mentioned that Eznik is uncomfortable with the association ofsacrificial paraphernalia with a god. Eznik interprets Zurva ̄n’s motive in hand-ing the barsomto Ohrmazd as an attempt on the part of the infinite father to berid of his divine doubt, the crisis of faith that generated Ahriman. For a god tosacrifice implies weakness, incompetence, and inferiority to another, unnamedand invisible but certainly greater power.140And in Eznik’s commentary, Eastmeets West; sovereign and self-sufficient ritual encounters sovereign and self-sufficient Lord.If he [Ohrmazd] were God and had power to create heaven and earth,why should he need to have the barso ̄mand to perform sacrifice, that hemight free his father from doubt? Why was he, who could createheaven and earth without the barso ̄m,unable to rid his father of carewithout the rods? Thus it is plain that the father was without intelli-gence and power and placed his reliance in another, and that the sonwas likewise without intelligence and power. For the one could not givebirth to his son without performing sacrifice, and the son could not re-lease him from his doubts without taking the rods into his hand.”141For Eznik, ultimate sovereignty and the attributive action of sacrifice can-not coexist. He goes on to demonstrate that Zurva ̄n cannot be the true king andcreator of the universe.142 We are reminded of Marijan Molé’s diagnosis of thisdiscomfort, cited at the beginning of this chapter.Zaehner believes that, by attacking the Zurvanite doctrine—as so oftenzoroastrian heresy211"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"may be true in the case of polemic—Eznik exposes a clear picture of how it wasunderstood by Zurvanites.143Because the Great God did doubt, Zurvanites mayhave indeed held him unworthy of the priesthood. He surrendered his king-dom to the Evil twin Ahriman.144But it is sacrificethat will win the kingdomback for the good. Thus to Ohrmazd Zurva ̄n “gave the barso ̄m,the emblem ofpriesthood, so that he could by virtue of sacrifice bring the power of Ahrimanto naught.”145Interestingly, here heresy and orthodoxy converge in a mutualpicture of a dispersal of this threatening doubt. The Greater Bundahi ̆snpro-claims that when the 12,000 years have passed, at the end of time, “two lies re-main, Ahriman and A ̄z. Ohrmazd comes down to earth and is himself the zo ̄tpriest and Sro ̄ ̆s, the Blessed, the ra ̄spı ̄k.He holds the girdle in his hand. TheFoul Spirit and A ̄z will be greatly and strongly smashed by the magic power(n ̄erang) of the Gau ̄as, and <they fall> back to the darkness and gloom.”146“[T]hereby the power of Ahriman is broken: finally no doubt remains.”147This is a history either of a polytheistic religion struggling with the impli-cations of monotheism—or else, perhaps, the reverse. The Hellenistic genesisof Zurvanism seemed to lie, appropriately enough, in two quarters. It sought toresolve the theological problem of the dualism of coequal Good and Evil Spir-its. At the same time, it offered a transcendent endorsement of ecclesiasticism,which reemerged after near-drowning by Hellenism in the Arsacid period tounprecedented power in conjunction with Sasanian royalty. The centrality andquasi-autonomy of Zurva ̄n’s sacrifice, the yasna,in the Zurvanite myth of cre-ation accomplished a conservative sanctification of ritual whose members hadthe earthly power to sacrifice—which is in fact what the Sasanian periodbrought. However, the infinitude of the preexistent supreme god Time is com-promised by his sacrifice. This criticism is made by Eznik, a Christian apolo-gist, but also seems to reflect a dualist Zurvanite view of the godhead as atworst essentially flawed or, at best, as ambivalent, binatured, and contingent.Zurvanism, with its heritage of worshiping the dark side of the divine, didnot, as one might expect, generate alternative forms of worship. Rather, bornduring a period of eclipse, it conservatively reinscribed clerical authority byclothing the first and greatest immortal with the power to sacrifice—and byhaving him clothe with the same power his son, who is traditionally seen as ho-mologous with the ritualizing mortal priest. This, I suggest, would have lent it-self admirably to the theocratic agenda of the Sasanians and to the enhancedpower of the Mazdean priesthood. Driven by the story of a sacrificing, Janus-like god, a story far from senseless in light of its cultic history, Zurvanismcame into its own.212the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"7“Myself to Myself ”The Norse Odin and Divine Autosacrifice. . . everything that involves Ódinn is marked in this way...he hasoften been seen as a sort of shaman-god to whom sacrifices are madeby hanging—and nothing, absolutely nothing in his affairs has theclarity of rational phenomena.1Vicious lord of the battle-slain (Valf÷odr) and the dead (drauga drót-tinn), incurable necromancer, inspired patron of the skalds and theiresoteric poetic arts—wherein history was largely recorded andtransmitted—and one-eyed keeper of the runes,2the Norse god-magician Odin fluctuates ominously on the boundaries of thetripartite structure established by Georges Dumézil for far-flungIndo-European pantheons.3Odin carries both the “magical” aspectof Dumézil’s first or sovereignty function, as well as sharing with hisson Thor of the thrown hammer aspects of the second or war func-tion. The god Frey, whose ithyphallic image may have been seated atthe ancient “temple” or ritual feasting-hall at Uppsala, alone obedi-ently conforms to his “assigned” Dumézilian realm of influence, thatof the third function of wealth and fertility. Like Zeus descendedfrom a primeval race, and like Zeus the partner in many liaisons andfather of many divine offspring, Odin also reprises the role of theGreek god as father of all (Alf÷odr).4Odin is impossibly old (aldinn) and infinitely wise. He played apart in the creation of men, giving them ÷ond(breath, life, spirit).5Heis in fact the purveyor of immortality; Snorri Sturluson’s Prose Edda,a skaldic handbook of ancient myths compiled in the thirteenth cen-tury by a wealthy Icelandic farmer and ambassador for the Norwegianking Hákon Hákonarson,6says of Odin, “He will live throughout allages, ruling his whole kingdom and governing all things great and"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"small. He fashioned the earth and the sky and all that is in them....But thegreatest is this, that he created man and gave him the spirit which shall live andnever perish, even though the body rot to soil or burn to ashes.”7Odin is deeplygenerous, bringing gifts to the gods and to humanity, such as the intoxicatingart of poetry (which he stole as mead from the dwarfs and giants), and themagical runes that when “cut and colored” can make the hanged walk and talkagain—gifts bought at steep cost to himself. He is also violent and cruel, the godof war and dissension; nothing pleases him more than fratricidal strife and themutual slaughter of kinsmen and friends.8He is a sorcerer, the master andoriginator of galdrar(shape-shifting, magical travel, the command of helpingspirits, and communication with the dead), seidr(divination and the inductionof sickness or death, “marked” in the human realm as powers that belong towomen), and fj÷olkyngi(revelation of closed places like mountains and burialmounds, and binding those who dwell therein).9He is Sigf÷odr (victory-father),Bileygr(the one with eyes that evade), and Báleygr(one with eyes that flame).No deity is described in richer detail in the extant Scandinavian literary sources;no god is stranger and less easily comprehended.Dumézil himself wrote of Odin, referring to his relentless quest for eso-teric knowledge,Odin is the head of the gods...in the mythology he is their only kinguntil the end of time, and consequently, the particular god of humankings and the protector of their power, even when they glory in beingdescended from someone else. He is also the god who sometimes re-quires their blood in sacrifice....He is...the father of all the gods,while his own ancestry links him to the primordial giants. He is theclairvoyant one. This gift was assured to him and symbolically ex-pressed by a mutilation which would seem to have been voluntary: heis one-eyed, having given his other eye in payment to the honeyedsource of all wisdom.10Odin is believed by most—although not by all—to have been a presenceamong the Germanic peoples of the Early Period and the Migration Periods,but perhaps not ascendant until the Viking Age (c. 800–1066 C.E.). The distri-bution of toponyms suggest that even at that time, his cult probably flourishedchiefly among the fractious societies engendered by the martial warlords ofDenmark and southern Norway. Even so, as king of the divine race of the Æsir,he was honored as the supreme deity of the pantheon throughout Scandinavia.He was the recipient par excellence of sacrificial offerings, the central religiousrite of the Vikings. The sacrificial verb that is perhaps most frequently used inthe extant literary sources to mean “sacrifice, consecrate as a sacrifice, dedicate”is the verb “to give.” For example, when in Víga Glúms sagaThorkell the Tall,who has been expelled from northern Iceland by Glúmr, enters the temple ofFrey, he prays, “ ‘Frey, you who have long been my patron, and accepted manygifts and repaid them well, now I give (gef) you this ox, so that Glúmr may leavethe land of Thverá no less compelled than I leave it now. Let some sign be seenwhether you accept or reject it.’ The ox was so moved that he bellowed and214the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"dropped dead.”11The passage does not relate that Thorkell then cuts the throatof the ox or drowns it in a well or at a waterfall where spirits dwell, commonforms taken by Germanic sacrifice. It just says that the fugitive “gives” the ox tothe god. The verb pertains no less in cases of human sacrifice, especially in thecase of the lord of the battle, whereby even the slaying of one’s enemies in waror blood-feud could be seen as a sacrifice; the formula recited to one’s victimwas, “I give you to Odin.”12How extraordinary, then, to read in strophe 138 of Hávamál,“The Speechof the High One,” in the ElderorPoetic Edda(compiled c. 1270 C.E.) that Odin,who is Yggr(the Awful) and Hár(the High One) was “given (or offered) to Odin(ok gefinn Ódni)—myself to myself (sjálfr sjálfum mér).” Odin was hangagud—“god of the hanged”; in this poem, he is himself hanged. The god engages in anautosacrifice of cosmic scope; and he narrates the story of his own agony.138. I know that I hungVeit ek, at ek hekkon the wind-swept treevindga meidi áfor nine full nights,nætr allar níu,wounded with a speargeiri undadrand offered to O ́dinn,ok gefinn Ódni,myself to myself;sjálfr sjálfum mér,on that treeá peim meidi,of which no one knowser manngi veit,from what roots its rises.hvers hann af rótum renn.139.

The Poetic Eddacontains poems such as V÷oluspá(The Sibyl’s [or Wise Woman’s] Prophecy);Hymiskvida(Thor’s visit to Hymir), and Alvíssmál,a poem containing interpre-tations of various words, geneaological poems, and so forth. Hávamális an ob-scure collection of ancient verses in the genre of wisdom literature, a collectionof maxims compiled under a single title at an early date; their only link seemsto be the divine character of Odin himself.15The passage continues:140.

Then I began to be fruitfuland to be fertile,to grow and to prosper;one word soughtanother word from me;one deed soughtanother deed from me.16Like Hesiod’s Works and Days, most of Hávamális practical “how-to” infor-mation for daily living; it expounds the necessity of keeping one’s wits aboutone, the obligations of friendship and hospitality, and how to deal with misfor-tune. But it also contains magical chants and spells. Preceding a catalogue ofmagical practices that someone, perhaps Odin, has mastered, appear the brief,cryptic verses cited above. This is the only surviving account of the myths ofOdin’s autosacrifice, and no other literary sources incorporate any of its ele-ments.17Therefore, as in the case of the Attic vases showing the gods pouringlibations, we are without interpretive context for this tale. As E.O.G. Turville-Petre writes, “No more mysterious myth is recorded in Norse literature thanthat in which it is told how Ódinn hung for nine nights on a windswept tree.”18The most obvious solution is that the myth, which may date to the ninth cen-tury C.E. or earlier, reflects direct Christian influence. This view was establishedat the end of the nineteenth century by Sophus Bugge19and adopted by others.20The parallels between the hanging Norse god and the crucified Christ, especiallyin the latter’s medieval depictions, are intense: Odin hangs from Yggdrasill (thehorse of Ygg [one of Odin’s names]). Yggdrasill is the World Tree of the Norse cos-mos, while the cross is portrayed as the Tree of Life by the early church; the cross-tree is often called the rood-tree, a paranormal tree without roots—while theroots of Odin’s Yggdrasill, as described in Grímnismál31, comprise the cosmos,with giants dwelling beneath one, Hel under the second, and the men of MiddleWorld under the third.21The wind batters Odin’s self-sacrifice, just as a medievalpoet saw Christ dead “in the wylde wynde.”22Both divine figures are pierced witha spear, Odin geiri undadrinHávamál138 and Jesus in John 19:35 and 37 (“Theyshall look on him whom they have pierced”). Odin thirsts horribly, as does Jesus,who is given vinegar to drink (Mt. 27:48, Mk. 15:36; Lk. 23:36; Jn. 19: 29–30).Christ cries out “in a loud voice” before death (Mt. 27:46, 50; Lk. 23:46; Mk.15:34, 37) just as Odin, “screeching” or “howling” (œpandi) as he falls, gathers upthe precious runes. Even Odin’s nine nights on the gallows-tree may be seen as amultiple reflection of Christ’s traditional three hours on the cross and three daysin the realm of death before his resurrection.23The English tribes were convertedfrom the practice of Germanic religion to Christianity in the sixth or seventh cen-tury C.E., the Saxons, under Frankish force, in the eighth century C.E., and theDanes in the tenth century C.E. (965) under German pressure; Iceland (c. 1000),Norway (1024, but already begun under Hákon Adalsteinsfostri, c. 935), and Swe-den (the first Christian king, Olof Skötkonung, died in 1021) held out the longest;it was not until the twelfth century C.E. (c. 1100) that the Æsir reigned no more.Was this episode an Old Norse version of the crucifixion of Christ?24216the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"The “invasion” or intertwining of the figures of Odin and Christ is perhapsnowhere more graphically represented than on a runic stele raised by the firstChristian king of Denmark, King Haraldr Bluetooth (died 986 C.E.) in whathad been the pagan sanctuary at Jelling in East Jutland. The stone clearly rep-resents the crucifixion of Christ, arms outstretched, but there is no cross, andthe figure of Christ is shown suspended in intertwined knots or vines, fetteredjust as human sacrifices were bound over to Odin.25However, the picture is far from simple.26Every element of the poetry ofHávamálcan be defended not only as indigenous and pagan but also as spe-cific to the cult of Odin himself. Odin’s nickname was “God of the Hanged.”He was not merely the patron of the hanged; he also frequently received hu-man sacrifice by hanging. Not only was the spear his special weapon; as well,victims to Odin were ritually marked with the spear before they were hanged,and it was common for warriors and kings, even when dying in bed, to be“marked for Odin” with a spear wound. In other words, Odin sacrifices himselfto himself (gefinn Ódni, sjálfr sjálfum mér), exactly in the same way that victimsare uniquely sacrificed to him. The mythic god of skaldic poetry inauguratesthefeatures of his own cult, but religious history tells us that this Odin of poetryactuallyimitatesaspects of the known Odinic cult. This is the circle of divine re-flexivity, and in none of the religious cases we have considered—or willconsider—is the ritual logic spelled out more explicitly.Why does Odin sacrifice himself to himself ? Veit ek,he says in strophe 138,“I know.” Odin is a magician, master of the runic letters and the supernaturalpower they contain; this myth tells how he seized them. The agony of his ordealas well as its goal strongly resembles an initiation, “something like a shamanis-tic test Odin took upon himself in order to learn esoteric magic.”27A strong casecan also be made for a ritualized death, undergone by the highest power in theuniverse, in order to gain access to the realm of the dead—and we know that inpre-Christian Scandinavia the dead were believed to have special wisdom un-available to the living.28Whatever the reasons for Odin’s ordeal—a reflexive sac-rificial mystery which, like that of Christ, is so exalted that it may be beyondcomprehension—the specificity of its cultic features do not require the influ-ence of Christianity. Rather, they serve as an idiosyncratic confirmation of theparticular power of a pagan god. Odin sacrifices himself to himself in theunique ritual terms of his own cult. He becomes his own cult’s centerpiece. Inorder to make this case, it might be best to analyze the individual religious ele-ments of Hávamál138–140.The GodNone of the other gods of the Scandinavian pantheon have the mania or thesorcery to attempt what Odin undertakes on the World Tree; if they are muti-lated, like Ty ́r by the monster wolf Fenrir, for example, it is because they havebeen tricked, and certainly not by intention; it is not with the sense of with-standing bodily pain for the sake of gaining something greater. In a sense Odin“myself to myself”217"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"alone truly comprehends the essence and economy of sacrifice, and in the ac-count we are considering, he is at once recipient, high priest, and victim. Meta-morphosis is Odin’s province. The “grey-bearded one,” who ranges abroad asan unexpected guest in the realm of his mortal subjects with an old blue coatand broad hat, Odin is a shape-shifter and a sneak. A mercurial and amoral de-ity, like the Greek god Dionysos he is closely identified with transformativeliquids—the blood of sacrifice, the well-waters of divination, or the stolen meadof poetry.29Creator and father of all, “the towering god of the Germanic pan-theon,”30Odin is at the same time G÷ondlir,“the bearer of the magic wand”;Hnikarr, “the spear-thruster”; and B÷olverkr, “the evil-doer.” He is a conjurer,and a nasty one; he embodies what Dumézil called “impulsive intelligence,”and as Boyer puts it, “absolutely nothing in his affairs has the clarity of rationalphenomena.”31Odin is surrounded with magical animals and magical possessions. Fromhis seat, Hlidskjálf, Odin sees all that comes to pass.32He watches the universewith his ravens Huginn (Thought) and Muninn (Memory) perched one oneach shoulder, sending them out “hovering every day the whole earth over”(Grímnismál20) to bring him wisdom from the world’s far corners. Birds ofdeath, ravens are often described as feeding on corpses in skaldic poetry; theyappear on battle standards to convey to enemies that they themselves will soonbe raven-food.33Similarly, Odin’s wolves Geri (Greedy) and Freki (Ravenous)stalk the soaked battlefields for corpses to devour.34Odin has an eight-footedhorse, Sleipnir, son of Loki when he took mare-form and the stallion Svadilfari,owned by the giant builder of ́Asgardr; asThe Prose Eddaputs it in Gylfaginning,“The names of the horses of the gods are as follows: Sleipnir is the best; Ódinowns him, he has eight legs.”35His multiple legs may derive from an icono-graphic device to represent equine swiftness, such as appear on the stones ofAlkskog Tjängvide, Ardre I and VIII, and Lärbro Tängelgårda I and II in Got-land.36Sleipnir carried Odin’s son Hermodr to Hel, the world of the dead, to de-mand the return of Baldr.37Odin possesses a spear, Gungnir, which strikes atwhatever he aims. On his arm he wears a golden ring, the precious Draupnir,which every nine nights generates eight more rings just as magnificent.Adam of Bremen glosses his mention of the god Wodan with the word“furor.”38The name of Old German Wo ̄tan/Norse Ódinn derives from theproto-Germanic Wo ̄danaz<*Wa ̄tónos.39The root is expressed in the Gothicwo ̄ths“possessed,” and the Old Norse ódr,“raging, raving, possessed.” In Ger-man these words are connected to the verb wüten,“to rage”; Odin is wütendesHeer,leading his raging army. Odin is the god of war, but in a special sense; heis the dispenser of a kind of warlike ecstasy. Norse poetic kennings for battleare “Odin’s Tempest,” the “Ygg’s Game,” “Odin’s Fire.” Dumézil ties his nameto “drunkenness, excitation, poetic genius,” citing the Old English wo ̄d,mean-ing “chant.”40In fact, Odin was believed to lead a special group of soldiers of fortune whodedicated themselves to him. In Ynglingasaga6, Snorri Sturulson says that Odin’smen shunned mailcoats and “were mad as dogs or wolves,” “bit their shields,”and “were as strong as bears or bulls. They slew men, and neither fire nor iron bit218the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"on them. This is called going berserk (berserksgangr).”41In Book 7 of Saxo Gram-maticus’s Gesta Danorum,the beserk Harthben swallows live coals and murderssix of his own men.Dead Odinic warriors (einherjar) were entertained in Valh÷oll(hall of theslain) where they were waited upon by the valkyries (choosers of the slain), whobound those preelected for death in battle (herfj÷oturr,“host fetter”) and broughtin new dead from the field. Odin tried to surround himself with as many slainheroes as possible for the final eschatalogical battle against the enemies of godsand humans, many of whom had lain in wait since the beginning of time.42With his ghoulish host, Odin sought to stave off the Ragnar÷ok, neverthelessknowing from the seeress whom he awoke from her grave at the gates of Hel tolearn the fate of Baldr, and whose prophecies comprise V÷oluspá, that his effortswould be futile. The gods would die and the world would sink beneath the cos-mic ocean from whence it was originally raised.The antiquity of the worship of Odin in Scandinavia is much disputed. In98C.E., Tacitus writes in Germania9 of the Germanic tribes that deorummaxime Mercurium colunt(“of the gods they worship Mercury most”). Mostscholars identify the god Mercurius with the German *Wo ̄dan(az), especially ashe is the recipient of human sacrifice, and we have noted Dumézil’s belief that*Wo ̄dan(az) represented the magical aspects of Indo-European divine sover-eignty, as the counterpart of the Vedic Varun.a.43Except for Tacitus’s account,we have only one other report of a pagan offering to Wodan, in the Vita Colum-bani(640C.E.). Mercurius receives dedications on inscriptions in Roman-occupied German territory, but Mercurius was also used in Latin to designatethe Celtic battle god Lug.Was the worship of Odin a relatively late phenomenon in Scandinavia?Some contend that the cult reached the north around 200–400 C.E., and spreadnorth. Others say that Odin was little known before the Viking Age.44The Dan-ish archaeologist Karl Nikolai Henry Petersen (1849–1896) claimed that thelegends of Odin’s migration north were true, and that the god was a late-comer.45He also proposed that the legendary warfare between the rival tribesof gods, the Æsir and the Vanir, reflected the struggle of an older, more natura-listic cult and a later, invasive cult (a similar exegesis to the one that was appliedto the conflict between the Erinyes and the gods of Olympus in Aeschylus’sOresteia).46Karl Helm has followed Petersen, calling Tacitus’s statement a gen-eralization of a religion practiced by only a portion of the Germanic territory,whereas the cult of the sky god *Tı ̄w(az) was prominent elsewhere.47Helmclaims that Odin was not Germanic in origin but rather Roman or Byzantine,his premise being that the Germans did not have a single king but were dividedand thus could not have conceived of a sovereign deity; they could only reflectthe monarchies of neighboring kingdoms—thus Tacitus’s Mercurius. Dumézil,a sponsor of Odinic antiquity and autochthony, refutes this, pointing out thatthe Vedic tribes were as divided as the Germans, attributing no more power totheir kings; yet they had a single, sovereign deity, Varun.a.48Odinic place-names are unevenly distributed, concentrating in Denmarkand southeastern Sweden, especially Gotland. Such names are far less common“myself to myself”219"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"in Norway, where there are only twelve place names, mostly in the southeast,with “Ódin-”; middle and northern Sweden appears to be similarly free of Odin-worship.49Turville-Petre has suggested that where military chiefs prevailed, sodid the cult of Odin. In Iceland and southwestern Norway, where loyalties grewfrom blood-relationship, the social contract focused on a hereditary agriculturalaristocracy—prominent farming families whose values lay in kinship and inde-pendence from kings. There, Thor, Njord, and Frey were venerated, althoughthe place-names of fertility gods are as prevalent in Sweden as in Norway. Ac-cording to this theory, Odin was the sponsor of men without land or family ties,dastardly heroes like Harthben and Starka∂r and brutal kings caught up in in-trigues of vengeance.50Norway was violently united by Haraldr Finehair and hisson Eiríkr Bloodaxe in the ninth and tenth centuries. The kings seized heredi-tary estates; all farmers were obliged to be tenants of the crown. Many fled toIceland, emigrating to preserve their traditional way of life and rule by leadingfarmers, independent of kings and central government. They lost no love forOdin. Strangely, the chief sources about Odin are mostly written in Icelandic,even though his cult is not attested in Iceland. This may be because as the godof poets, Odin comes to us mainly through poetry.51Odin is restless, insatiably curious, a strategist rather than a champion, amorbid and often utterly deceptive god. Unlike his son Thor, popular with thepeasants who continued to wear his hammer as an amulet around their neckslong after the advent of Christianity, Odin did not protect common humanity;and unlike Frey, he did not promote the growth and harvest of crops. Like hisworshipers, he was a berserk. Because of Odin’s ascendancy in the Viking Age,Dumézil despaired of Scandinavian religion: “In vain do the Scandinaviangods punish sacrilege and perjury, avenge violated peace or scorned law. Noone incarnates in pure,exemplary fashion those absolute values that a society,even hypocritically, needs to shelter under high patronage. No divinity is anylonger the refuge of the ideal, or even of hope. What divine society has gainedin effectiveness, it has lost in moral and mystical power. It is now no more thanthe exact projections of the bands or the terrestrial states whose only concern it isto gain or overcome.”52Ironically, Odin does incarnate in pure, exemplary fash-ion a paradigmatic ritual—his autosacrifice. That is perfectly accomplished, al-though ultimately ineffective in staving off the jaws of Fenrir and the destructionof the entire generation of gods—a battle written in fate as its name suggests, itsoutcome inevitable.God of the Spear; “God of the Hanged”: Sacrifice to OdinWe have seen how in HávamálOdin sacrifices himself in a particular way—wounded by his own spear, and hung on a tree. In fact, in so doing, Odin reit-erates the forms of his own cult. For he himself requires and even causes thesacrificial deaths of human beings, by spear and by gallows; and he himself en-dures a god-sized death, whether real or initiatory, by magical spear and time-less gallows. His truest face, then, may be the fearsome carved head in the220the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"stave church at Hegge, Norway (Catalogue no. O–2; Fig. 67).

And as the story of Víkarr shows from the fourteenth-century Gautrekssaga,the innocence or guilt of his victims was of no consequence to thehangagud.For Odin loved the slaughtered, especially the pierced and thehanged, for reasons of his own: They were privy to esoteric wisdom, the awe-fulwisdom of the dead.Historical testimony indicates that the style of Odinic sacrifice was, in fact,unique to him within Germanic religion, just as maenadic dance belonged toDionysos and the slaughter of pigs to Demeter. Literary and archaeologicalsources show that normal Germanic sacrificial ritual primarily revolvedaround libation and communal sacrificial meals.53To execute normal sacrificewasat blóta;the offering was called blót.The highly restricted term for sacrifi-cial blood was hlaut. Animals were slaughtered with a sword or an axe; theirblood was collected in a sacred vessel. It was there either examined by augurs,who from it divined the future,54or else it was sprinkled over the participantsor on divine emblems, such as the carved limbs and tree stumps like thosefound in bogs in northern Germany and Denmark. Horses, cattle, pigs, sheep,and dogs were sacrificed.55The meat of sacrificed animals was cooked, somefor the gods, the rest for the participants.56“myself to myself”221figure 67.Wooden carved head from the stave church at Hegge, Norway,thirteenth century C.E.

The sacrificial cup was passed over the fire; the man who had giventhe sacrifice would consecrate (signa) this as well as the sacrificial food. A toastwas first drunk to Odin for victory, then toasts to Njordand Frey for a bountifulharvest and for peace. A toast was drunk to the memory (minni) of deceasedkinsmen.59Solemn feasts were celebrated every nine years, in multiple blood sacri-fices; for the number nine, far from being explicably sacred as a multiple of theJewish and Christian three days of resurrection or trinitarian preoccupations,was always especially charged in Germanic religion.60Thietmar of Merseburg,writing in the year 1000 C.E., tells us about Denmark’s principal temple atLeire: The Danes sacrificed each ninth year ninety-nine human beings and thesame number of horses and dogs.61Nine, the number of nights Odin hangsupon the World Tree, is also a number of power in Siberian and other circum-polar forms of shamanism, and, as we shall see, this cultural matrix, an “en-souled world,” as Neil Price calls it, has had as much if not more influenceupon Viking religion and myth as the Celto-Germanic traditions in their Scan-dinavian form.62Classical authors frequently refer to human sacrifice among the continen-tal Germans.63In the same passage mentioned above (Germania9), Tacitus re-marks that although the Germanic gods Hercules and Mars could be appeasedwith animal sacrifice, Mercurius (Wodan) required human sacrifice. In Germa-nia39, Tacitus describes a sacred grove established by the Semnones, the eliteof the tribe of the Su ̄ ebi (modern Schwaben), where gruesome human sacrificeoccurred.64According to Tacitus, anyone entering the grove had to be boundwith a chain in deference to the ruling god there (regnator omnium deus).65Wodan must be the candidate of choice for this deity, given the god’s propen-sity for fetters, including the herfj÷oturrwith which he binds his enemies withpanic,66and especially the “fetter grove” (fj÷oturlundr) where Dagr slew Halgiwith a spear that Odin lent him.67Procopius (De Bello GothicoII.14.15) says ofthe men of Thule that they offered the first victim taken in battle to Ares.68Notonly was the sacrifice bloody but men of Thule would also hang the victim on atree, or cast him among thorns. Jordanes (GeltaV), like Procopius writing inthe sixth century C.E., relates that the Goths sacrificed prisoners of war to Mars,believing that the god of war needed human blood.69As Germanic religion evolved in Scandinavia, accounts of human sacrificepersisted.70A relationship between royal life and fertility is implied; there are222the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"stories of kings who were on rare occasion sacrificed til grodrar(for growth) atthe harvest. Ynglingasagatells us that when the crops failed, the Swedes slaugh-tered their king Dómaldi, and smeared their altars with his blood.71Guta saga,a thirteenth-century history of the Gotlanders, mentions that the landownersof Gotland used to sacrifice their sons and daughters as well as their cattle.72Human sacrifice by hanging is a recurrent theme in the sources.73Fromthe time of Tacitus on, there has been a literary and iconographic tradition ofdesignated sacred groves for death by hanging outside enclosed walls or formalsanctuaries. The existence of open-air sacrificial groves, albeit only yielding an-imal osteological remains in this case, was corroborated in the mid-1980s byexcavations beneath the floor of a medieval church on the island of Frösö in theStorsjö lake near Östersund in Sweden. The Frösö church excavation revealedthe decayed remains of a birch tree deliberately felled sometime in the eleventhcentury and, scattered in a nine-meter radius outward from the tree trunk, alarge assemblage of bones from mostly game animals such as bears, and theheads of elks, stags, reindeer, sheep, pigs, and cows slaughtered, apparently,while the tree was still standing, up through the tenth century.74It is not cer-tain that all the victims who swung from a tree were actually executed by thenoose. Both the descriptions of Procopius and the account of Adam of Bremenfrom around 1070 C.E. suggest that their precious blood was sprinkled beforethey were strung up; the hanging would occur after they were dead.75We know that both animal and human victims could be thrown over cliffs.In the Icelandic Hrafnkels saga(VI), the horse Freyfraxi is pushed over a cliffinto a pool below by his owner, who says, “It is right that he who owns himshould receive him.”76When acceptance of Christianity was debated at the Ice-landic Althingi in the year 1000, adherents of the Christian party complainedthat the “heathen sacrifice the worst men,” hurling them over rocks or cliffs(Gautreks sagaI–II reports that men and women of Gautland would throwthemselves over the family cliff in times of famine, believing that they would goto Valh÷oll “Great Assembly”).77This phrase about “heathen sacrifice” focuses a crucial debate in Germanicstudies: Did human sacrifice exist at all, and if it did, was it only the worstmenwho were sacrificed? Inland bodies of water and bogs, which due to an age ofcremation have yielded far more sacrificial offerings than graves, offer confus-ing testimony. The bogs have offered up an array of jewelry, and from the IronAge, the gods were presented with gifts of food, especially gruel in contain-ers.78Animal remains abound: numerous horses and dogs, who played a ma-jor role in funerals. There can be no doubt that these were ritually sacrificed, inthat certain body parts were consistently missing.However, human remains have been found in two different contexts in thebogs. The first type of victims, mainly women and children, were found in sac-rificial sites together with other evidence of sacrifice—such as at Oberdorla,where wooden idols and numerous animal bones are found besides human re-mains.79These must surely be sacrifices. But those who are found in isolationpresent a problem: Are we dealing with sacrifice or “sacral execution”? Thequestion of to what extent the death penalty originated in human sacrifice has“myself to myself”223"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"been much debated by scholars of ancient Germanic law.80Tacitus, in Germa-nia19, says that young women found guilty of adultery by the tribes had theirhair cut off and were stripped naked and flogged out of the community. This ishow the naked body of a young girl from Windeby, found in the peat of Dom-land south of Eckernforde in Schleswig, now in the Landesmuseum in SchloßGottorp, has been interpreted—blindfolded, one side of her head shaved, witha collar of ox-hide around her neck; the “excommunication” described by Taci-tus seems to have been extended to capital punishment. Far more ambiguousis the detached and probably severed head of a man, rope still in place aroundhis neck, discovered in the peat bog at Tollund, Denmark, who died by stran-gling during the Migration Period (third to sixth century C.E.). Does this repre-sent a Germanic or a Celtic victim? A criminal or a sacrificial execution? Wasthe strange gruel he consumed before he was hanged a ritual meal? Why washe hanged and then decapitated?81Let us return to Odinic sacrifice and to the spear, Odin’s favorite weapon.His spear Gungnir was forged by dwarfs (Skáldskaparmál44). The poet Egillcalled him “Lord of the Spear” (geirs dróttin).82Hence, to have a spear thrownover one’s head or to be marked with a spear was to be dedicated to Odin. InV÷oluspá24, Odin himself hurls his own spear to open the hostilities betweenÆsir and Vanir, thus consecrating the battle-dead to himself. And so, too, onthe mortal plane, a Viking warrior could devote the entire legion of the oppos-ing enemy to Odin by hurling a spear over their heads with the words, “Odinpossess you all!”83As is so often implied in the Greek Iliad,especially when agod is involved directly in the battle, death becomes, in this way, sacrificialdeath.The spear not only whistles over the heads of those whom Odin chooses; itpierces their flesh. In order to gain the hope of Valh÷oll, to “go to Odin,” one hadto mark oneself before death with the god’s sign—that is, receive a ceremonialcut from the point of a spear, thus symbolically avoiding a natural death.84Inchapter 9 of Ynglingasaga,where the euhemerized Odin is a mortal king of theSwedes, he has himself marked with a spear point so that he would go directlyto the world of the gods (Godheimr). Later, the god Njord also dies of disease,but lets himself be wounded for dedication to Odin before he dies. Odin’s ritualaction on Yggdrasill is thus illumined. “It was appropriate that Odin, as hehung on the tree, should be stabbed with his own weapon.”85In a pattern thatwe have already observed, since the spear belongs to Odin, so does the sacrifi-cial wounding by the spear. The spear wound “belongs” to Odin and thus he in-flicts it onhimselfforhimself.An equally efficient but even worthier form of Odinic sacrifice was death byhanging oneself; the hero Hadingus did this.86Again, the familiar hermeneuticalparadox emerges: Although historians of religion might perceive that in themyth the chief of the gods emulates human cult practice, the Norse saw such sui-cide as emulation of Odin’s sacred act. A poet of the mid-tenth century calledOdin “lord of the gallows” (gálga valdr)87and “god of the hanged” (hangaty ́r,hangagod).88But the skalds also knew him as a victim of the gallows; he wascalled Hangi (the hanged)89and “the load of the gallows.”90The center panel of a224the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"memorial stone from Lärbro Stora Hammars in Gotland shows a warrior aboutto be traditionally hanged from a tree (no.

As Pálsson and Edwards render the story,“They tried divination to find out when the wind would be favourable and weretold Odin expected a human sacrifice from the army, the victim to be chosen bylot. So they drew lots throughout the army and every time, King Vikar’s lot cameup. They were all very shaken by this, and it was decided that all their leadingmen should have a meeting the following day to consider the problem.”92Starkadr was awakened the same night by his foster-father Hrosshársgrani(Horse-hair-bearded), who rowed him in the dark to a neighboring island.There the hero encountered eleven men sitting on chairs. As Hrosshársgranisat down in the empty twelfth chair, others greeted him by the name of Odin.Starkadr understood that he was in the presence of the assembly of the gods.He was then condemned with conflicting destinies by the assembly of gods.Thor, who had been rejected by Starkadr’s father’s mother for a giant, saidthat the hero’s race would die with him; Odin, to counter Thor’s curse, gavehim three lifespans. Thor cursed him to do a dastardly deed during each one ofthose spans. Odin said Starkadr would have splendid weapons and treasures inplenty; Thor said he would never own land. Odin gave Starkadr the gift of po-etry, creating verse as easily as normal speech; Thor swore that he would not re-member a line of his verse. Odin said that his protégé would be prized by noblemen; Thor, that he would be despised by the commonality.93As Hrosshárs-grani and Starkadr returned to their boat, they took up the question of the sac-rifice of Víkarr.“Then you will send King Vikar to me,” said Grani Horsehair. “I’ll tellyou how to go about it.”Starkad agreed, and Grani Horsehair gave him a spear which hesaid would appear to be only a reed-stalk. Then they joined the rest ofthe army, just a little before daybreak.In the morning the king’s counselors held a meeting to discusstheir plans. They agreed that they would have to hold a mock sacri-fice, and Starkad told them how to set about it. There was a pine treenearby and close to it a tall tree trunk. The pine tree had a slenderbranch just above the ground, but stretching up into the foliage. Justthen the servants were making breakfast. A calf had been slaughteredand its entrails cleaned out. Starkad asked for the guts, then climbedup the trunk, bent down the slender branch and tied the calf gutsaround it.“Your gallows is ready for you now, my lord,” he said to KingVikar, “and it doesn’t seem too dangerous. Come over here and I’llput a noose round your neck.”“If this contraption isn’t any more dangerous than it looks,” saidthe king, “then it can’t do me much harm. But if things turn out oth-erwise, it’s in the hands of fate.”After that he climbed up the stump. Starkad put the noose roundhis neck and climbed down. Then he stabbed the king with the reed-stalk. “Now I give you to Odin,” he said.226the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"At that Starkad let loose the branch. The reed-stalk turned into aspear which pierced the king, the tree stump slipped from under hisfeet, the calf guts turned into a strong withy, the branch shot up withthe king into the foliage, and there he died.

In remorse, he fledH÷ordaland to Uppsala, where he served the Yngling kings Alrekr and Eiríkr. Hegrew moody and silent.The parallels between the horrible story of Víkarr—in which the god en-sures that he will not be denied his chosen victim—and that of Odin in agonyupon Yggdrasill are clear. Both victims, human and divine, are simultaneouslystabbed with a spear and hanged in a tree. The verb gefa,mentioned at the be-ginning, is the operant sacrificial term of dedication in both accounts. Odinsays he was “given to Odin, myself to myself ” (gefinn Ódni, sjálfr sjálfum mer).Starkadr says, as he lunges at his king, “Now I give you to Odin” (nú gef ek thikÓdni).95The Víkarr story is germane to our inquiry in that it shows how andwhy Odin is sacrificed as he is. As Turville-Petre writes, “the highest sacrifice toÓdinn of which we have read in this world was that of King Víkarr, for not onlywas he hanged and pierced, but he was also a king. But a still higher sacrificemust be that of the king of the gods, swinging in the wind from a tree andgashed with a spear.”96The god’s story has become the founding sacrifice; thestory itself derives from cultic reality, the practiced sacrifice. However, withinthe framework of religious understanding, the cultic reality is aetiologically an-chored in the distant past, a divine precedent.The Gallows: The World TreeThe Lärbro Stora Hammars stone shows its victim hanging from a tree. LikeVíkarr, Odin hung from a tree and not a gibbet. But Odin’s gallows was theWorld Tree. Yggdrasill, the primordial cosmic axis, is called an ash in the po-ems, although it also seems to have qualities of the sacred evergreen, the yew;it supports the worlds of the universe, which number, according to varying tra-ditions, three or nine. In his 1996 study on the world pillar in circumpolar re-ligions, Åke Hultkranz presents the main shared features of this archetype:[T]he world tree, a symbolic representation of the sacred centre of theworld,...an axis that measures the three main rooms of the world(and their subdivisions in a great plurality of rooms): heaven, earth,and the underworld. The tree runs through all these worlds, and is ameans of communications between them, sued by spirits andshamans. In Siberia shamans may have their own trees which arerepresentatives of this world tree, and which they may climb. Some-times the tree is marked to indicate seven, nine, or up to thirty levelsinthesky....The tree is often crowned by a bird, usually an eagle“myself to myself”227"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"(like the Russian imperial double eagle in Siberia, the thunderbird inNorth America).97According to The Poetic Edda’sGrímnismál(st. 31), the roots of Yggdrasill reachinto three worlds: J ̈÷otunheimr, the home of the giants; Hel,the realm of thedead; and Midgardr, the human dwelling-place, created by the gods for peoplefrom the eyebrows of the primal giant Ymir.98Snorri Sturluson offers a differentversion in Gylfaginning,chapter 15, where he says that the tree has one root inthe sky, among the Æsir, in their home Ásgardr, where Valh÷oll was also found.Ásgardr is connected with the earth by the rainbow bridge Bifr÷ost, guarded bythe mysterious god Heimdallr, whose name also means “Pillar of the Earth.”The guards travel over Bifr÷ost to hold their daily courts at the earth’s center un-der the boughs of Yggdrasill.99Wrapped around the World Tree’s trunk, the ser-pent of Midgardr supports the cosmic structure, biting its own tail (Gylfaginningch. 34). If the serpent were to free himself, the universe would collapse.Beneath one of its roots is Mímir’s well, the well of wisdom, where Odin’seye was left on deposit. There is the well of fate (Urdarbrunnr), guarded by thethree Norns called Urdr, Ve rdandi, and Skuld (Fated, Happening, and What WillBe). The Norns pour mud and water from the Well of Fate on Yggdrasill’s roots.Under another root is a third well, Hvergelmir (Roaring Kettle?).100Yggdrasill ispopulated with other symbolic creatures: An eagle, “Swallower of Corpses,”lives at the top of the tree in the northern sky, and, via a squirrel who runs upand down the trunk, exchanges scathing messages with the serpent Nídh÷oggr,who lies coiled in its bottom roots.101It is not only Odin who suffers in theHávamál; the tree from which he hangs undergoes unceasing torment. Despiteits antiquity and centrality, Yggdrasill is “the ever-perishing tree.”102Grímnismálsays,The ash Yggdrasil endures hardshipMore than men can know,The hart bites its crown, its sides decay,The serpent Nidhogg tears its roots.At Ragnar÷ok, Nídh÷oggr will escape and devour Thor. Yggdrasill will shudderand creak.That the episode of Odin’s suspension in the World Tree was not an iso-lated or obscure myth in the Scandinavian hoard is clear from the very name ofthat tree. “Yggdrasill” is a poetic kenning. It literally means “Horse of Yggr”(Yggr,“the Terrible; the Inspirer of Awe,” is one of Odin’s many names; drasill,a common poetic word for “horse”). “Horse” was itself a common moniker ofthe gallows; hanged mortals were said said to “ride” it. So the earthly gallows isoften called, in a kenning, “Sigarr’s horse” (Sigars jór), alluding to the legend ofSigarr who hanged his daughter’s lover, Hagbardr. Men swing on the gallows,the verb rídameaning either “to ride” or “to swing.” So Sigvatr said, in a lay inmemory of St. Óláfr, “men ride to the world of death on Sigar’s horse.”103Yg -gdrasill is thus “the gallows of Odin,” which he rides by hanging upon it untodeath. Odin’s gallows is no less than the center-beam of the world.228the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"As a transmondial pillar, Yggdrasill is far from unique, as Neil Price ob-serves, since “the idea of a number of layered realms of existence linked by asingle axle is found in many northern aspects,”104from the Finno-Ugrian cul-tures of the Baltic to Finland to Siberia, with relationships to the Cane-of-the-Sky in Northwestern Canadian mythologies. “In Eurasian belief the tree is themedium by which the shaman travels from one world to another, climbing itstrunk to another plane of existence. Sometimes each world has its own tree...in examples with a single tree, the roots become especially important, and it isthese that the shaman follows on his or her journeys.”105And it is indeed at Yg-gdrasill’s roots, extending into all of the extraterrestrial worlds, that the primor-dial shaman Odin searches for the runes, runes that when cut and colored canmake dead men walk and talk, as in Hávamál157:That twelfth I know,if on tree I seea hanged one hoisted on high:Thus I writeand the runes I stainthat down he dropsand tells me his tale.106The implications of Yggdrasill in relationship to its “family tree” for the exege-sis of the Hávamálepisode are clear: It is not the Christian crucifix, but rather acosmic conduit of communication between worlds whose heritage and fea-tures are central to many circumpolar religions, intimately bound up withshamanic ordeal, initiation, and access to supernatural realms of knowledge.Master of the Runes and Mantic WisdomThe aspect of the gnomic account of the self-immolation of Odin upon Yggdrasillthat is perhaps the most powerful countertype to the passion narrative of Jesus isnot a particular cultic feature but rather its voluntary nature. In both cases, thedivine figure autonomously offers himself up for an ultimate purpose. Christsurrenders himself to God, his father, whom liturgical tradition addresses in theEucharistic rite: “He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself,in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.”107Jesus offershimself to God for the sake of the whole world, and in one predominating strandof meaning, to atone for its sins as a blood-sacrifice after the prototype of thePaschal lamb.But what of Odin? The Norse god not only endures as a victim but himselfinaugurates the nine nights’ ordeal on Yggdrasill. Like Christ, he is sacrificerand sacrificed. Yet the Hávamálpassage makes clear Odin’s motives, which arequite different from those of Christ. There can be no doubt that the Norse un-derstanding of sacrifice was a classic one: do ut des. Hávamál145 says that a giftalways looks for its return, warning that it is wise not to pester the gods withtoo much sacrifice. Odin, too, looks for his return in his autosacrifice.A relentless seeker after occult wisdom, Yggr hung on his tree-horse in or-der to “grasp the runes.” And he succeeded. After nine nights of fasting and“myself to myself”229"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"suffering, he gained the magical runes and their associated knowledge, notonly for himself but also for human beings. The letters of the runic alphabetare known as the creation of Odin, who according to the historicizing narrativeof chapters 6–7 of the Ynglingasaga,is the master of all magic.108“When Ása-Óthin came to the Northlands, and the díarwith him, they introduced andtaught the skills practiced by men for a long time afterwards....[H]e knew thearts by which he could shift appearance and body any way he wished...[H]espoke so well and so smoothly that all who heard him believed all he said wastrue. All he spoke was in rimes, as is now the case in what is called skaldship.He and his temple priests are called songsmiths, because the art began withthem in the northern lands.”109Odin’s myths show him to be consistently willing to pay a terrific price forwhat he desperately wants. Odin is one-eyed because he wished to drink themead of the wellspring of the god Mímir and was forced to leave his eye on de-posit (Gylfaginningch. 15). According to the Heimskringla(Ynglingasaga4),Odin embalmed with herbs the head of Mímir, which the Vanir had severed inanger, to keep it as an oracle. Ynglingasaga7 gives a kind of shamanic aretalogyof Odin: “Ódinn had with him Mímr’s head, and it told him many tidings fromother worlds; and at times he would wake up dead men out of the ground or sitbeneath the hanged; from this he was called Lord of Ghosts or Lord of theHanged. He had two ravens, which he had endowed with the power of speech;they flew far over the land and told him many tidings. In this way he becamevery wise. And all these skills he taught with runes and those chants [ljód] thatare called galdrar; because of this the Æsir are called galdrasmídr[workers ofmagic].”110There are known to have been two kinds of magic in the Scandina-vian world: galdr,which were spells or incantations, just mentioned, and seidr,a kind of shamanistic spell that enables the practitioner to journey to distantcountries in another shape while the body remains unchanged, as well asaffording divinatory powers.111It is of no small import to the issues we areconsidering in this chapter that the ritualistic complexes of both blood sacrificeandseidrhave their origins among the gods, in the person of the great goddessFreyja: “The daughter of Nj÷ordr was Freyja; she was a blótgydja[priestess of sac-rifices]; she was the first to teach seidrto the Æsir, as it was practiced among theVanir.”112But it is the warrior god Odin who continues to practice seidr, this toxic arttaught to the gods by a goddess, and then to women; it is Odin who is most in-tensely identified with it: “Ódinn knew the skill from which follows the greatestpower, and which he performed himself, which is called seidr. By means of ithe could know the futures of men and that which had not yet happened, andalso cause death or misfortune or sickness, as well as take men’s wits orstrength from them and give it to others.”113“But,” Ynglingasagawarns,this sorcery brings with it so much ergi[wickedness] that manly menthought it shameful to perform, and so this skill was taught to priest-esses [gydjur]....Ód ́inn knew everything about treasures hidden in230the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"the earth, where they were concealed, and he knew such chants [ljód]that would open up for him the earth and mountains and stones andburial mounds, and with words alone he bound those who dwelled inthem, and went in and took what he wanted....Most of these skillshe taught to those in charge of the sacrifices [blótgodi]; they were nextto him in magical knowledge [fródleikr] and sorcery [fj÷olkyngi]. Butmany others learned much of it, and for this reason sorcery[fj÷olkyngi] was widespread and continued for a long time.114Like the fallen angels of the apocryphal Jewish mystical text I Enoch, Odin isthus the divine source on earth of “dark arts,” and their teacher to humankind.Furthermore, as such he transgresses gender boundaries, being the suprememaster of a web of skills so nefarious that it can only be taught to women, asit would sully the honor and manliness of any man. According to stanzas148–163 of Hávamál, Odin can cast many spells that cure sickness, stop mis-siles as they fly, scatter witches, inspire hopeless love, and so forth.The wisdom for which Odin performs his autosacrifice is that which is re-fracted through poetry, the skill of the bards. In the episode of his hangingfrom the World Tree, the high god learned nine mighty songs (galdrar, themagical chants mentioned in Ynglingasaga7) from the son of B÷olthórr. He gota drink of the “precious mead,” that of poetry. Poetic genius is dependent onOdin, who is its source. It was he who boldly stole the mead of poetry from an-other world, made of the blood of the divinely created giant Kvasir, through aseries of theriomorphic antics.115Odin’s patronage of poetry, as we have said,may already be implicit in his name, if Dumézil is correct in translating the OldNorse term ódr as “inspired mental activity” beyond just reasoning intelli-gence.116The Germanic *Wodan[az] would then mean “master of inspiration.”As we have seen in Ynglingasaga6, Odin himself spoke in rhymes.The rúnarthat Odin grasps in Hávamál139 are almost certainly the runicletters and their attendant magical force; over 5,000 runic inscriptions havebeen found, including some with pictorial scenes from Odin’s lethal battle withthe wolf Fenrir at the Ragnar÷ok. It has been suggested that rúnarcomes from*r ̄uno ̄,a hypothetical Germanic word meaning “magic secret,” which also pre-sumably generated the word raunen, “to whisper.”117This is a derivation simi-lar to the word “mysteries” and “myth” from the Greek mAv, “to close one’s lipsor eyes”—the runes would then bear in their name the thought of a covert mes-sage. However, Richard Morris argues for a suggestion made a century ago,whereby rúnmay be related to dialect terms for “cut.”118As archaeological evidence now seems to show, runes were used not onlyfor magic (hence inscribed in media such as stone that would survive) butalso for trade and other everyday use, as the excavations of the wharf area inBergen show. Their magico-religious use remains unclear; they may havebeen used for healing as well as for incantation. The signs used for divinationin Tacitus’s account of the first century C.E.(Germania10) may already havebeen runes.119He reports that from a number of sticks from a nut-bearingtree, scored with special signs and held in a white cloth, three were selected.“myself to myself”231"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"The oracle’s meaning was derived from the signs scored on the three chosensticks by a priest if the issue was public in nature, and by the head of the house-hold if it was private.The runes may have their origin in Denmark, although most runologistslook to the classical alphabets of the Mediterranean.120There is no evidence ofthe earliest runic development; some linguists believe that they must havebeen invented quickly by an individual or a group. The twenty-four-characterrunic alphabet, divided into three groups of eight, was called the futharkafterthe first six. Runes can be documented as early as 200 C.E., with the earliestrunic inscriptions appear on small objects such spearheads, buckles, amulets,and horns. By the fourth century C.E., they were being chiseled on stone, espe-cially in Norway. They were in use for over a millennium.But for the early Scandinavians, the runes came from the gods, as stated bythe Swedish stone of Noleby, carved around 600 C.E. Runic inscriptions do notmention Odin as the inventor of runes, as does the poetry of Hávamál138–139andSigdrífumál3. However, he is the supreme magician of Old Norse religion;the runes, whenever they were invented, would surely have almost immedi-ately been gathered into his domain.121For the skalds themselves, the story ofOdin’s discovery and appropriation of the wondrous runes extended the um-brella of his theurgical patronage. It thus enhanced the power whence the poetsderived their authority. Small wonder that the story of Odin’s howling grasp ofthe runes is known only in ancient poetic lays.The Fruits of Sacrifice: Access to the Wisdom of the DeadThe runes are found below; Odin must look downward (nidr) to seize them.They are the treasure of the underworld, where the unknown roots of Yg-gdrasill run. In grasping the runes, Odin gains another, greater prize: the wis-dom of the dead. He cannot leave them alone. In Baldr’s Dreams(Baldrs Drau-mar), an elaboration of the Baldr episode in the V ̈olupsa, he wakes the “hoaryseeress” to find out what she can tell him of the horrible future of his son:Then Óthin rodeto the eastern gate,Where the hoary seeress’howe [mound=grave] he knew,There spells he chantedto charm up the dead,Till unwilling arosethe witch and spake:What man is this,to me unknown,Who maketh me faresuch fear-fraught ways?Was I buried in snowand beaten by rainAnd drenched with dew,dead was I long.122His obsession with the dead, particularly with the hanged, is a recurrenttheme in the literary sources. He sends his ravens to seek them out. Rather thanletting them swing in peace, he goes to them in person using incantations, and232the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"wakes them up for a ghoulish chat. In Hávamál157, as we have seen, Odinshows a special relationship to those who populated the gallows: If he sees ahanged man above him, the hanged god, cutting the runes, could converse withhim. Similarly, Heimskringlasays that Odin “would call to life dead men out ofthe ground, or he would sit down under men who were hanged.”123A poet of theeleventh century confirms this habit, calling him “visitor of the hanged” (hangaheimthingadr).124Why this intense interest in the dead? The ancient Norse prized inspira-tion from the dead within the earth. As “Lord of the Ghouls” and “Lord of theHanged,” Odin’s quest for their occult wisdom is the paradigmatic expressionof this idea. However, it does not start with him. There is some evidence thatnew kings were invested on the tombs of their ancestors; for example, “manyburial mounds had flat tops, as though they were intended to be used for pub-lic ceremonies. Mounds of the Migration Period sometimes had ancient stand-ing stones or carved stone balls placed on them. The burial place of the kings atUppsala was also the place of the local assembly.”125Scattered references in lit-erature tell of kings and seers sitting on burial mounds, perhaps to claim theauthority or title of the former king, but also to seek inspiration.126In a tantalizing conjunction of themes, the writings of a Christian bishopin the Northlands suggest that Odin had learned the art of poetry from thehanged themselves. Early in the thirteenth century, Bishop Bjarni Kolbeinssonavers,I did not grow wise under waterfalls,I never dabbled in magic;by no means did I learnthe prize of Ygg (the art of poetry)under the hanged.127Thus, by undergoing death himself, Odin was in the company of the dead, andat the heart of their occult wisdom. What better way to gain it? As Turville-Petrenotes, “Odinn, swinging on the tree of the world, was in the company of thedead, sharing the wisdom which only they possess. But this is nearly the sameas to say that the god himself was dead. If wisdom could be won from a deaddelinquent swinging from the gallows, how much more could be gained fromOdinn after he passed through the world of death.”128W. Brede Kristensen believed that it was through Odin’s literal and salvificdeath that he was able to resurrect the runes. “The dying Odin...brings super-human or magical power out of the depths (‘sought below’) up into our world(‘and lifted up the runes’). By means of divine death men have obtained powerover death; they have gained health and salvation.”129It was Odin’s son Hermódrwho, riding his father’s horse, descended into Hel to bring back his brother Baldr.The self-sacrifice of Odin is widely seen as an initiation ritual; it may in-clude elements of ecstasy or trance, such as seem to appear in the ritual of thesorceress, also a nine-day vigil, described in the twelfth-century Sólarljód(Song“myself to myself”233"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"of the Sun). In this hard-won solar vision, though, the subject ascends, “raisedup on a horse,” whereas Odin’s directionality is down:On the chair of the nornirI sat nine days,Then I was raised up on a horse,The giantesses’ sunShone grimlyFrom the cloud-dripper’s clouds.130Shamanic practices in Finnish lore, which involve a nine-days’ nonlethal sus-pension in a birch tree, have also been raised as convincing parallels to Há-vamál.131Van Hamel compares Odin’s fasting to the importance of fasting inIrish legends, which confers mystical fortification on those who practice itagainst enemy powers.132The goal of these rituals was extraterrestrial experi-ence, not actual death. Nevertheless, the model of ceremonial initiation wouldperforce carry with it the idea of a symbolic death followed by a rebirth and anew identity. There is no evidence of such mysteries in the Old Norse literarysources.133Nor are there certain typical circumpolar shamanistic practices as-sociated with Odin, such as drumming or healing, although others surely arepresent in his quest for esoteric knowledge, ecstasy, self-mutilation, shape-shifting, association with magical animals, or traffic with the dead and otherspirits. Possible influences by (or independently emerging parallelisms with)Siberian shamanism upon Old Norse religion have been carefully consideredfor decades.134So has the role of the heavily shamanistic and sacrificial tradi-tions of the Sámi (Lapps), including their pantheon, powerful animism, “liv-ing” topography, ritualized forms of hunting and warfare, and particularly therelationship of the extensive Sámi magical complex (noaidevuohta) to Norseseidr(and therefore its paradigmatic practitioner, Odin), charted by Håkan Ryd-ving and Åke Hultkrantz.135But did Odin actually die in his ordeal? Did he undergo the sacrificial deathof his own cult? Hávamáldoes not tell us that Odin dies, as he most certainlydoes at the apocalypse of the Ragnar÷ok, foretold in the V ̈oluspá. Rather, the re-sult of Odin’s experience is his effective flourishing:141. Then I began to be fruitfuland to be fertile,to grow and to prosper;one word soughtanother word from me;one deed soughtanother deed from me.There is no mention of a death or a resurrection in these verses. Yet fertil-ity, blessedness, and prosperity are the ubiquitous gift of the death, of a god ora hero, from the slain and reborn wine-god Dionysos, to the civic boon of thebody of the dying Oedipus at the grove at Colonus, to Jesus’s metaphor of the234the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"grain of wheat in John 12:24,136to the European cathedral imagery of the GreenMan, disgorging vegetation from his mouth, who watches over the bier of theChrist soon to rise.The Meaning of Odin’s SacrificeVíkarr’s story reveals that if Odin’s victims were both gashed with a spear andhanged at once, the ritual through which they were offered was more complete.The god himself is pierced with a spear and hung. Therefore Odin’s autosacri-fice is perfectly performed. He hangs on his own “super-gallows,” the cosmicYggdrasill, a mondial axis, in an agony which Jaan Puhvel has called “the‘supreme mystery’ of Germanic theology, Odin’s primordial self-sacrifice onthe world tree.”137As recipient of hanged sacrifices, Odin sacrifices himself in precisely thesame fashion that human and animal sacrifices are made to him. He thus be-comes the supreme exemplar of his own cultus. “This is partly a validationmyth wherein the god as the founding initiate ‘charters’ a centerpiece of hisown cult, namely the sacrifice (including self-immolation) by hanging andstabbing that was practiced by his votaries.”138SinceHávamálcannot be dated any earlier than the ninth century C.E. (de-spite the fact that it has much inherited material that is centuries older), it is en-tirely possible that some kind of paradigmatic dialogue was going on betweenthe two religious competitors for the Northlands. If that were the case, however,the episode may not be so much derivative from as it is responsive to the Chris-tian theological challenge. It is equally possible that the passage represents thepure reinforcement of Odin’s own cult by Odin himself in the pre-Christianimagination. Beyond their apparent cultic similarities, there is good reason thatthe Odin of the Speech of the High One has been compared to the Gospels’Christ. “The sacrifice of Ódinn to himself may thus be seen as the highest con-ceivable form of sacrifice, in fact so high that, like many a religious mystery, itsurpasses our comprehension. It is the sacrifice, not of king to god, but of god togod, of such a kind as is related in Scripture of the sacrifice of Christ.”139A god’ssacrifice to himself (and there can be no doubt of the identity of the recipientin the Norse poem) possesses an ultimacy that shatters sacrificial norms and re-defines sacrifice itself.140As we have seen so often, this particular form of sacri-fice belongs to Odin, as does death itself. That he therefore undergoes thissacrifice and, perhaps, death itself is not rational; but it is absolutely true toOdin’s divine nature. Odin defines his cult through offering himself; offeringhimself, he expresses his own nature. As Kristensen writes, “Here the ‘I havehung myself upon the tree as a sacrifice to Myself ’ is thus a self-consecration, aself-sacrifice; the offering is the god himself. ‘Death’ on this tree is the actualiza-tion of absolute life, of which this tree is the bearer.”141In the case of Odin, interest attending divine sacrifice—sacrifice rituallyperformed by a god—has taken a new twist. According to this view, Odin can-not possibly sacrifice himself unless Norse mythology has been influenced by“myself to myself”235"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Christianity, and Odin is actually Christ. However, the evidence of the historyof religions suggest otherwise. Odin’s hanging, his wounding with a spear, hisgallows-tree, his nine nights, the voluntary and autonomous nature of his ac-tion and even his use of the verb “to give” all point in one direction: back toOdin himself, and to his worship as attested in other religious art and OldNorse literature.This is a view that is now generally accepted; however, I would suggest thatthe reasons for the earlier equation of Odin and Christ include, but also mayextend beyond, the historical Christianization of Scandinavia. The self-sacrificeof Christ is the only instance of divine reflexivity with which late-nineteenth-century Western scholars such as Bugge and his early-twentieth-century fol-lowers were familiar and to which, in a sense, they were theologically reconciled.Hence, they were not willing to extend that theological paradigm independentlyto Odin. In fact, the similarities of Odin’s sacrifice to the crucifixion are due notto syncretistic amalgam, but rather to the nature of divine reflexivity itself—especially, to the intimate involvement of the deity with his or her own cult.236the wider indo-european world"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"part iiiThe Peoples of the BookMonotheism and Divine Ritual"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"IntroductionThe Special Interpretive Challenge of Divine Ritual in MonotheismSacrifice to whom, if they arethe gods? Pray to whom, if he isGod?The supreme power can worship; is conceived of as worshiping. Thequestion of where the gods orient their religious acts may be irrele-vant in that it applies human categories to divine subjects. I arguethat from the standpoint of the traditions where these phenomena ap-pear, they are best understood as an expression of original essenceand power. The facile interpretation of “anthropomorphism” does notbest illumine the sacrificing or ritualizing god. Rather, as I have ar-gued, the shared idea is that the divine influences the human realmand expresses itself by generating human religious practices. “An-thropomorphic ideas of deity signify theomorphic ideas of man.”1Karl Rahner’s theological method, which “declares all theologicalstatements to be inherently anthropological and vice versa”2may ap-ply here: “As soon as man is understood as that being which has ab-solute transcendence toward God..., then anthropocentricity andtheocentricity in theology are not contradictories but strictly one andthe same thing seen from two different aspects, and each aspect isunintelligible without the other.”3Divine reflexivity describes a piv-otal religious idea that has remained largely unintelligible, at least inthe Abrahamic monotheistic traditions. As we have seen, clear ana-logues to the Greek sacrificing gods exist in other Indo-European tra-ditions. But worshiping gods are not confined to ancient polytheisms.Forms of religious behavior by the supreme being in monotheistictraditions can range from sacrifice to prayer to the use of ritual im-plements or clothing to reading and interpretation of scripture.In turning from “polytheistic” to “monotheistic” religions, weleave behind those traditions that acknowledge a plethora of universalentities, which are often related to one another through genealogy or"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"hierarchies of power. We enter a thought-world in which there is only onesupreme deity who lacks human form or attributes, although this has remainednot only a constant telos but a point of oscillation and bitter contestation—inthe efforts of the ancient Israelite writers of the Pentateuch to downplay God’sancient Near Eastern role in the earliest texts as the supreme god in the coun-cil of other gods, for example; in the Protestant Reformation rejection of theveneration of saints; in formative Islamic repudiation of the doctrine of theChristian Trinity as can be read in the mosaic inscription in the interior of theDome of the Rock in Jerusalem or in Wahhabi polemics against the perceivedmultiplicity of Muslim worship at dargahs in India or in Africa. Instances of di-vine reflexivity in monotheistic religious traditions de factoimply deep ten-sions, in that to ascribe ritual to God seems an extreme form of anthropomor-phism and seems to dis-articulate his unified being.The charge of “absurdity” made by Cleombrotus in De defectu oraculorumabout the story of Apollo’s need to offer expiatory libations to purify himself af-ter the slaughter of the Python draws its theological power from the idea of the in-appropriateness of a god’s sacrifice. Even within polytheistic systems, as we haveseen, the ontological separateness of the gods from human limitations is pre-served and upheld, in some cases extending to the philosophical critique of di-vinely performed ritual. How can a god bear the exigency of ritual requirement?In monotheism the stakes may be higher. All of the Abrahamic traditions havehistorically resisted the circumscription of God’s uniqueness and power; ritual,in that it both expresses and reiterates the quintessentially subordinate relation-ship of human being to god, cannot be an act of God. Yet another paradox im-mediately presents itself: God’s agency is illimitable. No act is impossible forGod, even a ritual act that on its face compromises his omnipotence.I will examine examples of this phenomenon in the so-called Peoples ofthe Book, to borrow an Islamic designation for Judaism and Christianity. I in-clude Islam itself under the umbrella of the phrase, since the centrality of theQur›a ̄n inspired in that tradition a respect for its scripturally founded predeces-sors. In these traditions God is not “lord of lords” (even though, as for examplein the case of ancient Israelite religion where God was el elohı ̄m,a case can andhas been made for an evolution in religious texts to monotheism from a morepolytheistic background) but is rather unquestionably supreme and unique.God’s uniqueness makes it all the more problematic when scripture, art, orsong represent him as engaged in ritual activity, that is, apparently worshiping.Whereas in ancient Greece, Iran, India, or perhaps even in the Norse world,we can still make a reasonable case that the gods themselves might worshiptheir own ancestors, or perhaps another order of gods worthy of worship (per-haps because they are older then the present order of gods, like the Titans or theSa ̄dhyas, or angrier than them, like the Erinyes), in the case of monotheismthere is no such recourse. This is pure divine reflexivity, whereby the ritual ac-tion of the Supreme Being cannot possibly be construed as redounding uponany other entity than God’s own self.Several elements unite the following cases. Crucial is the great significanceattached to the preservation and continuation of the believing community.240the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"I will argue that this significance, in fact, precipitates the appearance in eachtradition of an “observant God.” Monotheistic traditions, like certain polytheis-tic ones, have tried to show ritualized activities such as the study of scriptureand prayer in groups as central to piety; they have tried to sublimate sacrifice orto abolish it, and sought to establish prayer as a foundational action of the faith.To validate a specific ritual action, all three traditions portray God himself asobservant and pious—as practicing that ritual. God is not free of religious obli-gations! In the talmudic passages involving God’s worship, we see ritual super-seding expected theology: God reads Torah, prays, and wears both prayer shawland phylacteries. Prayer (s.ala ̄t) in Islam is public intercession; along with hisangels, God is said in the Qur›a ̄n to pray for the Prophet and thus establishesthe cultic basis for the s.alawa ̄t,the blessings on Muhammad, who will then in-tercede for the one who prays. This is paradigmatic and generative action, butcan we rightly call it “anthropomorphic,” even as analysis.As we will see, God’s prayer or other forms of worship in these mono-theisms are both like and very unlike human worship; the religion of theobservant Godhead has unique characteristics that mark it clearly and self-consciously as divine, as “other” than ritual writ larger.Christian Sacrificial Theology and Self-ReferentialityPerhaps the most complex case of divinely performed ritual is found in Chris-tianity. In positing both the internal relationships of the Trinity and the liturgicaloperations of the Eucharist, ancient Christian theology draws its strength froma rich conflation of sacrificial roles. Two principal “diagrams” of sacrificial hier-archy emerge from an examination of the historical tradition. They are equallyimportant, not only to this inquiry but also to the structure of Christianity itself.They reveal that God himself has a dual nature, both as deity receiving the vol-untary sacrifice of Christ, and—more darkly and problematically—as sacrificer.The tradition of the crucifixion as refracted not only through the Gospelsbut through patristic, medieval, and modern exegesis represents an autosacri-fice: Christ, as the willing victim offers himself up; this one-time sacrifice isreiterated in the cultic reenactment of the Eucharist. In the Gospel texts of theLast Supper that have become foundational for the Eucharist, Christ is cast in aproto-priestly role. He controls the action, as for example, in the account inMatthew:Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it,and gave it to the disciples and said, “Take, eat, this is my body.” And hetook a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying,“Drink of it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is pouredout for many for the forgiveness of sins(toPto garDstin tbaQmamoy tpßdiauakhß tbperBpollv∆nDkxynnamenon eDßgfesincmartiv∆n).”4The “pouring out” of Christ’s blood, a translation of a form of the koine ̄verbDkxAai, is a crucial idea underscoring the voluntariness of his death. It carriesintroduction241"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"with it the ancient idea of the emptying of the precious contents of vessel in theservice of some higher objective. In Philipians 2:6–7, Christ is praised as one“who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thingto be grasped, but emptied himself (dllbCaytbnDkAnvsen), taking the formof a servant, being born in human likeness.” The verb used in this instance isDkAnvsen, a form of kenav, “to empty, deprive of power.” It is used in the Sep-tuagint translation of Genesis 24:20, when Rachel “quickly emptied(DjekAnvsen,Hebrewwatt\\ar kaddah) her vessel into the trough” so that Isaac’s servant andhis camels could drink. The Hebrew verb translated by DjekAnvsenin the Gen-esis passage is \\arah,having the sense of “to empty, to expose or strip.”In the Synoptic Gospels, the Gospel of John, the Epistles, and in patristicliterature, explicit typological parallels are drawn between the efficacious blood-shed of Christ and a number of paradigmatic sacrifices in Hebrew scriptures.5Identifications are made between the mediating sacrifice of Christ and: first,the covenantal sacrifice between God and Moses at Mt. Sinai (Heb. 9:18–21);second, the expiatory and apotropaic blood of the paschal lamb (Jn. 19:31; 1 Cor.5:7)—this is explicitly worked out by Melito, bishop of Sardis, in the secondcentury, and later by Gregory Nazienzus, OrationI; third, the expiatory orcleansing sacrifice of a goat or heifer outside the camp for purification (Heb.13:11–12); fourth, the sacrifice of one goat on the Day of Atonement, whoseblood was sprinkled in the very heart of the sanctuary, the Holy of Holies, topurify it; and fifth, the driving out of another into the wilderness as a propitia-tory offering to Azazel, the prince of demons—in the Epistle of Barnabas, forexample, Christ is portrayed as the exile, the scapegoat.In the Epistle to the Hebrews, Christ is seen in specifically sacrificial termsas both the new High Priest replacing the High Priest of the temple, and as thenew victim, whose sacrifice both replaced and transcended the daily offering(tamid) at the temple on behalf of the Hebrew people (Heb. 7:26–27): “He hasno need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins,and then for those of the people; he did this once for all when he offered uphimself.”6This sublimation is most emphatically set out in the highly stylized, sym-bolic message of Hebrews, but it also informed actual liturgical interpretation ofthe Eucharist from the beginning. The sacrifice of Jesus offered the “surety of abetter covenant” (Heb. 7:22). Heavenly worship, the liturgy, is established byGod himself: “We have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand ofthe throne of the Majesty in heaven, a liturgist (leitourgos) in the sanctuary andtrue tabernacle which is set up not by man but by the Lord” (Heb. 8:1). In post-Pauline trinitarian doctrine, Christ as “a high priest forever after the order ofMelchizedek” was also understood as God incarnate.7In the Eucharist, then,God is sacrificing himself, as W. Brede Kristensten argues; “on the altar thedivine sacrificial death is again and again repeated and actualized. The bread isthe body of Christ which is sacrificed and consecrated. The meaning of the di-vine sacrificial death is indicated even more clearly when the human sacrificerdisappears. The idea behind this rite is that God sacrifices Himself. But at this242the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"point the realm of cultus is left behind, and we enter the realm of religious mythor credal formulation.”8Kristensen can be contested on one point: The realm of cultus is not left be-hind in the case of the self-sacrificing deity, but is rather amplified by the Chris-tian doctrine of the ritual sacrifice of God by himself. God provides his own giftsto himself, which the congregation returns to him at the offering of the com-munion. This sacrificial circularity is even more explicit in the Order of Prepa-ration preceding John Chrysostom’s fourth-century Eucharistic liturgy, still usedthroughout the Eastern Orthodox Church, where the priest, acting as Christ, ac-tually “crucifies” the Lamb—the bread of the Eucharistic host—at the impera-tive of the deacon, by cutting it partially through horizontally “so as to form across.”9He then pierces it, reenacting the piercing of Jesus’s side by a soldier’sspear as described in John 19:34.This reflexive sacrificial conflation—the priest as both crucifier and as Christ,Christ as both sacrificial victim and High Priest of his own autosacrifice—isreflected in a Byzantine iconic type traditionally located in the niche of thesanctuary of an Eastern Orthodox church. Christ, served by angels as deacons,is shown holding the Eucharistic cup and administering communion to theApostles with the spoon (used in Eastern churches for communicants of anyage). Here, in cultic time, the icon represents an eternal image of the heavenlyliturgy paralleled by the earthly liturgy enacted below. Constantine Kalokyrisdescribes this as follows:An attempt to make perceivable that which is mystically enacted inworship is also the purpose of the representation of the DivineLiturgy in the niche of the Sanctuary, where Christ is representedCeroyrgpnCaytbn(officiating over Himself ) as He transmits HisBody and Blood to the Apostles....Because the priest repeats by theliturgical act that which is enacted in Heaven by the Great HierarchChrist, this ideal performance of the Divine Liturgy in Heaven is rep-resented in the niche as a more perceivable expression of it in thescene in which the Lord receives the Sacred Gifts carried with fear bythe angels dressed as deacons.10At the climactic moment of the Eucharistic liturgy, `the cantor (or congrega-tion, taking the cantor’s part) sings, TbSbDktmnSmnSiÔ o prosfAromen—“Weoffer You these gifts, which are Your own.”11The sacrifice of the Eucharist is agift offered by the collective, mystical Body of Christ, the congregation, back tothe original owner. And at the same time, it is understood as a self-offering andself-actualization by God, of the kind later exegeted by the neo-Platonic SyrianChristian mystic Dionysios the Areopagite: “The cause of all things, by a beau-tiful and good love of all, through an excess of loving goodness, comes to beoutside himself by the providences of all beings...and from being above alland transcending all is brought down to being in all.”12Christian liturgical “ac-tion” cannot be understood without the positing of multivalent reciprocity,whose theurgic efficacy is at its core reflexive.13introduction243"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Aqedah and CrucifixionThe idea of divine reflexivity does not confine itself, however, to Christ as di-vinized victim or as divine autosacrificer, whom Origen compares in his Hom-ilies on Leviticus(3) to the Levitical priest consuming the meat of the sin-offering. There are strong indications that the aqedah also drives the passionnarratives. God sacrifices his yah.id,his beloved child. In Genesis 22:9–14, He-brew scripture reveals a deity who provides his own animal victim as a substi-tute for Isaac. God mandates a sacrifice, and then permits the eleventh-hourrescue of Abraham’s son. But by providing the substitute animal victim, God ineffect sacrifices to himself, with Abraham as the agent. The crucifixion ofChrist seems to complete the story. Jesus replaces Isaac as the unthinkable,and therefore most precious victim—the firstborn son. God replaces Abrahamas reluctant and yet devoted parent, able to withstand this, the ultimate test offaith.14Modeled on the Hebrew story of the aqedah, the elaborated crucifixion por-trays the Supreme Diety as sacrificer by his allowing, once and for all in history,the supreme act of sacrifice in Canaanite, Phoenician, and Israelite cultures: theslaughter of the firstborn, for which we have archaeological evidence fromCarthage and Canaan. Jon Levenson points to Jesus’s alleged lineage, his statusof sonship and chosenness, and his sacrificial-seeming death and its interpreta-tion.15Both in casting Jesus as the new Isaac, the son of God sacrificed by Godand to God, and especially ironically, in its supersessionism toward Judaism,Christian theology reacted, however “unconsciously,” in the ancient terms of aJewish archetype: the replacement of the older son by the younger and the lat-ter’s necessary destruction and restoration.In the Christian reformulation of the aqedah, God offers his own son tohimself on behalf of his created beings, who have fallen into sin, thus validatesand redeems his own universe through a cultic action. As Levenson has showninThe Death and Resurrection of the Beloved Son, because of its setting during thePassover season, the crucifixion attracts the aqedah story, with Isaac the willingvictim and Abraham the sacrificer. Furthermore, the daily sacrifices in the Tem-ple and the Eucharist are intended to recall the main sacrificial events in bothreligions—the binding of Isaac on the one hand and the death of Jesus on theother.16Jesus becomes the victim, and God himself the sacrificer. The parallelsof the crucifixion to the aqedah were commented on extensively in patristic lit-erature, as for example, in the second-century Epistle to Barnabas, where Isaac’slife is portrayed in Christianity as a prototype for Jesus’s suffering.17Strong hints of this “autosacrifice” by God of his son are presented by earlyChristian writings within a context of theological necessity. In this way a philo-sophical foundation was laid for what clearly had the potential to appear ascruel and bizarre exigency.18Texts such as Romans 3:22–25 undeniably indi-cate God as the subject of the sacrifice of Christ (“For there is no distinction;since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, they are justified by his244the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"grace as a gift, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus, whom Godput forth as an expiation by His blood (fn proAueto c uebß Clastarion). Thesacrificial term hilast ̄erionis explicitly used in the Septuagint to translate thecovering cloth of the ark or mercy-seat that was sprinkled and thus purifiedwith blood on the Day of Atonement. In the same vein, the First Letter of John,4:9–10, states that “God sent his only son into the world so that we might livethrough him. In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and senthis son to be the atoning sacrifice (Clasmbn) for our sins.”19Several other pas-sages hint that the sacrifice of Jesus was inaugurated by God, but are not asexplicit—for example, John 3:16 (“For God so loved the world that he gave hisonly son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but should haveeternal life”), Romans 8:3–4, and Romans 8:32. Comments Levenson: “John’sstatement in 3:16 [is] that God gave his only begotten son in order to secure lifefor the believers...the underlying identification of Jesus as the son of God hasbrought about a refashioning of God in the image of the father who gives hisson in sacrifice. The father’s gift to God has been transformed into the gift ofGod the Father...the father’s motive is...like Abraham’s...a love greatereven than that of his beloved son.”20The interpretation of the motivation for God’s sacrifice is one of the mostcomplex of early Christian theological debates. Chrysostom’s s commentaryon the Epistle to the Hebrews clearly understands the sacrifice as a kind ofself-propitiation of an angry God: “He went up as a sacrifice which had powerto propitiate the Father.”21Contradicting himself, he then reverts to the modelof a more loving God, in keeping with Levenson’s emphasis. As FrancesYoung expresses it, “God’s love in surrendering his Son for the salvation of theworld is compared with Abraham giving up Isaac in sacrifice.” Origen, in adifferent theology privileging the category of ransom over that of propitiation,offers a picture of Christ’s death as aversion of the devil: “The slain lamb ofGod is made, according to certain mysterious principles, a purification for thewhole world...according to the Father’s love to man, he submitted to deathpurchasing us back by his own blood from the devil who had got us in hispower.”22The tension implicit in the fundamentally inconsistent theological ideas ofthe crucifixion as self-propitiation to appease God’s wrath or self-sacrifice to avertthe devil was, argues Gustaf Aulén in Christus Victor,to a large extent resolved byAthanasius in his De Incarnatione.Evil and human disobedience tears God be-tween his attributes of loving goodness and that of divine consistency. We mightnote a strong resemblance to the divine dilemma faced by God in the talmudictractate Berakhot, wherein God prays that “My mercy may overcome My justice,and all my other attributes.” Human transgressions required the death of hu-mankind. But God’s love (as well, one might observe, as the strictures of theNoahide covenant) does not allow the utter destruction of his own creatures.Young argues that through Athanasius’s lens, Christ’s sacrifice was a “self-propitiation offered by God to God to make atonement for the existence of evil inhis universe.” Theologically, the circle is closed.introduction245"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Nowhere is this extraordinary interchange of hieratic roles within andwithout the Christian godhead more poignantly imagined than in El Greco’sThe Trinity(1577–1579, Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid).

That God is not only the divinerecipient and bereaved parent in this drama, however, but also the hierophantof the sacrifice is underscored by the ecclesiastical mitre that he wears.24Christian scripture leaves no doubt that the Supreme Being, possessingperfect power and wisdom, conceived a son in mortal frame and allowed him tobe born. Nor does it leave any question as to whether this son was loved by hisheavenly father; indeed, the son’s mission on earth was to tell the news of thatlove, and its implications for human life. If God is understood by Christian doc-trine to be omniscient and omnipotent, there could also be little doubt that heallowed his son to be killed. To be fair, one must venture beyond the sense of “al-lowed” and into the uneasy realm of intentionality. Through the Holy Spirit,God conceived Jesus the Christ, and with him a plan for his life that would end,inexorably, with his brutal death. Whywould God sacrifice his only son?In the story of the crucifixion, Jesus is the willing victim. In Eucharistictheology, he is the priestly self-sacrificer. But in addition to these types or per-haps beyond them, in a darker country, God is the priest presiding at the sacri-fice of his own son. He is judge, executioner, and chief mourner.25introduction247"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"8The Observant God of the TalmudA certain Min said to Rabbi Abbahu: Your God is a priest, since it iswritten, That they take for me Terumah [wave offering].

He maintains a daily schedule, and solicitsadvice from his angels on protocol.8He rejoices with his creatures, weeps fortheir misdeeds, and also for their tragedies, even though, in yet another of count-less paradoxes, he himself has allowed or even caused them.9He “visits thesick, sympathizes with the mourner and buries the dead.”10InBerakhot61a,God braids Eve’s hair to make her beautiful for her marriage to Adam.This would be extraordinary enough, but God’s human-style behavior doesnot stop with these. At certain points in the Talmud, God also seems to practiceJudaism: He observes miz.vot(religious commandments), wears consecratedaccoutrements, and performs ritual actions. As in the ancient Greek case of theOlympians who oddly pour libations from sacred bowls at altars, a divinity isassociated with both cultic objects and with cultic action.In the talmudic dialogue cited above (Sanhedrin39a), the God of Israel ischarged by a sectarian, or min, with being a priest, since God is biblically ac-corded in Exodus 25:2 the terumahor wave-offering that as a rule was given topriests.11But the theme of ritual and hierarchical reversal does not stop there,for the mingoes on to taunt Rabbi Abbahu with the absurdity of the tradition ofGod’s being made ritually unclean by his burial of Moses, subjecting himselfto the same purity laws set forth in Leviticus 22:4–6 that apply to the Israelites—for after all, where would the Lord of the Universe bathe after being contami-nated by contact with a corpse? What mikveh(ritual bath) would have been vastenough to contain him, filled with what waters, since Isaiah 40:12 tells us thathe can hold all the waters of cosmos in the hollow of his hand?Astonishingly, Rabbi Abbahu does not retort that God would surely havetranscended the impurity of Moses’s corpse and thus would have had no needto bathe. Rather, he responds on the strength of Isaiah 66:15 that God bathed infire. This was the purification appropriate to the Lord, and not only to him. InNumbers 31:19–23, God’s statutes are explicated to the Israelite army by Mosesand the priest Eleazar; the Midianite spoils of war, including the captives, are tobe purified: “gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, and lead—everything that can with-stand fire, shall be passed through fire, and it shall be clean. Nevertheless itshall also be purified with the water for purification; and whatever cannot with-stand fire, shall be passed through the water.” In yet another rhetorical surprisethat seems to oscillate between metaphor and halakhah, R. Abbahu concludesthat “bathing [ for purposes of purification] should essentially be in fire”: inother words, it is not that God’s fiery mikvehis an aberrant form of the humanritual bath. Instead, God’s ritual environment (fire) is the source and gold stan-dard for the human mikveh. Water is an inferior substitute for divine fire and ischosen only by default, on account of the human inability to withstand theflames that are the deity’s natural choice for purification.We will examine in detail four of these “moments.” According to Berakhot6a, the incorporeal Hebrew God wears scroll-bearing phylacteries; he wrapshimself in the .tallit,the prayer shawl worn by the precentor—the leader of prayerat the synagogue—in order to instruct Moses in a penitential service in RoshHashanah17b.

In other words, when God performs a specificallyJewish religious action, is he still acting as the King of the Universe or simplyas a larger and more powerful Jew?14As I noted in the Introduction, Schechtercalls these examples of God’s practiced religion “the humanizing of the Deityand endowing Him with all the qualities and attributes which tend towardsmaking God accessible to Man”; whereas Cohen insists, “however these pas-sages may be explained, it is impossible to maintain that their authors actuallybelieved in a corporeal God Who actually performed the actions ascribed toHim.”15This chapter will not attempt to survey the trajectory of divine anthro-pomorphism in Jewish theological history, from the throne and feet and face ofthe Lord of the Torah to the fantastic imagination of God’s dimensions in theShiÛur Qomahto the apophatic critique by Maimonides to the thoroughgoingJewish European rationalism of the nineteenth century; rather, it will seek toundertake a focused response to particular questions raised in these talmudicpassages in the context of our inquiry, concerning divine ritual practice.I would suggest that the passages in question theologically “mean” some-thing different and greater than what Schechter and Cohen imply. As I argued inchapter 5, the portrait of a ritualizing deity intensifies and elevates certainforms of observance. Furthermore, especially in this case, these forms are per-formed by God himself, not just once at the beginning of time, but continually.If we take this talmudic evidence as not meaningless (or desperately inade-quate, following a Maimonidean critique), we see that power flows with cen-trifugal force: from and around God. Thus the heuristic task would be otherthan to “deconstruct” the praying God but, rather, to determine why religion isnot just consecrated to but also ascribedto God during this particular period inJewish history. That is, what is the particular and special value of these fourtypes of religious observance that would occasion the need for their intensifica-tion using the paradoxical idiom of an observant God?These passages also belong to the broad genre of midrash, Jewish narrativecommentary on the Bible. Although vividly imaginative, they also seek to com-municate God’s nature, and to teach about holy activity. As David Stern writes inhisRabbinic Fantasies, “The genius of midrash (the earliest form of Jewish narra-tive) is that it exists in a kind of grey area between those separate domains of imag-inative literature on the one hand, and exegetical commentary on the other.”16It will be the purpose of this section to examine this material in a very dif-ferent light. I contend that these passages embody the phenomenon of divinereflexivity. I will clarify my assumptions at the start: I take the texts, howeverwhimsical, to be sayings about God,and not about a divinized observant hu-man being. Without denying the deliberate tension between God’s alleged in-corporeality and the anthropomorphism in these rabbinic images, I believethat we are to understand the subject of the passages in b.Berakhot6a,b.Roshthe observant god of the talmud251"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Hashanah17b, b. ÛAvodah Zarah3b, and b.Berakhot7b as genuinely practicingreligion. Furthermore, I maintain that the subject is doing so as God,that is, asthe I AM, whose power cannot be circumscribed: in other words, as the God ofIsrael. I will show that the purpose of these talmudic passages is quite otherthan “making God accessible to man,” and it also goes beyond the simple “par-adigm” model of imitatio dei.In examining these four passages, I have two goals. The first is to showthat the talmudic representation of God’s own worship was introduced to servespecific motives that were in fact historically crucial to the survival of Judaism.The Talmud envisions these scenes at a particular moment, a time of great lossand danger to orthopraxy. In the sudden absence of the Temple and thus thepossibility of sacrifice, rabbinical authorities sought to encourage the study ofTorah and statutory prayer as the central pillars of faith—or indeed, accordingto certain talmudic discourse, explicitly to replace sacrifice as the supreme,mandatory devotional act. And in the face of a strong sectarian threat in thefirst centuries C.E., they also sought to reinforce their particular theology andpraxis as normative.Second, I also propose that on closer examination, each of God’s ritual ac-tions, taken within their greater liturgical and theological context, do not nec-essarily correspond to human praxis on a one-to-one basis; rather, they reveal akind of analogical patterning, as divine participatory acts of piety similar tothose of human beings, but with ritual features that are unique to God. God’sworship is notin essence “just like” that of mortals, even if it is at the apex ofthe continuum in which they also worship. It is a special kind of Judaism: thepracticed Judaism of God during the rabbinic period.The third feature in the definition of divine reflexivity in chapter 5 high-lights the ways in which the divine nature both resembles and unmistakablydistinguishes itself from human nature: “The rituals performed by gods are notgenerally identical to those prescribed for mortals, and hence cannot be said tobe simple anthropomorphisms; they usually are modified by the sacrifier’s di-vine status. Divine religious acts are both likeandunlikehuman ones. The as-pect that is unlike human behavior is related to the nature of a god as Other—ontologically ‘bigger’ in scope and potentiality than a human being.”This idea of simultaneous divine similarity to and dissimilarity from hu-man characteristics and abilities is poetically treated in Tractate Shiratain theMekhilta According to Rabbi Ishmael, commenting upon the Song of Moses inExodus.17In contemplation of the passage, “Who is like you, O Lord, amonggods? Who is like you, majestic in holiness, terrible in glorious deeds, doingwonders?” (Ex. 15:11), Shirataoffers these kinds of distinctions in the rhetoricaleffort to establish God’s uniqueness:“Who is like you among those whom others call gods, but in whomthere is no substance, of whom it is said: ‘They have mouths but can-not speak’ (Ps. 115:5).”These have mouths but cannot speak, while the One who spokeand brought the world into being is not that way.252the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"But he can say two things in a single act of speech, which mortals can-not do.For so Scripture says, “God has spoken once, two things have weheard” (Ps. 62:12); “Is not my word like fire” (Jer. 23:29); “And asound does come out from his mouth” (Job 37:2)....The trait of a mortal is such that he cannot say two things in asingle act of speech, but the One who spoke and brought the worldinto being [can say two things in a single act of speech for] he saidthe Ten Commandments in a single act of speech, which mortalscannot do.The trait of a mortal is such that one cannot hear two people cry-ing out at one moment, but the One who spoke and brought theworld into being is not that way.For even if everyone who comes through the world comes andcries out to him, he hears their cry: “O you who hears prayer, to youall flesh comes” (Ps. 65:3).18God’s powers are thus elucidated, with profound implications. Followingthe rabbinic method of scriptural justification of each statement about God’snature, the Shirataauthor shows that whereas humans can only say one thingat a time, God can say two—or ten, as when he uttered the Ten Command-ments in a single speech-act!19Whereas we can only hear one person crying ata time, God in his infinite compassion can hear two (and by extrapolation,countless) cries simultaneously.The trope continues for a number of further comparisons, all marked bythe repeated formula, “But the One who spoke and brought the world into be-ing is not that way.” Unlike mortals, God is more frightening for those who arenear at hand to him than those who are at a distance. Unlike mortals, God doesnot build first the lower stories and then the upper ones; he builds first the up-per stories and then the lower (“In the beginning, God created the heaven andthe earth” [Gen. 1:1]). Unlike mortals, God roofs his world not with wood,stones, or mud; he uses water (“Who makes of water a cover for his upperchambers” [Ps. 104:3]), and so forth.20Most strikingly,[T]he trait of mortals is that when one comes to make a form, one be-gins with the head of with some other limb and afterward completesthe whole.But the One who spoke and brought the world into being is notthat way.He forms the whole figure at once:“For he is the one who forms the whole” (Jer. 109:16).All that God does, even that which in some part functionally resembles humanactivity, he does differently.

It is acts of loving-kindness, as it is said, ‘For I desire mercy and not sacrifice.’ ”[Hos. 6:6]22The destruction of the Temple by the imperial Roman forces of Vespasian in 70C.E. broke the heart of Israel as well as what Eliade would call her axis mundi.The first destruction ruined the Solomonic temple and caused the century-longexile in Babylon. This event was construed by the Israelites as their punish-ment for the idolatry condemned by the prophets. The majestic Second Tem-ple, whose construction was undertaken at the end of the sixth century B.C.E.and whose embellishments continued to be added under Herodian rule intothe first century B.C.E., was understood by many Jews since the time of Ezraand Nehemiah as an architectural testament to the reconciliation of God withhis people.23The Temple was the liturgical focus of Israel’s cultus and the geo-graphical focus of its prayer. The second destruction, therefore, was a theologi-cal crisis of the greatest magnitude.What was to be the response of first-century Judaism to the Roman de-struction of the Temple? There can be no doubt that some construed it in thesame way, as God’s wrathful punishment of Zion for her iniquity. This view-point was a natural exponent of the cornerstone belief in God’s omnipotence. Astriking example is found in II Baruch, a pseudepigraphical work purportingto be have been composed by the scribe of the prophet Jeremiah and to de-scribe the destruction of the First Temple. In fact, the book has been dated tothe early second century C.E.24The Lord announces that “This city will be deliv-ered up for a time, / And the people will be chastened for a time” (II Baruch 4:1).He then will send his angels to prepare the tabernacle for the enemy assault,commanding them to gather up the precious things stored within, and to letthem be swallowed up in the earth (II Baruch 5:8–9). There the cult objects willwait until the apocalypse, when the Temple and its cultus will be restored. God’sangels will destroy the walls of the temple themselves “so that the enemies donot boast and say, ‘We have overthrown the wall of Zion and we have burntdown the palace of the mighty God’ ” (II Baruch 7:1).25According to this vision,God not only allowed but also assisted in the Temple’s destruction.26But this was largely an atavistic theology, superimposed on a cruel newreality difficult to construe as divine punishment for Israel’s own sins. Al-though much midrashic literature stops short of saying that God was power-254the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"less to prevent the Temple’s destruction, it sometimes shows him lamentingthe ruin of his own house. The Shekhinah, the imminent presence of God onearth, resided in its inner sanctum, the Holy of Holies, with the ark of thecovenant. And when its beloved sanctuary was ruined, a mashal(parable) tellsus that the radiant tenant departed in tears, clinging to the very walls it hadindwelled:R. Aha said:It is like a king who departed from his palace in anger. But once hedeparted, he went back, and embraced and kissed the palace’s wallsand the palace’s columns, and wept, saying: Farewell my palace,farewell my kingdom’s home, farewell my precious house, farewellfrom now, farewell.Similarly, when the Shekhinah was departing from the Temple, itwent back, and embraced and kissed the Temple’s walls and the Tem-ple’s columns, and wept, saying: Farewell my palace, farewell mykingdom’s home, farewell my precious house, farewell from now,farewell.27InLamentations Rabbah1:1, God asks his angels to tell him what a king offlesh and blood customarily does when he mourns. He then proceeds dutifullyto carry out what they recommend, only on a God-sized scale—for example, inorder to “hang sackcloth over his door,” God blackens the entire sky. DavidStern comments:Not only does God wish to follow the model of the human king in thepractices of mourning; but to do so, He must seek instruction fromthe angels in the correct procedures. The true irony behind this re-quest lies in what it implies about God’s innocence, His need for in-struction. Without the angels, God is utterly at a loss, entirely igno-rant of the protocols of mourning. This picture of God may strike us,perhaps, as rather whimsical, especially given our ideas about divineomniscience. Yet, in fact, how could God know how to mourn? Hehimself is untouched by death. And if the Destruction was indeed theunprecedented catastrophe that the Rabbis believed it to be, God him-self must have been as unprepared for its devastation as were its hu-man victims.The real power of this passage lies not only in its depiction ofGod as a human-like mourner but in the ultimate reality it confersupon the human tragedy by making even God its mourner.28We will return to Stern’s important idea that God’s participation in a human re-ligious custom confers on it an “ultimate reality.”The response of Judaism to the catastrophe cannot be uniformly character-ized because there were many varieties of Judaism before the events of 70 C.E.In addition to the rebel zealots and apocalyptic communities such as thosewhose scrolls were found at Qumran, we know of the obscure and contentiousthe observant god of the talmud255"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Sadducees, whose alleged identification with the aristocrats or with the templepriesthood is not born out either in Josephus or in rabbinical sources, nor iseven made explicit in the New Testament. Both Sadducee and Pharisee priestsare mentioned in the sources. The Sadducees, however, seemed to have re-jected both the doctrine of personal immortality and the interpretations of ha-lakhic purity held by the far more influential Pharisees. The horror that befellthe Temple seems also to have eradicated the religious influence of the Sad-ducees, ratified Pharisaic ideology and praxis, and ushered in the dawn of para-mount rabbinical authority. The florescence of the rabbinical academies inPalestine and then, over the following several centuries, in Babylon, grew outof the Pharisaic conviction that the ritual fulfillment of the entire Torah was in-cumbent on every Jew, universalizing but also replacing the role of the Templecult in fulfilling Israel’s obligations to God. As Jacob Neusner puts it, “the pu-rity laws, so complicated and inconvenient, were extended to the life of everyJew in his own home. The Temple altar in Jerusalem would be replicated at thetable of all Israel.”30Legendarily smuggled out of the ravaged city in a coffin,Yo.hanan ben Zakkai, the youngest of the disciples of Hillel, one of the greatestof the 150 tannaim(teachers), founded his academy at Javneh and thus “res-cued Judaism from the shipwreck of the Roman destruction that overwhelmedthe Jewish nation in the year 70. Javneh became the rallying-ground of Jewishlearning and the centre of Jewish life.”31This, then, is the figure who comforts his disciple Joshua ben .Hananiah.32As Neusner says: “To Yo.hanan ben Zakkai, preserving the Temple was not anend in itself. He taught that there was another means of reconciliation betweenGod and Israel, so that the Temple and its cult were not decisive. What reallycounted in the life of the Jewish people? Torah, piety.”33To understand God’s pe-culiar performance of his precepts, rituals and miz.vot,the commandments ofthe religion formulated by him and dedicated to him, it is to “Torah, piety” thatwe must direct our gaze. The pre-70 C.E. Pharisaic practice of teaching the Lawin synagogues, and expounding and realizing the Law in daily life, was put to agreater test than perhaps its adherents had expected. Pharisaic Judaism was inthe process of becoming, as it were, the solo actor on a bright stage. “Torah,piety”: Gradually these were the new collective offerings of the Jewish people, re-placing the shewbread, the incense, the kasheranimal slaughtered on the altar.As explored in the previous section, early Christianity appropriated thesymbolic meaning of ancient Hebrew traditions of sacrifice toward the under-standing and description of the crucifixion of its savior. This appropriation tookplace on two levels: the theological, in which the Hebrew scriptural account ofthe aqedah, the binding of Isaac, was used in Christian exegetical writings tocast God as the sacrificer and sacrificial recipient of his own son. It also tookplace on the cultic level, in which aspects of the elaborate sacrificial cult of theJewish temple cast Christ as high priest, ritual victim, and sacrificer of himself.Christian sacrificial theology that made reference to the Temple cultusmade it clear that the cult itself was obsolete. But unlike Pharisaic Judaism,it did not seek alternatives to the Temple cult, but rather saw it as sublimatedin the crucifixion, ratified in heaven, and reenacted in the Eucharist. In the256the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Epistle to the Hebrews, discussed earlier, Christ as high priest of his self-sacrifice, the ultimate qorban, had made those sacrifices that used to be requireddaily and annually “once for all.”34Although surely not representative of therange of Christian devotional theologies in the first century C.E., the Epistle tothe Hebrews offered spiritualized images of the lost Temple cult that later be-came organizing icons in the worship of the Constantinian Church. By con-trast, Pharisaic Judaism, the main sect left standing after the debacles of first-century Roman suppression, tenaciously had to refashion an alternative to theTemple’s schedule of consecrated actions. Torah study became a holy activityin and of itself. Even in the Mishnah, the law code of Judaism orally circu-lated from the second century B.C.E. onward, we find the sanctification of aconcern for intellectual consistency: “[I]ts numerous unresolved disputes, itssporadic use of biblical proof texts and its occasional narratives all reflect thevalue of study as a religious ritual in its own right, and eventually the activityof studying God’s law was as important in Talmudic religion as was the con-tent of that study.”35The necessity of reinforcement of the Torah and its study and of the ritual ob-servances and purity laws became a preoccupation of the rabbis. The first reason,as we have said, is that classical Israel had lost its sacrificial focus. The second wasthat rabbinic authority was challenged within its Hellenistic environment by sec-tarian movements: Jewish Christians, gnostics, and other splinter groups, all ofthem called minim.It was necessary to lift up the Torah and the laws of purity ina way that was intense and radical—in a mode of discourse that had real power.One clear manifestation of this imperative in the rabbinic imagination was theidea of God’s own religious observance.In the world of the Talmud, we already encounter a vital God whose pres-ence is often denoted by the Shekhinah. On earth, God fairly glows: HisShekhinah (literally, “dwelling”), is often represented as shining or effulgent.Berakhot,dealing with the proper nature and orientation of prayer, the maincomponents of the daily prayers, and the prescribed thanksgivings to be recitedover meals, portrays God as a deity who is anything but a deus otiosusor an ab-sent father.36He is present in his own house of worship whenever the mini-mum number assemble to honor him. “Rabin ben R. Ada says in the name ofR. Isaac: How do you know that the Holy One, blessed be He, is to be found inthe Synagogue? For it is said: God standeth in the congregation of God. [Ps. 82: 1].And how do you know that if ten people pray together the Divine Presence iswith them? For it is said: God standeth in the congregation of God.[Sanh.2b].”37God stands in the congregation of God; he judges with those who judge.38He is present with those who study Torah.39These are activities that provokethepresence of God; he participates in the collective liturgical, judicial, and ha-lakhic life of Israel. This has a theurgic effect; God’s presence provides a su-pernatural ratification of human affairs. As the Palestinian Talmud commentsonb. Berakhot6a, “However high He be above His world, let a man but enter aSynagogue, stand behind a pillar and pray in a whisper, and the Holy One,blessed be He, hearkens to his prayer. Can there be a God nearer than this,Who is close to His creatures as the mouth is to the ear!”40the observant god of the talmud257"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Berakhot6a and b: God Wears TefillinThe rabbis did not wish to restrict God in time and space. They taught that Godis both everywhere and radically near; God hears even a whispered prayer. Nev-ertheless, it is unsettling to discover him wearing tefillinwound around hismighty right arm and strapped above his forehead at the spot directly over thearea between his all-seeing eyes.R. Abin son of R. Ada in the name of R. Isaac says [ further]: How doyou know that the Holy One, blessed be He, puts on tefillin?For it issaid:The Lord hath sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of Hisstrength.[Is. 62, 8] “By His right hand”:this is the Torah; for it is said:At His right hand was a fier y law unto them[Deut. 33, 2]. “And by thearm of His strength”:this is the tefillin; as it is said: The Lord will givestrength unto His people.[Ps. 29, 11] And how do you know that thetefillinare a strength to Israel? For it is written: And all the peoples ofthe earth shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon thee, and theyshall be afraid of thee,[Deut. 28, 10], and it has been taught: R. Eliezerthe Great says: This refers to the tefillinof the head.41Tefillin, called “phylacteries,”in the New Testament are the reminders ofGod’s covenant with Israel “as a mark on your hand” and “a memorial betweenyour eyes” (Exodus 13:16). Although repeatedly evoked with such splendid im-ages as these in God’s commandments to Israel to remember her deliverancefrom bondage, tefillinare never described in Hebrew scripture. As we have seenfrom the specifications God exacts for his altar and later, for his temple, this wasnot because he was not particular about his cult places or practices. So, jumpinginto the breach of biblical silence (and, in the process, ratifying and additionallyregulating existing practice), the rabbis specified how tefillinwere to be madeand when worn (Menah.ot34b–37b).Traditionally, tefillinare two small cubical black leather boxes containingparchment made from the hide of kasheranimals. Each of the tefillincontains thesame four biblical passages, which are written by a scribe on one piece for thearm, and on four separate scrolls for insertion into four parallel compartmentsworn on the forehead. On the head-box is written the Hebrew letter shin.They areworn on the inner left arm, opposite the heart (shel yad)and on the foreheadabove the space between the eyes (shel rosh).The strap circling the head is knot-ted at the nape of the neck in the shape of Hebrew letter dalet.The remainingpart of the strap of the hand is bound around the palm forming the Hebrew let-teryod,and Hosea 2:21–22 is recited. Shin, dalet, yodcombine to make Shaddai,one of the names of God. Originally, tefillinwere worn throughout the day. Todaythey are worn only during the morning service, and only by Jewish males. Sincethey serve as a reminder, they are not required on the Sabbath or on major festi-vals, which are themselves considered to be sufficient reminder of the covenan-tal relationship to God. Tefillinare not worn on the first day of mourning, by agroom on his wedding day, or by lepers or the excommunicated.258the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"In the passage above, Rabbi Abin (Avin) seeks to show how we know,based on scripture, that God wears tefillin.Isaiah 62:8 is invoked to illustratethat his “right hand” was the Torah, “a fiery law unto them,” according toDeuteronomy 33:2. The “arm of his strength” in the Isaiah passage representsthe tefillin,according to R. Abin. Although the passage does not specify onwhich arm God wears the tefillin,talmudic-style analysis would seem to sug-gest that “the arm of his strength” is in fact, God’s right arm, since it is his righthand that is the all-powerful Torah. Already we have a possible “complemen-tary” aspect to God’s ritual practice: Unless one is left-handed, human tefillinare worn on the left arm. Deuteronomy 28:10, according to R. Eliezer, proves thedivine practice of wearing tefillinon the divine head. “And all the peoples of theearth shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon thee, and they shall beafraid of thee.” This is also an interesting proof-text for human religious prac-tice: As we have seen, the boxes and straps of the tefillindo in fact spell out thename of God.Now, why would God wear these? Notable in and of itself is the fact that therabbis, who are in the habit of explaining everything, do not deem it necessaryto explain this. The answer lies in examining what is written on the mortalpieces of parchment together with what is written on God’s scrolls inside thecompartments of his boxes.For millennia, the tefillinhave contained four sets of verses: Exodus13:1–10;42Exodus 13:11–6;43Deuteronomy 6:4–9;44and Deuteronomy 11:13–21.45These passages speak of his power in choosing and delivering Israel frombondage; they exhort his people to remember God’s deliverance of them frombondage, always to love him with their whole being, and to shun the gods ofneighboring peoples. As May and Metzger comment on Deuteronomy 6:4–9,the first passage of the ShemaÛ, “[t]here are not many gods but one Lordwho issovereign and unique; thus Israel is to have only one loyalty.”46The biblicalverses worn by the Israelites in their tefillinhave a common—and reflexive—focus: They each mention the miz.vahof wearing tefillin; and a common theo-logical theme: They celebrate the uniqueness of God.God’s tefillinscrolls, correspondingly, celebrate the uniqueness of Israel.As the Berakhotpassage continues, God sings the praises of his chosen nation.R. Nah.man b. Isaac said to R..Hiyya b. Abin: What is written in thetefillinof the Lord of the Universe?—He replied to him: And who islike Thy people Israel, a nation one in the earth(I Chron. 17, 21). Does,then, the Holy One, blessed be He, sing the praises of Israel?—Yes,for it is written: Thou hast avouched the Lord this day...and the Lordhath avouched thee this day(Deut. 26, 17, 18). The Holy One, blessedbe He, said to Israel: You have made me a unique entity in the world,and I shall make you a unique entity in the world. “You have mademe a unique entity in the world,” as it is said: Hear, O Israel, the Lordour God, the Lord is one.(Deut. 6, 4). “And I shall make you a uniqueentity in the world,” as it is said: “And who is like thy people Israel,a nation one in the earth” (I Chron. 27, 21).47the observant god of the talmud259"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"God has made a marriage vow with Israel; this is his part of the covenant.

A mutual covenantal element explains the relationship of these two,on the analogy of the marriage of Hosea and Gomer. They are a recitation of re-marriage on covenantal grounds, after the model in the second chapter ofHosea. Hosea undertakes another wedding to his Gomer the harlot, despiteher unfaithfulness. God will never cease to love his own, seeking to win backthose who forsake him.As we read in Hosea 2:19–20: “And I will betroth you to me forever; I willbetroth you to me in righteousness, and in justice, in steadfast love, and inmercy. I will betroth you to me in faithfulness; and you shall know the Lord.”Hosea 2:23 reiterates this vow: “And I will sow him48for myself in the land.And I will have pity on Not Pitied, and I will say to Not my people, ‘You are mypeople’: and he shall say, ‘Thou art my God.’ ”The marriage relationship was a familiar figure of speech depicting God’srelation to Israel.49Humantefillincontain four verses in which Israel is dedi-cated to God as her chosen deity, the one true God. Yahweh’s tefillinsay that heis devoted to Israel as his chosen people by the covenantal relationship theyshare. Some of the earliest prayers in Hebrew liturgy, found in LamentationsRabbah1:45 and b. Bererakhot11b, echo this adamantine bond of faithfulness:“With great love hast thou Loved us, O Lord our God, with great and exceedingpity hast Thou pitied us.”The rest of the verses contained in God’s tefillinbear this out:R. Ah.a b. Raba said to R. Ashi: This accounts for one case, whatabout the other cases?—He replied to him: [They contain the follow-ing verses:] For what great nation is there,etc.;And what great nation isthere,etc. (Deut. 4, 7, 8); Happy art thou, O Israel,etc.; (Deut. 33, 29)Or hath God assayed, etc.;(Deut. 4,34) and To make thee high above allnations(Deut. 26, 19).50When worn by a mortal, the tefillinbind one to God as the only true God,solely to be loved, worshiped, and obeyed. “The biblical portions define thefoundations of Judaism in terms of God’s unity and the acceptance of Divinerule, as well as God’s providence and faith in the world’s redemption, as sym-bolized by the Exodus from Egypt. Thus, the act of binding oneself with thetefillinserves as a regular reminder to the Jew to be bound up in service to God,with heart, mind, and might.”51When worn by God, God’s tefillincontain hisresponse. They beautifully provide the missing half of the puzzle—that is, theloving divine answer to the message of the scrolls worn by mortals. Taken to-gether, they spell out the theme of the marriage-covenant. The two sets ofscrolls provide an interlocking, dually reinforced affirmation of mutual choiceand devotion. God’s biblical passages are notthe same as people’s. Thus what isat work here is by no means a simple case of intended imitation of the immor-tal by the mortal or vice versa, but rather a powerful, theologically intentionalprinciple of complimentarity.260the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"God’s Six Prayers in Four CasesR. Ah.a b. Raba (Rava) is concerned that God’s phylacteries would have toomany cases if they are to contain so many prayers. Although he has six pas-sages of scripture (two extra), God wears four cases on the tefillinof his head,just as people do. Clearly, there is the sense that God’s tefillinshould matchpeople’s. R. Ashi has a reassuring response: In three of the cases, God has twosimilar verses written and inserted.If so, there would be too many cases? Hence [you must say]: For whatgreat nation is there,andAnd what great nation is there,which are simi-lar, are in one case; Happy art thou, O Israel,andWho is like Thy peo-ple,in one case; Or hath God assayed,in one case; and To make theehigh,in one case. 6b) And all these verses are written on [the tefillinof ] His arm.52Again, what is the text’s real purpose? Why is it necessary so carefully tospecify that even though God wears six verses, he does not wear six casesbutrather the normative four? Deviation from established custom was perceived bythe rabbis as extremely dangerous. For example, the Mishnah states explicitlythat one may not wear oval-shaped or gold phylacteries. This relates in a generalway to the rabbinic struggle against nonrabbinic communities, and the need toaffirm a uniform practice after the destruction of the temple. God must wear thesame number of cases as his people do lest they say, “since God has six scrip-tural passages, so can I.”Controversy had surrounded the contents of the tefillinduring the late firstcentury C.E. Both the daily prayers, the Shema\\, and the tefillinused to includethe recitation of the Decalogue (Deuteronomy 5:6–21). Both Babylonian andPalestinian Talmud (b. Berakhot12a and y. Berakhot3c) give clear testimony thatthe Decalogue was excised from daily prayers to counter the attack of the minimthat the law resided only therein. Y. Berakhot3c reads, “It used to be lawful to re-cite the ten commandments every day. Why then do they not recite them now?Because of the claim of the minim:so that they may not say, ‘only these [words]were given to Moses on Sinai.’ ” Minimis a coverall term for groups the rabbisjudged heretical in belief or practice. Some of these sectarians refuted the divineorigin of the entire Torah, claiming that only the Decalogue was God-given.Mann identifies the minimwith a gnostic group.53Vermes thinks they wereChristians and/or Jewish Christians.54Moore confesses ignorance as to theiridentity.55Archaeological evidence indicates that pre-Diaspora tefillinused to contain afifth scroll for the Decalogue. At Qumran, variations in first-century custom wereapparent in both the order of the four basic paragraphs—and in an addition tothem—for Deuteronomy 5:1 also appeared in the Qumran phylacteries.56Thispassage was clearly related to the recitation of the Decalogue (Deuteronomy5:6–21) and its inclusion in tefillinprior to the destruction of the Second Tem-ple.57Ritual uniformity had been achieved by the second century.

Like a bright starfish that will, without hesita-tion, surrender whichever legs it must to permit its escape from danger, thetradition relentlessly excised from its practice a custom as precious and funda-mental as the saying and wearing of the Ten Commandments. It sacrificed thepart in order to save the whole. It was crucial that God wear the tefillin,but justas key that he wear the right number of cases: the regular number. WhateverGod did was infinitely more powerful than what people did; therefore the rab-bis wanted his religious practices to be orthoprax, and never the basis for un-orthodox piety.Rosh Hashanah17b: God Wears the T.allitGod’s covenantal relationship with Zion is reiterated in a passage from b. RoshHashanah17b.59But here he does more than wear affirmations of Israel’suniqueness among the nations of his world on forehead and arm. God actuallydons the fringed ›t.allitcustomarily drawn over the head by the prayer-reader(Ba\\al Tefillah) of a synagogue congregation.“And the Lord passed before him and proclaimed” [etc.] [Ex. 34, 6].R. Joh.anan said: Were it not written in the text, it would be im-possible for us to say such a thing; this verse teaches us that the HolyOne, blessed be He, drew his robe round Him like the reader of acongregation and showed Moses the order of prayer. He said to him:Whenever Israel sin, let them carry out this service before me and Iwill forgive them. “The Lord, the Lord”:I am the Eternal before a mansins and same after a man sins and repents. “A God merciful and gra-cious”:Rab Judah said: A covenant has been made with the thirteenattributes that they will not be turned away empty-handed, as it says,“Behold I make a covenant.”60A wool or linen mantle still worn by observant Jewish men, the t.allithadtassels with eight threads doubled over and fastened at its four corners as com-manded by God to Moses in Numbers 15:38–41.61After the Diaspora, theshawllike garment, probably resembling the Bedouin abbayah, which had beenworn daily by rabbis and scholars and by the wealthy, tended to become a moreritually marked vestment, mandated for prayer.62It is worn by males duringthe morning prayers, for every additional service, and all day on Yom Kippurduring the five prayers.63Strictly observant Jews don both tefillinandt.allittowalk from home to the synagogue.

For prayer, the rabbis stressedattaining a right frame of mind and an attitude of devotion (\\iyyun tefillah,b. Shabbat127a). Although b. Berakhot24b and 31a emphasize the formation ofthe words of prayer with one’s lips, rather than their declaration in a loud voice,one can also discharge one’s religious obligation by listening attentively to theBa\\al Tefillahand responding, “Amen.”The designated reader, or anyone called to the Reading of the Law, mustput on a t.allitbefore reciting the Torah blessings.66As Ismar Elbogen remarksin his study of the history of Jewish liturgy, “Someone who was to step out ofthe ranks of worshipers to perform a liturgical function had to be properlydressed; he owed this to the dignity of the congregation. Not only defects inone’s clothing, but certain kinds of clothing were considered improper andrendered the wearer unsuited to serve as precentor (m. Megillah4:8,t. Megillah4:30). The precentor used to wrap himself in his coat. From this, scholars be-came accustomed to put on special clothing whenever they visited the syna-gogue or set about praying anywhere else....In particular they used to put onthe particular type of coat that in the Talmud is called t.alit.”67Thus, resonatingwith the irony that has become so familiar in dealing with divine reflexivity, wefind this imagined God of Rosh Hashanahenveloping himself in a symbol ofsubmission to his own will, “like the leader of prayers in a synagogue,” seekingto lead his people in right worship of himself.68The “proof-text” of this paradox in the talmudic passage is Exodus 34:6–7.Rabbi Yoh.anan discusses God’s revelation of his own attributes to Moses: “TheLord passed before him, and proclaimed, ‘The Lord, the Lord, a God mercifuland gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness,keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression andsin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathersupon the children and the children’s children, to the third and fourth genera-tion.’ ”69But Yoh.anan’s discussion has deeper implications. Yoh.anan teachesthat Exodus 34:6–7 also reveals God as the source of an order of prayer. It is theproof-text for the institution of a liturgical service. The passage from the Torahcontaining the thirteen attributes was read as part of the prayer service. It hadthe special force of repentance. According to the talmudic exegesis, God hasmade a covenant with his thirteen attributes (that is, aspects of his own nature),guaranteeing that the people of Israel “will not be turned away empty-handed”when they recite them. God not only self-reveals; he also institutes prayer. Thusthe rabbis are able to say that “he drew his robe round Him like the reader ofa congregation and showed Moses the order of prayer.”The introductory phrase, “God is likethe reader of a congregation,” warnsus that, however briefly, we are in the realm of the mashal(parable). When hethe observant god of the talmud263"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"dons the t.allitand shows Moses the order of prayer, God is acting as a syna-gogue leader would to familiarize a congregant with a liturgy. But as God,he isoffering the terms of repentance: the recitation by mortals of his attributes thathe himself recites. The talmudic perspective sees all of this happening at thetime of the original conversation between God and Moses. Rosh Hashanahtherefore presents a thoroughly self-referential situation.God’s wearing of the t.allitand behaving in this way reinforces synagogueprayer in general, but also a specific prayer within that order of prayer, as hehimself is shown to be both its source and teacher. This echoes his role assource of the moral and religious code of Israel, the Ten Commandments. It isdifferent, however, in that it affects the realm of contemporary cult practice, of-fering an explicit aetiology for a particular liturgical feature.70That the Talmud itself is aware of the paradoxical, even shocking import ofthis passage is attested by the formula “Were it not written in the text, it wouldbe impossible for us to say such a thing.” The “text” in which “it is written” towhich the rabbis refer is the scriptural justification for the midrashic idea—in this case, Exodus 34:6, undergirding the image of God in a prayer robethrough a miracle of exegetical creativity. Moshe Halbertal has systematicallyevaluated the rare instances, including Rosh Hashanah17b, where this “If not”formula occurs in rabbinic literature, remarking that its presence “alerts us de-cisively that we are about to face an unusual issue that, were it not for the text,the exegete would not be able to express of his own accord....[T]he expressionpoints to a theological meaning of the text which is irresolvable.”71Halbertalcharacterizes the position of the exegete as one of “aghast wonder.” Interest-ingly, he shows that the “If not” formula almost always accompany midrashimthat reverse or apparently compromise God’s role vis-à-vis human beings,“stretching the humanization [of God] to its limit if not further...the authori-tative stance of God towards man is completely blurred.”72For example, in b.Berakhot32a, God’s fury in Exodus 32:10 (“Now let me alone, so that my wrathmay burn hot against them and I may consume them; and of you I will make agreat nation”) allows Rabbi Abahu to say, “If the text had not been written, itwould be impossible to say such a thing: This teaches that Moses took hold ofthe Holy One, blessed be He, like a man who seizes his fellow by the garmentand said before Him: Sovereign of the Universe, I will not let Thee go untilThou forgivest and pardonest them.” As Halbertal observes, the social spacebetween God and Moses is collapsed by the analogy; a man grabs his equal’scoat to coerce or plead with him. The formula occurs again in Sifrei NumbersBeha›lotacha96, which resolves the traditions of Moses’s death in Reuben’sportion of Moab with that of his burial in God’s portion: “Moses was carried inthe hand of God for four millinfrom the portion of Reuben to the portionof Gad.”In the end, the use of the formula has to do with the power of love to sub-vert hierarchies and hence, strangely, to break them open, resulting in revela-tion. Here in the prayer-robed God, of whom, had the text not been written, itwould be impossible to speak, we may perhaps find resonance with the icon ofChrist feeding the Apostles from the Eucharistic cup, or Alla ̄h and the angels264the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"praying for Muh.ammad. For Halbertal, the implications of these talmudic re-versals extend infinitely, like mutually reflecting mirrors.This unique midrashic anthropomorphism creates an intimacy be-tween God and man that disturbs the most basic understandings ofanalogies of personification. The strength of love is its ability to dis-rupt the unsaid connections in the lives of people within which thereare clear authority relations. Love is that which causes authority fig-ures to change into dependents; love breaks the rules. The peak of re-ligious life is found in a place where the humanizing metaphor ar-rives at the edge of paradox, as a result of intimacy that breaks thestructure of the authority that is supposedly a given in the relation-ship between man and God.73Berakhot7a: God PraysR. Joh.anan says in the name of R. Jose: How do we know that theHoly One, blessed be He, says prayers? Because it says: Even willI bring them to My holy mountain and make them joyful in Myhouse of prayer. [Isaiah 56, 7]. It is not said, “their prayer”, but “Myprayer”; hence [you learn] that the Holy One, blessed be He, saysprayers. What does he pray?74The scripture on which this is a commentary (Isaiah 56:7) in its wider con-text seems to be an inclusive declaration that Gentile offerings are accepted onGod’s altar: “And the foreigners who join themselves to the Lord, to minister tohim, to love the name of the Lord, and to be his servants, every one who keepsthe sabbath, and does not profane it, and holds fast my covenant—these I willbring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; theirburnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my houseshall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.”75“My house of prayer” (or, as R. Joh.anan calls it, “the House of my Prayer”)offers an expansive image. The root of tef illah,“prayer,” means “to think, en-treat, intercede, judge”; its reflexive derivative, lehitpallel, has the etymologicallyderived sense of “judging oneself.” Setting aside the question of the new andspecial characteristics of prayer in the rabbinic period, we can observe somequalities of continuity throughout Jewish history. Tefillahis not only the askingfor needs to be met, but in the highest sense, it is the “intimate communion ofthe created and the Creator, speaking deep to deep.”76In Hebrew scripture,God seeks humankind as readily as the reverse (Isaiah 50:2, 65:12). The powerof prayer has its roots in the Jewish belief that mortals can communicate withGod, and that God hears and responds. As God created man and woman in hisown image—and so has a personal interest in them—there is a spiritual con-nection between creator and creatures; the Psalms especially express thisyearning for closeness to God, often associating prayer with that search. ExodusRabbah21:3 says that “[W]hoever directs his heart...to Him in prayer isthe observant god of the talmud265"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"heard.”B. Berakhot10a says that no one should ever despair of supplicatingGod, “even if a sharp sword rests on his neck.”77A prayer may be as simple asthat uttered by a desperate Moses on behalf of the leprous Miriam,78or as com-plex and formal as Solomon’s extensive petition at the dedication of the FirstTemple (1 Kings 8:22–53).So in b. Berakhot7a, God’s prayer is his self-communion, and furthermore,it is not a communion without struggle. For the sake of his creation, God praysfor one of his divine attributes to overcome the other. Incredibly, he makeshimselfcontingent, limiting and defining his own nature with respect to hu-mankind.Prayer in the Rabbinic PeriodThe liturgical laws in the Hebrew Bible have much to say about sacrifice, but al-most nothing about verbal utterance. Biblical laws governing sacrifice, a “chore-ographed, dramatic act of public worship in and of itself,” give virtually noprovision for liturgically incorporated prayer.79The only exceptions were two:first, the pilgrim’s declaration on bringing first fruits to the Temple ([Deuteron-omy 26:5–10], which begins “[A] wandering Aramean was my father,” describesIsrael’s delivery from bondage in Egypt, and concludes, “[A]nd behold, now Ibring the first fruit of the ground, which Thou, O Lord, hast given me”) and sec-ond, the priestly confession on the Day of Atonement ([Leviticus 16:21–34], inwhich two goats are made to absorb symbolically the sins of the people. Onegoat is offered for God; one driven into the wilderness to Azazel, an evil spirit ordesert demon. The actual text of the priestly confession is not given in the Pen-tateuch, although a version may be preserved in a Second Temple formula(m. Yoma3.8).During the Babylonian exile, communal prayer developed outside EretzYisrael as a replacement for sacrifices. After the Second Temple destruction, therabbis built on precedent by recognizing a daily prayer service: \\avodah shevalev,“the service of the heart.” In Ta\\anit26, the pivotal commandment in Deuteron-omy 11:13 (“And if you will obey my commandments which I command you thisday, to love the Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with allyour soul”) is explicitly construed by the rabbis as a ratification of prayer. Thequestion about the scriptural statement, “Which is the service of the heart?” isanswered simply, “Prayer.” Just as Joh.anan ben Zakkai comforted Joshua mourn-ing the Temple in ruins with the reminder that in acts of loving-kindness, “wehave another atonement as effective as this,” so the concept of “service” (\\avo-dah), once connected with the temple and its worship, finds a substitute inprayer. One of the two important reasons for statutory prayers was the claimthat they were ordained by the patriarchs. The other was that they correspond tothe perpetual offerings in Temple times (b. Berakhot26a–b).But prayer is not simply a substitute for the lost Temple and its cult; moreis claimed for prayer. In b. Berakhot32b, we read that “greater is prayer than266the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"sacrifices. Greater is prayer than good deeds.”80The example to illustrate theprecedence of prayer over good deeds given by rabbis is that of Moses, whosegood deeds were not answered, but only his prayer: He was allowed to see thepromised land before his death (Deuteronomy 3: 26–27).The Talmud itself (b. Berakhot21a) states that the religious obligationof of-fering up prayers is rabbinic, not biblical. B. Berakhot4:1 states that one shouldpray three times a day, in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night.81Set for-mulas were ascribed to the men of the Great Assembly; congregational prayerwas expanded to include morning benedictions (the Shema\\and blessings), theAmidahorTefillah(the eighteen benedictions), and the reading of the law,which combined Torah study and worship. A liturgical pattern for daily, Sab-bath, and holiday worship took shape. In addition to statutory and privateprayers, public prayers were specified (that is, for rain in a time of drought inTa\\anit2:1–5). Nonobligatory prayers, such as kinot, piyyutim,andseli.hotwerecomposed. Prayers appeared in poetry and prose and were added to the prayer-book, used in public worship. Other forms were ordained for use in the home:the grace after meals, havdalah,the kiddush.82B. Berakhot4:4 and Avot2:13 emphasize the need to retain a personal andspontaneous element in prayer; prayer as fixed or rote negate its purpose andeffect.Y. Berakhot4:3 and 4:8a urge one to “offer an original prayer each day.”Nevertheless, in rabbinic Judaism, prayer is mandatory, not a “spontaneous ac-tivity” or an outpouring of devotion or petition, as conceived especially byProtestant Christianity. The prayer that emerged from the crucible of the rab-binic movement was not the same as the later kavvanot,medieval mysticalmeditations and devotions revolving around divine mysteries; nor is it theprayer of Hasidism, a supreme religious act whose ecstatic expression in wor-ship aims to achieve mystical communion with God (dev›kut). Rabbinic prayer,at the time that God prays, is a mi.zvahand not optional. All mi.zvotoccur withina legal framework.83The rabbis were suspicious of too much and the wrongkind of prayer. B. Berakhot33b says that man should use only standard scrip-tural praises established for use in prayers. Prayer must not be uttered “in themidst of sorrow, idleness, laughter, frivolous chatter, or idle talk, only in the joyof performing a commandment” (b. Berakhot31a). God’s prayer, then, upholdsand strengthens a mandatory practice, a ritual obligation that was explicitly ex-pected and hoped to replace the elaborate sacrifice of the Temple. God is imag-ined as praying at a time in the history of Judaism when the habit of prayer hasbecome, of necessity, greatly emphasized.Collective Nature of Prayer Stressed over PersonalNeither does rabbinic prayer conform to an image of individual, private devo-tion. Personal supplications outside of ritual were to be kept short (b. Berakhot61a). A minyan was required for important features of the daily prayers; withoutthe minyan, these were omitted, and as we have seen previously in b. Berakhotthe observant god of the talmud267"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"6b, this is no small matter to God: “R. Joh.anan says: Whenever the Holy One,blessed be He, comes into a Synagogue and does not find ten persons there, Hebecomes angry at once. For it is said: Wherefore, when I came, was there noman? When I called, was there no answer? [Isa. 50: 2].”In the same spirit, “[C]orporate prayers set in the first person plural, orthose offered on behalf of others, have greater significance than private, self-centered prayers.”84B. Berakhot29b tells the story of a rabbi departing on ajourney, who composed a prayer for the occasion that began: “May it be Thywill, O Lord my God, to conduct me in peace, and to deliver me from everyenemy and ambush by the way.” A colleague objected, saying, “Always shoulda man associate with the community when praying. How should he pray? ‘Mayit be Thy will, O Lord ourGod, to conduct usin peace, etc.’ ” (italics added).B. Berakhot29b–30a says a man should pray not only for himself but think ofothers as well, using the plural injunctive “grant us,” not “grant me.” Commu-nal prayer in the context of congregational worship is of greater significancethan private prayer (b. Berakhot8a,Deuteronomy Rabbah2:12);b. Berakhot6ais even more radical: “A man’s prayer is only heard [by God] when offered ina synagogue.” In synagogue liturgy, the use of first person was and is veryrare. Even rarer, then, is God’s prayer, for it is supplication made by the ulti-mate “first person.”Furthermore, contrary to what we may understand or be comfortablewith—living as we do in an era that stresses individual spirituality—prayer wasnot necessarily the supreme act of devotion after Javneh. Greater though prayermight be than good deeds or sacrifices, greater yet and valued more even thanprayer was the reverent study of Torah. “Rabbinic piety came to be organizedaround gratitude for the law and joy in its fulfillment. The law was understoodto be a divine gift; to observe the law meant to strengthen one’s link to itsgiver....Study of the law was both the highest intellectual activity in which aJew might engage and also a practical activity designed to further this expan-sion of opportunity. Enlarging the scope of the law was not felt to be adding tothe already heavy burden; on the contrary, it increased the portion of one’s lifethat could be constructed in response to the voice of God.”85Bothb. Shabbat11aandb. Rosh Hashanah35a tell us that some scholars only prayed occasionally.Inb. Shabbat10a, a rabbi who spent too much time praying is rebuked by hiscolleagues for putting temporal over eternal concerns; it is Torah study, notprayer, that links human beings to the infinite. Some holy men were renownedfor their ability to have their prayers answered (b. Berakhot34b); scholars wouldask these to pray for them.The Holy of Holies: Place of God’s PrayerOne of the most simple and moving Talmudic directives on prayer was that ofRabbi Eliezer: “When you pray, know before whom you stand” (b. Berakhot28b).But in the next part of the Berakhot7 passage about God’s prayer, we encounter268the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"an interesting reversal: God “stands” in the presence of a mortal, Rabbi Ishmaelben Elisha, and the latter formulates God’s prayer for him as a blessing.It was taught: R. Ishmael b. Elisha says: I once entered into the inner-most part [of the Sanctuary] and saw Akathriel Jah, the Lord of Hosts,seated upon a high and exalted throne. He said to me: Ishmael, myson, bless me! I replied: May it be Thy will that Thy mercy may sup-press Thy anger and Thy mercy may prevail over Thy other attributes,so that Thou mayest deal with Thy children according to the attributeof mercy and mayest, on their behalf, stop short of the limit of strictjustice! And He nodded to me with His head. Here we learn [inciden-tally] that the blessing of an ordinary man must not be consideredlightly in your eyes.86What an encounter! In this recapitulation of the previous discussion ofGod’s prayer, we are suddenly transported from the realm of the holy andabstract into the immanent, concrete world—in fact, to God’s dwelling placeon earth, where his “prayer” is transformed into a blessing from a mortal—extraordinarily, solicited by him. With his nod, God acquiesces to Ishmael’sblessing, whose words are, as we will learn, those of God’s own prayer.About 960 B.C.E., at the dedication of the Temple, the tension implicit inthe notion of an earthly, finite “house” for the holy, infinite One appears alreadyin Solomon’s words: “But will God dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and thehighest heaven cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I havebuilt!” ( 1 Kgs. 8:27). However, the Temple has a special role as a focus of humanprayer. Because of God’s gracious condescension to live among his people,Solomon directs the prayers of Israel to the Temple, asking God to “hearthe plea of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward thisplace” (1 Kings 8:30; see also 2 Chronicles 6:21, 26). And “[I]f your people goout to battle against their enemy, by whatever way you shall send them, andthey pray to the Lord toward the city that you have chosen and the house that Ihave built for your name, then hear in heaven their prayer and their pleas, andmaintain their cause” (1 Kings 8:44). In 1 Kings 8:46–50, Israelites taken cap-tive are enjoined to turn to the land, the city, and the house of God, where he isurged to hear their prayer and forgive their transgressions. In the book ofDaniel, written C. 165 B.C.E. in response to the persecution of Antiochus IV, theexiled Daniel is said to have worshiped three times daily in an upper room ofhis house in Babylon where he “had windows made facing Jerusalem” to thewest (Daniel 6:11). By the Mishnaic period, the custom became the legal norm(b. Berakhot4:5). All Jews “should direct their hearts to one place in worship.”87We encounter in this story a compelling geography of the sacred. EveryJew living in the Diaspora is bound to turn toward Israel when he or she prays.If in Israel, one should turn toward Jerusalem. If in Jerusalem, Jewish prayer isdirected to the Temple Mount. If one is actually on the Temple Mount, the prayeris directed to site of the Holy of Holies within the Temple itself. And here, en-throned in the Holy of Holies, we discover God himself blessed by Ishmaelthe observant god of the talmud269"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"with the words of his own prayer! In this centrifugal diagram of mandatedprayer, divine prayer for the resolution of a volatile divine polarity resides at thecenter.“What Does He Pray?”R. Jo.hanan has asked what God prays. In the name of Rab, Rabbi Zut.ra b. Tobiinforms him of the exact divine wording: “May it be My Will that My mercy maysuppress My anger, and that My mercy may prevail over My [other] attributes, sothat I may deal with my children in the attribute of mercy and, on their behalf,stop short of the limit of strict justice.88The content of God’s prayer is com-pelling. “May it be My Will”—his own customized variant of the formulaic “Mayit be Thy will,” beginning the majority of the countless prayers in rabbinicliterature—“that My mercy prevail over My justice and all My other attributes.”This is a direct reference to the thirteen divine attributes enumerated in Exodus34:6 and discussed in the passage in b. Rosh Hashanah3b. This is not a uniquetheme in the Talmud; for example, b. Rosh Hashanah17b contains a collectiverabbinic observation of God’s two attributes and their paradoxical coexistence:R. Huna contrasted [two parts of the same verse]: It is written, TheLord is righteous in all his ways,and then it is written, and gracious inall his works.[Ps. 147, 17] [How is this?]—At first righteous and at theend gracious. R. Eleazar [similarly] contrasted two texts. It is written,Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy,and then it is written, For Thourenderest to ever y man according to his work.Ps. 67, 13. [How is this?]—At first, Thou renderest to ever y man according to his work,but at theend,unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy.Ilfi...[similarly] contrastedtwo texts: It is written, abundant in goodness,and then it is written,and in truth.[Ex. 34, 6].But nowhere else in the Talmud does God himself pray. Although judge of theworld, God wishes to let a higher compassion (middat haddin) overwhelm hissense of what the world truly deserves (middat hara.hamim). The rabbis called himRa.hmana(the Merciful); Avot2:19 teaches that “the world is judged by grace.”This is in fact a divine version of the efficacy of prayer toward the same hu-man goal. B. Yevamot64a tells us that prayer can turn God’s attribute from one ofanger to one of compassion: “The Holy One, blessed be He, longs for the prayerof the righteous. Why is the prayer of the righteous likened to a shovel?89In thesame way that a shovel removes produce from one place to another, so that theprayer of the righteous turns his attribute of anger to one of compassion.” Prayerserves to overcome our own evil impulses.Y. Berakhot7d also asks for the triumph of one human attribute over an-other: “May it be acceptable before Thee, O Lord my God and God of my fa-thers, that Thou break and cause to cease the yoke of the evil impulse from ourhearts, for Thou hast created us to perform Thy will and so we are bound to do.Such is Thy desire and such is our desire, too. But what impedes us? The270the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"leaven in the dough. It is revealed and known before Thee, O Lord my God andGod of my fathers, that Thou cause it to cease from upon us and subdue it sothat we may do Thy will as our will with a perfect heart.” Human beings do nothave the strength to resolve the dual claims unceasingly brought to bear uponour moral compass; God does. In the vision of the Talmud, one relies on prayerto God to achieve the right outcome. God’s own prayer can achieve this trans-formation from justice to mercy. As the source of all being, he alone can re-order not only ourown but also hisown inclinations. It is his goal, and hisprayer is efficacious.This dualistic divine internal conflict is a self-contained struggle on a titanicscale. And the resolution asked for by God will not be some relative synthesisbut rather the temporary triumph of one of his qualities which is the completeopposite of its rival.90We have already seen God’s transfer from the Throne ofJudgment to the Throne of Mercy in b.\\Avodah Zarah3b; this is also echoed inLeviticus Rabbah29:1 and 29:3 and most dramatically in the passage from Pe-siqta de-Rav Kahanawhich is read at the Liturgy of the New Year.When the Holy One, blessed is Heascends His throne on the New Year,He first sits on the Throne ofJudgement. But when Israel, assembledin the synagogue, sounds the Shofar,He rises from the Throne of Judgementand ascends the Throne of Mercy.91In the ancient Near Eastern Poem of Erra,the god Erra (scorched earth) isprovoked by the god I ̆sum (fire) into dethroning Marduk, the king of Babylon,and laying the city waste; the two gods then seem to switch roles and Erra is re-buked by I ̆sum for the slaughter of just and unjust alike; Erra restores bothMarduk and the city.92Jon Levenson wonders whether “the superficial narrativeof the poem, in which the two are represented as different gods, is best not ac-cepted as definitive, but rather viewed as a projection...of the deep psycho-logical dynamics internal to one God, Erra-I ̆sum.”93In the Hebrew Bible, justone God—the only God—does indeed seem to suffer a continual psychic pen-dulum swing between his two main attributes. He is inherently benevolent andrestorative, and yet, just as deeply rooted in his nature, his chaotic and destruc-tive side continues to threaten creation.94We have seen that the idea of God’s goodness and the idea of his ab-solute sovereignty are in contradiction. Affirm either, and the other iscast into doubt. It is characteristic of Judaism that it tends to accept thecontradiction as tolerable rather than to reject it as fatal.That is, Judaismgenerally sees it as a paradox,a mystery of the faith, if you will, or acreative tension....This dialectical theology of divine goodness andtotal sovereignty, in which each is read in the light of the other, un-derscores our awareness of the eeriness, the uncanniness of the Godof Israel.95the observant god of the talmud271"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"B. Berakhot7a proceeds with a discussion of the mood of anger as it occursin God, and the length of time one must wait for it to pass. Apparently God isangry every day.96And so it is important that God prays each day, not that heonce did pray. The divine self-intervention must take place continually, unceas-ingly. Furthermore, his prayer is far more than a divine model for pious hu-manity. It is a mechanism for the ongoing preservation of the world, a petitionthat only God can make and, reflexively, that only he can grant. Just as God canswear only by his own holiness in Psalm 89:34–36,97so there is no authority tohear or grant God’s prayer higher than himself.Why Does God Pray That His Mercy May Prevail over His Justice?The dichotomy between God’s mercy and his wrath, and the profound hope forthe prevalence of the former over the latter, was a ubiquitous theme throughoutHebrew scripture as it corresponded to Israel’s cataclysmic history. But per-haps at no time was this hope so poignantly invoked as after the Roman de-struction of the Temple. The prayer in Berakhotis God’s own hope for himself.Although the scene with Rabbi Ishmael takes place with God still dwelling onthe mercy seat within his house, the story was probably told and surelyredacted after the razing of the Temple and the flight of Joh.anan to Javneh in70C.E. Analogous talmudic texts bear this out in their chronology: “Since the Ex-ile,the Shekhinah mourns and God prays: May it be My Will that in My dealingswith My children My mercy overcome My Justice [italics added].” What was tobe the theological interpretation of the destruction of the Temple?Sacrifice was still possible among the ruins until the final Roman architec-tural insult on its site in 135 C.E., and Israel could hope for the Temple’srestoration—as witnessed in the yearning of y. Berakhot7d: “Rebuild Thy Tem-ple and Thy city speedily in our days.”98But Hadrian’s violent suppression ofthe Bar Kokhba uprising of 132–135 C.E. caused the martyrdom of Rabbi Akiva,with the Shema\\on his lips—he who had reorganized the Mishnah and foundbiblical bases for the tenets of the oral law. Its lethal climax also saw the prohi-bition of circumcision, and the end of any surviving hope for the renaissance ofthe Temple cult with the construction of a temple of Jupiter Capitolinus on thefoundations of the sacred ruins. Not only was the sacrificial cult extinct but sowas any hope of its reinstitution in the near future.We have seen that in midrashic parables, God was thought to mourn the lossof his Temple as a king mourns that of his palace. In Pisqa 16:8 of the Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana,providing an exegesis on Isaiah 40:1 (“Comfort ye, comfort yeMy people”), God beckons the prophets to go together with him to comfortJerusalem: “Comfort her, ye who are in the regions above, comfort her, ye whoare in the regions below....It is all these I mean by yewhen I say comfort ye,Comfort ye with Me.”99But Rabbi Abin (Avin) poses the hypothetical situationof a king whose palace burns down: “Who is to be comforted, the palace or theowner of the palace? Is it not the owner of the palace who should be comforted?272the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Likewise, the Holy One, saying, The Temple is My Palace, ‘And it is My palacethat lieth waste’ (Haggai 1:9), went on to ask, Who then requires comforting? Isit not I? Hence Comfort, comfort, My people(Isa. 40:1)—comfort Me, comfortMe, O my People.”100God’s mighty grief and his demand for comfort from hisbeloved creatures pierce the heart of the hearer.But just as the first destruction of the Temple by the neo-Babylonians in thesixth century B.C.E., and the first exile, were construed as God’s punishmentupon Israel’s wickedness and unfaithfulness, so a certain school of thought at-tributed the same reason to the second national disaster. In many writings,God’s wrath and mourning exist together. Certain parables make it clear thatGod regrets his decision to allow the disaster as much as he mourns the Tem-ple’s loss; but it is regret for a decision clearly made by him.That the loss of the Temple was seen, at least by some Jewish writers of theRoman Imperial period, as a deliberate act or allowance by God is proved notonly by 2 Baruch but also, for example, by Lamentations Rabbah2:7. God was,after all, omniscient and all-powerful. Commenting on Lamentations 2:7, “TheLord has rejected His altar,”R. Haggai said in the name of R. Isaac:It is like the inhabitants of a province who prepared banquets (liter-ally: set tables) for the king. They provoked him, but he bore withthem. The king said: The only reason the inhabitants of this provinceprovoke me is because [they rely upon] these banquets that they haveprepared for me. Here, it is thrown down in their faces!Similarly, the Holy One, blessed be he, said: The only reason Is-rael provoked Me is because [they rely upon] the sacrifice that theyused to offer before me. Here, it is thrown down in their faces!101As in the case of 2 Baruch, certain first- and second-century C.E. Jewishwritings purporting to respond to the First Temple destruction in fact treat thesecond event, much as Herodotus wrote of the Persian War while in fact pro-viding political and moral commentary on the Peloponnesian War, or ArthurMiller treated the Salem witch trials in his play The Cruciblewhile livingthrough the McCarthy hearings, a contemporary “witch hunt.” If in fact thesecond destruction was any barometer of God’s wrathful justice against Israel,then the rabbinic report of his own prayer that his mercy, the more clementpart of his nature, might overcome his angry side is indeed understandable.After 70 C.E., Judaism was reoriented, but with a definite hope for God’sclemency, and, perhaps as Berakhot7a shows, a need to insist on it.“The House of My Prayer”God is praying. But to whom? I would suggest that he is praying as much “fromhimself ” or “because of himself ” as “to himself.” “To whom is God praying?” isthe observant god of the talmud273"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"a question that invites a rationalistic answer unworthy of subtle and paradoxicalmidrash. The phrase “The house of My prayer” in Isaiah 56:7 may not anticipateb. Berakhot7a, but may make a more general statement about prayer. Prayer thatis directed toGod is as much “God’s prayer” as the one he makes himself.Prayer is a consecrated activity; whether supplication or praise, spontaneous orprescribed, individual or congregational, it is part of God’s sphere and it ac-quires his attribute of holiness. It belongs to him. When God prays, he under-takes and takes part in prayer. Midrash is “parabolic” not only in that it oftenmakes its theological points through parables; parabolic, too, is the energeticrealm of prayer, catapulting endlessly from God to his people and back again.God and Israel are at each end of the inclusive parabola that is prayer. Ulti-mately, however, prayer, whether divine or human, is God’s.An excellent analogue is the genre of blessing. In Hebrew scripture, humanbeings bless one another. But Christopher Mitchell has convincingly shown thatthroughout known patriarchal blessing promises, God is the original source ofblessing.102Blessing is never procured through the autonomous, magical powerof the spoken word. God makes promises in the first person; moreover, the bib-lical narratives describe God as able to fulfill his promises directly. For example,God says to Abraham concerning Sarah, “I will bless her, and give a son to youfrom her (Gen. 17:16).” The fulfillment is reported by the simple statement,“YHWH did to Sarah what he said he would do” (Genesis 21:1). There is nomention of any means or indirect agent. In Genesis 12:3a, there is an apparentlydeliberate effort to portray God as the originator of blessing and curse: “I willbless those who bless you, and him who curses you I will curse.”103To summarize: God’s prayer has two crucial didactic purposes in b. Be-rakhot7a. In the first place, it reinforces prayer as a miz.vah,at a time whenprayer had explicitly replaced sacrifice in the liturgical life of Israel. A person-ally involved God participates in ritual prayer himself. Second, it portrays Godas desiring his merciful attributes to prevail over his just (or wrathful) ones.The theological truth that God would always ultimately show compassion to-ward his people had been affirmed throughout the history of Israel, indeed atevery apocalypse and every renewal of the covenant. But it was especially im-portant now that God’s very house, the “tent of meeting” where he had said hewould meet with his people (Exodus 25:22) had been wiped from the earth.Some writings of the period, such as 2 Baruch and even Lamentations Rabbahmake it clear that God was indeed wroth to allow such an event, although Israelis hard-pressed to explain why. Even those writings that mention God’s angeralso describe his broken heart, and the mourning that attends his sorrow. Butboth theologies, which are for all practical purposes the same theology, woulddemand a reassurance—the same that God had given through history—thathis mercy would consistently, in fact, daily prevail over his justice.Finally, this prayer is happening in the present: “God prays,” not “Godprayed.” God’s continuous activity is a not a one-time intercession with him-self. Like the worshipful study of Torah in the passage we will next consider, itis an ongoing theurgic act. In the Hebrew Prayer Book, God is said to be “re-newing the creation every day continually.” God’s prayer, like the sacrifices of274the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"the Vedic gods, does not end. But whereas the Vedic divine sacrifice is a cosmi-cally recreative act, the prayer of Akathriel Jah is a redemptive act that sparesthe cosmos. This redemptive, reflexive verbal action is imagined as takingplace at the world’s very center, the Holy of Holies.104God Studies Torah: \\Avodah Zarah3bIn the talmudic tractate b.\\Avodah Zarah,we find the rabbis embroiled in aheated conference about whether God laughs and if so, when.105They are in-trigued by Psalm 2:4: “He who sits in the heavens laughs.” There is only oneday on which God laughs, according to Rabbi Isaac, which some connectedwith Rabbi Jose’s representation of the great battle of the Messianic age, whenidol-worshipers will pass themselves off as pious proselytes only to be exposedunder the leadership of Gog and Magog (Ezekiel 39). These will most surely belaughed at by God. But Rab Judah counters in the name of Rab that God laughsduring the course of his normal daily routine—when he is sporting with thegreat sea-dwelling Leviathan at day’s end. In the course of the rabbinic conver-sation, we also learn that God studies his own Torah in the morning.Then each of the proselytes will throw aside his religious token andget away, as it is said, Let us break their bands asunder.[Ps. 2:1], and Hethat sitteth in heaven laugheth[Ps. 2:4]. [It was on this that] R. Isaac re-marked that there is no laughter for the Holy One, blessed be He, ex-cept on that day. But is there not, indeed? Yet Rab Judah said in thename of Rab: “The day consists of twelve hours; during the first threehours the Holy One, blessed be He, is occupying himself with theTorah, during the second three He sits in judgment on the wholeworld, and when He sees that the world is so guilty as to deserve de-struction, He transfers himself from the seat of Justice to the seat ofMercy; during the third quarter, He is feeding the whole world, fromthe horned buffalo to the brood of vermin; during the fourth quarterHe is sporting with the Leviathan as it is said, There is leviathan,whom Thou hast formed to sport therewith?” [Ps. 104:26] Said R.Nah.man b. Isaac: Yes, he sports with His creatures, but does notlaugh at his creatures except on that day.106Next, sadly, R. Aha comments to R. Nah.man b. Isaac: “Since the day of the de-struction of the temple, there is no laughter for the Holy One, blessed be He.”107\\Oseq BattorahWe have noted that Torah study is the supreme devotional activity, valued evenmore highly than prayer. Thus it is important that God himself is said to un-dertake this activity daily; in fact, as for the pious, it is his first scheduled periodof each day. But exactly what is the Holy One doing in relation to Torah? Couldthe observant god of the talmud275"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"it not be the case that he is simply contemplating his own creation, or makingprovisions for its further dissemination among humanity? The Hebrew phraseused in this passage, the substantive participle \\oseq battorah,in mishnaic andtalmudic usages carries with it far more meaning than simply “one who isstudying.” With a secular object, \\oseqmeans “occupying oneself with, doingbusiness, arguing or dealing with (an affair).”108Sacred objects such as the Lawor Torah attract this activity, so that it has the expanded meaning of “occupyingoneself with, studying, reflecting on, or teaching” the Law (or Torah) (\\oseq bat-torah). In the Mishnah, which is older than the Gemara, \\oseq battorahhas thesame sense. Avot6a speaks of “everyone who occupies himself in Torah”; “Youhave no student except one who studies the Torah” (Avot6b).109At least half of the time when \\oseqappears in the Talmud, it is with the Lawor the Torah as object, in forms of the same phrase as in b.\\Abodah Zarah.110Inb. So.ta21a, we learn that “Hillel occupied himself with the Torah.”111The sen-tence “He is occupied with the Law of his creator [especially the Torah or versesof it]” occurs in b. Berakhot9a;b. Rosh Hashanah59c;b. Shabbat4b;b. Ta\\anit64b; and Lamentations Rabbah16a. Other instances include: “He is occupiedwith the Torah for three hours each day” (Deut. 32:4); “They were sitting occu-pied with that verse” Pirqe de-Rav Kahana316:7;Lamentations Rabbah83:7; andb. Sukkoth55b.112Similarly, in the reflexive, when used with Law or Torah, itmeans “one who occupies oneself with”: for example, “If you want to occupyyourselves with the Law, you should recite Shema\\before midnight and (then)occupy yourselves.”113We have seen that the divine presence is with those whoare “sitting and studying Torah” (b. Berakhot6a). Of Rabbi Akiva (called “theRescuer of the Torah” in Sifre to Deuteronomy48), the rabbis taught in b. Be-rakhot61, “Once the wicked Government [i.e. Roman] issued a decree forbid-ding the Jews to study and practise the Torah. Pappus b. Judah came and foundR. Akiba publicly bringing gatherings together and occupying himself with theTorah (\\oseq battorah).”114To repeat our question, why does God study Torah? To undertake a re-sponse, we must first appreciate the nature of his relationship with the Torahduring the rabbinic period. First of all, especially after 70 C.E.,\\oseq battorahwasmore than study of Scripture, an enriching activity. Like prayer, it was a miz.vah,an orienting religious activity, one that changed the actor, in turn activatingdivine interest. A people that had survived by choosing to “make a fence aroundthe Torah” and if necessary, literally die rather than be religiously assimilated,was strongly dependent on the halakhic judicial process. But Torah was more: Itwas the mind of God.What they [the Pharisees] sought was the full and inexhaustible reve-lation which God had made. Contents of that revelation, they held,was to be found in the first instance in the Written Text of the Penta-teuch; but the revelation, the real Torah, was the meaningof that Writ-ten Text, the divine thought therein disclosed, as unfolded in evergreater richness of detail by successive generations of devoted teach-ers. “Apart from the direct intercourse of prayer,” says [Travers]276the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Herford, “the study of Torah was the way of closest approach to God;it might be called the Pharisaic form of the Beatific Vision. To studyTorah was to think God’s thought after Him, as Kepler said.”115The rabbis thought that Proverbs 8:22–23 identifies the Torah with preex-istent wisdom. Wisdom says, “The Lord created me at the beginning of hiswork, the first of his acts of old. Ages ago I was set up, at the first, from the be-ginning of the earth.” As such, the Torah was agent of the process of creationand the structure of the cosmos. Genesis Rabbah1:1 says that God planned theuniverse using the Torah: “The Torah said, I was the architectural instrument ofthe Holy One, blessed be He.” Spinning a mashalof its own, the Torah pointsout that a human king, when he constructs a palace, does not follow his ownideas but those of an architect. An architect has parchments and tablets to knowhow to plan rooms and entrances. “So did the Holy One, blessed be He, lookinto the Torah and created the Universe accordingly.” Similarly, Philo writes,“God having determined to found a mighty state, first of all conceived its formin His mind, according to which form He made a world perceptible only by theintellect, and then completed one visible to the external senses, using the firstone as a model.”116The study of Torah also provided a divine link to the hereafter. The tractate wehave been considering, b.\\Avodah Zarah3b, asserts shortly after the story of Godoccupying himself with Torah that “To him who is engaged in the study of Torahin this world, which is likened unto the night, the Holy One, blessed be He, ex-tends the thread of grace in the future world, which is likened unto the day, as itis said: By day the Lord,etc.”In other words, the study of Torah was the quintessential activity of Ju-daism in this time period. God gave the Torah, and Israel alone accepted it.117Originally “the ideal of the religion of the Rabbis was the extension of God’sKingship over all the peoples of the world.”118The Sifrato Leviticus 18:5 (“Yeshall therefore keep My statutes and Mine ordinances, which if a man do, heshall live by them”) claims that “even a Gentile who obeys the Torah is the equalof the High Priest.” Nevertheless Rabbi Joh.anan sharply clarifies: “A Gentilewho occupies himself with the study of Torah is deserving of death, as it is said,‘Moses commanded us a Torah, an inheritance for the assembly of Israel[Deut. 33:4]—the inheritance is for us, not for them’ ” (b. Sanhedrin59a). Simi-lar to the struggle over the Decalogue, but with a radically different approach(for the Torah could not be likewise dropped from the tefillin), forceful efforts todistinguish Israel’s receipt of the Torah, as Cohen observes, “were in all proba-bility called for by the rise of the Christian Church whose members also stud-ied the scriptures and claimed that the Divine Grace rested upon them.”119There can be no doubt that God’s daily three-hour Torah session serves asa powerful endorsement for the holy activity of \\oseq battorah. God not onlygives the Torah; he is its student. This seems to be the understanding in ExodusRabbah30:9: “The attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He, are unlike thoseof a human being. The latter instructs others what they are to do but may notpractice it himself. Not so is the Holy One, blessed be He; whatever he doesthe observant god of the talmud277"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"He commands Israel to perform.” But is God’s study of the Torah described in\\Avodah Zarahpurely to inspire mortals to do the same? Tractate Baba Mez.i\\aprovides a surprising answer: Interpretation of the Torah, and even the Torahitself, has become the exclusive province of the rabbis now, and no longer be-longs to God.120The Torah Prevails over Miracles and Is No Longer God’sIn the wake of the loss of the sacrifice, “rabbinic intellectualism turned into adisciplined argument the interplay of proof and refutation, a holy activity.”121The wording of sacred texts became ascendant over the circumstances inwhich they were pronounced; this would have important repercussions in post-talmudic spirituality.122One of the most important effects of this process wasthe diminishing of the influence of miracles. In the miracle-oriented Hellenis-tic, Imperial, and Late Antique periods, we must see this as yet another rab-binic concern for the sanctity and uniqueness of the ancientrevelation of theTorah on Mount Sinai.Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus disputed with the entire remaining rabbinateconcerning an issue of ritual uncleanness of a tiled oven. He challenged them,“If the halachahagrees with me, let this carob-tree prove it! Thereupon thecarob-tree was torn a hundred cubits out of its place—others affirm, four hun-dred cubits. ‘No proof can be brought from a carob-tree,’ ” they retorted.123Astream flowed backward, inspired by the same oath on the part of Eliezer, andthe walls of the schoolhouse began to fall to prove that he was right, until theywere rebuked by Rabbi Joshua, “When scholars are engaged in a halachicdis-pute, what have ye to interfere?” Whereupon the walls did not fall, in honor ofJoshua, nor stand upright in honor of Eliezer (“And they are still standing thusinclined”). Finally the rabbis were challenged by the heavenly Bat Qol,literally,the “daughter of a voice,” who cried out, “Why do you dispute with R. Eliezer,seeing that in all matters the halachahagrees with him!”But even this was not enough. In a surprising turn of events, God himselfwas rebuked by the rabbis. “But R. Joshua arose and exclaimed: ‘The Torah isnot in the heavens (Hattorah lo›bashamayim hi›),’124What did he mean bythis?—Said R. Jeremiah: That the Torah had already been given at Mount Sinai;we pay no attention to a Heavenly Voice, because Thou hast long since writtenin the Torah at Mount Sinai, After the majority one must decline.”125R. Nathanthen quizzed Elijah about God’s reaction to this, “What did the Holy One,blessed be He, do in that hour?—He laughed [with joy], he replied, saying, ‘Mysons have defeated Me, My sons have defeated me.’ ”126All the objects thatRabbi Eliezer had declared as clean were then burned in a fire, and by vote hewas excommunicated.This emphasis on the subservience of even God to his own Torah serves tocounter the influence of a charismatic personality who challenges the estab-lished rabbinic school. As Anson Laytner points out, “What is so extraordinaryabout this story is that in so miracle-minded an age, the Rabbis could reject all278the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"proofs based on miracles, which is to say they rejected divine input—even rev-elation by means of the Bat Kol—in their halakhic decisions....It is as R. Je-remiah interprets: once God gave the Torah to Israel, it is Israel’s to use, and Is-rael has the freedom to challenge God’s will based on the laws themselves.”127In the Hellenistic atmosphere of charismatic holy men, the rabbis felt it neces-sary to downplay miraculous events; such individualistic phenomena detractedfrom their own collective authority.128It is interesting that the Bat Qolis obeyedelsewhere in the Talmud. Alexander Guttman makes the case that becauseEliezer was arrested and acquitted by Roman authorities on charges of Chris-tianity, and because this particular dispute centers on ritual purity laws, it wasabsolutely necessary to counteract the authority of this particular “holy man.”“The Bat Qol, a post-Biblical revelation, at first recognized as the highest au-thority in deciding the BetHillel versus BetShammai controversies and play-ing elsewhere a role in legal matters, later became all but outlawed. This stepwas taken about the time when Pharisaic Judaism became aware of the immi-nent danger coming from nascent Christianity which had previously been con-sidered as one of the many obscure ephemeral sects. With such revelation, allother miracle had been outlawed, too, as an active agent influencing the deci-sion of halakiccontroversies.”129God’s Torah no longer belonged to him to alter or even to interpret on anongoing basis. One of the qualities of divine reflexivity, as we have observed, isits function in reinforcing religious dogma and practice. When the idea ap-pears in art, liturgy, or scripture, something—usually some aspect of worshipor belief that is threatened or problematic—is often endangered.God occupies himself with Torah in \\Avodah Zarahbecause, in a sense,Torah study, and not his numinous intervention in history, was the new systoleand diastole of Judaism. “To learn Torah was thus a kind of sober mysticism, areliving of the events at Sinai, while to add to the growing body of ‘oral’ law wasto share in a divine activity. Already in the Talmud God is depicted as studyingTorah several hours a day (B.T., ‘A.Z.3b), but the kinship between the rabbi andGod was felt to be even stronger. By increasing the amount of Torah in theworld, the rabbi could do what previously only God had been held able to ac-complish.”130Every Jewish male of age studied Torah; everyone sought to par-ticipate in it, including God. The rabbis had stepped onto his platform, and asthey studied together, Great Originator of the Law and its devoted exegetes,Father of All and his quarrelsome children, the Torah was enriched andenlivened.Why Does the Talmudic God Observe?Why does God behave in these ways? Should the interpretation of suchmidrashic texts cause us to label it, in the spirit of the rabbis, teyqu—an insolu-ble problem? Since the imitation of God was such an important goal of rabbinicteaching, perhaps we should simply be content with Arthur Cohen’s assess-ment of the genre of talmudic passages that we have been considering: “Morethe observant god of the talmud279"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"probably the thought behind them is the doctrine of imitation....the Imitationof God is a cardinal principle of human conduct in Rabbinic ethics, and it ap-plies to the whole of life—to religious observances as well as to moral conduct.God is accordingly represented as Himself obeying the precepts which He de-sires Israel to observe.”131These descriptions of divinely practiced religion are indeed strange. Theirony and playfulness of the portraits of God we have seen are true to the spiritof Haggadah; they make us smile, or do a double take. But the rabbinic idiomoften relies on wit or shock value as a rhetorical enforcer.132At the same time,it reinforces certain ritual observances, the miz.votwhich were rabbinic Ju-daism’s centerpiece. The observant God of the Talmud is no exception.As in the ancient Greek case, divine reflexivity in the rabbinical imagina-tion was a response to a specific period in religious history. The tradition re-acted to assault by promoting certain alternative forms of worship. The Templeand sacrifice were gone; prayer and the devotional study of the law replacedthem. God himself therefore prayed and studied the law. Divine reflexivity alsoreinforced very particular types of praxis, as part of a general effort to suppresssectarian movements such as Jewish Christianity and gnosticism. As also mayhave been true in the Greek case, divine reflexivity arose when certain practicescentral to the faith were endangered and facing very real threats. In an atmos-phere of collective religious anxiety, scriptural ideology can and will performthis custodial function.133As the Talmud “throughout the centuries of persecu-tion and darkness...saved Israel from intellectual and moral degradation,”134so these paradoxical instances of God’s practiced religion are consistent withthat effort and perhaps with that result. To return to David Stern’s point, God’sundertaking of these practices confers on them an “ultimate reality” which nohuman being, no matter how revered, could offer. In so doing, the practices areconcretized, ratified, and intensified within the tradition by its supreme focusand ultimate ground of being—God himself.It is important that God’s ritual behavior often has a character unique andhighly appropriate to himself. He is not, as we wondered at the beginning ofthis discussion, simply a larger Jew. He is Lord of Israel and “master of theUniverse.” We have seen that his religion is notexactly like that of human be-ings. It is rather, deliberately and carefully presented as modified to fit God’sunique and omnipotent nature. That is what gives these passages their power;they are extremely attentive to the ritual nuances resulting from the strange sit-uation of God as observant religious practitioner. The scrolls in divine tefillinhave prayers that differ from these found in human tefillin, reflecting his partof the covenantal relationship with Israel. When God mourns mortal loss, hedoes so in his own immortal way and on his own global scale. When he prays,he modifies the human formula, and prays that it be hiswill that his mercymight overcome his justice.This, then, goes far beyond the divine establishment of paradigm. This isreciprocal religion. As in the case of divine libation in classical Greek vase-painting, where certain iconographic details make it clear that the gods’ prac-ticed rituals in fact belong uniquely to them, the divine inhabits its own world280the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"and makes its own rules. Far from being “anthropomorphic” when undertakenby God, religious observance is in fact both likeandunlikeits human analogue.Just as in ancient Greek epic, where there are tantalizing reference to the gods’own special language, whereby in the Iliadthe river Skamandros is called Xan-thos and in the Odyssey,Circe’s plant is called molyby the gods, the ritualsphere of action of which God himself is the center and agent refers to theknown elements of religious tradition, but in a “marked” way. We might evenconsider whether it is the human religious observance that is the variant, re-sponsive to divine catalysis. The “religion of the gods” can serve as a model forhuman beings, but it has ontological self-sufficiency, and not just because ob-servance itself is holy: Divine reflexivity does not derive its “charge” from reli-gious demarcation. In the religion of Israel, as the faithful conceive it, religiousactivity originates in the godhead and is then refracted by the human realm,not the other way around.the observant god of the talmud281"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"9“God and His Angels Pray for the Prophet”A Qur›a ̄nic ParadigmCall down blessing on him with that .sala ̄twith which Thou didst calldown blessing on him in the mih.ra ̄bof Thy transcendent holinessand the Ipseity of Thine intimacy.—Ah.mad al-Tı ̄ja ̄nı ̄1S.alla ̄›lla ̄h \\alayhi wa-sallama:“God bless [the Prophet] and give himpeace.” This benediction, one of the most common in Islam, isknown in Arabic as the tas.liyah,oras.-s.ala ̄t \\ala ̄Muh.ammad.2A Mus-lim would no more mention the Prophet’s name without this formu-laic prayer, the “calling down of blessings upon the prophet” (s.ala ̄t \\ala ̄›n-nabı ̄), or that of Alla ̄h without phrases of magnification, than therabbis would have mentioned the name of God without adding,“blessed be He.”3From the time of the earliest Muslim commentaries through thepresent, the devotional tas.liyahhas been exclusively derived from theQur›a ̄nic Su ̄ rah 33, verse 56:“Allah and His Angels send blessings (yus.all ̄una\\ala ̄) on theProphet. O ye that believe! Send ye blessings on him, and salute himwith all respect.”4The practice of the benediction has been describedas nothing less than a divine command: “Know that the command tocall down blessing on the Prophet was given in the second year of theHijra,and it is said that it was on the night of the Isra ̄\\; there is a tradi-tion...that the month of Sha\\ba ̄n is the month of calling down bless-ing on the chosen Prophet because the verse commanding it was sentdown in that month[i.e. Qur. 33.56].”5The verse that is the basis for the s.ala ̄t \\ala ̄›n-nabı ̄originally de-scribed not a human blessing of the Prophet but the action of Godand his angels. We find a harbinger of its usage earlier in the Su ̄ rah,"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"at 33:43: “Oh, ye who believe! Celebrate the praises of Allah, and do so often;and glorify Him morning and evening. He it is Who sends Blessings on you, asdo His angels, that He may bring you out from the depths of Darkness intoLight: And He is Full of Mercy to the Believers.” As in verse 56, only one verbalphrase is used: s.alla ̄\\ala ̄, even though—for reasons that we shall considerpresently—it is often translated from the Arabic differently when God is thesubject than when the angels are.However, like those devout exegetes, we immediately confront a thorny co-nundrum: The verb describing the action of God and the angels, s.alla ̄\\ala ̄in allother contexts means “to pray for or over”—in other words, “to pray on behalfof ” someone. That is how it is used in its other Qur›a ̄nic contexts where thesubjects of the verb are human rather than divine. S.alla ̄\\ala ̄,as Ah.mad al-Tı ̄ja ̄nı ̄rightly observes, carries with it the liturgical force of the s.ala ̄t,the five daily for-mal prayers enjoined upon the faithful in the Qur›a ̄n.6S.alla ̄\\ala ̄means “to per-form ritual intercession for.” Or that is what it wouldincontrovertibly mean,were not Alla ̄hal-wa ̄h.id(the One),7al-h.ayy(the Living),8al-muta a ̄\\li(the exaltedin and through himself; great above all, most high).9Does God, whose tran-scendence Islam describes as inconceivable, and who cannot be limited, really“pray for” the Prophet, one of his own creatures? Immediately we are in verydeep and by now familiar waters.God’s prayer for the Prophet in the Qur›a ̄n represents perhaps the mostacute case of divine reflexivity we have considered thus far, in that from its be-ginnings Islam has insisted so strongly on the uniqueness, indivisibility, and ab-solutely uncompromised noncontingency of the godhead. Whereas the libationof Zeus or Apollo may have seemed to the ancient Greek philosophical mind“strange and paradoxical” or even “absurd,” within Islamic theology and corre-sponding heresiology, the idea of God performing ritual prostrations in prayerborders on inconceivability. That such a description is found first not in later the-ological speculation but in the Qur›a ̄n, the holy revelation of God to humankind,and not once but twice, along with many other passages that seem to support thisvision of God’s dynamic prayer, is hard to imagine.The verbal noun tashbı ̄h,when used in describing God, describes a hereti-cal theological move of “comparing; immanence; symbolic interpretation; an-thropomorphism.”10It may, for example, attend the comparison of “a DivineQuality to a cosmic or human one in order to make it comprehensible.”11Thisand its accompanying terms ta\\tı ̄landtanzı ̄hrepresent the monumental theo-logical and philosophical debate within Islam examined below in the sectionon Alla ̄h. This was the nigh-impossible struggle to render intelligible, and toworship, a living deity, while also avoiding the dangers of dragging that un-speakably powerful, abstract deity down to human level. If Judaism was deeplyperturbed over the centuries by this problem (as for example, witnessed inMoses Maimonides’s impassioned proofs against divine anthropomorphismin his Guide for the Perplexed), Islam was agonized.But is the case of Su ̄ rah 33:56 an instance of anthropomorphism? God’ss.ala ̄tis not so much a divine quality as a divine action. And how “human” isthat action? How much is it conceived of as resembling human prayer?284the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Muslim theologians did struggle with how best to understand God’s para-doxicals.ala ̄tupon his Messenger, Muh.ammad—and some, like the great Sufimystic Maula ̄na ̄ Jala ̄luddı ̄n Ru ̄mı ̄, reveled in it. For the philosopher Ibn al-\\Arabı ̄, God’s prayer was not only not paradoxical; it was the heartbeat of thetheophanic imagination. Basing his discussion on Su ̄ rah 33:42, God becomes,in Ibn \\Arabı ̄’s writing, the mus.allı ̄, “he who prays,”12mirroring the rabbinic im-age of the .tallit-wrapped God as the Ba›al tefillin.In the previously considered classical Greek, ancient Israelite, Christian,and talmudic traditions we have seen that if we have a “problem” in ancient the-ological interpretation, then we have a corresponding problem in modern criti-cal interpretation. Writing in the early twentieth century, Hartley Hirschfeldrepresents Su ̄ rah 33:56 as indeed indicating God’s own prayer. Without hesita-tion, he compares this passage to the talmudic examples upon which we havejust been speculating.13Writing in the 1930s, James Robson takes strong excep-tion to this.14“To some who are learning Arabic the use of the verb s.alla ̄in con-nection with Allah raises a difficulty. They have learned that it means ‘to pray,’and therefore they wonder whether the conventional phrase used after Mo-hammed’s name expresses a wish that Allah may pray for the Prophet. Thewriter has even heard a missionary telling Arabs that that was what it meant,and that therefore it was nonsensical. But surely Arabs know their own lan-guage, and therefore it is better to find out what this difficult phrase reallymeans.”15Robson’s characterization of the phrase as “difficult” and his desire to findout “what it really means” is a sign that divine reflexivity is at play. We have en-countered this confusion before in the case of other iconographic and literarymaterials featuring divine beings performing ritual actions. The more tran-scendent, potent, and monolithic the supreme deity, the higher the degree ofwhat the translator of al-Tı ̄ja ̄nı ̄ calls “Ipseity” attributed to the god, then themore “difficult” things often become for the rationalist theologian or modernscholar—and the more contorted the efforts to explain the evidence as mean-ing something other than what it clearly purports to mean. Islam is rightly per-ceived as “supremely” monotheistic, disseminating the pure, clear light of thefire of divine Unity. The modern interpretive problem before us has its originin a limited understanding of the nature of the divine in Islam and of the wor-ship ascribed to it. I raise the question of whether the “problematic” scripturalpassage, even if understood quite literally, is indeed divorced from, rather thanreflective of, the self-understanding of the tradition.An irony emerges. By protesting that the s.alla ̄\\ala ̄cannot really mean“pray for” if Alla ̄h is its subject, those who protest are limiting God’s nature asit is magnified by Islam. In effect, the protest determines what he can and can-not do: He can be and do everything else in his created universe excepthimselfpray for the Prophet. The problem stems, as in the other cases we have consid-ered, from the assumption that God’s worship is exactly like human worship—the offering of a lesser, contingent being to a greater, noncontingent one. If onerefuses the obvious meaning of yus.all ̄una\\ala ̄in Su ̄ rah 33:56, one must ap-proach the sin of shirkby attributing to God a contingency. Apparently prayer“god and his angels pray for the prophet”285"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"is an “off-limits” activity for him. He cannot pray for a lesser creature. Thiswouldseemto be sensible, since God is Glorious, al-wa ̄si\\(the comprehensive),16al-qa ̄dir(the powerful),17al-badı ̄\\(the Absolute Originator).18But Islamic doc-trine also says that first and foremost, there is nothing that God cannot be or do!In fact, as I shall argue, two elements support and ratify, rather than un-dermine, a literal interpretation of Su ̄ rah 33:56—“God prays for the Prophet”—which I maintain is the phrase’s most obvious and at the same time its deepestmeaning. The first is one of the most essential metaphysical qualities of God(s.ifa ̄t Alla ̄h) as defined by Islam19—his self-sufficiency, embodied in the namesofal-qayy ̄um(the self-subsisting)20andal-ghanı ̄(the self-sufficing).21Second,but just as important to our enquiry, is his reciprocal relationship to the culticlife of Islam, both directly and as mediated by the Prophet.I contend that both of these allow God to be the subject of prayer. As withthe Greek vases, and as with the talmudic “anomalies,” my starting assumptionis that the religious tradition is “innocent until proven guilty.” That is, I assumethat what is “really meant” in Su ̄ rah 33:56 is exactly what it says. My goal will beto discover whether there are good grounds within Islamic scriptural theologyand devotional practice to support this assumption.Is this divine prayer in a self-contained mode? God’s s.ala ̄tis intercessory,not contemplative.22The divine prayer for “drawing down of blessing on”Muh.ammadby Godbecomes the basis for the mortal prayer for “drawingdown of blessing on” the Prophet by human beings,arguably the most frequentand efficacious devotional prayer in Islam.23The believer is enabled to inter-cede for the Prophet because the Qur›a ̄n asserts that God himself intercedesfor him or her.When the believer pronounces the s.ala ̄t \\ala ̄›n-nabı ̄, God’s prayer for theProphet is not only referenced, but initiated—set in motion: “cultic time.” God’sdivine prayer in Su ̄ rah 33:56 signals his unending participation in the blessingsthat are uttered on Muh.ammad by mortals through a life of prescribed ritualprayer. As we shall see, the circle of prayer is completed in that the mortaltas.liyahthen allows Muh.ammad to intercede with God on our behalf.Far from an anomaly that needs mitigation by a less controversial transla-tion, the literal s.ala ̄tof Allah for the Prophet is notinvalidated because it seemsparadoxical. Instead, the idea bears with it the sense of a profound communionbetween Creator and creature, a communion having as its inspired model theoriginal relationship of the Prophet to his God. There has developed in Islam amechanism of ritual intercession more complex than any other we have en-countered thus far. But the idea of reciprocity, and underlying that, of divine re-flexivity, remains the driving force. “God Most High informed His worshippersof the rank which His Prophet holds with Him in the heavenly host, by prais-ing Him in the presence of the angels of access, and by the s.ala ̄tof those angelsfor Him. Then He commanded s.ala ̄tand a greeting of peace from the people ofthe world below, so that the people of both worlds, above and below, mightunite in His praise.”24286the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Origins of a Sacrament: S.alla ̄\\alain the Qur›a ̄nPhilological scrutiny of pre-Islamic Arabic yields neither the noun s.ala ̄tnor thedenominative verb derived from it, s.alla ̄.S.ala ̄talmost certainly comes from theAramaic verbal root s.lymeaning “to bow down” (selo ̄ta ̄).25It does not mean“spontaneous prayer.” That is signified by the Arabic word du\\a ̄›.S.ala ̄tmeans,exclusively,“ritual worship, divine service.” S.ala ̄toccurs in several Semitic di-alects with the meaning of “prayer”; it was used by Aramaic-speaking Jews forthe obligatory recital of the Eighteen Benedictions thrice daily.26In its Qur›a ̄nicincarnation, s.alla ̄means simply “to perform the s.ala ̄t,” that is, “to pray ritually”(which does indeed involve bowing down) and carries with it the sense of pub-lic praise.27S.ala ̄tseems to have been introduced into Islam by Muh.ammadhimself to refer to the devotional practice of the new religion—and, we mightinfer, to distinguish it from that of pre-Islamic veneration of Alla ̄h.Used with \\ala ̄, s.alla ̄carries with it the sense of intercessory prayer. In itstwo Qur›a ̄nic attestations (apart from the two times it appears in Su ̄ ra 33 withGod as subject), the phrase appears in the imperative with a human subject,the addressee being Muh.ammad or another less exalted mortal. In these othercontexts,s.alla ̄\\ala ̄means “to pray upon or over” or “pray for.” In Su ̄ rah 9, whichdeals with idolators, disbelievers, and hypocrites, verse 84 enjoins, “Nor dothou ever pray (s.alla ̄\\ala ̄) for any of them that dies, nor stand at his grave; forthey rejected Allah and His Messenger, and died in a state of perverse rebellion[or: while they were still sinners].”28S.alla ̄\\ala ̄is indeed used in later traditionfor some kind of funeral prayer. To underscore the idea of intercession at a bier,Qur›a ̄nic interpreter Muhammad Zafrulla Khan renders this verse, “Pray notfor any who dies, nor stand by his grave asking forgiveness for him.”In contrast to the harsh verse 84, verses 101–104 of Su ̄ rah 9 offer a positivemandate of intercession by the faithful for the “desert Arabs round about youas well as (desert Arabs) among the Madı ̄nah folk....Perhaps Allah will turnto them (in mercy): For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Of their goodstake alms, that so thou mightest purify and sanctify them; and pray on their be-half (s.alla ̄\\ala ̄), verily thy prayers are a source of security for them....Knowthey not that Allah...is verily He, the Oft-Returning, Most Merciful?” Again,there can be no question here of anything other than intercessory prayer, as theidea is repeated in substantive form.In Christian communities using Arabic or related languages, the termss.ala ̄tands.alla ̄have undergone an expansion in scope corresponding to theirlimitation in Islam. In Christian Coptic usage, the verb s.ala ̄hconnotes both pri-vate devotional and public devotional prayer, like the Latin orare,the Germanbeten,or the English “pray.”29S.alla ̄can mean “to pray spontaneously” or it canretain its very formal usage as in Islam; it is often used to denote one’s partici-pation in the Christian Mass.30The phrase s.alla ̄\\ala ̄occurs in the Arabic NewTestament, in the Epistle of James 5:14. The sick man is told to send for the eld-ers of the church and they will pray “over him,” that is, including the sense of“god and his angels pray for the prophet”287"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"“for him.”31But in Christian Arabic usage, s.alla ̄\\ala ̄can also simply mean “con-secrate” or “bless” something, such as water or oil.32By contrast, in Islamic Arabic usage, the verb s.alla ̄has always been verylimited in scope. If the subject is human, it means “to perform the s.ala ̄t.”33S.alla ̄\\ala ̄has the delimited sense of “to perform (usually public) worship on behalf ofsomeone.” Popular devotional prayer-manuals use it for Muh.ammad’s prayersfor himself; a prayer might be called “that which the greatest of [sayyids] prayedfor (s.alla ̄\\ala ̄) his noble self.”34But what if the subject of s.alla ̄is divine?What is S.ala ̄t?“Bow down in adoration and bring thyself the closer (to Allah)!” (S ̄urah 96:19).At the beginning of this chapter, Ah.mad al-Tı ̄ja ̄nı ̄ asks God to call downblessing on Muh.ammad “with that s.ala ̄twith which Thou didst call down bless-ing on him” in the Qur›a ̄n (S ̄urah 33:56). The s.ala ̄tis the prayer-liturgy of the fivedaily times, including noon on Friday, with variants for special occasions. In theQur›a ̄n,al-s.ala ̄tis frequently mentioned, even the special Friday congregationals.ala ̄t.35Western scholars believe that the evolution of the liturgy of the fiveprayer-periods and their ritual form was gradual. At the start of his revelation,according to tradition, Muh.ammad did not have a litany with which to worshipGod. To Su ̄ rah 96:1, the revelation traditionally reckoned as the first given tohim, along with the next two verses,36it is said that the Prophet responds to theangel commanding him to “Proclaim! In the name of thy Lord and Cherisher,who created humankind from a (mere) clot of congealed blood,” with the bewil-dered, “I have nothing to recite” (or: “I cannot recite”).37The divine answers tohis protests in this dialogue became the first text for recitation.38Observant Muslims, on the other hand, “have no doubt that the prayer-rite, as they experience it, is both primitive and fundamental, a dictation of theProphet himself.”39For example, it is “Muh.ammad who taught us the phraseswe should say at the standing, the bowing, the prostration.”40As in rabbinicJudaism, performance—bearing as it does the gravitas of observance—iscrucial.41The s.ala ̄tconsists of five daily prayer rituals, three of which are establishedin the Qur›a ̄nic verses 4:103, 11:114, and 17:78 and 79 (which self-referentiallycommands the believer to “recite the Qur›a ̄n at dawn”).42The five prayers,“man’s communion with the Divine,”43and corresponding physical motionshave been fixed for centuries.44The body’s prostration reflects and at the sametime effects the soul’s submission to God;45everything else is in a sense com-mentary. “The most excellent of the ways of worship is the s.ala ̄t, since it is a pil-lar of the faith, and includes within itself the invocation of God Most High andthe declaration of His transcendence, and thanks to Him; and s.ala ̄tis the nega-tion of immorality and of blameworthy or insolent conduct, and purifies andstrengthens the body.”46The importance of the s.ala ̄tcannot be overestimated inthe ritual life of Islam. Qur›a ̄n Su ̄ rah 14:40 pleads, “O my Lord! make me one288the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"who establishes regular Prayer [s.ala ̄t], and also (raise such) among my offspring.”While it is “the most potent means of establishing and strengthening one’scommunion with one’s Maker and of drawing near to Him,”47Islamics.ala ̄tisformal and collective. Muslim children are first taught the set prayers by oralrecitation, not how to pray extemporaneously or silently; there is nothing about“interior” spirituality in Muslim school primers.48The Islamic ideal and prac-tice of ritual prayer is similar to that of orthodox Judaism: The prostrations ofs.ala ̄tshould be congregational, if possible. As in Judaism, collective, ritualizedprayer is the vehicle by which one offers oneself completely and unconditionallyto God. In the words of Seyyed Hossein Nasr, “the spiritual is never opposed tothe formal. Rather it always makes use of the formal, which it interiorizes.”49Saints, for example, have often deeply spiritualized the s.ala ̄t.50All prayers will be heard, even those of one who has neglected God for along time. In Su ̄ rah 2:186, God reassures Muh.ammad, “When My servants askthee concerning Me, I am indeed close (to them): I listen to the prayer of everysuppliant when he calleth on Me”; God promises in Su ̄ rah 40:60, “Call on me;I will answer!” In s.ala ̄t, there is a sense of leaving the world of the senses andstanding before God—indeed, of complete humility, surrender, and annihila-tion in God. In a sense, because it represents this attitude and this communion,it never ceases: “Muslim prayer is not a part-time activity; it is a continual act ofdedication to the end that the Divine Purpose inherent in man’s creation is ful-filled.”51Both early Muslim and later Western translators rightly encounter extremetheological difficulties when God is the subject of the phrase s.alla ̄\\ala ̄, “to prayfor” or “to perform the s.ala ̄tfor”—for how and to whom can God pray?52There-fore Su ̄ rah 33:43 is rendered as “It is He who blesses you, and his angels blessyou” by A. J. Arberry, and 33:56, as “God and his angels bless the prophet.”53AMuslim rendition gives: “God blesses you, and his angels invoke blessings onyou [the Prophet].”54This translation at least preserves the fact that it is thesame verb that is used for God and the angels. But the plain sense of the verseremains.Muslim Interpretation of the Qur›a ̄nicS.alla ̄\\ala ̄Can God be imagined as bowing down with his forehead touching the groundin ritual prayer? To whom would he bow? This is just the most literal aspect ofthe multivalent discomfort caused by a literal interpretation of s.alla ̄\\ala ̄whenGod is its subject. Al-Suyu ̄.tı ̄ addresses this problem directly when he writes,“The honour with which God most high honors Muh.ammad is fuller and moreuniversal than that with which he honoured Adam when he commanded the an-gels to prostrate themselves before Him, for it is not possible that God himselftook part in that earlier honouring.”55Classical Muslim interpretive authorities were well aware of the paradoxicalimplications and perhaps even heretical dangers of such an interpretation (and“god and his angels pray for the prophet”289"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"of such an image) of the Qur›a ̄nic statement that God s.alla ̄\\ala ̄his Prophet.In the dictionaries Lisa ̄n al-\\arabandTa ̄j al-\\ar ̄us, there are several attempts toexplains.alla ̄\\ala ̄: when used of Alla ̄h, it means that he “shows mercy” or“praises”; when used of angels, it means that they pray for and ask God to for-give someone.56That the angels also “pray for” Muh.ammad in Su ̄ rahs 33:43 and33:56 presents no such theological problems, as in Islam the angels are essen-tially only luminous hypostases of God’s mind. Although they are “intertwinedwith all dimensions of human life,”57they are in many respects inferior to hu-man beings, and certainly not as multidimensional as mortals are in their rela-tionship to God.58In his commentary on Su ̄ rah 33:56, al-Zamaksharı ̄ says that the phrase de-notes mercy from God to Muh.ammad.59Al-Tabarı ̄ holds that when Alla ̄h isthe subject of s.alla ̄,it means either “to bless” or “to show mercy.”60However, thetranslation “shows mercy to” can be challenged by Su ̄ rah 2:157: “They are thoseon whom (descend) blessings (s.alawa ̄t) from the Lord and Mercy (rah.mah), andit is these who receive guidance.” Since rah.mahindisputably means “mercy,”s.alawa ̄t,the nominal plural of s.ala ̄t,is said by both Lisa ̄n al-\\arabandTa ̄j al-\\ar ̄usto mean “praise” from Allah. Commenting on the same passage (2:152), al-Bai.da ̄wı ̄ says s.ala ̄tfrom Alla ̄h is his declaration of purity and forgiveness.61Other meanings of s.alla ̄\\ala ̄are said by the classical dictionaries to be“magnify,” “bless,” and “exalt.” The Ta ̄jqualifies this by saying that when s.alla ̄\\ala ̄is used with reference to Muh.ammad (presumably as object), it has onlythe sense of magnifying him. However, Ibn al-\\Arabı ̄, holding true to the literalmeaning of the old Semitic roots.alla ̄,insists that s.ala ̄tfor Muh.ammad is prayerfor him.62Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (d. 751/1350 C.E.), a follower of Ibn Taymı ̄ya,refutes the view that s.alla ̄can mean “to show mercy,” since if s.alla ̄andrah.imaare the same, one should be able to say irh.am Muh.ammadan(“show mercy toMuh.ammad), but this would never be said. One can say irh.amni(“show mercyto me”) but never s.alli\\ala ya. Where rah.macan be appropriately used, for ex-ample, as pertaining to the treatment of an enemy, s.ala ̄tcannot, for it involvesspeech. He trenchantly points out that since one verb is used in Su ̄ rah 33:56 forwhat Alla ̄h and the angels do, they cannot do different things. Running into thewall of s.alla ̄\\ala ̄’s literal and customary meaning, “to pray for,” he thereforeconcludes that the verse must mean that both Alla ̄h and the angels praiseMuh.ammad. The same verb is used immediately afterward for what humanbeings are to do: “O ye who believe, do you also invoke blessings on him.” SoIbn al-Qayyim believes that this directs people also to praise the Prophet.63Popular prayer manuals from this century, which often reflect exegetical tra-ditions much older than their date of publication, offer important commentaryon God’s s.ala ̄t. The intensity of their speculation is in direct proportion to thedepth of the paradox and to its possible heretical potential; one senses that thequestion must be carefully and convincingly handled. ÛAlı ̄ al-Makkı ̄ writes,Opinions differ as to the meaning of s.ala ̄t. It is said that from Godits meaning is mercy and complaisance, and from angels and men290the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"petition and asking forgiveness. And it is said that the s.ala ̄tof God isHis mercy and the s.ala ̄tof angels prayer for blessing. And it is saidthat the s.ala ̄tof God is His mercy combined with magnifying andthat of the angels is asking for forgiveness, and that of men, humblebeseeching and petition. And it is said that God’s s.ala ̄tfor hisprophets is praise and magnifying while His s.ala ̄tfor others is Hismercy.Ibn al-\\Arabı ̄ said:S.ala ̄tfrom God is mercy, and from human be-ings and others, angels and jinn, it is bowing and prostration and pe-tition and praise, and from birds and owls it is praise.

Humans are enabled to s.alla ̄\\ala ̄the ProphetMuh.ammad because God s.alla ̄\\ala ̄him in the Qur›a ̄n: Human beings, in asense, take God’s place in this observance, reflecting and repeating the divines.ala ̄t. But one form of the s.ala ̄t \\ala ̄›n-nabı ̄goes so far as to asks God to take ourplace in this action: “and replace us, with Thy pure and generous favour, incalling down blessing on him.”66The conception of the higher status of bothGod and Muh.ammad and the purity of their relation is responsible for this;God alone can truly s.alla ̄\\ala ̄Muh.ammad:If you say, what is the explanation of the fact that although God com-mands us to call down blessing on the Prophet, we yet say, “O Godcall down blessing on Muh.ammad,” asking God to call down bless-ing instead of doing so ourselves, I reply that this is because theProphet is pure, without blemish or failing, while we have both blem-ishes and failings. How shall one full of blemishes and failings calldown blessings on the pure and perfect Prophet? Therefore we askGod to call down blessing on him, that the blessing may be calleddown by a pure God on a pure Prophet.67Why the plethora and variety of (often contradictory) interpretations of oneQur›a ̄nic phrase within Islamic tradition itself ? Perhaps it is because in theidea of God’s s.ala ̄t, Muslim theologians have perceived that they must explainthe inexplicable: a ritual that isunique, having its own rules different from theones given to human beings. God’s s.ala ̄tlies at the heart of the divine being,and occurs unlike human rituals, eternally—in “cultic time.” “After all explana-tions the worshippers feel themselves in the presence of a mystery on whichsome have loved to ponder, picturing a Divine s.ala ̄tcontinuous from before allworlds, in the mih.rabof the essence of the Divine Being. Others have dwelt onit as a communion of love, ‘the calling down of blessing by the Beloved on hisbeloved.’ ”68“god and his angels pray for the prophet”291"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"The Ta.sliyahConstance Padwick, who collected and analyzed hundreds of modern populardevotional prayer manuals, noted that fully one-third of their contents consists ofvariations on the tas.liyah,the single-sentence prayer, “May God call down bless-ing on our Lord [Master] Muhammad and on the family of our Lord Muhammadand greet them with peace.”69The mu’adhdhinmay call out the tas.liyahfrom theminaret. All prayers should begin and end with tamh.ı ̄d[“Praise be to God”] andtas.liyah.70“The tas.liyahhas become an essential, sometimes it would seem, thees-sential of the life of salvation and devotion.”71It is also the most potent of Muslim prayers. As Annemarie Schimmelnotes, “although thousands of prayers and poems speak of the Muslims’ hopeof Muhammad’s intercession for them and for their families, there is onemeans to this end that is much more powerful than anything else: to imploreGod to bless Muhammad and his family. The Koran itself says (Surah 33:56)that God and his angels ‘pray upon,’ that is, bless the Prophet.”72The influenceof the tas.liyahwas highly esteemed in the development of Islamic prayer. Itcame to have a special efficacy and increasingly, in the view of Fritz Meier, aquasi-magical autonomy—not so much in the sense of a direct ability to influ-ence things, but rather in its conferral of sanctity upon the supplicant, whichGod rewards.73The individual’s own supplications may remain unarticulated, fortradition holds that the tas.liyahalone suffices; God will comprehend and look fa-vorably on the unspoken cache of personal prayers in the heart.74In the H.adı ̄th,Muh.ammad’s own words specifically support this belief: “whoever one hundredtimes a day speaks the blessing over me, for him God will fulfill one hundred re-quests, seventy in the other world, and thirty in this.”75Many other popular devotions testify to the importance of the s.ala ̄t \\ala ̄Ún-nabı ̄): “If a man brings on the Day of Resurrection as many good works asthose of all the people in the world and does not bring with them the callingdown of blessing on the Prophet, his good works are returned to him, unac-ceptable.”76Conversely, “one of the saints saw sleep in a hideous form, and hesaid, ‘Who art thou?’ It answered, ‘I am thy misdeeds!’ He said, ‘And how canI be delivered from thee?’ It said, ‘By much calling down of blessing on theProphet.’ ”77“(God said to Muh.ammad): ‘He who, when thou art mentioned,fails to call down blessing on thee, when he enters the Fire shall be banishedfrom God Most High.’ And I said, ‘Amen.’ ”78When did the tas.liyahbecome obligatory in the prayer-rite itself ? Theprayer manuals do not say. Initially it may have been a response to the a ̄dha ̄n,the call to prayer. The relatively early al-Bukha ̄rı ̄ (d. 256/870 C.E.) writes on thea ̄dha ̄nbut does not mention the prayer, raising an interesting questionsconcerning the evolution of the Prophet’s status in Islam.79Al-ShaÛra ̄ni(d. 973/1565 C.E.) forgives the omission of the s.ala ̄t \\ala ̄Ún-nabı ̄,implying that itcould be distracting: “As for the position of those who do not make the s.alatu\\ala ̄›n-nabı ̄obligatory in the last tashahhudthey hold that the preoccupation of(the man engaged in) the prayer-rite is continuously with the presence of God292the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"himself, and perhaps the awe of that presence may so strongly dominate theheart of the worshipper that he may be unable to turn from the greatness of thedivine interview to the thought of anyone else.”80But in the circularity of cultic power that we have come to expect in thiskind of case, God performs that ritual action most essential to the developmentand reinforcement of Islam, namely, the magnifying of the Prophet. For it wasMuh.ammad who in his actions and especially in his person transformeddesert religion, who with his la ̄ila ̄ha illa ̄›lla ̄h(there is no God but God) “re-placed the ultimacy of tribal affiliation with membership in the larger commu-nity of believers....Islam had valorized the individual and so re-shaped Arabsociety and its images of immortality.”81We can only ask God to call downblessing on us because he called down blessing on the Prophet: “What workcan arrive at such a result? What power or means can attain it? How could itcome about that the Mighty King should call down blessing on his poor andlowly servant, but for his care to obey the Prophet, and the greatness of thatProphet’s influence with the Almighty?”82Robson’s DilemmaAs we mentioned earlier, James Robson raises serious objections to the ideathat the tas.liyahis in fact based on Su ̄ rah 33:56. He does so on two grounds,one philological, the other, far more telling, having to do with what he imaginesto be the mechanism of religious mimesis. To translations such as Palmer’s(“Verily, God and His angels pray for the Prophet”),83Robson retorts that “it isextremely difficult to believe that Mohammed himself could have understood itthis way.”84It is worth looking more closely at the argumentation that underliesthis response to divine reflexivity, in that it reveals much of the theologicalproblematic surrounding the category. And despite its anchor in the first halfof the last century, Robson’s type of objection to prayer performed by God re-mains both current and symptomatic.On the translation score, Robson claims that s.alla ̄\\ala ̄really has two mean-ings, “pray for” and “send down blessing upon.” “In Syriac we find an interest-ing parallel, for the verb s.alı ̄followed by \\almeans either ‘to pray for’ or ‘tobless.’ It is therefore not surprising that the corresponding verb in Arabicshould have more than one meaning.”85He fastens onto the notion of “bless-ing” as a way out of the uncomfortable translation “pray for,” endorsing Sale’stranslation of Su ̄ rah 33:56–57 (“Verily God and His angels bless the Prophet.O true believer, do ye also bless him, and salute him with a respectful saluta-tion”). The dictionary Lisa ̄n al-\\arabsays, “Since God (Praise be to Him!) com-manded us to invoke blessing on him and we cannot attain to as much of thatas is necessary, we transfer it to God and say, ‘O God, do Thou bless Mo-hammed, because Thou knowest best what is fitting for him.’ ” Commentingon this passage, Goldziher explains that we are impure and unworthy to blessMuh.ammed worthily, “therefore we ask Allah to bless him that the blessingcome from a pure Lord to a pure prophet.”86According to Robson, when God“god and his angels pray for the prophet”293"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"is the subjectof the verbal phrase, the second meaning (“bless”) is to be pre-ferred. Robson does not offer that the second translation may have evolvedbecauseGod is the subject.Ibn Qayyim, referring to the tradition which says that if one should s.alla ̄\\ala ̄Muh.ammad, God will s.alla ̄\\ala ̄him ten times, says that therefore the verbmust mean “praise.”87Finally, Qayyim mentions the common explanation thats.alla ̄\\ala ̄means “to bless” and says that this is in keeping with the meaning “topraise.” He goes on to speculate on the tradition in which people are told topray that Alla ̄h may s.alla ̄\\ala ̄Muh.ammad as he did Abraham, the invocationends by addressing Alla ̄h as al-h.amı ̄d al-majı ̄d(praiseworthy and glorious), ar-guing, as Robson summarizes, that “as one usually uses in prayer a name ofAllah which has some relation to the object for which one is praying, this sug-gests that people are told to pray that Allah may bless Mohammed.”88The difficulty with the translation—and hence the understanding—of s.alla ̄\\ala ̄remains. Robson frequently paints himself into a corner, relying, in a cer-tain sense, on a tautological argument, since in modern English, the word“blessing,” like “prayer,” traditionally encodes the notion of intercession to athird, more powerful party. But Robson and others gravitate toward “bless” fora reason. In its origins, the English word “bless” carries as much divine reflex-ivity as God’s Arabic s.ala ̄t.The Old English ble ̄tsianorblœdsian,“bless,” comesfromblo ̄d,“blood.”89“Bless,” then, meant “to make or consecrate with blood”(as in Exodus 12:23). It was the word chosen at the English (Anglican) conver-sion to render the Latin benedicare, “to praise.” It was also used to render theHebrew “to bend the knee, worship.”“Bless” means “to consecrate by a spoken formula or charm; later, by aprayer.” In Old and Middle English usage, however, it meant “to call holy, toadore (God) as holy” and “to pronounce words that invoke divine favour” (OE);“to invoke blessings on” (ME). Most telling is the Old English meaning “to con-fer well-being upon; to make happy, to prosper,” which was originally said ex-clusively of God.90Even without its etymological implications, the modern concept of “bless-ing” still involves the invocation or transfer of power from a more powerful toa less powerful party; from a religious viewpoint, it could only come from God.This is historically confirmed by Christopher Mitchell in his study of the con-ceptbrkin Northwest Semitic religious texts, cited in the previous chapter.The original use of brkin NW Semitic was for god(s) blessing man,i.e., bestowing children, wealth, etc. The other uses clearly derivefrom this original use. There is really no support for the almost uni-versal assumption that the original view of blessing in NW Semiticwas an animistic conception akin to the pre-Islamic Arabic concep-tion associated with baraka....The Arabic blessing conception wasconformed to the animistic Arabic religion, and when under Islamthe religion became monotheistic, the blessing concept followed suit.The extant extra-biblical NW Semitic texts present a thoroughly poly-theistic view of blessing in conformity to the religion of the people.294the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"The use of brkfor man blessing man clearly developed from the firstuse for gods blessing man, since it constitutes an entreaty for thegods to bless the person whom the human subject “blesses.” The useofbrkin the praise of God is a subsequent, inner-biblical develop-ment arising from the use of brkin human benedictions.91But in the same tradition discussed by Ibn al-Qayyim (“s.alla ̄\\ala ̄Muh.ammadas You did Abraham”), the next petition is that God may ba ̄raka\\ala ̄(unequivo-cally, “send baarakahdown on; bless”) Muh.ammad.

Robson equivocates. “Clearly while the two verbs are related inmeaning, there must be some difference, but it is not easy to decide how toexpress it.”92Robson concludes that it is appropriate to translate s.alla ̄\\ala ̄as“bless” exceptwhen it is used in conjunction with ba ̄raka\\ala ̄, where some othertranslation must be found. “To translate it as ‘praise’ sounds very unnatural inEnglish; so one might try to get round the difficulty by using some phrase as‘express approval of,’ ‘acknowledge,’ or ‘show favor to.’ ”93Robson’s second argument is based on a technicality, and one of dubiousapplication at that. “Moslems themselves have found a difficulty in this, as theyhave noticed that the verse gives men a command about what they are to do,whereas the formula is a prayer that Allah may do it.”94What Robson describesis a pure case of imitatio dei, of action mandated by the divine and derivedfrom God’s action. This idea is very common and in fact fundamental to manyreligious aetiologies. An auxiliary second reason he offers is that in 33:56 theverbsallamais clearly used in the sense of “saluting,” but in the usual formulait has a different meaning (“to keep safe, to protect”). “One may therefore rea-sonably conclude that if the formula were really based on the Koranic verse, itis unlikely that one of the words would be used in a different sense from theoriginal.”95This is specious reasoning. The transmission of religious traditionsdoes not work in this legalistic way; aetiologies for ritual are frequently notexact but no less firmly held. Robson’s is not an argument against the Qur›a ̄nicderivation of the practice of praying for the Prophet. Furthermore, as we haveseen, many other h.adı ̄ths derive it from Su ̄ rah 33:56. We are reminded of theobjections of the ancient scholiast on Hermes’s libation in the Peace.Robson raises the possibility of whether “the familiar tradition referred toalready has not been invented to get over the difficulty.” He continues, “Onecommon introduction to it is that some people tell Mohammed that they knowhow to salute him, but wish instruction on how to invoke blessing on him. Hereplies by telling them to say, ’O Allah, bless Mohammed and Mohammed’sfamily as Thou didst bless Abraham’s family. . . .” Here authority is given bythe prophet himself for doing something different from what the Koran tellspeople to do, assuming that 33:56 is the basis of the practice.”96Robson reports that even though earlier in history, Muh.ammad’s namewas always given first in the formula, followed by that of any other person to be“blessed,” there is some indication that the prayer was not used exclusively ofMu.hammad.97Robson cites a much-discussed tradition of how the Prophethimself said, “O God, s.alli\\ala ̄the family of Abu ̄ Aufa ̄.”98“The explanation“god and his angels pray for the prophet”295"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"which seems to give most satisfaction is that, since this word is to be appliedparticularly to Mohammed, he has a right to transfer it to others if he wishes.But this is rather a weak attempt to adapt a larger usage to earlier times.”99The“weak attempt” that Robson derides is, in fact, just how religious aetiology func-tions; consider, for example, how the sensibilities and customs of the GreekGeometric Age were read back into the Homeric epics set in the time of Myce-nean royalty.The whole formula (“may Alla ̄h grant him and give him peace!”) usuallyappears only after Muh.ammad’s name appears. But there are also Qur›a ̄nic ex-amples of its use after the name of Adam (4:83), Abraham (2:23), Moses (4:95),David (2:4), and Jesus (4:86), which are the bases for early honorific mentionsof these saints. Robson therefore concludes, “these usages, [attested] as late asthe second half of the fourth century of Islam, indicate that the later practice ofreserving the invocation for Mohammed alone had not yet fully developed.”100A strange compromise emerges. Robson insists that if Su ̄ rah 33:56 is to beconsidered as the basis of any later practice, it is not to be found in the com-mon invocation “which has already been shown to do something differentfrom what that verse commands.”101But “it can be said that the command isobeyed, to a certain extent in the regularprayers.”102Robson notes that in thetah.ı ̄ya(the salutation which comes before the profession of faith, the tashah-hud), one of the phrases used is “Peace be upon thee, O Prophet, with themercy of Allah and his blessing.” After the tashahhudthere is a prayer for bless-ing on Muh.ammad. “[B]y a certain stretching of the meaning of the Koranicverse,” Robson says that this may be taken to fulfill the first part of the com-mand of Su ̄ rah 33:56: “While s.alla ̄\\ala ̄can be translated as ‘to bless’, it can alsomean ‘to invoke blessing.’ So if 33:56 may be translated, ‘Verily Allah and Hisangels bless the Prophet; O believers, invoke blessing on him and salute himwith a salutation,’ the command can be said to be fulfilled in these parts of theregular prayers.”103In the final analysis, Robson asserts that Su ̄ rah 33:56 cannot be the basisfor the ritual tas.liyah,but can be the basis for part of the regular s.ala ̄t.He iswilling to accept it as such only if God “blesses” but does not “pray for” theProphet. But this is not what is asserted by theh.adı ̄ths, which despite anyquestions of the meaning of s.alla ̄\\ala ̄, usually ground the ta.sliyahsquarely inthe Qur›a ̄n—specifically in the verses that have been our focus. In other words,Robson creates his own solution to his own problem. In so doing, he revealsthat his “problem” is not one of translation at all, but one of theology. In this hisis symptomatic of much rationalist exegesis throughout historical instances ofdivine reflexivity.“Without Enquiring How and without Making Comparison”: Who Is Alla ̄h?We have seen that Muslim tradition does ascribe its most important invocation,the calling down of blessing on the Prophet, to Su ̄ rah 33:56.

In other words, as in the previous cases of divine reflexivity we have exam-ined, God’s action is the basis for and reinforces a mortal ritual action which isessential to the cultic life of the religious tradition. “The Koran itself says (Surah33:56) that God and his angels ‘pray upon,’ that is, bless the Prophet. Could thebeliever do anything better than follow the example given by the Lord Him-self ?”104Perhaps, then, it is worth discovering what is really bothering Robson.I suggest that his problem is, in fact, philosophical—or, to be more precise,theological. As Padwick puts it, “there lies the rub. Some explanation must begiven of the term s.ala ̄t \\ala ̄which covers an activity in which God Himself takespart.”105The distress comes from what to Islam is almost worse than a paradox,bordering on a heresy—the underlying anthropomorphism attending the ideaof a praying God. It comes from the idea that God’s worship resembles humanworship, in other words, that divine ritual, because it is Muslim ritual, shouldcounterintuitively involve utter submission—to God.Islam is by reputation the theocentric religion par excellence. Who is Alla ̄h,the special form of al-ila ̄h(in Arabic, “the god”)?106His Qur›a ̄nic epithets portraya being self-sufficing, all-powerful, knowing, and encompassing. Alla ̄h,or God,is the king (al-malik), the watcher and reckoner but also protector and guide.107He is the eternal creator (al-kha ̄liq)108and the beginner (al-mubdi›).109In a veryreal sense, “nothing exists save him and that which He has made.”110Whatever is in the heavens and on earth—Let it declare the praisesand Glory of Allah. For He is the exalted in Might, the Wise. To Himbelongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: It is He Whogives Life and Death; and He has power over all things. He is theFirst and the Last, the Evident and the Hidden: And He has fullknowledge of all things. He it is Who created the heavens and theearth in six Days; and is moreover firmly established on the Throne(of authority), He knows what enters within the earth and whatcomes forth out of it, what comes down from heaven and whatmounts up to it. And He is with you wheresoever we may be. And Al-lah sees well all that you do. To Him belongs the dominion of theheavens and the earth: And all affairs are referred back to Allah.(S ̄urah 57:2–5)In Islamic theological terms, we only know God to the degree permitted byhis great grace and our limited scope; as Ibn \\Arabı ̄ wrote, “no one can knowGod except in keeping with what his own essence provides.”111Many phrasesin the Qur›a ̄n suggest the nonexistence of everything except God. Thus the hu-man relationship to him, including how he can or should be worshiped, canonly be one of submission and dependence. God does indeed provide for hisown worship, giving to mortals above all the holy Qur›a ̄n, but also the modelfor the Ka\\bah, the rules for sacrifice, and teaching Muh.ammad the s.ala ̄t,justas YHWH taught Moses the order of prayer in Rosh Hashanah.“god and his angels pray for the prophet”297"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Yet God is also a “strange combination of anthropomorphics and meta-physics.” As in the case of Hebrew scripture, anthropomorphism (tajsı ̄m,alsotashbı ̄h) is the legacy of the holy Qur›a ̄n itself, referring as it does to God’s twohands,112his grasp,113his eyes,114his face,115and his settling himself on histhrone.116Early Islamic philosophy began to wrestle almost immediately withthe paradoxes that were its legacy: the problem of absolute predestination ver-sus free will, and that of the inconceivability of God’s divine nature versus thatof his apparent humanness, which seemed to make him resemble his crea-tures. The ahl al-h.adı ̄th(people of tradition) advocated a strict adherence to therecorded word, especially Qur›a ̄nic-derived proofs (adillah sam\\ı ̄yah), the sun-nah(the usage of the Prophet, encoded in the h.adı ̄ths) and ijma ̄\\(the agreementof the Muslim people). Paradoxical statements should be taken as they stand;one should not criticize or expand upon scripture or traditional exegesis. Forexample, when in Su ̄ rah 20:5, one reads that God has settled himself on histhrone, one should not ask howhe sits. Above all one should not compare hissitting to human sitting.From this, the identity of God as an unconditioned Being, there developedthe severe doctrine of mukha ̄lafa(difference): “everything in Allah is differentfrom similarly named thing in men; we must not think of it as like.”117There-fore it was incumbent to eliminate from him, so far as possible, the elementsentailing relationship and all human attributes. From this strand came the ideathat God could not pray. The rationalist Mu›tazilites in particular rejected mys-tery, especially the notion of God’s qualities as infringing on his unity. God wasa pure and vague spiritual substance, not subject to dimension or locality.In the fourth century of Islam, al-Ash›arı ̄ and his followers established thenecessity of dialectic, a middle path in response to the “unimaginable,” vagueconception of the Mu›tazilites and to the obvious doctrinal dangers of tajsı ̄m.The Ash›arites held that the traditional names and thoughts of God provided aconceptionnotessentially wrong: “We could not get from them what He was,but something like He was.” They upheld the idea of tanzı ̄h, that is, “removing”God from any danger of confusion or association with his creatures. But theyheld that he still must be thinkable. Their solution to the paradoxes inaugu-rated by Muh.ammad’s vision are summed up in the phrase bi-la ̄ kayf wa-la ̄tashbı ̄h, “without enquiring how and without claiming resemblance.”The simultaneously developing sects of mystical Sufism, strongly affectedby Neoplatonism, Christian mysticism, Buddhism, and Oriental monism, soughtunity with God through hypnotic devotional techniques. Their theology ranclose to pantheism: They stressed the idea that God was all, that there was noth-ing but him in the world, as, for example, was expressed in Qur›a ̄n Su ̄ rah 2:115:“To Allah belong the East and the West; whithersoever ye turn, there is Allah’scountenance.” This led, in the devotion of some individuals Sufis, to a negligencenot only of the traditionally exalted or “special” role of the Prophet, but a tran-scendence of (or, in the eyes of the orthodox, an unholy transgression against)the enormous barrier separating God from perishable humanity. Al- .Halla ̄j wasstoned to death, in part, for the cry, “I am the Divine Truth!”298the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Al-Ghaza ̄lı ̄ (d. 505/1111) forged a compromise between the three strandsthat included the illimitability of God, the need to imagine his qualities andcharacteristics, and the mystical all-pervasive theology of Sufism. It was a the-ology that bordered internal contradiction, maintaining a delicate balance ofcompromise. Al-Ghaza ̄lı ̄›s starting point was that since the soul of Adam wasbreathed into him by Alla ̄h, and because the first human was created by God inhis own form (e.g., Su ̄ rah 38:72), human beings aretherefore different fromeverything else in the world. God created Adam in his own form. In a gnosticvein, al-Ghaza ̄lı ̄ held that mortals are in exile here and yearn to return to theirdivine source.Al-Ghaza ̄lı ̄›s distinction of human beings from among other creaturesthus separated him from the strictest construction of tanzı ̄h. God is not utterlyremoved from association with his creatures. There is a likeness between thehuman spirit and that of God in its essence, quality, and actions; just as Godrules the world, a person analogously rules his or her body. What then aboutthe danger of tashbı ̄h,claiming resemblance between God and humankind?In the Ma.dn ̄un al-s.aghı ̄r, al-Ghaza ̄lı ̄ takes up this very question.118Tashbı ̄happlies only to God’s unique quality—that he is qayy ̄um(self-subsisting). Healone subsists in himself, while “things through their own essence have noth-ing but non-existence, and existence comes to them only from something else,by way of a loan. But the existence of Alla ̄h is essential, unborrowed. This real-ity of self-subsistence belongs to Alla ̄h alone”119—and would include, therefore,religion.And yet, between the clashing rocks of tanzı ̄h(the distancing of God, theinsistence on what God is not), which can lead to atheism or nihilism, andtashbı ̄h,which can lead to a kind of imagistic materialism, al-Ghaza ̄lı ̄ believesthat the former is worse. According to him, people need a language that theycan comprehend with which to speak about God.“My Religion”: God as the Source of Religious Worship in IslamThe history of Islamic theological philosophy reflects a struggle to resolve aconflict whose foundations were laid in the Qur›a ̄n itself. Philosophical, if notpopular, Islam found itself torn between an unwillingness to describe God,whereby one can only say what God is not, and the urge to compare him to ourown perishable selves and world.However, out of the dialectics of al-Ash\\arı ̄ and the unified tension of al-Ghaza ̄lı ̄ emerge two basic tenets of Islamic self-understanding. These mayhelp us to discern how and why God could “pray for” Muh.ammad. The first isthat everything that exists owes its existence to the preexistent One. The secondis that human beings and their sphere have a special affinity to God. The “re-semblance” conceded between God and human beings acknowledged that hewas different, but still able to be conceived. His names and epithets as well asour own characteristics and actions help us to understand God and to get some“god and his angels pray for the prophet”299"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"sense, albeit highly flawed, of what he is like. The implications of the first tenetis the s.ala ̄t,which, like all immanent things, owes its existence to God, and be-longs to him. The second tenet implies that our prayer does reflect what Goddoes, but not exactly. If he does in fact pray, then his prayer is still differentfrom ours, and of different, unimaginably higher order.There is nothing in the Islamic view of the origins of human religious wor-ship that rules out the possibility of God’s prayer; on the contrary, there ismuch that supports it. This is because, from the viewpoint of the ummah,thecommunity of the faithful servants of God, religion has its source not in the in-tentions of humanity but in those of God. This distinction is crucial in that itallows God to s.alla ̄\\ala ̄Muh.ammad in Su ̄ rah 33:56. We are reminded of theQur›a ̄nic verse (Su ̄ rah 57:1) considered in the previous section: “Whatever is inthe heavens and the earth—Let it declare the Praises and Glory of Allah.” Infact, according to the Qur›a ̄n, the forms of Islamic observance are designed,commanded, and come directly from God. In Su ̄ rah 22, for example, in God’sown voice we hear how the great liturgy at Mecca is to be performed:“Then let them complete the rites prescribed for them, perform theirvows, and (again) circumambulate the Ancient House.” (Su ̄ rah22:29)“In them ye have benefits for a term appointed: In the end their placeof sacrifice is near the Ancient House.” (Su ̄ rah 22:33)“To every people did We appointed rites (of sacrifice), that they mightcelebrate the name of Allah over the sustenance He gave them fromanimals (fit for food)....The sacrificial camels we have made for youas also among the Symbols from Allah: in them is (much) good foryou....It is not their meat, nor their blood, that reaches Allah: it isyour piety that reaches Him: He has thus made them subject to you,that ye may glorify Allah for his guidance to you.” (Su ̄ rah 22:35–38passim)120“He has thus made them subject to you, that ye may glorify Allah for hisguidance to you”: in this extraordinary statement we are aware of a circularityof the movement of prayer, sacrifice, and worship. God made the world in or-der to worship him. In fact, God makes explicit that his only motive in creatingthe universe is so that it could then reflect his own glory back to him: “I haveonly created jinns and men, that they may serve me. No sustenance do I re-quire of them, nor do I require that they should feed me” (Su ̄ rah 51:56–57). TheKa\\bah, containing the heavenly “black stone,” is rebuilt by Ibrahim andIsma\\ı ̄l after an heavenly archetype, much like the Solomonic temple. Aroundthe heavenly Ka\\bah, the angels perform the ritual circumambulations, thetawa ̄f.Religion, which we may tend to think of as a sphere of human activitydirected to God, is in fact God’s sphere of activity and originating action. Godrefers to “Myreligion” in the writings of the fifteenth-century C.E. Egyptianwriter Jal ̄aluddı ̄n as-Suyu ̄.tı ̄., where he says, “O Muhammad, I am taking you as300the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"a friend, just as I spoke face to face with Moses. I am giving to you the Fatiha(Su ̄ ra 1) and the closing verse of al-Baqara (Su ̄ ra 2:24–6), both of which arefrom the treasuries of My throne and which I have given to no prophet beforeyou....I shall exalt your name for you, even to the extent of conjoining it withMy name, so that none of the regulations of My religion will ever be mentionedwithout you being mentioned along with me.”121In other words, God is giving Muh.ammad the most important prayers inIslam. They will be the foundational intercessions of God’s religion, which aregiven by God and will be practiced by God’s people for God. Islamic worship asreflected here is thus reflexive in origin and also in practice. Along these lines,speaking of the Sufi mystic Ru ̄ mi, Schimmel writes that “Prayer, as the Koranstates, is the prerogative of humans, who may call to God. But Maulana knows—again from the Koran—that the world was created to order to worship God andthat everything praises the Creator in its mute eloquence.”122God ordains prayer; prayer comes from him. In prayer, the heart is trans-formed, for “it is He who hears the unspoken prayer, and seen from this angle,every prayer is, in itself, its own answer. By praying, one acknowledges God’sgreatness and at the same time offers gratitude toward Him who not only hasgranted life and material goods but, what is more important, has granted aheart than can seek and find Him.”123There is no better rite of worship; if therehad been, al-Ghaza ̄lı ̄ says, God would have taught it to his angels, whomhe identifies as the Qur›a ̄n’s “those with him, strong against Unbelievers.” Themessengers of God are engaged in the s.ala ̄t, bowing, prostrating themselves,and standing,124and “On their faces are their marks, (being) the traces of theirprostration” (Su ̄ rah 48:29).God also participates responsively in human prayer. This is illustrated inthe s.ala ̄t, where God’s participation in prayer is established by the Prophet in a.hadı ̄th qudsı ̄. Muh.ammad narrates God’s antiphonal response to the recitationof the Fa ̄.tihah,the first Su ̄ rah of the Qur›a ̄n. Syed Ali Ashraf writes, “As the per-son stands before God, he should ‘lend his hearing’ to what God says in replyto his prayer...The servant says, ‘In the Name of God the Most Merciful (al-Rah.ma ̄n), the Most Compassionate (al-Rah.ı ̄m),’ and God says ‘My servantmentions Me.’ The servant then says, ‘The King of the Day of the Judgment,’and God says, ‘My servant glorifies Me and submits himself to Me.’ ”125Every verse of the Fa ̄.tihahrecited by the believer is answered by God.Whereas the first half of the prayer is oriented to God, the second half is ori-ented exclusively to the human community of the faithful. This is similar to thecomplementary contents of God’s and his people’s tefillinin the Talmud. Afterthe invocation of God’s attributes in the first half of the chapter, the servantprays with humility: “ ‘It is Thee whom we adore, and it is of Thee that we begfor help,’ and God says, ‘This is shared between Me and My servant, and Myservant will receive that which he asks.’ When the servant says, ‘Lead us uponthe right path, the path of those to whom Thou hast been most gracious, not ofthose on whom Thy Wrath has descended, nor of those who have gone astray,’God says, ‘All that comes back to My servant, and My servant will receive thatfor which he asks.’ ”126“god and his angels pray for the prophet”301"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"This dialogue is crucial to the actualization of the prayer: “It is because ofthis mutual participation between God and man in this chapter, which is con-sidered to be the heart of the Qur›a ̄n, that the canonical prayer is regarded as nothaving been performed if this chapter is not recited.”127Unless there is a mutualparticipation in prayer, there is no prayer. William Graham notes that the Kita ̄bal-Ma ̄ba ̄ni(425/1033C.E.), a very early treatise on Qur›a ̄nic usage in liturgy, stip-ulates the impermissability of the recitation of non-Qur›a ̄nic Divine Sayings inprayer. “[I]t is the Qur›a ̄n’s form as a text intended for recitation in the daily wor-ship of ritual that distinguishes it.”128Hence the need to hear the divine re-sponse to each line of the recited Fa ̄.tihah,which in its turn represents God’s ownwords whose original recitation is now reenacted by the believer. This is the sub-ordination of the human performer to the ritual identified by Rappaport, as wellas the interlocking world of divine reflexivity. But although God is the ultimate“performer” (reciter) of his own Qur›a ̄n, and the speaker of his own responsiveDivine Sayings, God is not subordinated to the Fa ̄.tihahbut rather, actualizes thispresence through its human performance. As Henri Corbin writes of Ibn \\Arabı ̄’sconception of this in the Fus. ̄us., “Prayer of God is the revelation, the epiphany ofthe human being as His mirror. Reciprocally, the Prayer of man is the ‘creation,’that is, the reflection and manifestation of God, whom man contemplates in themirror of his self, because he him-selfis that mirror.”129After the adorer performs the prostrations (ruk ̄u\\), the standings and repeti-tions of the s.ala ̄t,drawing ever closer to God, he or she “sits in the posture of ahumble slave and bears witness to his vision of Unity and his consciousness ofthe prophethood of the Prophet. Thus he sends his prayers and blessings uponthe Prophet and his family and descendants. Since the Prophet is a mercy to theentire creation (rah.mah li ›l-\\a ̄lamı ̄n), to send blessings upon him means receiv-ing in return from God blessings and mercy upon the entire creation.”130This communion of observance is exactly how the intercessory nature ofthe tas.liyah,based on God’s s.ala ̄t,operates in Islamic piety. The Muslim under-standing of the drawing down of blessings on the prophet is that of “an ongo-ing, celestial activity” in which both God and mortals participate.131Simplyarticulated, unless God prays for the Prophet, we cannot pray for him, and hecannot pray for us. God’s action in Su ̄ rah 33:56 is not “once and for all.” LikeGod’s prayer in Berakhot,which also uses the present tense, it is set in what wehave called “cultic time”: a sacred, parallel temporality whose only inhabitant isthe divine.Thus Su ̄ rah 33:56 is best understood if the verbal phrase s.alla ̄\\ala ̄is nottranslated in a euphemistic fashion out of a desire to protect God from anthro-pomorphism, but is instead allowed to mean what it means for people: “prayfor.” God’s prayer remains unique, hence incomparable to human prayer. Butit is still prayer. When God prays for the Prophet, he intercedes, in a sense, withhimself, and because of himself. In the words of al-Ghaza ̄lı ̄, “the visible worldwas made to correspond to the world invisible and there is nothing in thisworld but is a symbol of something in that other world.” God’s action doesserve as a paradigm for mortals, but it is more than that. It is a kind of theurgicactivity in which people participate; it is something that they do not only be-302the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"causeGod does it; it is something that they do togetherwith God. “The Koran it-self says (Surah 33:56) that God and his angels ‘pray upon,’ that is, bless theProphet. Could the believer do anything better than follow the example givenby the Lord himself ?”132Underscoring this notion of interpenetrating realms,Padwick argues that a sense of the sacramental in devotion exists (actions andespecially words, which are outward signs of inward grace) despite Islam’s sim-plification of ritual acts and surroundings of worship. She maintains that the“qibla,the mih.ra ̄b,most of the gestures and words of the prayer-rite, the bas-mala,the tahlı ̄l,and especially the calling down of blessing on the Prophet[tas.liya], have, for those with eyes to see, the quality of sacramentals. In his call-ing down of blessing on the Prophet the worshipper believes that he is, by theutterance of a few words, not only entering into communion with an activity ofheaven but setting in motiona correspondent heavenly activity.”133Muh.ammad is “the beautiful model”; Su ̄ rah 33:21 says that “You have in-deed in the Messenger (ras ̄ul) of Allah a beautiful pattern..., for anyonewhose hope is in Allah and the Final Day, and who engages much in the praiseof Allah.” Much of Muslim observance is imitatio Muh.ammadis. In each of thefive forms of devotion, the pillars of the faith—shaha ̄dah,the confession offaith;s.ala ̄t, the ritual prayer; zaka ̄t, the giving of alms; s.awm,the Ramadan fast;andhajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca—the religious practice of the Prophet formsthe basis. But God is the model for Muh.ammad.From an important collection of h.adı ̄ths, Baghawı ̄’sMas.a ̄bı ̄h.as-sunnah(the Lamps of the Sunna), among other sources, we learn that the requirementof the s.ala ̄twas given by God to Muh.ammad during al-mi\\ra ̄j,the initiatorynighttime “ascension” taken through the heavens by the Prophet to meet God“without the veil” in Paradise. God commanded the Prophet to institute fiftydaily prayers for his community. Descending to earth, he encountered Moses,who told him the grim reality that “his people will never be able to perform thatmany prayers and he should return to ask God that the number be reduced.”134Muh.ammad did so; in repeated efforts he bargained God down to five requiredprayers. The gloomy Moses opined that even this was too much, but Muh.am-mad drew the line and insisted that his people could handle that requirement.And thus the five daily prayers were fixed.135IntercessionMy prince will protect me—therefore I trust in GodThe beloved will prostrate, will lament and cry—therefore I trust in God.Muhammad, the pure and innocent, will intercede there for his people...When the trumpet sounds, then all eyes will be opened.136Muh.ammad is the great intercessor for his people, sent by God, as Su ̄ rah 21:107tells us, “only as a mercy for the universe.” His celestial journey and dialogue“god and his angels pray for the prophet”303"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"with Alla ̄h is often seen in Islamic poetry as the source of his status to intercedefor the ummah.

It is difficultto derive this directly from the Qur›a ̄n.138In the throne room, according toSu ̄ rah 2:255, “God! There is no God but He, the Ever-Living, the Eternal. Noslumber can seize Him, nor sleep. His are all things in the heavens and onearth. Who is he that can intercede in His presence, except as He permitteth?”But Muh.ammad’s special intimacy with God, as evidenced by his mi\\ra ̄j(ascension), indicates that the Prophet was indeed accorded this special per-mission, becoming one of those “around the Throne.”139He is “intercessor forboth worlds,”140sha ̄fi\\man f ı ̄›d-da ̄raynfor saints as well as for sinners, butmainly for the community of his own people, his ummah.The calling down of blessings on the Prophet is understood as having itssource in God. So as-Suyu ̄.tı ̄ explains, “our s.ala ̄tfor the prophet is not interces-sion (shafa ̄\\ah) from us on his behalf, for such as we do not intercede for suchas he.” God must pray for Muh.ammad since we cannot.How should not men, angels, and djinn praise himSince God Most High Himself had praised him?141“It is in fact exactly this formulation, that ‘God Himself has praised him,’ thathas caused serious difficulties for poets and collectors of...poetry. One no-table example is Yusuf an-Nabhani, [a pious lawyer from Beirut]...who spenta lifetime collecting devotional works about the Prophet.”142He records the im-possibility of praising Muh.ammad in panegyrics in one of his own poems:They say to me: “Did you not praise Muhammad,The Prophet of the God of everything created,The most worshipable among men?”I said to them: “What shall I say in his praiseSince his Creator has praised him and has not left anything to say?”143And just as the prerogative of praying (s.alla ̄\\ala ̄) for Muh.ammad does notconfine itself to humankind, where one would expect it in the Qur›a ̄n, but leapsdisconcertingly into God’s sphere of activity, so, too, we discover that there alsoexists a group of popular prayers, like the tas.liyah,with Qur›a ̄nic basis, “which304the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"claimshafa ̄\\ahas God’s own prerogative.”144God is the supreme intercessor, inother words; the source of all intercession.(From \\Alı ̄ Zain al-\\Abidı ̄n,Du\\a ̄fı ̄›t-tawbah):If I remain silent no one will speak on my behalf and if I intercededfor myself I am not worthy to be an intercessor. O God, Call downblessing on Muh.ammad and his family, and make Thy generosity theintercessor on behalf of my errors.O God I have no escort to Thee, therefore let Thy pardon be my es-cort. I have no mediator with Thee, therefore let Thy generosity bemy mediator.(From ash-Sha ̄dhilı ̄,.Hizbu›t-tawassul:O God, as Thou wast my guide to Thyself be my Mediator with Thyself.(From \\Abd al-Qa ̄dir al-Jı ̄la ̄nı ̄,Du\\a ̄ munawwir abs.a ̄ra›l-\\a ̄rif ı ̄n):And Thyself plead for us with Thyself.(From Muna ̄ja ̄t \\az.ı ̄mah, in Majm ̄u\\atu› l-ah.za ̄bin):My God I have sought Thy mediation with Thyself for me, and haveasked Thy protection for me from Thyself.Padwick remarks, “[T]hese are hard to reconcile with the development of thestrictest doctrine of tawh.ı ̄d(strict monotheism, divine unity), but there may bepenetrations of spirit where reason has not learnt to follow, and these prayerspoint to the mystery of the Divine life.”145We might phrase it in the terms of par-adox: Muh.ammad is empowered to pray for human beings because God prayedfor Muh.ammad. God interceded for Muh.ammad because God alone has the ul-timate power of intercession. And, as we have seen before, God performs andthus reinforces one of the central rituals of his religion.ConclusionEven if the verb s.alla ̄\\ala ̄strictly means “to pray for publicly, to perform the s.ala ̄t,”God can indeed s.alla ̄\\ala ̄Muh.ammad. This is because God requires the s.ala ̄tofhis people. From Alla ̄h comes the s.ala ̄t. He created human beings to performthe s.ala ̄tand to worship him. He is the One able to mediate with himself. Inter-cessory prayer, so different from other theological trends within the tradition,has in this way become a powerful Islamic devotional strand. God’s prayer forthe Prophet carries with it all the force of ritual intercession. Because the im-mortal God ritually intercedes for the Prophet, mortals are empowered to calldown blessing on the Prophet in God’s name, just as God did, and through it,can intercede. The tas.liyahwas set into motion by a heavenly action (“God andhis angels pray for the Prophet”). In the ancient Greek case, we introduced theidea of “cultic time” which is timeless like the gods, repetitive, and yet temporal“god and his angels pray for the prophet”305"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"and linear like that of human beings. When human beings utter the tas.liyah,calling down blessing on the Prophet, the same heavenly activity is set into mo-tion, recapitulating the original, foundational action, but extending from it intime up to the present time of individual and collective prayer.Even if the Qur›a ̄nic passages are translated as literally as possible, using thestrictest (and in fact, the only) sense of s.alla ̄\\ala ̄—God “prays for” the Prophet—Su ̄ rahs 33:43 and 33:56 are still very much consonant with Qur›a ̄nic and laterIslamic theology, and especially appropriate to formal Islamic ritualism. Thereis no need to explain away the sense of the verb with “bless,” which, as we haveseen, remains an inadequate dodge, as there exists a distinct word for “bless” inArabic, and it is specifically not chosen in these verses.Like Muh.ammad, the prayer for the Prophet itself, the tas.liyah, carries in-tercessory power with God. In other words, the effect of this circle of power inpopular piety is that God intercedes with himself through Muh.ammad. The di-alectic created is thus utterly participatory, a dynamic communion betweenGod and his creatures. God prays and thus we pray; we pray and thus Godprays. The history of Su ̄ rah 33:56 and the prayer based on it is a kaleidoscope oftheological reciprocity. As Constance Padwick writes of the tas.liyah,“Here thenis a universal communion in honouring Muhammad.”146It is “universal” inthat it is ultimate; its source is God.The internal logic of practiced religion is construed in the case of Su ̄ rah33:56 in the following way: Religious actions directed to God, whose purpose isto glorify God, are commanded by God, often in imitation of a heavenly plan ormodel. These actions therefore do not belong to the human sphere—they werenever of human origin. According to Islam, their performance is not some-thing Muslims can decide to do or not do. They are obligatory. Religious actionsbelong to God; they are his. He created worship; the human community didnot. It is thus a short step to the idea that these actions are performed by God.Whether or not it seems to be a short step, it is a much more natural state of af-fairs if, once again, we will accept the premises of Islam itself. In Islam, God isself-subsisting; he is the source of all things, including religious worship.147His is that quality which al-Tı ̄ja ̄nı ̄ called “Ipseity.”Islamic orthopraxy reveals itself as a complex system of paradigms, eachdependent on the rest, and all dependent on the divine source. If the implica-tions of that dependency are accepted as a starting premise, God’s s.ala ̄tforMuh.ammad does not need to be less radically understood. It is not a threat toGod’s unity, but rather is revealed as the basis for several key features of thatpraxis, especially the tas.liyahand the right of Muh.ammad to intercede withGod for his people. God’s s.ala ̄tsimultaneously endorses prayer, intercession,and the unique authority of Muh.ammad, grounding these in his eternal being.Jala ̄luddı ̄n Ru ̄mı ̄ has the last word. In commenting on Su ̄ rah 33:56, thisproblematic passage, Ru ̄mı ̄ explains that “these acts of service and worship andattention do not come from us and we are not free to perform them....Theybelong to God; they are not ours, but His.”148306the peoples of the book"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"Conclusion“Religion of the Gods”Once more let it be your morning, Gods.We repeat. You alone are the primal source.With you the world arises, and a fresh start gleamsOn all the fragments of our failures...—Rainer Maria RilkeIn ancient Greek vase-paintings, Olympian worship seems to re-dound upon the gods who practice it. If there are no higher gods insight or out of sight of the ones who are offering, what can be the reli-gious idea behind such a phenomenon? Are the gods acting as hu-man beings do? If so, do they do this to set an example? Or do thegods simply sacrifice to themselves? Does ritual, by dint of its perfor-mance, subordinate even the gods?As the preceding studies have shown, the representation of godsengaged in the performance of ritual do not comprise an isolatedphenomenon in the ancient Mediterranean, or even in the history ofreligion. The iconographic and literary evidence presented here de-picts gods in highly diverse, if historically linked religious traditions,who themselves are the agents rather than the recipients of ritual.And there are others beyond the scope of this book.

We need a new theoretical framework for making sense of rit-ualizing gods, one that is both historically and theologically intelligible withinthe traditions in which such gods originate. This emic intelligibility cannot beoverstressed, for without it, etic interpretation is impoverished, and ultimatelyfails in its inability to exegete religious phenomena according to internal logicaloperations.The myriad historical data of divine religious action that have emerged inthis book show the inadequacy of projectionist theorizing. Anthropomorphism,what Goitein called in the case of the paradoxical prayer of God, “religious psy-chology...[since] Man has always seen God in his own image . . .” is notenough to interpret that prayer as a historical idea. For even if ancient Greekgods—or, paceHegel and following Feuerbach and Durkheim, all gods—are ul-timately understood as products of human consciousness or as hypostases ofsocial values, a currently privileged but unproven assumption, I have tried toshow that ritualizing gods are too complex for projectionist theory to illuminecompletely; there remains too much in their deep structures, their matrices, forwhich we must account.For example, as we have seen, the gods’ rituals are, ironically, often some-what “unorthodox” (such as God’s mikvehin fire, not water, in the Talmud) andthus dissimilar from orthodox human ritual prescriptions. This is because thenature and agency of the gods in ritual always changes the ritual situation, andthus the hermeneutical task. The representation of the goddess who pourslibations—or the god who hangs himself as a sacrifice, or circumambulates, orpurifies himself, or prays—should not be understood as a straightforward caseof replacing the human agent of religious action with a divine one. The utterdifference of the divine as a category affects not only the action but also theagency of the ritual.Along the same lines, the didactic or mimetic function that is ascribed topious deities fails to account for the elements of ipseity, noncontingency, andautonomy that chronically characterize the holy. Whereas, as Rappaport re-marks, the performance of human ritual generally subordinates or binds theperformer on a number of levels—that is, compromises her freedom andnegates the possibility of randomness in her actions, at least temporarily—divine ritual does not have that effect on its also divine performer. Rather, ritualoriginates with the god’s apparent urgency to self-manifest, and in some formto receive that self-manifestation reflected back in the human religious sphere.In the ancient Greek case, where mortals pour libations on the reverse of thevases that depict ritualizing gods, but also in the comparanda, the data show apattern of symbiotic relationship between divine and human ritual, culminat-ing in a kind of reciprocity that is enacted in cultic performance.In the end, a god is supremely self-referential, and all religious observancemust be understood as reflexively beginning with the god, not ending there.From an emic viewpoint, religion has its source, not only its object, in the gods.Furthermore, the goal of divine religious behavior is not so much paradigmaticinstruction of mortals, or modeling devotional piety for them, as it is self-expression that, like a voice seeking an echo in a canyon, can only be realized308“religion of the gods”"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"by the mirroring and corresponding syntax of human ritual. This bivalency inthe religious imagination is apparently a rule, rather than an exception. HenceI have argued that, from the perspective of a given tradition, religious actionought to be understood as an attribute and reflex of the divine, not simply as theprojection of human ritual obligation, or as paradigmatic showcase for right ac-tion.The rest of this concluding chapter will explore these concepts more fullyto show that the idea of divine reflexivity can encompass and illumine the in-terpretive dilemma of the god in ritual performance.Are the Ritualizing Gods Acting as Human Beings Do?Any formulation of a god who worships, whether in art, text, or tradition, alsochallenges our formulation of the “direction” toward which religion is ori-ented, and our corollary identification of subject and object. We have seen thatacts of worship or “religion” as practiced byrather than forthe god cannot log-ically be interpreted as the hierarchical act of an inferior to a superior being inthe same way as the same acts practiced by the gods’ devotees. There is noth-ing “superior” to the gods. Therefore they are not sacrificing, praying, self-purifying, or burning incense “to” a superior being. If we concede from anemic perspective the infinity and omnipotence of the gods, their sheer other-ness, then when the gods worship, it is not the same act as when people wor-ship, nor is it done for the same reason. The gods in ritual performance arenot acting as mortals do.Do the Gods Practice Religion in Order to Set an Example for Human Beings?The paradoxical portrayal of the gods as ritualizing priests serves to reinforcethe importance of that ritual within a given religious culture by making even thedivine its practioner. This is usually shown in reflexive and intensifying lan-guage. King Lear cries out, “Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia, / the Godsthemselves throw incense.”1When God or the gods are conceived of as them-selves worshiping, the power of that form of worship is exponentially in-creased. That is, eventhe gods do this. It may be observed in other religiouscontexts in the use of reflexive pronouns “themselves”; “Himself ”; and adverbssuch as “so” or “even,” as in John 3:16, “For God so loved the world that He gaveHis only son.”It must be argued that when, in the Hymn to Demeter,the great earth god-dess establishes her temple and her mysteries upon the rocky outcropping atEleusis, she prescribes the form in which she desires to be worshiped. But whenshe pours libations, is she simply “recommending” libation by her mortal wor-shipers? The didactic conferral of example may be the resultof the libations ofZeus or the Torah study of God, but it cannot be the cause.Religious activityconclusion309"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"emanates from the godhead; hence, religious worship is an extension of the di-vine sphere. It is the undifferentiated circle of who the god is(transcendent,unlimited power), of what belongsto the god (cultic accoutrements and culticsites), and what the god does(the practice of devotional acts).As we have seen, this often occurs during a historical period of crisis orthreat to established forms. Divine reflexivity is thus not exactly “paradig-matic,” because mimesis is not the apparent immediate goal, and the gods’ rel-ative dependence on the behavior of those who worship them is always am-biguous. It does, however, have the effect of a generative paradigm, which inturn theurgically summons corresponding human ritual response. In this way,divine reflexivity allows for religious systems to maintain and protect them-selves, especially their central, defining actions.Do the Gods Simply Sacrifice to Themselves?This is explicitly said in some cases, as in the Poetic Eddapassage about Odinhanged on the windy tree (“I was offered to Odin, myself to myself ”), or in thetalmudic prayer-sessions of God. But it is said in jest by Poseidon in The Birds,when he ironically swears “by Poseidon,” and in the Amphitr yon,where Jupiterjokes that he will be offering libations to himself. This is perhaps too crude of aconstruct, more implicitly understood by each religion than explicitly stated,and then only as one aspect of what is truly taking place in a divine sacrifice, rit-ual, or prayer. The Christian case is a good example. If one logically lays out thedoctrine of atonement in orthodoxy’s own trinitarian terms, God sacrifices hisown son—or allows his son to be sacrificed—through human agency and “forthe sake of the whole world.” To whom? To himself. And by himself. The theol-ogy of the crucifixion reveals a powerful sacrificial circularity.The doctrine is seldom expressed in these terms, perhaps because a kindof cruelty and an uncomfortable autonomy of will must then be attributed toGod’s nature. This chracterization also tends to obscure the voluntary nature ofChrist’s autosacrifice and loving-kindness of God, and perhaps even his grief atthe loss of his son (represented so poignantly in El Greco’s Trinity,no. O–4).And yet in the same painting, God wears a bishop’s miter, sacerdotal headgearthat points to his priestly role. In other words, it is not sufficient to say that thegods sacrifice “to themselves,” since the theological mechanism seems to bemore complex. Closer, perhaps, to the ideation would be to say that the godssacrificeaboutthemselves or because ofthemselves.Cultic Action as Divine AttributeIn the religious imagination, cultic objects and places clearly come from theother world. Holy text is often seen as having divine origin.2The ancient mir-ror enshrined and periodically reenshrined at Ise belongs to the sun goddessAmaterasu-omikami, and is identified with her. According to tradition, Christ310“religion of the gods”"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"imprinted his face on a cloth to heal Abgar of Edessa; the Virgin Mary trans-ferred her lunar image to Juan Diego’s apron at Guadalupe Hidalgo. David ex-plained the commands of God to Solomon concerning the dimensions of thetemple in which he, God, would dwell, down to the dimensions of the goldentable for the showbread and the placement of the seat of mercy (1 Chr.28:11–19). “All this he made clear by the writing of the hand of the Lord con-cerning it, all the work to be done according to the plan.” Orthodox icons ap-pear from the other world in the forks of tree branches, dxeiropoAhtoß, “un-made by human hands.” The naga’s cave bears the shadow left behind by theTa t h a ̄gata, sought in veneration centuries later by the pilgrim Hsüan-Tsang.The Rock beneath the Dome bears the foot print of the Prophet, left when heascended into the seven heavens.But what about cultic action, the set of sanctified behaviors that constitutethe practiced religion? What about prayer, the study of scripture, the burning ofincense, the slaughter of animals, or the pouring of libations? Eliade showedhow God or the gods ordain or perhaps even perform a ritual oncein aboriginaltime, as a cosmogonic or foundational act for the religious tradition—reiterated,as Stanley Tambiah says, “in order to achieve the double feat of projecting con-crete present time into mythical time (Eliade, 1959:20) and bringing the supe-rior divine realm or moments of beginning into the present human world toachieve a cleansing and a charging with moral potency.”3If the gods continueto perform that ritual in cultural representations, and the ritual is not cos-mogonic but quotidien, seeming to take place continually—on an ongoing ba-sis, in the divine sphere, as often as it does in the human realm, and perhapseven signaling a relationship between the two—then the time in question isother than illud tempus. It is the hyper-present time of enacted ritual.Greek gods are shown on classical vase-paintings holding libation bowls.In the previous instances, ritual objects often enter intothe human realm fromthe very gods for whom the ritual is intended. In a sense, these cultic objects“belong” to the gods. But the idea does not stop at that point. In hundreds ofthese images, the high gods tip the bowl and pour out the wine. They worshipjust as humans do. Both the wine of the divine libation and its action are un-mistakably represented. Crimson paint depicts the wine offered by the gods. Itsplashes onto the altar or onto the ground.The Vedic deity Indra drinks soma while the gods eternally chant as theysacrifice. God reads the Torah daily and stands among his congregation in thesynagogue, holy head covered with a prayer shawl. Together with his angels,Alla ̄h performs ritual intercessory prayer. Ritual action alsoseems to comefrom, belong to, and even express the nature of the gods for whom it isintended.Worship by the gods is a situation imagined as removed, sharply distin-guished from the human realm. The assumption that it is in some way “about”human beings is misleading. As heirs to an intellectual tradition of humanism,we tend to analyze cult activity or worship as the exclusive province of mortals.In fact, we view worship as quintessentially human religious behavior: It isthe appropriate activity of contingent beings toward noncontingent, infinitelyconclusion311"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"superior ones. This approach flourishes in structuralism; for example, in an essayon divine possession in Tamilnadu, Manuel Moreno describes this approach asit is applied to the Hindu gods, largely referencing the writings of Dumont:From the structuralist point of view, gods are symbols of social reali-ties, metaphors for human relationships. The divine attributes andthe relationships of the gods vis-à-vis other gods are treated assources of information about the social order, and religion is viewedas the privileged domain wherein men [sic] gain insights into this or-der by homological inferences. Gods reflect the structure of society,and for this reason they are useful to the sociologist. Stripped of theirbodily personalities, gods become disembodied residents of theHindu universe, fixed homologies vis-à-vis other humans.4So therefore, so the thinking goes, the gods, when they worship, must be actinganthropomorphically.We take for granted that humans originate worship; but from traditionalistperspectives, the gods, the recipients of religious activity, are its logical origina-tors. This is “ideal worship,” but it is more. It is the source of worship and thereason for worship. God or the gods are plainly portrayed as participating in rit-ual activity, in cult. This is because they are its source; practiced religion be-longs to them. As John Carman observes, “It is a striking feature of sacrifice inmany religious traditions that what is offered in sacrifice to a deity not only rep-resents something vital to the sacrifice but something appropriate to, belong-ing to, and even part of the deity who receives the sacrifice.”5The evidence seems to show that the “sphere of sacrifice” (or “sphere of re-ligion”), this circle belonging to the god of which the sacrificial victim is a natu-ral part, can be enlarged to include religious action. Just as the gods receive sac-rifices appropriate to them (fish from the sea, or bulls that shake the earth toPoseidon; sweet-smelling incense to Aphrodite, goddess of the boudoir), so theyalso enact religious gestures equally appropriate to them. Dionysos, the god ofwine, pours only from a kantharos, his signature vessel. Apollo, the god of pu-rification, washes his hands at a lustral basin. Odin, the god of the hanged,pierces and hangs himself from the tree at the center of the world.The concept of divine reflexivity obviates the need for a lost myth or invisi-ble recipient. In a sense, there is no remaining tension between theology andcult. This is a new category: “the religion of the gods.”6The Ontic Autonomy of the DivineThe mirror-play between heaven and earth, mutual reflecting spheres, is one ofthe most ancient and fundamental religious ideas. Then why, when we considerit now, at this point in the history of religions, do we find it so problematic? Andmore important, why has the predominant response been to distort religious his-tory by saying that mirror activity, such as gods performing ritual actions, is ele-vated anthropomorphism? This is not a new critique, but the descendant of clas-312“religion of the gods”"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"sical skepticism; however, I maintain that its present form has led us significantlyastray in understanding these images, and their comparanda in other traditions.As William Paden puts it, “The world of the sacred shows itself reciprocallywith the states of mind of its participants.”7There is no doubt that there is rec-iprocity between the two worlds, and “like knows like”: “[I]n the frame of reli-gious interpretation, human consciousness is explicitly part of the frame....The appearance of the sacred relates to the transformations of the religious par-ticipants’ own subjectivity. We human beings are part of the reality equation.”8But we can easily forget that in the minds of ancient adherents that con-ceived these paradigms, God was notobject, but supreme subject and agent. Infact, as Anne-Marie Schimmel writes of the Sufi understanding of God, “OnlyGod has the right to say, ‘I,’ and the heart must be emptied to receive Him.”A man knocked at the door of his beloved.“Who are you, trusted one?” thus asked the friend.He answered: “I!” The friend said: “Go away,Here is no place for people raw and crude!”What, then, could cook the raw and rescue himBut separation’s fire and exile’s flame?The poor man went to travel for a whole yearAnd burned in separation from his friend,And he matured, was cooked and burnt, returnedAnd carefully approached the friend’s abode.He walked around it now in cautious fearLest from his lips unfitting words appear.His friend called out: “Who is there at my door?”The answer: “You, dear, youare at the door!”He said: “Come in, now that you are all I—There is no room in this house for two ‘I’s!”—Maula ̄na ̄Jala ̄luddı ̄n Ru ̄mı ̄,Mathnawı ̄-yi maÛnawı ̄I 3056–63Schimmel comments, “Maulana never ceases to marvel at the fact that He whois not contained by heaven and earth can yet dwell within the tiny humanheart, that he lovingly condescends into our hearts, which are broken for Hissake, there to dwell like a treasure in the ruins.”9The ontic autonomy—the perfect ipseity—of the gods is stressed in othertraditions. God discloses himself to Moses as I AM (literally, in the Hebrew im-perfect, “I will be who I will be.”) God is the source of all existence, hence thefount of subjectivity. The pre-Socratic philosophers came close to this conceptin making Zeus First Cause. When the ancient Greek gods are represented aspouring out wine, they perform not a giant burlesque of human action but anoriginal act that occurs not just once, but continually. Themselves the supremeontic beings, the subjects of all verbs, the gods have the unique right and abilityto perform ritual action, sacrifice being the most potent example. As Christo-pher Fry writes in his play Thor with Angels, “for sacrifice / Can only be per-fectly made by God.”10W. Brede Kristensen ratifies such an idea when he saysconclusion313"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"that sacrifice is expressed most purely when the gods themselves perform thesacrifice by sacrificing themselves: “sacrificial death is the actualization of di-vine life....God who sacrifices himself is the formulation of the thoughtbehind every act of sacrifice. It is the actualizing of absolute life.”11Religioussubjectsare also only known in the context of religious acts.Paden says,Religious interpretation...is the activity of seeing the world as sa-cred, rather than seeing the world as social forces or physical sub-stances. The gods are not known independently of this active, experi-ential matrix. Without a religious subject, no religious objects, noreligious data, come into view....The concept of multiple data-creating frames and paradigms therefore means that we are nolonger forced to choose between the objectivist, rationalist optionsthat either the god exists or the god is an illusion—a dichotomy thathas pervaded popular opinion just as much as it has philosophy andtheology. Gods are ways of seeing the world, and these ways exist.12How, Paden asks, does reciprocity work in a religious frame? “If we can say,‘as society, so the gods,’ or ‘as the psyche, so the gods,’ then religion itself says,‘as religiousness, so the gods.’ ”13Religion also says, however, “as the gods, soreligiousness.”The Emergence of a Religious CategoryA phenomenological category in the history of religions emerges, one that isnot new but rather has been submerged as an anomaly in the classical recordbecause of its isolation from the comparative context. It is a transcultural struc-ture with both cultic and theological dimensions. While its emphases may bedifferent in the traditions we have examined, I have argued that it neverthelesshas essentially similar foundations. This category, “divine reflexivity” or the re-ligion of the gods, actually allows the gods to be what religions imagine them tobe, unique and all-powerful, their fallibility or lack thereof notwithstanding.Echoing Rilke, they “alone are the source,” the perpetually original devotees oftheir own cult.This category represents more than an attribute of the divine (that is, a godis omnipotent, a god regenerates himself, a god worships). It is a reformulationof “god” with respect to that which arguably constitutes him or her: practicedreligion. “Gods crystallize how we address and are addressed by those agencieson which our world depends.”14If religion maintains the god, why should thegod not also maintain the religion? At the heart of this arrangement is reci-procity, built-in, perpetually effected, and eternally established.Albert Moore asks a valuable question: “How does this experience trans-form the worshipper’s understanding or reinforce his religious stance person-ally? How does his own body relate to the ‘ideal body’ of the god?”15The God314“religion of the gods”"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"who prays, the gods who pour libations, are in each instance a presentation thatreiterates divine experience. The believer becomes part of the sphere that is thegoddess and all the cultic dimensions associated with her. We have also seenthat the humanly expressed idea of gods practicing religion has the intentionand effect of conferring authority and ultimacy onto the religious actions inquestion. In this ideation, the gods shift from recipient or object to originatingsubject. Those who view the vase or read the text can see the same source atwork.Attic vase-paintings did not exist in a self-contained universe. Rather, theviewer would be reciprocally drawn into their realm. Whether as sanctuaryofferings or as decorative grave goods for the late archaic and early classical Etr-uscan dead, the vases “intended,” conveyed, or reflected something.16Writingabout the Buddha-image, Titus Burckhardt says of the reciprocal relation be-tween the worshiper and the icon: “The icon penetrates the bodily conscious-ness of the man and the man as it were projects himself into the image. Havingfound in himself that of which the image is an expression, he transmits back toit a subtle power which then shines forth on others.”17The message comesfrom the Buddha-image; the process begins there, not with the human being.By no means do I wish to minimize the fact that human artists createdthese images to be seen and understood by other human members of the soci-ety. Rather, I would submit that human artists create on the basis of religioustraditions and out of the vortices of religious thought. The question is: what ex-planation for the vase-paintings makes the most sense in terms of what weknow about ancient Greek religion as it had evolved up to the time of the clas-sical period? The “humanization” of the immortals by the attribution of humanbehavior to them, as if acts of offering were the same as romantic dalliances ortennis volleys? Or the deliberate portrayal of the omnipotent gods as rituallyself-sufficient and paradigmatic? I would argue that it is the latter.The phenomenon of divine reflexivity does not require human action. Tothe believer, the gods are sufficient unto themselves. But as a determinant ofritual, it does have the purpose and effect of sustaining religious worship. Whydoes this change anything? Is “the religion of the gods” at the apex of a blurrycontinuum of human-divine relations or is it something completely “other,” asGod’s tefellincontain prayers that are entirely different from human Jewishprayers? Is the proprosal an anthropology of divine sacrifice or a theology ofhuman religious behavior?Modern Iconoclasm: An Answer to “Projection”The postulation of the category of “divine reflexivity” in the history of religion isabove all a rejection of a construct of human projection as being appropriate tothe self-understanding of an artifact-producing religious society. It rejects theimputation of specific forms of human behavior to the constructed “divine.”Rather, it claims that divine worship was in fact a deliberately expressed theme,conclusion315"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"not an accidental migration. In other words, the libation bowl did not simplyjump from the hands of the devotee to that of the god. If anything, it was morethan natural for the god to hold and pour from the bowl.To summarize: “divine reflexivity” occurs as an organizing phenomenon inparticular religious milieus in order to emphasize and perpetuate forms of re-ligious action. It does so by envisioning the god as both natural object and asnatural source of religion. And yet, invariably and no matter what our specula-tions about its meaning, it presents itself as something hard to grasp. The godwho worships is a paradox that stretches and perhaps tears the fabric of rationalanalysis. But so does the religious imagination itself, its terms being ultimatelyits own, subordinate to no other, its deep structures transcendent and indis-cernible.“The invisible harmony is stronger than the visible one (crmonAhdfanbßfanerpß kreAttvn),” wrote Herakleitos toward the end of the archaic age.18Perhaps, as Hegel implied, reflexivity is a defining element of the divine—regardless of whether or not the divine is a human construct. Even if their pur-pose cannot be adequately described or even fully revealed, the high gods whopour out wine are no iconographic aberration. Gods in ritual performance donot belong at the periphery of the historical study of religion. Anomalous, self-transmuting, and utterly real, they bring rather an iconic challenge to our lim-ited imaginations. As Rilke asks, “What would be a God without the cloudwhich preserves him? What would be a worn-out God?”316“religion of the gods”"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"CatalogueN.B.: All vase-paintings are Attic unless otherwise notedMiddle Archaic Period(600–510B.C.E.)Votive Statuesapollo1.Delphi Museum.

A priestess approaches with acovered basket on her head, as does avotary playing the double flute. A cele-brant approaches with a tympanon.Around the register of the vase, an ec-static dance explodes.Claude Bérard and Jean-LouisDurand write, “This group [the twodeities] cannot be separated from theright-hand section of the frieze. Infact, the libation cups are not merelydecorative accessories or attributes;they are functional: liquid flows andspreads to the foot of the altar in frontof the pedestal. (This essential detailis scarcely visible in the photographs,since it is painted in added white,which is extremely fugitive.) Al-though static, this mysterious couplethus participates in the general ac-tion, carrying out a libation, as if inresponse to the musicians anddancers who frame them” (“Enteringthe Imagery,” in City of Images,25).The Group of Polygnotos.

William Anderson writes in his study of the Green Man in European religiousculture, “It is a sign of archetypal power in an image that it should be capable of trans-formation from one culture to another, from one set of beliefs to a fresh paradigm offaith. This means that it expresses something permanent in the human soul, howevermuch one age may lay different stresses on it from a previous time” (Anderson, TheGreen Man: Archetype of Our Oneness with the Earth, 56).14. Vernant, “Théorie générale du sacrifice et mise à mort dans la uysAagrecque,” 12.15. Traditional acceptance of the special case of the sacrifice of Jesus, as we willsee, holds only on one level of theological understanding. When Christ’s death isviewed not only as a voluntary autosacrifice which is recapitulated in the Eucharistbut also or rather as a sacrifice by God the Father—not only modeled after but utterlydetermined by the ancient Judaic type of the binding of Isaac—controversy againerupts.16. One can observe this from the ancient scholion to Aristophanes’s Peace433,which arbitrarily assigns Hermes’s libation and formulaic prayer to the mortal chorus(even though Hermes has said that he is holding the sacred bowl) to Martin Nilsson’scategorical comment in 1956 on the vase images in question, “They [the gods] cannotpossibly be sacrificing or pouring out libations” (The Dionysiac Mysteries of the Hellenis-tic and Roman Age, 103).17.

Human beings offer the immor-tals smoke and libations, and divide the entrails and spitted, grilled meat among them-selves according to a traditional hierarchy. The priests’ portion, the choicest portion ofthe meat, is called the gAraß. Hence Zeus’s mention of the libation and savor (sweetsmoke) of the sacrifice as the gods’ gAraßis of interest; it is a specific cultic differentia-tion of what rightly belongs to whom.4.

Burkert compares this to the story of the thirsty King David who, when threemighty men risked their lives to bring him water from the Philistine-controlled well ofBethlehem at the gate, forbore to drink and in tribute to their bravery, “poured out thewater to the Lord” (2 Samuel 23:16) (Burkert, Structure and Histor y, 55 and n. 12).

Hekamede prepares a mixed potion of onion, honey, “holybarley,” Pramneian wine, and goat cheese, all of which is sprinkled with white barley.Watkins suggests that this reflects a sacred recipe.21. Watkins, “Grains,” 10. The language of Circe’s instructions (Odyssey10.1518–1520) is almost identical to that describing the actual libations poured byOdysseus at the infernal rivers’ junction (Odyssey11.26–28:xobnxeamhn ppsinnekAessi, prpta melikrati,metApeita dBcdAJoGni,tbtrAton aRu›Edati \u0002DpBd›glfita leykbpalynon(pour a libation to all the dead first with honey-mixed [milk]and then with sweet wine, then third with water, and sprinkle thereon white barley).Watkins comments that the fact that the honey was mixed with milk is clear from Euri-pedesOrestes115 (melAkrat›...galaktoß).

The number and the precisionof the agreements between Indo Iranian and Greek...are too striking for a fortuitousresemblance to be plausible” (Watkins, “Grains,” 17). Wasson argued for the identifica-tion of soma and Eleusinian hallucinogens in his The Road to Eleusis(1976); however,this idea has been rejected by Burkert and others.24. It has been argued that in ancient Mesopotamia, where propitiation andmagic were the governing principles of offering food and drink to the gods, and divina-tion their usual goal, the term “sacrifice” should not be used at all. See Leichty, “Ritual,‘Sacrifice,’ and Divination in Mesopotomia,” esp. 237.25. For example, the Zakros Rhyton depicts in relief carving a fragile, long-lostmountaintop sanctuary, which we otherwise could never have imagined, surroundedbyagrimini,the indigenous Cretan long-horned goat that still lives there.26. See Long, The Ayia Triadha Sarcophagus.27. For a discussion of the archaeological evidence for libation in classical antiq-uity, see Simon, “Archäologisches zu Spende und Gebet in Griechenland und Rom.”28. Homeric libation involved rising (Iliad16.231;Odyssey3.341), taking the cupin hand (Iliad11.774–775), looking to the sky (Iliad16.232; 24.307), pouring the liquid,pronouncing a prayer, with one’s hands held toward the sky (Iliad6.265; 24.285; thendrinking (for example, Hekabe meeting Hektor on the walls of Troy in Iliad6.258–260gives him “honey-sweet wine to pour to father Zeus and the other immortals first, andafterwards if you will drink yourself, be strengthened”).29.Iliad24.283–286;Odyssey13.50–52.30.Odyssey4.591–592.31.Iliad16.225–227.32.

Albert Henrichs observes, “That the term spondairatherthankhoaiis occasionally used for chthonian libations does not affect the nature ofthese libations, or their composition; they are still poured into the ground, and the rit-ual liquids used for them tend to be more complex than the loibaiordinarily used forOlympian gods.

See alsoXenophonCyropaedia2.3.1 and Hesychius s.v. “trAtoß kratar.” Hanell(“Trankopfer,” col. 2136) points out that there were no hard and fast rules for the threedrink-offerings; one could invoke the other gods as well with libations, such asDionysos, Hygeia, or Zeus Philios.44. Hoffman, Sotades, 5: “[The symposium] was essentially an élitist affair, re-stricted to those who could afford it, and took place on special occasions such as wed-dings, victories in athletic or literary contests, departures for abroad, or important ar-rivals.” Hoffman refers to Plato Symposium176a and Xenophon Symposium2, as wellas the treatments of J. K. Davies, Athenian Propertied Families600–300B.C. (Oxford,1971), and I. Scheibler, Griechische Töpferkunst(Munich, 1983).45.

Cf. the libations of Alkinöos for Odysseus, 13.39–55; Antiphon, in Accusationof Poisoning18, mentions that two friends pour libations when one is at the point of de-parture.48. Cf.

Hesiod Theogony793–806 (see discussion in chapter 3).52. As Burkert has observed, sphagia(animal sacrifices) started wars; spondai(liq-uid libations) concluded them. An inscription from Arkades, Crete (discussed inZeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik13 [1974]: 265–274) simply says, “We, the po-lis, have made libation,” meaning, “We have concluded a peace treaty.”53. “Ihre wirklich grobe Bedeutung für den griechischen Kult haben dieTrankopfer als Begleiterscheinung anderer Opfer” (Hanell, “Trankopfer,” col. 2135).54. Libations belonged not only to large animal sacrifices, but also to the gift of-ferings of cakes, fruits, and the like, for example, Philemon, fr. 70, ˆArtemi,fAlhdAspoina,toPtan soi fArv,rpatni›,dmfifpnta kaBspondasima(Artemis, dearlady, I bring you this cake offered by two lights, O mistress, and this libation), cited byHanell, “Trankopfer,” col. 2134. Hanell speculates that the “two lights” could either re-fer to the sun and the moon, or to two burning candles.378notes to pages 34–36"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"55. See Albert Henrichs’s discussion of these sacrifices in his essay, “The ‘Sobri-ety’ of Oedipus.”56. Stengel, Die griechischen Kultusaltertümer,105.57. For example, the bowls designated by the Eumenides for Oedipus’s propria-tory xoaAat their grove at Colonus are kratpreß(Oedipus at Colonus72).58. The scene is reduplicated on the outside of the vase with divine pairs: Zeus andHera, Poseidon and Amphitrite, Dionysos and Ariadne, and Ares and Aphrodite. Of thefirst three pairs, the male deity in each case holds a phiale; Aphrodite brings Ares askyphos. The divine symposium is observed and linked to themes of fertility by Ruth M.Gais, “Some Problems of River-God Iconography,” 364–365. Gais compares the numer-ous representations of reclining banqueting deities to the anonymous banqueter on clas-sicalTotenmahlreliefs from Thasos and elsewhere. “As with representations of mortalbanqueters, the representations of gods reclining at a feast can assume, in addition to apurely narrative purpose, a symbolic meaning which indicates the god’s connection tofertility” (364). In the case of the vase London E 82, she points to the presence in thetondo of the cup of the king and queen of the underworld. “The cornucopia held by Plutosymbolizes the connection between life and death and fertility, as does Persephone her-self. The image of Pluto reclining in the banqueting pose reinforces the connection be-tween fertility, death, and feasting” (365). Gais says that the fertility theme is reinforced bythe presence on the outside of Zeus, Dionysos, and Poseidon crowned with olive (Zeusand Poseidon) and ivy (Dionysos). Only the warlike Ares does not wear a leafy crown.59. Hoffman, Sotades,5.60. Dionysos only pours libations from the kantharos, the two-handled vessel spe-cial to his cult in particular, and also preferred by the libating Herakles (see Fig. 1,“Chart of Vase Shapes”).

Jonathan Z. Smith has speculated on the use of domestic animals by the ancientGreeks and other agrarian or pastoralist societies for sacrificial purposes in his essay,“The Domestication of Sacrifice” in Hamerton-Kelly, ed., Violent Origins; for example,“Sacrifice is an elaboration of the selective kill, in contradistinction to the fortuitous kill”(200);“Sacrifice...is the artificial (i.e., ritualized) killing of an artificial (i.e., domesti-cated) animal”(italics Smith’s).

A great deal has been said about this reluctance. Karl Meuli’s theory positeda profound identification between Neolithic hunter and prey (such as earlier cavepaintings seem to anticipate), which survived in a vestigial bond between sacrificer andvictim (“Griechische Opferbräuche”). Meuli seeks to account for the ambivalence,guilt, and denial that seemed to surround the ancient Greek uysAa: the pseudo-orderand calm of the ritual, the women’s cries to drown out any cries of the victim, and thefrequent literary emphasis on the animal’s willingness to die for a sublime end. In anextreme case, the very old Athenian festival of Zeus called the Bouphonia (ox-slaying),all participants in the sacrifice from the water carrier to the priest were ceremoniallytried each year for the murder of the animal. Each was absolved in a “comedy of inno-cence” until the axe itself was ultimately found guilty and flung into the sea (Pausanias1.24.4 and 28; see Parke, Festivals of the Athenians,162–167, and Simon, Festivals of At-tica,8–12).Vernant and others have instead emphasized the uncomfortable similarity—theliteral consanguinity—sensed by the ancient Greeks between their constant sacrifice ofanimals and the taboo, unholy murder of human beings. This has supposedly led tothe reluctance to recall, either verbally or visually, the moment when the animal waskilled. See Vernant, “Théorie générale du sacrifice et mise à mort dans la uysAagrecque,” 1–21, esp. 4–9.

This evi-dentiary usage is itself disturbing; I have examined the relief and it is clear that Apollo,not Artemis, is the chief sacrificer.

The importantquestion of how the robust Etruscan art market of the sixth and fifth centuries influ-enced the iconographic choices of the Attic Kerameikos is treated by Nigel Spivey,“Greek Vases in Etruria.”Coarse and black-glazed ware was the domestic pottery of the Athenians; the red-figure vases we see were special, dedicated in sanctuaries both in Greece and Etruria,given as athletic prizes, or drunk from at symposia. But 80 percent of the Greek vasesnow in museums and private collections were recovered from tombs, the vast majorityof them Etruscan (although, as T. B. L. Webster argues, “the fact that 80 per cent werefound in graves does not mean that 80 per cent were destined for graves”; cited inSpivey, “Greek Vases,” 149–150). Some were probably intended to be the tableware ofan eschatological banquet; others held the ashes of their aristocratic owners, who werefabulously wealthy, according to Diodorus Siculus (5.40), writing in the first centuryB.C.E. The question posed by ethnoarchaeology is what “message” was intended by theartists who painted these vases, and what message was received by the Etruscans whobought them? Depictions of athletic events, equestrian pursuits, and musically accom-panied feasts would have found resonance with Etruscan views of the afterlife, as wemight infer from the subjects of their tomb wall-paintings.But as Spivey rightly points out, “not all myths on Greek vases found in Etruscantombs can be viewed as particularly appropriate for Etruscan funerary use” (Spivey,“Greek Vases,” 146), and the common presence of cult statues holding phialai inGreece or even the simple fact that a lekythos with a libating Athena was interred inthe polyandrion at Thespiai in the classical period argues against an overly emphaticconstruction of the vases’ religious imagery as “created for” or even “aimed at” theirnotes to pages 54–57385"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"Etruscan purchasers.

Typically on vase paintings mortal women hold the oinochoe for men, who li-bate from the phiale, and only hold the phiale themselves when alone. But goddessesare different, and can hold their own phiale in the company of a male phiale-bearinggod: Hera and Zeus both extend phialai for Athena in no. 22; Cybele and Sabazioseach hold a phiale in no. 195.

The one exception is a coin from Paphos in Cyprus in the fourth century B.C.E.(no. 242), which I include as a paradigmatic illustration of a cult statue of Nemesis,with phiale and branch, perhaps that of Rhamnous by Agorakritos, discussed in chap-ter 3 (Lacroix, Les reproductions de statues sur les monnaies grecques,287 ff., pl. xxvi, 1;Richter, The Sculpture and Sculptors of the Greeks,185, no. 679.

In Nat-ural Histor y36.17, Pliny says that Agorakritos lost a sculptural competition to sculptAphrodite to Pheidias’s other favorite, Alkamenes. Agorakritos then sold his statue “onthe condition that it should not remain in Athens, and called it Nemesis; it was set up atRhamnous, a deme of Attica, and was preferred by Varro to all other statues.” Richter dis-counts as problematic the reconstructions of the Rhamnous Nemesis based on the repre-sentations of a goddess holding a phiale and branch on fourth-century Cypriot coins (no.242; see Richter, Sculpture,185 no. 679 and n. 82; Six, “Aphrodite-Nemesis,” 89–102 pl.5, and Lacroix, Les reproductions de statues sur les monnaies grecques,”287 ff., pl. xxvi, 1).12.

The particular legendof Apollo’s pouring libations to appease the Erinyes and expiate the blood-guiltcaused by his slaughter of the chthonian serpent (the Pytho) at Delphi has led severalscholars to emphasize a mythical explanation for the frequency of his appearance inthe ancient representations described in chapter 1.

The myth of Apollo killing the Pytho at Delphi long predated Plutarch; it isfound in the Homeric Hymn to Pythian Apollo355 ff., Scholion to Pindar Pythian Odes4.11–14 (ed. Drachmann), and Euripides’s Iphigenia at Tauris1245 ff. These, in turn,probably bespeak an even more ancient tradition. Murders of supernatural or chthoniancreatures by gods are not unheard-of; Hermes slew Argos. But far more than Apollo’sdeed, many other mythical or legendary events would seem to warrant blood-guiltinessand divine atonement: the murder of the hapless Niobids or the hunter Actaeon byArtemis, the slaughter of the Greeks encamped at Troy by Apollo’s plague-bearing ar-rows, the burning of Semele, the mother of Dionysos by the thunderbolt of Zeus, andcaused by Hera’s jealousy, or even the destruction of Kronos himself by his own son.50. Plutarch De defectu oraculorum418A–B. The story has a source in PlutarchQuaestiones Graecae293C: “Now the Septerion seems to be a mimesisof the god’s battlewith the Python and the flight and expulsion to Tempê after the battle: Some indeedsay that he [Apollo] fled because he sought to be purified for the murder (oCmBngbrfygePnDpBtufanifasBxriÓ zonta kauarsAvn), others that he was following thewounded Python as it fled along the road, which we now call [the] sacred [way], andjust missed its death.” Text: Plutarch Moralia, Loeb Classical Library, translation mine.See the discussion in Burkert, Homo Necans,127–130. Burkert notes of the first versionthat, ironically, “the purificatory god was himself in need of purification, for he hadkilled” (Homo Necans,130).51. See Gibert, “Apollo’s Sacrifice: The Limits of a Metaphor in Greek Tragedy,”which engages this argument in the form in which it appeared in my dissertation,When the High Gods Pour Out Wine: The Paradox of Divine Reflexivity in ComparativeContext, Harvard University, 1992.

For the connection of Hermes’s cattle theftwith shamanism and primitive hunting ritual, see 184 n. 29.54. Susan C. Shelmerdine takes these details to refer to the “regular procedurefor preparing a meal with meat in ancient Greece, and while the scene here is regularlyreferred to as a ‘sacrifice,’ we should remember that whenever an animal was killed forfood, a portion was set aside for the gods. The focus in this scene is really on themeal.” Shelmerdine, The Homeric Hymns.55.Hymn to Hermes127–129. Greek text: Hymn to Hermes,inHesiod, The HomericHymns and Homerica,Loeb Classical Library. Translation of this and the next passageby Susan C. Shelmerdine, who points out in her commentary to these lines that the“twelve portions” of the meat (dadeka moAraß) each receive a gAraß, the choicest por-tion of meat that is normally laid onto the sacrificial meat reserved for the god himselfor for the priest—that is, the gAraßwould have gone to only one person at the meal(e.g.,Iliad7.321,Odyssey8.479–481). Whereas at Mekone Prometheus provides suchuneven portions that Zeus even complains, Hermes “takes special care that all 12 por-tions are equally honorable and perfect” (Shelmerdine, The Homeric Hymns).56.Hymn to Hermes,130–133. Shelmerdine believes that Hermes has not yet beenaccepted into the Olympic pantheon and is bidding for a place by preparing the feast:“No one can agree why Hermes refuses to eat the meat for which he has been longingfor since line 64. If the food is intended to mark the timêof the recipient, however,Hermes would naturally not yet be entitled to a portion” (Shelmerdine, commentaryon lines 131–133, in her edition of the Homeric Hymns).57. The meaning of csAhin this context remains controversial. Liddell, Scott, andJones in A Greek-English Lexicongive the meanings “divine law” and “the service owed392notes to pages 110–11"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"by man to God.” LSJ therefore renders this passage “the rite of the flesh-offering.”However, Shelmerdine argues on the basis of the work of H. Jeanmaire (“Le substantifcsAaet sa signification comme terme technique dans le vocabulaire grecque,” Revuedes Études Grecques58 [1945]: 66–89), and M.H.A.L.H. van der Valk (“Quelques remar-ques sur le sens du nom ‘Hosia,’ ” REG64 [1951]: 417–422) in seeing csAhas “a rite ofdesacralization.” She concludes in her note to Hymn to Hermes130, “the passage there-fore describes Hermes’ longing for the ‘desacralized portion of the meat.’ ”58. Kerényi, Prometheus: Archetypal Image of Human Existence,ApostolosAthanassakis elaborates on this point. Hermes, in his crime, is quintessentially appro-priate in his actions toward the powers that be: 54.59. “He performs the feat of stealing them, he kills them, thereby receiving theirmanaand becoming a uebß boykolAhß, and then he performs a sacrifice to theOlympians and sets up the corpus delictias a spma fvrpß, a monumentof stealing. Heis a thief but a pious thief. Indeed, when he pleads his case before Zeus he takes careto tell him that he reverences Helios, obviously not unaware that Helios has a specialconnection with cows. His pastoral care and power over cows and other herds is sol-emnized by Apollon, who gives him a three-forked golden staff and who places cattleof all sorts under his care.” Apostolos Athanassakis, “From the Phallic Cairn to Shep-herd God and Divine Herald,” 37.60.Iliad5 and 22.61. Euripides Hippolytus1437.62. Shelmerdine, The Homeric Hymns, Hymn to Hermes. She points out that Her-mes’s actions do not recapitulate the normal sacrificial practices known from theHomeric poems. No preliminary rituals such as the scattering of the barley or the cut-ting of the cattle’s hair occur, “as the poet seems more interested in describing the dis-position of the cooked meat than any preliminary ritual activities. While there areclearly sacrificial elements in the present scene, then, the central focus remains themeal (daAß).”63. Athanassakis, The Homeric Hymns, 90.64. Aristophanes Birds514–519.

Nan Dunbar argues instead that “placing a share of thesplagxnaon the hands or knees of a cult-statue seems implied in a series of inscrip-tions, probably all 4thc.B.C., regulating the priest’s share of the sacrificed animals onthe island of Chios” (Dunbar, trans. and ed., Aristophanes Birds,356 on Birds 518–519).66.

Albert Henrichs writes, “Dionysos in disguise makes excellent theater becausehe is an unfailing source of dramatic irony...[which is]...in the eyes of the audience,a deadly weapon which disintegrates the king’s identity long before the physical sparag-mosoccurs off stage” (“Male Intruders among the Maenads: The So-Called Male Cele-brant,” 86). In this essay, Henrichs considers the persistent modern myth of the “malecelebrant” in the maenadic rites as portrayed by Euripides in the Bacchae. This mythwas propagated by E. R. Dodds, based on variant readings of lines 115 and 140 (Dodds,in “Maenadism in The Bacchae,” and in his first Oxford edition of the Bacchae[1944]).Rationalism’s disciples, among them A. W. Verrall, Gilbert Norwood, and Gilbert Mur-ray, refused at the beginning of this century to allow the Dionysos BramioßofBacchae115 to be the god himself—for example, Norwood’s characterization of him as a deceiton the part of Euripides, “a man masquerading as a god masquerading as man” (G.Norwood,The Riddle of the Bacchae: The Last Stage of Euripides’ Religious Views, 80–125),and Murray’s gently conspiratorial and unfounded remarks: “A number of difficult pas-sages in Euripides’ Bacchaeand other Dionysiac literature find their explanations whenwe realize how the god is in part merely identified with the inspired chief dancer, inpart he is the intangible projected incarnation of the emotion of the dance” (G. Murray,Four Stages of Greek Religion, 43. See Henrichs’s discussion of these in “Male Intruders,”87 nn. 75 and 76, and ff., where he demonstrates that there is no solid textual or religiousbasis for assuming that the celebrant or “stranger” in the Bacchaeis any other than thegod Dionysos (as the character himself announces in no uncertain terms). The lengths towhich classical scholars will go, including textual distortion or emendation, to avoid con-fronting the god as worshiper are extraordinary. We encountered this already in the Peaceand will encounter it again in chapter 4 and in exegesis of talmudic and Islamic sacredtexts. One indication of what must be at its root theological discomfort with ritualizinggods is the use by scholars of phrases like “difficult passages,” as Murray calls them.74.

Burkert suggests that the gods’ oath derives from an ancientNear Eastern tripartite formula (examples of which we find in Hittite, Ugaritic, andAramaic) invoking “the sun and sky, the earth with its rivers, and the underworld—inother words, the entire cosmos.” The gods’ oath by the Styx alone, then, “is a result ofthe last part of the cosmic formula being mistakenly separated from the rest” (Burkert,Greek Religion,251 and nn. 8 and 9).88.

The activity in which Alexander, as a god, should not participate (dnauamatakataskeyazein) has no technical sacrificial overtones in Greek but participates in thewider semantic field of votive offerings to which sacrifices surely belong. ›Anauamata,a noun formed from dnatAuhmi, “to set up,” once having the sense of “delight” or “or-nament,” is used almost exclusively from the time of Herodotus (1.14.92) to mean“things which are set up (i.e., votive offerings) in a temple.” It is like the word ggalma,which in Homeric usage meant “treasure” or “adornment,” but could also be used ofsacrificial victims or offerings—anything in which one “delighted” or “gloried,” fromits root verb—but by classical times meant “statue.” Kataskeyazeinhas the sense of“to furnish or equip” a house or edifice.97. According to Jones, the Loeb editor, probably Deinocrates, a Macedonian ar-chitect (cf. Vitruvius 1.1.4) (Jones, ed., The Geography of Strabo,227 n. 4). See alsoPlutarchLife of Alexander.98. Strabo Geography14.1.23 (C 641). The verb CposxAsuai(CpisxnAomai) canbe used in the sense of promising or vowing something to a god (in the dative), per-haps again suggesting Alexander’s divine status (as in IGII21126, 11 [Delph. Amph-ict.]). From the Geometric period on, we find votives to a deity of a statue or likenessof himself (as, for example, in the Athenian and Lindian Acropolis terracottas ofAthena or the early seventh-century bronze statue ofApollo dedicated toApollo byMantiklos at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts). However, the grandiose scheme ofrendering the likeness out of Mount Athos befitted the larger-than-life self-conception of Alexander.99.

Lane does not use the standard spelling of the god’s name, “Mên.” He adds inan addendum the comment, “[T]he standard work on the subject of gods sacrificing isthat of Erika Simon....She is concerned with the theme in fifth-century vase-paintingand concludes that the gods are primarily propitiating other gods, and only secondarilysetting a model for humans. The relevance of her conclusions (she explicitly rejects theevidence of Plutarch) for beliefs of the Roman period is subject to doubt” (Lane, Corpus,125). Lane’s scholarly skepticism toward “a religion of the gods” is common. Typical isPlatnauer’s commentary on lines 435–438 of the Peacenoted in chapter 3 (“Hermeshimself can scarcely pray. The lines are best given to the coryphaeus”). Equally typicalof this school of thought are adverbs such as “scarcely,” “hardly,” “cannot possibly” (allattested in the secondary literature) and dismissive adjectives such as “unthinkable”—always a risky starting premise in the interpretation of religions.7. Paden, Religious Worlds,16. This is especially true of the most recent commen-tary on these vases, namely, that of Walter Burkert, Structure and Histor y,41 and nn. 16and 17, and K. W. Arafat, Classical Zeus,90.8. In my experience, the “obviousness” of this initial explanation has been borneout by its frequency in the minds of those presented with the images for the first time,both scholars and nonscholars. “They’re just portrayed as acting like people” is oftenthe first reaction, followed immediately by, “But to whom are they sacrificing? Zeus?”When told that Zeus himself is depicted on many vases pouring out wine onto an altar,most find that the mystery begins to deepen. These very questions have also been mystarting point in the search to discover an explanation—or, more accurately, anunderstanding—that fits the iconographic evidence. I believe that what is needed is abroad phenomenological theory of this aspect of religious history that does not de-mand that we do violence to what we already know about ancient Greek religion, butinstead will have room, like a spacious ceremonial tent, for the infinite permutations.9. Furtwängler, “Zwei Thongefässe aus Athen.” Side A has the partial depictionsof three draped figures. This particular kylix is now Athens National Museum no.2187, and is briefly discussed by Joan R. Mertens in her dissertation Attic White-Ground: Its Development on Shapes Other than Lekythoi, 182, no. IV. B. 73, pl. XXXIV, 2.10. Although consideration of the vase-paintings culminated in the work ofEckstein-Wolf and Simon in the early fifties, it was not until reviews of their work ap-peared in journals years later that other European as well as American scholars be-came publicly interested in the divine libation bearers. However, Germans such asHimmelmann-Wildschütz, Fuchs, and Neumann continued to make the most impor-tant contributions to the literature. This dominance may have been due to the controlof archaeological research in Greece by German scholars in the late nineteenth cen-tury, especially those who were deeply interested in the iconography and interpretationof vase-painting.notes to pages 122–24397"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"We might also wonder, however, whether the German cultural and religious mi-lieu of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries produced minds more ori-ented toward confronting the problem itself, which is paradoxical and slippery. It re-quires one to go beyond questions of cult practice and to traffic heavily in the questionof relations between humanity and divinity in ancient Greece, as did Goethe, Nietz-sche, and later, Freud, Rilke, and the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung. Perhaps it is no acci-dent that Wagner’s twenty-year struggle to produce The Ring Cyclehad only recentlyended when Furtwängler wrote of the “Vermenschlichung der Götter” that he per-ceived in his Athenian vase in 1881. Ending with the “Twilight of the Gods” (Die Götter-dämmerung), this Teutonic saga chronicled the dissolution of an agonizingly perme-able membrane between the worlds of the dying and undying, in which the trials of thehuman spirit mightily affect the divine ones who supposedly rule over them.11. “Our kylix, on the contrary, where the mother is enthroned and is served bythe daughter, belongs to a class in which the libation is typically shown as a mark ofhonor by the younger [gods] for the older [ones]; here the meaning of the [act of ] pour-ing as service is naturally the most important thing, and the observer who inspects[this scene] should scarcely think about the ensuing religious act, [namely,] libationsconnected with prayer” (Furtwängler, “Zwei Thongefässe,” 116–117, my translation).12. Ibid., 117.13. Ibid.: “eine letzte Consequenz der Vermenschlichung der Götter, die nunselbst als fromme und in gewissem Sinne bedingte Wesen erscheinen.”14.

Ibid., 118: “man jedoch auch sie selbst spendend sich denken mochte.”17. In “Ein Attisches Weihrelief im Vatikan,” 176 n. 46. Werner Fuchs observes thatFurtwängler later qualified his original view of the sacrificing gods as “the final result ofa process of humanization” in Greek religion. Lacking corroboration in the seventeenth-century drawings of Carrey or in any other descriptive account, Furtwängler neverthelessreconstructed a phiale in the hand of Athena newly sprung from the head of Zeus in thesculptural group of the Parthenon’s East pediment. Less important for our purposes isthe accuracy of this reconstruction than Furtwängler’s intepretion of it. For him, it signi-fied that “the newborn goddess will immediately become part of her sacrificial cult; “derNeugeborenen wird sofort Opferkult zu teil” (“Intermezzi, 27). Fuchs believes that this re-mark betrays Furtwängler’s view of statuesof the gods with phialai as “Opferempfänger,”that is, as the recipients of offerings. One would be very hard-pressed to defend the tiny,vital Athena (even though we have it only on a secondhand basis) of the East pedimentas a cult statue, however, or even as the depiction of one. This uncertainty leads to one ofthe main problems in the history of interpretation of the phiale-bearing gods, namely,the ill-advised attempt to distinguish between cult statues and “living gods” in art, and onthe basis of that arbitrary distinction, to assign different meanings to the held phiale (seechapter 5 for more on this question).18. Cf. Furtwängler’s remarks cited on p. X, n. 15 of this chapter. I do not imputeany psychiatric notions of “transference” to his use of the verb übertragen.19. Hazel Barnes observes, “[T]he gods lived the life of mortals in two distinct ways.Totally anthropomorphic, they not only possessed human shape, somewhat glorified tobe sure, but behaved in accordance with human needs and emotions. The compulsion toimagine realistically a corporeal body for an immortal being led to an occasional awk-ward naïveté, apparently even to the vague notion of a divine digestive system....Theylived the life of humans in another fashion; much as they might scorn the ‘creatures of398notes to pages 125–26"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"day,’ the gods were irresistibly drawn to meddle in mortal affairs, sometimes directly, butmore often by pulling strings behind the scene” (The Meddling Gods,97).Barnes’s diagnosis of “compulsion” and “awkward naïveté” to describe whatamounts to the incarnation of the gods in the Greek religious imagination is typical of aschool of discomfort whose first champion was Xenophanes, and whose most eloquentchampion was Maimonides. It may be from this heritage that judgments such asBarnes’s originate; however much it claims to appreciate, it is a school that condescendsto the Greek pantheon, seeing it as an inferior form of spirituality, much as Protestanttheology repudiates the material representation of the divine valued in Roman Catholicand Eastern Orthodox traditions. An outstanding exception was the German scholarWalter F. Otto, whose Die Götter Griechenlands(1934) passionately defended the gods asshining in a pure, corporeal, and emphatically natural reality as opposed to the interior-ized, mystical, or redemptive spirituality valued (and often retroactively projected ontothe Greek gods) by Judaism, Christianity, and, to a certain extent, psychiatry.20. Nietzsche, The Birth of Tragedy,trans. Francis Golffing, 30. Thinkers such asGoethe and much later, Walter F. Otto, found in Greek mythology an elevation of thehuman condition, rather than the other way around. Goethe wrote, “The meaning andthe struggle of the Greeks is to divinize humanity, not to humanize divinity. This is notanthropomorphism, but theomorphism!” (“Der Sinn und das Bestreben der Griechenist, den Menschen zu vergöttern, nicht die Gottheit zu vermenschen. Hier ist einTheomorphism, kein Anthropomorphism!”) From “Aufsatz über Myrons Kuh” (1818),cited by Otto, Theophania: Der Geist der altgriechischen Religion,55–56.21. Calvert Watkins and Emily Vermeule have been pioneers in suggesting thatcertain formulaic phrases and words used in the Homeric epics date back well beforethe eighth century, when they were “composed” (or “stitched together,” to follow theproposed aetiology of Homer’s name) by one or more rhapsodic minds, and perhapseven earlier than the canonical date of the Trojan War, 1260 B.C.E. See Emily D. T. Ver-meule, “Priam’s Castle Blazing,” 85 and n. 28, where she elaborates on the dating ofpossibly “pre-Mycenean” hexameter verses in Homer. Watkins’s main interest hasbeen in remnants of an ancient epic from Asia Minor in a language known as Luvian,which might have produced a Trojan Iliad.Many earlier elements appear in the poemsfor which there has been recent archaeological corroboration with the discovery ofweapons and armor dating no later than the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries B.C.E.This include artifacts such as several boar’s-tusk helmets and a Mycenean suit of ar-mor from the “Armor Tomb” at Dendra, now in Nauplion; see Hector W.

The idea that a profound silence attends the divineworld has a long history, both ancient and modern; Karl Schneider expresses it grace-fully: “Greek religion is therefore the devout glorification of Nature; holy and godly areNature and those things in Nature’s sway....In opposition to [the human realm], thedivine is elevated over everything earthly, and beyond fate, it is peaceful in an eternalsilence; ‘Still and effortless is that which is truly godly’ ” (Schneider, Die schweigendenGötter,Hildesheim: 12).26. Arafat, Classical Zeus; see chapter 4, “Libations,” 89–103.27. In both cases, another god is usually present; he cites only the lekythos by theIkaros Painter in which Zeus is alone (ARV2, 697, 13; Arafat’s no. 4.45). As we will see,Erika Simon makes a case for the scenes involving Zeus and Hera pouring libations asnotes to pages 126–28399"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"representing the sacred oath poured at their marriage, a hieros gamos.Althoughacknowledging Simon’s work as “the most detailed treatment” of the theme, Arafatnotes that she does not discuss the number of scenes in which Zeus makes a libationwithout Hera (Arafat, Classical Zeus,89). He observes that “there are scenes of eithergod making libations without the other, although those involving Zeus alone aregreater in number.” Arafat rightly points out that this is more than just a deliberate“narrow focus” on Simon’s part; it actually distorts our impression of the role of Zeusin these vase-paintings. “Zeus without Hera” is not just a truncated version of the al-leged Zeus-with-Hera hieros gamos(Arafat, Classical Zeus,90). Citing Simon’s opinionon the sculptural representations of Hera from Selinus and the Parthenon frieze, andon the Athenian festival of the Theogamia, Arafat notes that of the vases, only one (no.C–13, Arafat no. 4.26, pl. 29a), a cup by the Codrus Painter in London, “shows Heralifting a veil in the manner shown on those sculptures, and without an explicit refer-ence such as this or an Eros (who would perhaps lower the tone), it is difficult to seethese vases as alluding to the hieros gamos” (Arafat, Classical Zeus,90).28.

Since the possession of thephiale often characterizes the gods as gods, Luschey contributes the important observa-tion that the vessel can legitimately be considered “the bowl of the gods.” Phialai cropup in depictions of divine meals; outside of the emblematic kantharos of Dionysos,gods do not hold other types of vessels, such as footed cups (ibid.).

We talkedabout the possible meaning of the overwhelming predominance of libation versusnotes to pages 131–35401"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"animal sacrifice in the iconographic evidence as well as possible chthonian implica-tions and archaic connections with ancestor worship. I also mentioned to her the reso-nances I had observed between the Greek sacrificing gods and the same theme inVedic ritual literature, which interested her greatly. She mentioned her most recentthinking on the role of libations as ritual spondai,or talismans of treaties. This may beespecially important in the case of the libation-pouring Eleusinian goddesses and Trip-tolemus, who were mythologically associated with travel and the creation of treatiesworldwide. Erika Simon discusses the proposed concept of “divine reflexivity,” set forthin an earlier form of this book, in her “Libation/Libation/Libation/Libazione” in The-sCRA242–3.70. In this she differs strongly from her contemporary Himmelmann, who hassuggested that the cult statues, reliefs, and vase-paintings be considered as a whole.See Himmelmann-Wildschütz, Zur Eigenart des klassischen Götterbildes.71. However, she disassociates the vases, which she regards as almost decorative,from the rest of the iconographic evidence, which occurs, as we have said, over a muchbroader span in time, and is clearly votive.72. See especially Nagy, Pindar’s Homer.73. Sappho, frs. 135 and 136D.74. Simon, Opfernde Götter,7.75. Simon also cites Hesiod’s Theogony383–403: “Styx took the side of Zeus inthe war with the Titans; as a reward for this action, Zeus made her the oath of the gods,and had her children Zelos, Nike, Kratos, and Bia dwell with him forever.”76.

Ibid., 55. She further comments, “The tearing apart of the sacrificial beast andthe streaming out of the wine are cultic activities that are complete in and of them-selves and that have made the transition from myth into ritual without any substantivechange.” This, in her view, explains the lack of an altar in these scenes and the absenceof “the social dimension of ritual.”82.

Versnel explains it, “fundamentally there are three ways to explainconspicuous similarities between myth and ritual: 1) the myth is an (aetiological) re-flection of actual ritual; 2) the ritual imitates mythical processes; 3) both are parallelbut more or less independent symbolic processes for dealing with the same type of sit-uation in the same affective mode”; Ter Unus: Isis Dionysos Hermes,136. Versnel points402notes to pages 135–37"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"out that the first has been traditionally expounded; the second has been put forth onlyrarely, but trenchantly, as in Albert Henrichs’s “Greek Maenadism from Olympias toMessalina,”Harvard Studies in Classical Philology82 (1978): 144: “The Greeks under-stood maenadism as a re-enactment of myth and thus basically mimetic, or commem-orative.” The third explanation is exclusively that of Walter F. Otto; according to Ver-snel, “[F]or him, myth and ritual are both expressions of the experience of the god’sexistence, one in words and the other in action, both being essentially responses to theprimordial existence of the god: ‘Immer steht am Anfang der Gott’ ” (Versnel, Ter Unis,137). What do we have in Simon? The basic belief that art offers images of ritual takingplace in or attributable to mythical episodes.88. Veyne, Did the Greeks Believe in Their Myths?, 17.89. John Boardman in Journal of Hellenic Studies,Marjorie Milne in AmericanJournal of Archaeology,Hans Möbius in Gnomon,and Charles Picard in RévueArchéologique.90. On the question of whether or not libation should be considered a type of sac-rifice, see chapter 1.91. Although often cited in articles on the problem, the Freiburg dissertation ofBrigitte Eckstein-Wolf (discussed earlier) that appeared almost simultaneously in arti-cle form in Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Institutshas never received asmuch attention as Simon’s published Heidelberg thesis. It is hard to determine why;but it may be because Eckstein-Wolf does not distinguish among the phiale scenes aseach having its own separate meaning; nor, more importantly, does she assert that thegods are “really offering libations,” as does Simon. In fact, she emphatically rejects thatexplanation, which she implies is nonscientific and “mystical,” but which alone amongthe theories advanced has shown itself to be the most provocative. Scholars may citeEckstein-Wolf; but they are still debating Simon: cf. John Gibert’s recent “Apollo’s Sac-rifice: The Limits of a Metaphor in Greek Tragedy.” In this essay, as the title implies,Gibert explores the “limits of the metaphor” of Apollo sacrificing, in the mouth of Elec-tra in Euripides’s Orestes191–193: “Sacrificial victims Phoebus made of us (DjAuys’cFoPboßcmpß), by assigning that piteous murder of father’s murderer, mother!” WritesGibert: “Commentators have noticed the extraordinary dictation: the god is made theagent of a human sacrifice, and the victims are still alive” (158). However, Gibert’s in-vestigation into ancient Greek religious thought as expressed in tragedy and the vase-paintings we consider here convinces him that the literary metaphor was not intendedliterally, in the section entitled “Gods Don’t Sacrifice” (172–181).92.

For example, in the prayer of Athenato Poseidon in Odyssey3.55, cited by Simon, Milne points out that Athena knows thatPoseidon cannot hear her; he is still in the land of the Ethiopians. Since Athena, in herguise as Mentor, is concerned with Nestor, his sons, and the Pylians, the phrase kaBaDtbpanta teleAtaseems to indicate that the god’s absence does not deprive thecommunity of a proper response.notes to pages 138–39403"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"101. Ibid. Milne believes that Simon makes far too much of the mention, such asin Pindar’s Tenth Paean4, of the (underworld river) Styx. She asserts that the oaths ofthe gods which are sworn by the Styx “do not necessarily involve propitiation of or rap-prochementwith Kronos and the Titans.” Hera’s oath in Iliad14.271–279 is the only in-stance in Homer where a god calls Kronos and the Titans to witness. It is echoed inHera’s prayer to the Titans in the Hymn to Apollo335 ff. Milne believes that it was ex-ceptional. She points out that Pindar in the Fourth Pythian Ode291 relates how Zeusreleased the Titans from Tartaros and settled Kronos in the Isles of the Blessed. Simonthinks this was original with Pindar, but Milne suggests that it might be earlier. Theancient Greeks believed that Kronos was king of the Isles of the Blessed, which devel-oped from his role as ruler of the gods during the golden age. There would thus be nomythogically based need for détente.102. Ibid., 250–251. This isolation of Aeschylus from any prior tradition of con-flict between the older, chthonian powers and the new Olympian order is a minimalistview. It can surely be challenged; the problem is very similar in certain respects to thequestion of the extent to which Euripides’s Bacchaereflected actual Dionysiac traditionor cult, and how much originated with him. Milne overlooks the real problem with Si-mon’s interpretation of lines 1006–1009 of the Eumenides,in which Athena speaks oftpn sfagipn(1006) that will accompany the escorting of the chorus of Eumenides totheir new underground home as benefactors of Athens. But these are not libations;they are holocausts; nor are they to be performed by Athena—she is referring to thesacrifices that will be made by the citizens of Athens.103. M. P. Nilsson’s first remarks were made in “New Evidence for the DionysiacMysteries.” He later repeated his refutation of Simon’s theory in Dionysiac Mysteries,101–103.104. Skepticism along similar lines appears in remarks by the archaeologist Chris-tos Karouzos in 1957 in a short piece on a late archaic bronze Laconian Apollo in theAthens National Museum (“Ein lakonischer Apollon”). The youthful god strides forward,a figure of vibrant and intentional movement, on his (left) foot. The gestures of bothhands are subject to interpretation, as all attributes are lost. The left hand is bent at the el-bow, with clenched fist and two extended middle fingers. According to Karouzos, its func-tion is clear: The hole in the middle of the clenched fist held a bow, and the fingers, twoarrows. “The gesture of the right hand is harder to understand.” It is raised at chest level,palm facing outward, fingers pointing upward with the tips bent slightly back toward thenipples. David Gordon Mitten suggests that the fingers of the right hand may have beenbent backward at some point in the statue’s history after its creation. According toKarouzos, an unbiased examination gives the impression of a gesture of prayer. His dis-cussion includes an awareness of the interpretations, as well as the recently precedingwork of Eckstein-Wolf and Simon. He writes, “But what is a praying Apollo supposed tomean? One may not appeal, without further ado, to the appearance of a sacrificing Apolloas a parallel representation, especially [when] one has only a short while ago abandonedthe previous explanation deriving from the ‘humanization of the gods,’ and tried to inter-pret the representations of sacrificing gods as mythologically meaningful scenes. To trou-ble mythology in order to explain the sculptural representation of a supposedly ‘prayingApollo,’ would certainly be rash” (Karouzos, “Ein lakonischer Apollon,” 35).105. Ibid.106. Ibid.107. Ibid, 34–35. A form of this designation, relying on the verb spendento de-scribe these scenes and avoiding the term opfern,is used by Eckstein-Wolf and Met-zger.

The hypothesis that the sacrificing gods are not gods at all but peopledressed like them in a priestly role would be reasonable except for the fact that theyare almost always identifiable by their attributes, and are sometimes even named bythe artist with inscriptions (as on the vase in Boston): Zeus, Hera, Athena, Leto, andso on.121. On this fundamental but often dishonored precept, Richard M. Carp haswritten of his decade of experience in teaching the iconography of religion, “Studentsmay find the encounter with other worlds of meaning, expressed in unfamiliar media,to be unsettling. When they realize that the facts about the construction of experiencethat apply to other people apply to themselves, they may be disturbed. When they un-derstand that every sort of knowledge is a kind of map, and that no map is adequate tothe territory, they may be troubled.

Ibid., 23 n. 54. “The more the manifest gods live their own lives, experiencethemselves, the more they isolate themselves, remove themselves from the sphere ofearthly reality, and become the revelation, toward which the world, of the gods as ofhumans, can only react by observing.”165.

The bowl can have nomeaning different from the incense burner, which was to the worship of Aphrodite aubiquitous sacrifical instrument almost unique to her cult. In an amphora at the Lou-vre (Himmelmann’s Abb. 29), Eros storms ahead of his mother with a thymiaterion asshe goes forth in glorious epiphany over the sea. In a lekythos in Berlin (Himmel-mann’s Abb. 10) she rides a swan while he precedes her with the incense burner that isher cultic signifier.189. Himmelmann, Zur Eigenart, 29.

In a terracotta group in Berlin, Aphrodite herself places theincense into the open mouth of a thymiaterion (AA1938, 347, Abb. 5. 29; cited byHimmelmann on p. 29 and n. 89).

Neither, according to Himmelmann, should one rely for explana-tion (as does Picard) on the “wine miracles” which envisioned the kantharos overflow-ing by itself. The same Dionysiac sacrifice, featuring kantharos and drinking bowl, iscelebrated on a vase in Würzburg (Himmelmann’s Abb. 31), but by the human wor-shipers of the god.

On this point, Himmelmann directly critiques Eckstein-Wolf ’s use of thetermSeinsbild, which signaled her important insight that the meaning of the imagewas itself. Himmelmann feels that she misses the point by assuming that the libationbowl draws its meaning from the human realm. Thus rendered, she says it is an attrib-ute “which does not express a quality of the god like a normal attribute, but representssomething originating out of another conceptual or existential sphere” (Eckstein-Wolf,“Zur Darstellungen,” 55). He continues: “So interpreted, the sacrificing gods wouldthen certainly bear the name ‘Seinsbild’ wrongly” (Himmelmann, Zur Eigenart,27 n.73).193. Himmelmann, Zur Eigenart, 31.194. Ibid.195. W. F.

Werner Fuchs, who calls the terminology of Himmelmann “highly unfortu-nate,” asks rhetorically, “Was it necessary for the gods of Aeschylus and Sophocles toappear in the ‘self-portrayal of their own holiness’? I think not. A fundamental fact ofGreek, and not only of Greek, religion, is overlooked by Himmelmann-Wildschütz inthis explanation: There is no cult and sacrificial action without myth, just as there is notrue myth without cult” (Fuchs, “Ein attisches Weihrelief im Vatikan,” 178).200.Taittirı ̄ya Bra ̄hmaña I, 5.9.4.

Of Tanagra, Pausanias remarks that “[A]mong the Greeks, there arethe Tanagreans, who seem to me to have best rendered honours to the gods; theyplaced their own dwellings in one corner, and in the other, the temples, which are thusin a space that is free and apart from people (xvrBßdBtbCerbCpBraDtbßDnkauaruteDstin,kaBDktbßdnurapvn)” (Pausanias 9.22). Picard exegetes, “Onedeemed it proper that the gods be chez euxnot so much for their comfort, or to avoidthe indiscretion, perhaps, of mortal sight, but above all, in any case, so that one couldestablish around their reunion a sacred barrier, the religious obstacle against humanimpurity” (Picard, “Agoras,” 136).210. Reconstructed from fragments and identified by M. J. Marcadé; dated520–510B.C.E. In light of the Greeks’ tendency to honor the twelve gods (in the inven-tories, the edifice is referred to as tbdadeka), Picard also suggests two other triads,perhaps Demeter-Zeus Eubouleus-Kore and Poseidon-Amphitrite-Hermes.211. Picard, “Agoras,” 142.212. The excavation of the Delian “agora of the gods” side-by-side with the peo-ple’s agora indicates that with the statues of the “Delian triad” of Apollo, Artemis,and Leto is preserved the trunk of the kitharode Apollo. Thus, Bakalakis speculatesthat the “musical” Delian triad (to which sacrificial equipment was later added)might have emerged separately during the last quarter of the sixth and the turn ofthe fifth centuries B.C.E. On a red-figure pyxis in Ferrara from the end of the fifthcentury, the musical Delian triad and the inscribed (DHLOS) personification of De-los is depicted with Hermes (no. 206). He agrees with preceding scholarship (e.g.,Simon,Opfernde Götter,19) that the vase-paintings of the triad of deities “mean” thesame thing whether or not altar and phiale are depicted, as it is on the amphora inthe manner of the Niobid Painter in Würzburg (no. 503 [Graef and Langlotz, Die an-tiken Vasen, pls. 170, 172, 184; Himmelmann, Zur Eigenart,Taf. 28; ARV2611, 32;1661).

See Winter, “The King and the Cup: Iconography of the Royal PresentationScene on Ur III Seals.” Winter notes that the seated king “regularly holds some kind ofcup, goblet, or vase in his extended right hand” (255). She later observes, “the functionof the ‘cup’ remains elusive. But its use as an emblem of the powers of the king in hiswell-attested role combining divine sanction and access to divine order with the exer-cise of office, seems to make considerable sense, particularly as this is the very giftgiven by Ur-Nammu in the underworld to Gilgamesh, the ‘ideal king’ in the Ur III pe-riod.

This is articulated in later neo-Platonic thought by Iamblichus, who writes:“Is not every sacred ritual legislated intellectually from first principles according to thelaws of the Gods? For each rite imitates the order of the Gods, both the intelligible andthe celestial, and each possesses the eternal measures of beings and the wondroussymbols which have been sent here by the Demiurge, the Father of all things.”Iamblichus,De Mysteriis65.3–7, trans. Olivier Clément.11. Himmelmann, Zur Eigenart.12. For a discussion of Apollo’s status as a god particularly concerned with purity,see Robert Parker, Miasma: Pollution and Purification in Early Greek Religion, esp. Ap-pendix 8, p. 393. Parker speculates that Apollo’s cathartic role, which Artemis some-times shared, may have had its genesis in his role as sender and healer of disease (cf.IliadI); this is supported by the law of Cyrene (Supplementum Epigraphicum Grae-cum[SEG] ix 72) and the history of Delos.13. The conceptual and ritual force of this notion is hard to convey. As in manylanguages, Greek verbs have a middle or “reflexive” mood that conveys the conceptof doing something “for oneself,” “to oneself,” “for one’s own benefit,” and bothuAesuaiandspAndesuaiare attested in the middle (LSJ). However, these have aspecialized meaning in each case, and never with a divinity as subject. uAesuaimeans to “cause a victim to be offered,” as in Inscriptiones Graecae(IG) 5 (1) 1390.65,412notes to pages 162–71"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"Andania, 1; hence, frequently, “consult the gods”; spAndesuaimeans “pour libationswith one another, make a treaty, make peace,” as in Herodotus 3.133, Xenophon An-abasis1.9.7.14.OED,s.v. “reflexive.”15.

Following a similar statement in her introduc-tion to the issue of the journal Semioticathat was the result of the the symposium or-ganized by Victor Turner in 1976 entitled “Rituals and Myths of Self: Uses of andOccasions for Reflexivity,” Babcock writes, “If not since Epimenides, then at leastsince Russell and Whitehead, we have realized that statements by a member of aclass about its own class tend to paradox. By confounding subject and object, seerand seen, self and other, art and life—in short, by playing back and forth across ter-minal and categorical boundaries and playing with the very nature of humanunderstanding—reflexive processes redirect thoughtful attention to the faulty or lim-ited structures of thought, language and society.” Babcock, “Reflexivity: Definitionsand Discriminations,” 5.Sacrificing gods, supposedly objects of ritual, by becoming its subjects describetheir own divine natures, their scope and limitless differentiated potential, as well astheir high degree of specificity through the “statement” of rituals that are particular tothem: This paradoxical reversal reveals the fault lines in a limited view of ritual as anarbitrary action that can only be directed from an inferior to a superior power.16.

See Colin Renfrew, Archaeology and Language, and his The Roots of Ethnicity.Renfrew has rejected the historical pessimism of much postmodern archaeologicaltheory, theorizing the possibility of what he calls “cognitive archaeology,” which allowsfor the validity of the recovery and reconstruction of thought-worlds. Renfrew arguesthat we can begin to answer the question, “What did they think?” by extrapolating frompatterns in the material evidence from ancient cultures—even where textual evidenceis absent. See also The Ancient Mind, ed. Colin Renfrew and Ezra B. W. Zubrow.2. See the discussion in Walter Burkert, Greek Religion,16.3. One late example is the Hellenistic mystery religion of Mithraism, in whichthe heroic god Mithras—who seems to have developed in the incubator of Iranian reli-gion from the sun god Mi.tra of the ancient Indian R.gveda—slays a bull in a cosmogo-nic act that is central in surviving Mithraic iconography. See David Ulansey’s The Ori-gins of the Mithraic Mysteries, which posits Mithras as a kosmokrator.Ulansey interpretsthe slaughter of the bull as an act of cosmological significance, interpreted by Stoiciz-ing intellectuals from Tarsus as their hero Perseus overcoming the constellation Tau-rus the Bull in the procession of the equinoxes.4. See Jan Gonda, “Vedic Gods and the Sacrifice.” Gonda pursues issues beyondthe s ̄uktava ̄kaformula expressed in Taittirı ̄ya Bra ̄hma.na3.5.10 and elsewhere (“in whichthe deity declares that he accepts the offering, has become strengthened by it, has ac-quired greater might...and the wish is expressed that the sacrificer may prosper ac-cordingly”), issues such as “whether or not the sacrificial ritual was believed to be basedon divine will, initiative, or authority, and that of whether divine power is inherent or ef-fective in the rites...[and] whether the great gods are equally and in the same mannersupposed to be concerned with the establishment and operation of the ritual” (1).5. Proto-Vedic features, including funerary mounds and horsehead assemblages,have been discovered within the past decade in archaeological excavations in the Uralmountains. The “cultural transformation thesis,” as it called by Gavin Flood and others,is a relatively recent theory challenging the traditional view of Aryan (exterior) invasionor migration into India by posting Aryan culture as an indigenous development of anancient, even Neolithic culture whose Indo-European language and culture coexistedwith Dravidian counterparts in the region.

The gods said ‘It willnot be sufficient for us, being taken apart; come, let us gather the sacrifice.’ (Theyreplied) ‘Be it so.’ They gathered it together; having gathered it together they said to theAçvins, ‘Do ye two heal it’, the Açvins are the physicians of the gods, the Açvins the Ad-hvaryus; therefore the two Adhvaryus gather together the cauldron.

Christensen, in L’Iran sous les Sas-sanides,144, declared that Zurvanism was the normative form of Zoroastrianism atthat time; Bidez and Cumont in Les mages hé llenisésI: 63 n. 3 regarded this idea as in-defensible. Zaehner advocates the approach of O. G. von Wesendonk, who in his DasWesen der Lehre Zarthu ̆stro ̄s,19–20, advanced the view that Mazdaism and Zurvanismalternated, depending on the affinities of the particular ruler (Zaehner, Zurvan,p. 35and n. 3). However, categorical statements continue on both sides; see, for example, theassertions of Jacques Duchesne-Guilleman: “Zurvanism was widely accepted...per-haps even prevalent, in Sa ̄sa ̄nian times” (“Zoroastrianism and Parsiism,” 1081), andJean Varenne: “There is...no formal proof that the cult of Zurva ̄n ever had a signifi-cant existence in Iran” (“Pre-Islamic Iran,” 886).

Eznik and bar Penkayê mention the conception of Ahriman as deriving fromZurva ̄n’s “pondering”; bar Kônai says explicitly that the cause was the fact that the god“doubted.” Zaehner (60–61) claims that Zurvanites would have chosen “ponder” or“doubt” depending on which theology they wanted to emphasize. The translation “pon-der” “at least draws a veil over the essential imperfection of Zurvan, and does not allowthe basic inconsistency in the divine nature to come to light.” “Doubt,” on the other hand,“advertises this imperfection and elevates this unsureness in the godhead into the distinc-tive mark of the system”; this imperfection was exploited by Eznik in his refutation.10. A “mother” is mentioned by the Syriac writers, but not by Eznik, who com-plains, “When nothing at all existed, neither heaven nor earth, Zurva ̄n alone existed.Now this is really highly ridiculous that he himself should be both father and mother,and that the same person should have emitted the seed and received it” (Eznik, Veniceedition, 149, cited in Zaehner, Zurvan,63 n. 4). In fact, later both realities seem tohave been true: Zurva ̄n was accepted as hermaphrodite in the Acts of Ana ̄hı ̄d, and alsohad a female consort with whom Ohrmazd had intercourse to conceive the sun in a fa-ble preserved by Eznik, a Manichaean fragment (Zaehner, Zurvan,Text F7) and theSyriacActs of the Martyrs(Zaehner, Zurvan,Text F5).11.

Varenne remarks, “However these problems are to be solved, Zoroastrian-ism remains a religion marked more than many others by the belief that Evil is pow-erful, that it is a Spirit (that is, a cosmic energy, a divine power), and that the dy-namism of his actions makes necessary a struggle to contain him” (“Pre-IslamicIran,” 886).28.Yasna30:3–4.29. “Historical” conversion (including that of the “Magi”) is contested.30.

In the beginning, said these priests, there was nothing but infinite Time (Zurva ̄nakarana), from which came Light and Darkness, Ohrmazd and Ahriman, and eventu-ally, all living beings.

This is in keeping with Zaehner’s stance, typical of muchof Western scholarship on Zoroastrianism, that “Zoroastrianism was uncompromis-ingly dualist.” Zaehner concedes that this was not a “classical dualism between spirit420notes to pages 199–203"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"and matter which would have provided a common meeting-ground with the IndianJains and the Sa ̄m.khya ̄ to the East, with the Gnostics to the West, and with theManichaeans in Iran itself. It was a dualism of spirit, postulating two principles at theorigin of the Universe—the Spirit of Good or Ohrmazd, and the Spirit of Evil or Ahri-man. This radically original idea dates back to Zoroaster himself, and it is his basiccontribution to the philosophy of religion” (Zaehner, Zurvan,3–4). Zaehner is correctthat the Gnostics and the Manichaeans did indeed appropriate the apparent dualism ofZoroastrianism and identified the Evil Spirit with the Christian Satan, who held do-minion over the world, a theodicy hard to refute. But orthodox Zoroastrianism was re-lentlessly optimistic, devoted to Ahura Mazda ̄, willing to help him in his struggle inthe material world (where he is by no means completely powerless) and trusting in hiseventual triumph—despite the unsympathetic charge that he remains “as mythologi-cally colorless as God the Father for the Christians, majestic, sovereign, creative, intrin-sically good, but distant and ‘without a story’ ” (Varenne, “Ahura Mazda ̄,” 891).95.

Kotwal, in Zaleski and Zaleski, “Bridge of Fire,” 63–64. Hoama(Vedicsoma), the sacred intoxicating liquor of Indo-European cult, called the “drink of im-mortality,” was stolen from the gods. In a profound illustration of the power of sacrifi-cial over divine recipient, it was even believed that their immortality depended on con-tinuing to drink it. Without mortals’ willingness to “press out the haoma” for the gods,the once-Immortal ones would perish. After pouring the part owed to the gods into thefire,haomawas consumed by worshipers at a sacrifice. By the tenth century B.C.E., thefloruit of classical Vedic and Iranian religion, every important ritual included thepressing out and drinking of haoma. Speculative research into its composition suggeststhat it was an hallucinogen. Hashish is ruled out by a helpful passage in the D ̄enkartinwhich Zoroaster’s patron-king Vi ̆st ̄ asp drinks haomamixed with bhanga; therefore theywere clearly not the same thing. As mentioned in chapter 1, pharmaco-religionist Gor-don Wasson claims it was the Amanita muscaria,the fly-killing or false orange mush-room. The latest on the issue is Haoma and Harmaline: The Botanical Identity of theIndo-Iranian Sacred Hallucinogen “Soma” and its Legacy in Religion, Language, and Middle-Eastern Folklore, by David Stophlet Flattery and Martin Schwartz (Berkeley: Universityof California Press, 1989).In one of the Ga ̄ua ̄s, Yasna48 (strophes 10–12), Zoroaster calls haoma“filth.” Heaccuses it of causing lying and hubristic violence in warriors, to whose gods and cus-toms, as we have seen, he already bore marked hostility. In the same passage, he asso-ciates haomawith blood sacrifice, which he denounces. Haomawas reintegrated intothe fire-ceremony, but in extremely modifed form: it is called para ̄-ho ̄m,“preparationforhaoma.” It is made of ground sprigs of the Ephedra vulgaris—still, interestingly, anintoxicant if consumed in extract (ephedrin)—and is heavily diluted with holy water.Animal oblation is only represented by a small quantity of fat. However, the latter con-cession may be a recent adaptation of the Parsis to the sensibilities of their Hindu hostcountry; opinions differ on this. That these liquid and animal oblations exist at all—even in symbolic form—in the yasnaceremony is yet another testimony to the persis-tence of ancient ritual and its resistance to the “purified,” bloodless rituals demandedby “ethical” protestant reforms.113. Zaehner’s Text Z 37. Henning (author of Zoroaster, Politician or Witch-Doctor?, 51) considers that all principal anti-Zurvanite writings are derived from acommon written source that dates no later than the fourth century C.E., including aPersian Manichaean fragment: “They say that Ohrmazd and Ahriman are brothers: inconsequence of this doctrine they will meet with their destruction.

Compare the writings of Alexander of Lycopolis and especially Augustine,Against the Manichaeans,which were proved through the independent discovery ofCoptic and Iranian Manichaean texts in this century to contain far fewer doctrinal dis-tortions than had been previously ascribed to them on the basis of their Christianpolemical stance. Especially striking was the degree to which Manichaean dualism re-garded matter itself as the imprisoned domain and imprisoning principle of darkness,just as Augustine had claimed. See Allberry, A Manichaean Psalm Book,54.17, 108.24,221.5. See the discussion in Kurt Rudolph’s work.144. So among Zurvanites, the Manichaeans and the more pessimistic Gnosticsects, we do not live in a “mixed” world where both good and evil are at war, as theBundahi ̆sndescribes. Instead, the diabolical one is the unchallenged ruler of earth. A passage in Psellus (De Operatione Daemonum,Boissonade, 3; Zaehner’s Text G7)confirms this. Psellus describes a sect as Euchite, but which must have had strongZurvanite tendencies: It acknowledged a father and two sons, the younger of whomcontrols heavens. The older son’s authority only extends to what is within the cosmos.Zurva ̄n, the father, controls only those things which are above the cosmos. It is hard toknow if as a result of this doctrine, the Zurvanites, like the Manichaeans but unlikeorthodox Mazdaeans, viewed matter as demonic.145. Zaehner, Zurvan,68–69.146.

Odin had to give up one of his eyes in order to drink from the well of wisdombelonging to the giant Mímir at the roots of the World Tree (Gylfaginningch. 8; V ̈oluspá28). As Stephen Mitchell observes, “nearly all of Ódinn’s activities revolve around hissearch for wisdom.” Mitchell, “Ódinn,” 444. He is tortured between two fires in Grím-nísmal, and hangs himself on Yggdrasill, the World Tree that unites the three realms,where he is also impaled in Hávamál, the subject of this chapter. “The result of bothexperiences is an ecstatic state in which Ódinn spouts forth numinous knowledge....He is often found on journeys, the sole purpose of which is to grow in wisdom fromknowledge gained through confrontations with otherworldly beings” (ibid.).

The approach is ubiquitous. For example, Germanic religion scholar EdgarPolomé calls Odin “the Germanic representative of the Indo-European divine ‘king-magician’ analyzed by Georges Dumézil”; see Polomé, “Ódinn (Odin),” 58. E.O.G.Turville-Petre writes, “It is said widely today that Ódinn, the priest magician, is a god ofthe first class, corresponding with the Indian Varun.a, while Thór, the warrior god, be-longs to the second class, and corresponds with Indra” (Myth and Religion of the North,41). However, Odin’s oscillating nature and, as Mitchell notes, the lack of Odinic place-names in the West Norse area has caused some to question his Indo-European antiq-uity and to call for his later advent from the south to replace the indigenous Ty ́r(Mitchell, “ Ódinn,” 445). In the light of comparative research, Dumézil’s schema is424notes to pages 212–13"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"largely adhered to: Ódinn “belongs,” although as priest-magician he manifests su-perbly strange, amoral, chthonic, and undeniably shamanic characteristics.4. The ancestry of Odin and his two brothers Vili and Vé is as follows: Bestla, thefrost-daughter of the giant B÷olthór was their mother; their father was Borr, son of Búri.In Snorri Sturluson’s well-known creation story, Búri had no parents, but was revealedby the primeval cow Audumla as she licked salty rocks into the shape of a man (TheProse Edda, Gylfaginningch. 6).5. According to The Poetic Edda’sV ̈oluspá(The Wise Woman’s Prophecy), 17–18,Odin and two divine companions made the first human couple from two logs, orbranches, Askr and Embla.6.The Prose Eddaconsists of Gylfaginning,the journey of King Gylfi to the hall ofthe Æsir, where he asks them questions about the gods and is answered in ency-clopaedic fashion; Skáldskaparmál(The Diction of Poetry); and Háttatal(The List ofVerse Forms). Snorri also composed Heimskringla(Circle of the World), which con-tains biographies of the Norwegian kings. HeimskringlaincludesYnglingasaga,whichis the History of the Kings of the Yngling Dynasty, and rich tales of legendary kingsand some of the gods, including Odin. Snorri Sturluson (1178–1241 C.E.) was a Christ-ian who was concerned that poets of his day were not familiar enough with the oldheathen religion to be able to properly use “kennings,” that is, mythical, often crypticphrases in their compositions. For example, kennings for poetry itself, such as “theseed of Odin’s breast,” “the seed of the eagle’s bill,” “Kvasir’s blood,” and so forth, ex-isted orally for at least two centuries before Snorri wrote them down; they all referredto the theft of the mead of poetry, the blood of Kvasir, from the dwarves by the shape-shifter Odin.7. Snorri Sturluson, Prose Edda, Gylfaginningch. 4; translated by Turville-Petre, 35.8. For example, Odin kills his beloved protégé, Harald Wartooth (Saxo Grammati-cus,Gesta Danorum8.220).9. See the analysis of Neil Price, The Viking Way,93–94.10. Georges Dumézil, Gods of the Ancient Northmen, 26. The sorceress of V ̈oluspá28 says, “I know, Odin (Alt veit ek, Ódinn), exactly where your eye was hidden, in thefamous fountain of Mímir. Mímir drinks mead each morning from the pledge of Val-father (Odin)” (cited by Dumézil, Gods,27). She uses the same phrase that Odin willlater use in describing his autosacrifice in Hávamál138, “I know that I hung (Veit ek, at ek hekk) / on the wind-swept tree / For nine whole nights.” In the Scandinavianreligious universe, mantic wisdom was the invaluable resource: The one who“knows” is the one with true power; that is why Odin goes to such great lengths to“know.”11.

It has been accepted that Scandinavia was reli-giously isolated until the Viking era exposed the northern lands to the cultural influ-ences of Britain, Ireland, Normandy, Russia, and Byzantium. Recently, however,Thomas DuBois has forcefully made the case for the deep influences of Sámi/Finnishpractices, which he argues persisted in Norse religion in relationship to foreign cul-tural factors (see his Nordic Religions in the Viking Age). Iceland was settled in 874. In830C.E., St. Ansgar undertook a mission to convert Sweden to Christianity. In 985,Haraldr Bluetooth of Denmark was converted to Christianity; Iceland followed by voteof the Great Assembly in 1000 C.E. St. Olaf established Christianity in Norway in 1015.But the Germanic gods died hard: In 1070 Adam of Bremen still reported animal andhuman sacrifices at Uppsala in Sweden.Iceland in that period “saw a flowering of antiquarian culture” (Puhvel, Compara-tive Mythology, 190), including the Eddas, sagas, and skaldic poetry. Around the sametime, Saxo Grammaticus in Denmark wrote the Gesta Danorum,a history of the Danes“from the beginning” to 1185. The first nine books consist of epic prose with a strongmythical overlay. As Puhvel puts it (190), these works are “the basic fund of Germanmythic tradition.” Despite the lateness and antiquarianism of the Icelandic material,and the lack of primary sources, reconstructed Germanic myth ranks with Vedic andRoman “as the third mainstay for triangulated Indo-European reconstruction” (Puhvel,Comparative Mythology,191).16. B÷olthórr was a giant, father of Bestla, Odin’s giantess mother. So the “son ofB÷olthórr” was Odin’s uncle. Giants were thought to be very wise and very old, just asOdin is said to be in Baldrs Draumar2.V ̈oluspá2 asserts that giants were born agesago, and that like the dead, they live in hills and rocks. Giants (j ̈otnar) are in factclosely identified with the dead.17. See the discussion of research on the Hávamálin Rudolf Simek, Dictionar y ofNorthern Mythology, s.v. “Odin’s (self-)sacrifice,” 249: “The motifs in this myth remi-niscent of Christ’s crucifixion have led to a theory that this is merely an adaptation ofChrist’s Sacrifice on the Cross by the ancient Scandinavians who, having heard ofChrist’s sacrifice on their travels to the British Isles, subsequently transferred it totheir chief god, Odin (Bugge). However, this form of sacrifice is also well-known frominitiation rites in archaic cultures, and has sufficient parallels in Indian (Praja ̄pati,K.r.sn.a) and in Greek mythology (Dionysius) to warrant its acceptance as an Indo-Germanic motif. Consequently, the origin of Odin’s self-sacrifice should be seen as oneof the shamanistic initiation rites into the knowledge of poetry and magic (connectedwith the knowledge of runes).”18.

Or as R. I. Page asks, “The tale shows disturbing similarities to the ChristianChrist hanging on the cross-beam, pierced by a spear, tormented by thirst, achievingthe fullness of his Godhead by his willing self-sacrifice. Were there two myths here,perhaps ultimately related? Or did one invade the world of the other?” Page, NorseMyths,15.25. Odin’s symbol was a triangular knot, representing the knot with which hu-man sacrifices to him were hanged.26. As Munch remarks, “the scholars who derive the myth of Odin on the gal-lows from the story of Christ on the cross, and Yggdrasil’s ash from the cross as thetree of life, have at the same time maintained that ancient pagan faith and cult had be-come more ingrained in Norse myth” (Norse Mythology,289).27.

G. van Hamel offers an animistic explanation, citingIrish parallels (“Ódinn Hanging on the Tree,” 260–288). This school of thought is ur-gently refuted by Jere Fleck, in favor of the sexual symbolism of the cosmic tree andOdin’s dripping wound—as well as possible parallels to the Soma sacrifice—in his“Ódinn’s Self-Sacrifice: A New Interpretation.”28.

Although they are distinct phenomena, the mania of the berserkrhas beencompared to that of the mythical maenads in the Bacchaeof Euripides. To Otto Höfler,the common aspect linking them is the interpretation that such “ecstatic happenings,”even when triggered by chemical means, are caused by the influence of a higherbeing—that is, a god, Höfler, Verwandlungskulte, Volkssagen und Mythen,169, 187. Inthe worship of Odin, Höfler claimed the interpenetration of myth and cult. He sees the“mythicization” of cult as a basic religio-historic category; see Brod, “On GermanicMyth and Cult.”42. William Anderson compares Odin as leader of the Wild Hunt with his host ofdead warriors to the Celtic God Cerunnos, the spectral horseman who gallopedthrough the deer park of Peterborough woods up to Stamford, recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in 1127. “It is a hunt of unbaptized souls riding through woods oracross the sky recorded in many parts of Europe. In Scandinavia and Germany theleader of the hunt was Odin or Wotan.” Anderson, The Green Man: Archetype of OurOneness with the Earth,55.43. This view is upheld by Jan de Vries, Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte, 46–48and 89–106.44. For example, Chadwick, The Cult of Othin,49.45. In his Om Nordboernes Gudedyrkelse og Gudreto i Hedenold(Copenhagen,1876).46. Jan de Vries disagrees, seeing the myth more euhemeristically as mirroringthe struggle of the pre-Indo-European agricultural population of northwestern Europeand Indo-European invaders (de Vries, Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte,210–211).Dumézil sees the Vanir as fertility gods, and the Æsir as gods of dominance and war-fare. Their truce under the dominance of Odin, concluded by spitting into a jar, is tohim an illustration of the tripartite social contract whereby the farmers cultivate soil,the warriors protect people, and one monarch rules them all.47.

Strabo (Geography7.294) writes of the Cimbri that they collected human sac-rificial blood in special kettles: “Grey-haired women in white garments...crownedthe prisoners with wreaths and led them to a bronze mixing cauldron of a capacity ofabout ninety pails. Climbing the step-ladder resting against it and bowing over the ket-tle, they slit the throat of each prisoner that was raised to them. From the blood thatflooded into the cauldron, they would read oracles” (translation by Jan Puhvel). A simi-lar scene is portrayed on the Gundestrup Cauldron, a Celtic work of the early Iron Agefrom Gundestrup, Jutland (National Museum, Denmark). Although the cauldron wasfound in Denmark, it is regarded as a Celtic work. Further commentary on the caul-dron may be found in The Celts,ed. Salatino Moscati, et al., trans. Andrew Ellis, et al.(New York: Rizzoli, 1991), and Olmsted, The Gundestrup Cauldron: Its ArchaeologicalContext.However, Norse priests also practiced oracular divination using blood(Hymiskvid ́a1, cited in Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion,252 n. 9).55.

Three great sacrifices were heldyearly: “at winter-day...for a good year; at mid-winter...for a good harvest, and atsummer-day...for victory” (Ynglingasaga8).58. Among the tribes in England, the Germanic ritual sprinkling of blood af-fected religious language. The term “to bless” derives from OE blæ ̄dsian, meaning “tohallow with blood.”59. Accounts of Icelandic temples such as those given in the Heimskringla’sSagaof Hákon the Goodthus far lack archaeological corroboration. See Olsen,“Vorchristliche Heiligtümer in Nordeuropa.”60.

For example, V ̈oluspástr. 2 and theVafthrúdnismálmention nine worlds in the universe; it was said of Heimdallr that hewas the son of nine mothers; we remember that Odin learned nine mighty songs fromthe son of B ̈olthórr in Hávamál,140.61.

Price characterizes Viking sacred geography as an“ensouled world,” participating of indigenous circumpolar traditions extending toSiberia and Alaska and to Greenland and Canada: All things are in fact animate andautonomous, and their respective essences can be identified and controlled by theshaman (or in the Old Norse case by Odin, the shaman par excellence). These ideasemerge in a famous statement by a Chukchi shaman, recorded by the RussianVladimir Bogoraz Tan while in exile in Siberia in the late nineteenth century: “On thesteep bank of a river there exists life. A voice is there, and speaks aloud. I saw the ‘mas-ter’ of the voice and spoke with him. He subjected himself to me and sacrificed to me.He came yesterday and answered my questions.

Turville-Petre, and es-pecially Heinrich Beck (“Germanische Menschen opfer in der literarischen Überliefer-ung,” in Vorgeschichtlicher Heiligtümer und Opferplätze,ed. H. Jankuhn) have taken upthe issue of the authenticity of this tradition in the sagas, many with skepticism. It isMitchell’s contention that archaeological evidence like the Northern European bog bod-ies and the Lärbro Stora Hammers stone in Gotland, Sweden (no. O–3; Fig. 68) pro-vide a challenge to the dismissal of the historicity of the sagic insistence upon Odinichuman sacrifice (see Mitchell, Heroic Sagas and Ballads, 64 and n. 42). James Sauvétreats its Indo-European ancestry in “The Divine Victim: Aspects of Human Sacrificein Viking Scandinavia and Vedic India.”71.Ynglingasaga11, 14–15. A different version of the death of Dómaldi appears inthe Monumenta Historica Norvegiae,which says that the king was hanged as a sacrificeto Ceres (Frejya). Although this may indicate that other gods besides Odin received sac-rifice by hanging, this is a unique instance.72.Guta Lag och Guta Saga,ed. H. Pipping (1907), 63; cited in Turville-Petre,Myth and Religion,253 n. 11.73. One of the more evocative, if controversial sources for pre-Christian Scandi-navian religion is the description offered by Adam of Bremen around 1070 C.E. in hisGesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum(Histor y of the Bishops of Hamburg) 4.26–27.It seems to have been based on the description of Sveinn II Estridsen. Adam famouslydescribes a temple at Uppsala that he says included a sceptered Thor, an armedWodan, “the raging one...(who)...makes war and gives men courage in the face ofthe enemy,” and an ithyphallic Fricco (Frey). “The common sacrificial festival of all theSwedes together is held each ninth year in Uppsala....Nine heads are offered fromevery kind of living creature of the male sex, and the custom is to appease the godswith their blood. But the decapitated bodies are hung in a grove near the temple. Thegrove was so sacred for pagans that they held each of the trees as divine because of thevictims’ death. Dogs were hung with horses and men, and a Christian told me that hehad seen as many as seventy-two corpses hanging in rows” (cited and translated byPuhvel,Comparative Mythology,192). Adam also mentions at Uppsala the drowning ofvictims in a well, perhaps recreating on a mundane level the well of wisdom at the430notes to pages 222–23"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"roots of the world tree. The existence of such a temple is now gravely doubted, al-though many of its ritual elements seem to have some roots in authenticity. As Priceremarks, “new studies of sources for the Gamla Uppsala ‘temple’ have suggested thatit may have been a very large feasting hall in which pagan festivals took place at certaintimes, rather than a dedicated religious building in its own right....The notion ofprominent buildings taking on a temporary role as ‘temples’ for blótceremonies isnow generally accepted”; Price, The Viking Way,61, citing the papers presented in thesymposium publication Uppsalakulten och Adam av Bremen, ed. A. Hultgård (Nora:Nya Doxa, 1997).74. Hans Dedekam demonstrated the presence of a sacrificial grove with humanfigures hanging from trees in the Oseberg tapestry in his “Odins Træ: Et Stykke Billedvæv fra Osebergfundet,” 56 ff.

F. Ström denies any connection between religious sacrifice and the deathpenalty (On the Sacral Origin of the Germanic Death Penalties, 1942). D.

Discussing both, Turville-Petre believesthat if this was true, the law itself was divine (Myth and Religion,328).81. These questions are raised by Polomé, Essays,p. 72.82.Den norsk-islandske Skjaldedigtning,ed. Finnur Jónsson, A I–II, B I–II,1912–1915; cited in Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion,43 n. 8.83. In Eyrbyggja saga,ch. 44, we learn that before a battle started, one of the chiefshurled a spear over the enemy “following an ancient custom” (at fornum sid), and thusdedicated them to the battle-god. Stephen Mitchell remarks, “The use of a phrase likeat fornum sidshould be understood to be highly unreliable (or questionable at any rate)in a culture as ‘antiquarianizing’ as that of the Icelandic 13th or 14th centuries” (per-sonal correspondence, June 27, 1995).84. Dumézil, Gods,30.Gefa(give), which we identified earlier as the verb used byOdin on the tree to describe his offering of himself to himself, is used in many differ-ent sacrificial contexts. The most ghastly one may be the habit of “cutting the blood-ea-gle” on one’s enemy by slitting open his back and drawing out the lung, thus explictlyconsecrating the victim to Odin. For example, the Orkneyinga sagasays that when Tork-Einar defeated Hálfdan Highleg, he cut the blood-eagle on his back and “gave him toOdin” (gaf hann Ódni). (Orkneyinga saga,ed. S. Nordal, 1916, 12; cited in Turville-Petre,Myth and Religion,254 n. 21). However, as is the case with the other medieval Icelandsagas that treat archaic (Viking) topics, doubt has been raised about whether the prac-tice ever existed, as argued by Roberta Frank, “Viking Atrocity and Skaldic Verse: TheRite of the Blood-Eagle.”85.

In chapters 4–6 of the Skáldskaparmál, Snorri Sturluson relates thePromethean theft of the elixir of poetry in the response of Bragi to the question,“Whence come the art called poetry?” (there is also a version in Hávamál104–110):“Kvasir was a being who was so wise that he could answer any question put to him. Hewas fashioned by the gods from their truce-spittle at the conclusion of the hostilies be-tween the Æsir and the Vanir. The two dwarves Fjalar and Galar murdered him whenhe wandered in to their house. They ran off with his blood in three vessels. Mixing theblood with honey, the dwarves brewed mead that made anyone who drank of it a poetor soothsayer. Later, the hospitable dwarves murdered another guest, a giant namedGilling, by drowning him in a rowboat. His wife’s loud lamentations disturbed themso much that they dropped a millstone on her head. When Suttung, the son or nephewof Gilling, learned of the dwarves’ perfidy, he marooned them on a reef. They gave himthe mead as weregild. Odin, travelling abroad as B ̈olverk (Evil-doer), took service withBaugi, the brother of Suttung, and demanded a drink of mead as wages. When Sut-tung refused, the god bored a hole into the rock of Suttung’s castle with a supernaturalauger called Rati, changed into a serpent, and crawled into the hole. There he encoun-tered and seduced the daughter of Suttung, Gunnl ̈od, who guarded the mead. She of-fered him three sips of the mead; he emptied all three vessels. Odin changed into aneagle and flew away with Suttung in hot pursuit. When the gods saw the eagle ap-proaching the walls of Ásgardr, they set out crocks in the courtyard. With Suttung liter-ally at his tail, Odin spewed out the mead into these jars; but some spilt outside thewall. Anyone can drink this; it is called ‘the foolpoet’s portion’ (skáldfíflahlutr).”As Turville-Petre notes, the story of the theft of the sacred liquor of inspiration innot unique to Norse mythology; it may have an ancient Indo-European genesis: “theclosest parallel to the story of Ódinn is to be found in Indian myths about the rape ofsoma, the half-personified, intoxicating sacrificial liquor....Soma is said to stimulatethe voice, and to be the leader of poets. Those who drink it become immortal andknow the gods....Soma gives strength to gods and men, but especially to Indra. In-dra, filled with soma, conquered the monster Vritra, and fortified with it he performedmany a mighty feat. The soma was brought from heaven to Indra; as is frequently toldin the Rigveda,it was brought by an eagle. The eagle, according to one passage, brokeinto a fortress of iron to seize the soma. Although Indra is occasionally called, orlikened to, an eagle, he does not, in the Rigveda,appear to be identified with the eaglewho raped the soma. It has, however, been remarked that, in one later passage, it is In-dra himself, in the form of an eagle, who carried off the soma” (Myth and Religion,41and n. 43).Régis Boyer comments on the meaning of this episode, “At the price of a series ofanimal metamorphoses, Ódinn managed to swallow the liquid in order to return it toÁsgardr. This role of ‘savior’ or, more exactly, of inventor of poetic inspiration, seemsprimeval if we do not forget that poetry is a matter of penetrating the arcana of wisdomor, once again, of controlling furor, in this case poetic furor, the creative power ofspeech, its ability to found the world.

There is no way to master all the wisdom of the dead but to die.Ódinn died, and like Christ he rose up and came back. We may remember a storyquoted by J. G. Frazer about an Eskimo shaman of the Bering Strait, who burned him-self alive, expecting to return with greater wisdom” (Myth and Religion,50).

The effort to tie the autosacrifice ofOdin to the crucifixion of Christ is, in my opinion, another version of the inability tocope with divine reflexivity as a recurrent indigenous category.139. Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion,48.140. This ultimacy is clearly felt and expressed by Kristensen, who writes aboutOdin’s “death,” “In this case the idea of sacrifice is, as it were, expressed quite purely:sacrificial death is the actualization of divine life. God who sacrifices himself is the formu-lation of the thought behind ever y act of sacrifice.It is the absolutizing of absolute life,which can only take place in death”; The Meaning of Religion, 495–496 (italics added).141.

The “liquid” theme is also central in Hebrews, which continually dwells on theredemptive power of the “sprinkling” of Christ’s blood, offered in atonement; seeHebrews 9:11–14, “Now if the blood of goats and bulls and the ash of a heifer sprinkledon those who have been defiled sanctifies for the purification of the flesh, how muchmore does the blood of Christ, who through eternal spirit offered himself blameless toGod, cleanse our conscience from dead works so that we might serve the living God!”In later Christian tradition, both the water of baptism and the blood of Christ, offeredby him to God as atonement for collective guilt, are represented as purifying, absolvingagents.6. In practice, the Last Supper is transformed into a daily rite after all, with theofficiating priest assuming the role of Christ as high priest.

Carman observes in Majesty and Meekness,419: “Since Abrahamwas carrying out a direct divine command, there is a divine presence in his sacrifice—uttering the word demanding the sacrifice, staying the hand with the knife about to killthe beloved son, and providing the substitute victim, the ram.”15.

Vermès, “Redemption and Genesis xxii—the Binding of Isaac and the Sacri-fice of Jesus.” The Palestinian Targums on Leviticus 22:27 (1TJ and 2TJ) reveal an ex-plicit relationship between the aqedah and the temple sacrifices; for example, “Thelamb was chosen to recall the merit of the lamb of Abraham [Isaac], who bound him-self upon the altar and stretched out his neck for Your Name’s sake. Heaven was let down and descended and Isaac saw its perfection and his eyes were weakened bythe highplaces. For this reason he acquired merit and a merit was provided there, inhis stead, for the burnt offering” (cited in Vermès, “Redemption and Genesis xxi,” 211and n. 1).436notes to pages 243–44"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"17.

Iphigenia actually dies in Pindar’s Eleventh Pythian Ode;Aeschylus’s Agam-memnon141; and the work of Lucretius I (101).Artemis does not perform the sacrifice herself. However, the victim is to be of-fered back to her;she who requested the human victim also provides the animal substi-tute, and she will receive it in substitution. Like Artemis, the god of the Genesis storydoes not himself perform the sacrifice; Abraham, like Calchas in the Iphigenia story,becomes the agent of the deity.Later, in the haggadotof the talmudic period, perhaps in response to the heuristicpower of the Christian sacrifical story, Isaac actually dies; see Spiegel, The Last Trial,especially ch. 8. For a discussion of the implications of this transformation from meta-phorical or averted human sacrifice to a tradition of realized sacrifice, see Henrichs,“Human Sacrifice in Greek Religion.”The idea of this “autosacrifice” by God of his son, a “successful” aqedah with noanimal substitution, with Christ as both agent of sacrifice and victim, is presentedwithin a context of theological necessity as early the first epistle of John and theGospel of John 12:27–34 (e.g., Christ’s words in John 12:27, “For this purpose Ihave come to this hour”). Interestingly, it is with the same colors of necessity(anagkh) that Iphigenia paints her coming death; of many examples in the play, seeIphigenia at Aulis1482,eDxrean(if it must be); and 1556, eGperDstBuAsfaton tade(if this is what the god has said). In submitting to what she perceives to be divinenecessity, the victim ennobles the sordid machinations that have brought her to thealtar.Albert Henrichs observes that “no Greek divinity ever performshuman sacrifice,even though Electra in Euripides Orestes191 charges Apollo with doing her and herbrother in—DjAuysen foPboßcmpß—‘a sacrificing god’ in a violently metaphoricalsense” (correspondence with author, October 1991).19. 1 John 2:2 also identifies Jesus as the expiation (Clasmaß) for our sins, butdoes not explicitly connect this with the Father.20.

Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin39a, trans. Jacob Shachter.2. The Talmud itself distinguishes between two genres: Halakhah, the expandedexposition of the Law, and Haggadah, the vast body of digressions and lore. Within theTalmud, the two are interwoven and in fact, often hard to tell apart.3. The discussants were the amoraim,“those who explain,” from the Aramaic ‘mr,“say, discuss.”4. Babylonia was a center of autonomous Judaism that lasted from the year586B.C.E. (the reign of Cyrus) to the year 1040 C.E. (the invasion of the Mongols).Hillel was Babylonian by birth. Rav and Mar Samuel, the founders of the Babylon-ian academies, were born in Babylonia but went to sit at the feet of the PalestinianJudah the Prince, also known as Rabbi. The first rabbinic academy rose to eminenceunder Samuel (d. 254 C.E.) at Nehardea; the second academy in Sura under Rav (d.247C.E.), and the third, that of Judah Bar Ezekial (d. 299 C.E.), the pupil of Samueland Rav, at Pum Beditha. Ravina II bar Huna (d. 499 C.E.) was the last of theamoraim.5. The Sasanian kings Yazdegird II (438–457) and Peroz (459–484) tried to com-pel Jewish conversions to Zorastrianism (see Hermann Strack, Introduction to the Tal-mud and Midrash,71).6. Tradition holds that Ashi and Ravina completed the redaction (Gemara)ofTal-mud Bavli, but this is now thought to be the legacy of the savoraim(from the Aramaicsbr,“consider, hold an opinion”), who thrived for several generations after the acade-mies disappeared. They not only introduced a consistent, complex technical terminol-ogy for introducing source materials into the tractates of the Talmud; they also com-posed entire sections. It is to them that we owe the size and completeness of theBabylonian Talmud, which comments on thirty-six of the sixty-three Mishnaic tractatesand is four times as long as the Palestinian or “Jerusalem” Talmud.In addition to its scope, the “canonicity” of the Babylonian Talmud (abbreviatedas B.T.: generally, the term “Talmud” is taken to imply the Bavli) may be attributableto the propaganda of the Babylonian geonimof the last centuries and to the declininginfluence of the rabbis of the Land of Israel under successive waves of invasions, es-pecially the destruction wrought by the Crusades (see Goldenberg, “Talmud,” 257).Goldenberg also points to the stronger ties of the ascendant communities of NorthAfrican and Spanish Jewry to the Jews of Babylon than to those of Palestine.

Epstein, Introduction to Seder Zera\\iminBerakhot). All tal-mudic arguments, no matter how digressive, are scripturally based.A congregation, the number required for a public service, consists of not less thanten adult males. Later in b. Berakhot6b, concerning the Lord’s attending the syna-gogue, we find this account: “R. Johanan says: Whenever the Holy One, blessed be He,comes into a Synagogue and does not find ten persons there, He becomes angry atonce. For it is said: Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? When I called, wasthere no answer? [Isa. 50, 2].” In the absence of a minyan, a quorum of ten, a numberof features in the service are omitted (recitation of Barekhu, Kaddish,public recitationof the \\Amidah, and other statutory prayers).38. In b. Berakhot6a, which continues: “And how do you know that if three aresitting as a court of judges the Divine Presence is with them? For it is said: In the midstof the judges He judgeth[Sanh. 2b].” The dispensing of justice is seen as a holy activity:“I might think [the dispensing of ] justice is only for making peace, and the DivinePresence does not come [to participate]. Therefore he teaches us that justice also isTorah.”The interpretation of the noun “judges” (Úelohim,“gods”) is normal for the rabbisin this context, but problematic in the greater realm of biblical interpretation. The termis found in Exod. 21:22: “When men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, sothat there is a miscarriage, and yet no harm follows, the one who hurt her shall befined, according as the woman’s husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as ‘thejudges’ determine.” The rabbis read the pluralÚelohimas “judges” here as well, but ex-trapolated it into polytheistic texts such as Ps. 82:1, “God has taken his place in the di-vine council; in the midst of the gods he holds judgement.” See Mullen, The Assemblyof the Gods.39.B.

Simon notes that the tefillinof the arm are covered by thesleeves.42. Exodus 13:1–10 highlights Moses’s admonition to Israel to “Remember thisday, in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage, for by strength ofhand the Lord brought you out from this place” (13:3) as well as the prohibition againstleavened bread and the other ceremonial requirements of Passover. Israel is enjoinedto recall her chosen status: “And it shall be as a memorial between your eyes, that thelaw of the Lord may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand the Lord has broughtyou out of Egypt” (13:9).43. Exodus 13:11–16 deals specifically with the consecration of firstborn animals toGod, as well as the redemption of firstborn sons with an animal sacrifice. A responseto a son who asks the meaning of this is given, and again the remembrance is to bemade on the hand or between the eyes: “ ‘For when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to letus go, the Lord slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of manand the firstborn of cattle. Therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all the males that first openthe womb; but the firstborn of my sons I redeem.’ It shall be as a mark on your handor frontlets between your eyes; for by a strong hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt”(13:15–16).44. Deuteronomy 6:4–9 contains the great exhortation to hear and affirm theoneness and uniqueness of God, and the importance of complete dedication of one’sbeing to his service: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with allyour soul, and with all your might” (6:5). It too refers to the transmission of these com-mandments, giving the scriptural basis for the wearing of tefillinand the placing ofmezuzoton doorways: “And you shall bind them as a sign upon your hand, and theyshall be as frontlets between your eyes, And you shall write them on the doorposts ofyour house and on your gates” (6:8–9).45. Deuteronomy 11:13–21 is an injunction to “fear the Lord your God,” to “servehim,” and to “swear by his name.” It inveighs against worship of other neighboringgods, and warns of God’s jealousy.46. May and Metzger, eds., The Oxford Annotated Bible(RSV), 223. Shema\\,“Hear,” was the first word of the Deuteronomy passage. The rest of the passages in theShema\\, which was to be recited upon arising and retiring according to the practice ofMoses, are Deuteronomy 11:13–21 and Numbers 15:37–41; “Jews have always regardedit as divinely prescribed.”47.B. Berakhot6a. Simon notes that although the Aruch, the medieval talmudiclexicon of Asher ben Je.hiel, gives “a unique entity” as the translation, Jastrow of the lastcentury translates this phrase as “the only object of your love”; both translations cap-ture the idea of a marriage covenant.48. The RSV corrects the objective pronoun “her” from earlier translations to“him,” thus characterizing Israel as a male. “Her,” however, would best seem to honorthe text’s analogy of Hosea’s remarriage with Gomer to God’s reconciliation and vow towayward Israel.49.

Thus the activity of the precentor was understood in antiquity: ‘The eyesof the community are raised to him, and his eyes are raised to God,’ as it says in amidrash and in an ancient prayer.” Elbogen, Jewish Liturgy,376.67. Ibid., 379.68. In the sayings of Bar Nahmani reported from the third century C.E., the di-vine robe became the focus of a quasi-gnostic mysticism, with heretical potential.69. Metzger and Murphy (eds. New Oxford Annotated Bible, 3rd ed.) note that thissummary is echoed in other places in Hebrew Scripture (Numbers 14:18; Nehemiah9:17, 31; Psalms 103:8, Jeremiah 32:18, and Jonah 4:2) and remark that it “is probablyan old cultic confession” (NOAB, 115). Simon notes that the thirteen attributes are enu-merated as follows: “According to one reckoning, ‘The Lord, the Lord’ count as two, ac-cording to another reckoning only the second of these counts as an attribute, and theexpressions‘keeping mercy’and‘unto the thousandth generation’count as two attributes.According to Rashi, the Divine Name YHWH designated the divine attribute ofmercy—a very old idea” (Simon, Rosh Hashanah,nn. 9 and 10).70. We might compare Jesus’s instructions on how to pray in the Sermon on theMount (Matthew 6:9–14), which seems to fall squarely between the two genres.71. Halbertal, “If The Text Had Not Been Written, It Could Not Be Said,” Neistranslation, 1–4 passim.72. Ibid., 17.73. Ibid., 25.74.B. Berakhot7a, translated by A. Cohen. Cohen adds a footnote, “Lit., in thehouse of My prayer.” In fact the original Hebrew, bebet tefillati, ascribes God’s posses-sive to the house rather than to the prayer, since in Hebrew one cannot put the suffixon the first noun in the construct, even if semantically it is the first noun that it gov-erns. That is, “the house of my prayer” is the biblical way of saying “My house ofprayer.” However, the Septuagint translates the passage too literally: GntuoGkitmßproseyxmß moy(LXXIsaiah56:7) and, interestingly for this discussion, the rabbis ex-ploit the idiom for their own purposes.75. Isaiah 56:6–7.76. Cohen, Ever yman’s Talmud,87.77. God’s direct response is guaranteed in times of peril, without the need to gothrough intercessory functionaries; for example, y. Ber.9:1, 13a: “When a man is introuble, do not cry out to the angel Michael or to the angel Gabriel but to Me and I willanswer immediately.” As with all prohibitions, this must signal a widespread belief inangelic intercessors and a common practice of importuning them. However, in b. Ber.32b and at other points in the Talmud, expectation of an answer to prayers was discour-aged. As with miracles, as we will discuss below, rabbinic Judaism did not endorseclaims to ongoing divine revelation on the part of particular individuals; these were insome way perceived as detrimental to the adherence to statutory devotions and to themaintenance of halakhic authority.78.

John Carman notes that “the Divine will is represented here by the rabbi, notas a wise merger of the different Divine virtues, but as God’s own prayer that hismercy may prevail over his anger and all his other attributes....It might seem asthough that quality furthest away from the regal or lordly character of the ‘King of theUniverse’ is the one for whose triumph the Lord himself prays...but the delineationof distinct qualities is even sharper, qualities that seem to be in conflict” (John Carman,draft ms. of Contrast and Harmony: A Comparative Study of Polar Attributes in the Con-cept of God, quoted here with permission of the author from the draft of chapter 19,“Justice and Mercy in the Experience of Israel.” This passage was later published insubstantially changed form in Majesty and Meekness,p. 255).91.Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana,translated by Max Arzt in Justice and Mercy,quotationfacing title page.92.The Poem of Erra,translated by Luigi Cagni in Sources from the Ancient NearEast; cited by Jon Levenson in his essay, “Cataclysm, Survival, and Regeneration in theHebrew Bible,” n. 5 to p. 42.93.

He also suggests that Rav’s image of the two sidesof God contesting with each other may be attributable to the atmosphere of Zoroas-trian dualism in which it was written: “Since Babylonia in Rav’s time was in the con-trol of a zealous Zoroastrian dynasty, the resemblance of this prayer to the Zervanicdualistic monotheism already mentioned...is unlikely to be coincidence” (ibid., n. 27to p. 59).95.

Stern notes that the altar is a synecdoche for thewhole Temple and then further hypothesizes that “God’s own altar here is transformedinto a substitute for the people of Israel.” In Lamentations Rabbah 4.11, Asaph praisesGod for destroying the Temple rather than the people of Israel, but, Stern says, thisgoes even further: “It is also a transformation of the conventional image for the Jewishvictims of the war as sacrifices of atonement upon the altar of punishment for Israel’ssins. In this mashal,the altar literally atones for their sins in place of the victims”(Stern,Parables in Midrash,114). In other words, God’s wrathful justice was so greatthat he could have justifiably destroyed his people.102. Mitchell, The Meaning ofBrk“To Bless” in the Old Testament.103. Ibid., 35–36.

Yet the talmudic episodes and images considered in this chapter, however fan-tastic, are not in fact divorced from normative concerns or halakhic force.133.

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, common shortforms of the tas.liyawhen the name of Mu.hammad is mentioned are s.alla ̄›lla ̄hu \\alayhiwa-sallama(“Allah bless him and grant him peace”) or s.alla ̄\\ala ̄›n-nabı ̄(“Alla ̄h bless theprophet”).70.

Meier notes that in hisMagie et religion dans l\\Afrique du Nord(Algiers, 1908, 453, 1–2), Edmond Doutté heldthat the origins of the Arabic tas.liyahlay in the idea of burnt-offering (e.g., Su ̄ rah56:94,wa-tas.liyat jahı ̄m: “and roast in a hell-fire”). If it does have some connection tosacrifice, this might shed some light on the reason for the magical potency and self-sufficiency of the prayer.74. Meier’s article traces the ancient habit and frequent later practice of addingpersonal demands to the tas.liyah.Since Abu ̄ d-Darda ̄›(d. 653 C.E.) was supposed to havesaid the plea for the divine benediction is itself a personal prayer which God does not450notes to pages 289–92"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"fail to grant, JaÛfar as.-S.a ̄diq and Abu ̄ Sulayma ̄n ad-Da ̄ranı ̄ concluded that God is toogenerous to grant only the blessing of the prophet without taking into account also thepersonal wishes added by the author of the prayer.75. Ibn al-Qayyim, Jala ̄›239; Kulı ̄nı ̄,Us. ̄ul2, 493, nr. 9; cited in Meier, “Die segen-sprechung,” 375 n. 61. Similarly, “When you hear the call to prayer, say after him whatthe mu›adhdhinsays, then call down blessing on me, for whosoever calls down one’sblessing on me, God shall call down on him ten blessings” (Abdullah b. Umar, cited inPadwick,Muslim Devotions,152–153).ÛAli al-Makkı ̄ comments that “there is no doubtthat to bless the Prophet is one of the most important of good deeds” (Fa.thu\\l-karı ̄mi›l-kha ̄liq; cited in Padwick, Muslim Devotions,153). Traditionally, the tenfold reward ofthe s.ala ̄t \\ala ̄›n-nabı ̄is based on Su ̄ rah 6:160, “He that doeth good shall have ten timesas much to his credit.”Anne Marie Schimmel notes that according to al-Ghaza ̄lı ̄, God himself addressedthe Prophet with the words, “Do you approve, O Muhammad, that nobody from yourcommunity utters the formula of blessing for you [even] once but I bless him tentimes, and nobody from your community greets you [even] once but I greet him tentimes?” (Ih.ya ̄›\\ul ̄um i›d-dı ̄n,1:278–289, cited in Schimmel, Muhammad,92 n. 54). Ac-cording to the same h.adı ̄th,the Prophet says, “Whosoever utters the blessing for me,he is blessed by the angels as often as he utters the blessing, be it often or rarely.”76.

Mitchellgoes on to observe an evolution of the idea of blessing which may well have been reca-pitulated in Islam: “The frequency of the different meanings of brkchanges with time.Twelve of the thirteen occurrences of brkin Ugaritic denote gods blessing men, withone occurrence denoting a human benediction. The frequency of human blessings in-creases in later NW Semitic texts (35–36). See also Greenberg, Biblical Prose Prayer.92. Robson, “Blessings on the Prophet,” 367.93. Ibid.94. Ibid., 368.95.

Robson offers many examples to show how these words were not used exclu-sively of Mu.hammad; among them is a poem attributed to Kuthaiyir (d. 105/723)where s.alla ̄\\ala ̄is used in a grave elegy (Kita ̄b al-agha ̄nı ̄,VI, p. 25 (Cairo, 1935), cited inRobson, “Blessings on the Prophet,” 370 n. 13. From a narration from Ibn Harma,dated to the second century of Islam, he cites a prayer that Allah’s s.alawa ̄tmay rest onAli and his descendants (Kita ̄b al-agha ̄nı ̄,VI, 105), cited in Robson, 370 n. 14. In thedı ̄wa ̄nof Hassan b. Thabit, Mu.hammad’s court poet, we find a dirge on the death ofHamza that includes “Allah ‘bless you’ (s.alla ̄\\alayka) in a high garden whose entrant ishonorable” (ed. Hirschfeld, 72 n. 15; cited in Robson, 370 n. 15). In the Q ̄ut al-qul ̄ub,ahistory of religion of Islam written by Abu .Talib al-Makkı ̄ (d. 386/996), we learn thatthe angels “bless” him (tus.allı ̄\\alayhi) who recites the whole Qur›a ̄n in a week (Cairo,1932), I, 68; and they also do so to a man whose table is spread with food to entertainguests (IV, 68); birds, beasts and fish bless the learned man who shares his learning(II, 4); all cited in Robson, 370 nn. 16, 17, and 18. However, especially the last example,which clearly shows that the birds, etc., in order to “bless” mustinvoke the power ofGod, show that the translation of “bless” has just as much problem as “pray for” as atranslation of s.alla ̄\\ala ̄for God’s action in Su ̄ rah 33:56. 98.

The article’s author goes on to insist, “We are not to re-gard that as due to an anthropomorphic theology but rather as the still plastic meta-phor of a poet.”107. Other striking polarities exist in traditional Islamic theology: God is the Exal-ter (al-raf ı ̄Û) but also the Abaser (al-mudhill); He is the Advantager (al-muqaddim) andyet the Withholder (al-ma ̄ni). His epithet of Distresser (al-.da ̄rr) is also used of Satan inSu ̄ rah 58.10. In Su ̄ rahs 4:169 and 175 we find a word-for-word reprise of God’s prayerinBerakhot:“May my mercy overcome My wrath!” For a discussion of these issues ofpolarity in Islam and in the context of comparative religions, see John Carman’sMajesty and Meekness.108.

Schimmel points outthat many verses in Ru ̄mı ̄’sMathnawı ̄emphasize that God “lights the candle of prayerin the darkness....As all activity come from God and begins with Him, and as Hisaddress precedes every human word, thus it is He who teaches man to pray: ‘Other-wise, how could a rose grow out of an ash pit?’ ” (Mathnawı ̄II 2443 ff., cited in Schim-mel,I Am Wind,171).123.

Another h.adithlikens ritual prayer to the mi\\ra ̄j,“ladder,” and more specifically,“heavenly journey.” Ru ̄mı ̄ takes up this saying; the Prophet experienced God’s imme-diate Presence and he alluded to this moment with the words lı ̄ ma \\a Alla ̄h waqt,“Ihave a time with God.” “So too the heart of one who prays ‘has a time with God’ whennothing stands between the heart and God” (Schimmel, I Am Wind,171).136.

Padwick collects these in Muslim Devotions,46. She notes that the preoccu-pation with the shafa ̄›ahof Mu.hammad is largely Sunni and is not so dominant inShı ̄Ûa devotion because “the same honorable office [i.e., as Mu.hammad the intercessor]is shared by the Shı ̄Ûa Ima ̄ms.” These receive their own direct pleas for direct interces-sion in popular devotion.145.
