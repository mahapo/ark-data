In your desire to please or impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite-inspire fear and insecurity. Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power. LAW 2 page 8 NEVER PUT TOO MUCH TRUST IN FRIENDS, LEARN HOW TO USE ENEMIES Be wary of fiiends-they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from fiiends than from enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them. LAW 3 page 16 CONCEAL YOUR INTENTIONS Keep people off-balance and in the dark lly never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Guide them far enough down the wrang path, envelop them in enough smoke, and lly the time they realize your intentions, it will be too late. LAW 4 page 31 ALWAYS SAY LESS THAN NECESSARY When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate lly saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say somethingfoolish. LAW 5 page 37 SO MUCH DEPENDS ON REPUTATION-GUARD IT WITH YOUR LIFE Reputation is the corners tone of power. Through reputation alone you can intimidate and win; once it slips, however, you are vulnerable, and will be attacked on all sides. Make your reputation unassailable. Always be alert to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, leam to destroy your enemies lly opening holes in their own reputations. Then stand aside and Let public opinion hang them. LAW 6 page44 COURT ATTENTION AT ALL COST Everything is judged lly its appearance; what is unseen counts for nothing. Never Let yourself get lost in the crowd, then, or buried in oblivion. Stand out. Be conspicuous, at all cost. Make yourself a magnet of attention lrj appearing larger, more colorful, more mysterious than the bland and timid masses.

Not only will such assis­tance save you valuable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency and speed. In the end your helpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered. Never do yourself what others can do for you. LAW S page 62 MAKE OTHER PEOPLE COME TO YOU-USE BAIT IF NECESSARY When you force the other person to act, you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent come to you, abandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him with fabulous gains-then attack. You hold the cards. LAW<) page69 WIN THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS, NEVER THROUGH ARGUMENT Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resent­ment and ill will you stir up is stronger and !asts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate. LAW 10 page 76 INFECTION: AVOID THE UNHAPPY AND UNLUCKY You can die from someone eises misery-emotional states are as infectious as diseases. You may feel you are helping the drowning man but you are only precipitating your own disaster. The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you. Associate with the happy and fortunate instead. LA W 1 1 page 82 LEARN TO KEEP PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON YOU To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more freedom you have. Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and you have nothing to fear. Never teach them enough so that they can do without you. LA W I 2 page 89 USE SELECTIVE HONESTY AND GENEROSITY TO DISARM YOUR VICTIM One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones. open-hearted gestures of honesty and generosity bring down the guard of even the most suspicious people.

He will find a way to ignore you. Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion. He will res pond enthusiastically when he sees some­thing to be gained for himself. x CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"LA W 14 page 101 POSE AS A FRIEND, WORK AS A SPY Knowing about your rival is critical.

LAW 15 page 107 CRUSH YOUR ENEMY TOTALLY All great leaders since Moses have known that a feared enemy must be crushed completely. (Sometimes they have leamed this the hard way.) If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventu­ally break out. More is lost through stopping halfway than through total annihilation: The enemy will recover, and will seek revenge. Crush him, not only in body but in spirit. LAW 16 page 115 USE ABSENCE TO INCREASE RESPECT AND HONOR To o much circulation makes the price go down: The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear. If you are already established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked about, even more admired. You must leam when to leave. Create value through scarcity. LA W 17 page 123 KEEP OTHERS IN SUSPENDED TERROR: CULTIVATE AN AIR OF UNPREDlCTABILlTY Humans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to see familiarity in other people's aetions. Your pre­dietability gives them a sense of control. Tum the tables: Be deliberately unpredietable. Behavior that seems to have no consistency or purpose will keep them off-balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain your moves. Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize.

A fortress seems the safest. But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it protects you from-it cuts you off from valuable in­formation, it makes you conspicuous and an easy target. Better to circulate among people, find allies, mingle. You are shielded from your enemies by the crowd. LAW 19 page 137 KNOW WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH-DO NOT OFFEND THE WRONG PERSON There are many different kinds of people in the world, and you can never assume that everyone will react to your strategies in the same way.

The trick, then, is to make your victims Jeel smart-and not Just smart, but smarter than you are. Once convinced oJ this, they will never suspect that you may have ulttr rior motives. LAW 22 page 163 USE THE SURRENDER TACTIC: TRANSFORM WEAKNESS INTO POWER When you are weaker, never fight Jor honor's sake; choose surrender instead. Surrender gives you time to re­cover, time to torment and irritate your conqueror, time to wait Jor his power to wane. Do not give him the sat­isJaction oJ fighting and deJeating you-surrender first. By turning the other cheek you inJuriate and unsettle him. Make surrender a tool oJ power.

All the toil and practice that go into them, and also all the clever tricks, must be concealed. When you act, act effortlessly, as if you could do much more. Avoid the temptation of revealing how hard you work-it only raises questions. Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you. LAW 31 page254 CONTROL THE OPTIONS: GET OTHERS TO PLAY WITH THE CARDS YOU DEAL The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a choice: Your victims feel they are in contral, but are actually your puppets.

Never appeal to tru,th and reality unless you are prepared for the anger that comes frvm disenchantment.

No one wants less power; everyone wants more. In the world today, however, it is dangerous to seem too power hungry, to be overt with your power moves. We have to seem fair and decent. So we need to be subtle-congenial yet cunning, democratic yet devious. This game of constant duplicity most resembles the power dynamic that existed in the scheming world of the old aristocratic court. Throughout history, a court has always formed itself around the person in power-king, queen, emperor, leader. The courtiers who filled this court were in an espe­cially delicate position: They had to serve their masters, but if they seemed to fawn, if they curried favor too obviously, the other courtiers around them would notice and would act against them. Attempts to win the mas­ter's favor, then, had to be subtle. And even skilIed courtiers capable of such subtlety still had to protect themselves from their fellow courtiers, who at all moments were scheming to push them aside. Meanwhile the court was supposed to represent the height of civiliza­tion and refinement. Violent or overt power moves were frowned upon; courtiers would work silently and secretly against any among them who used force. This was the courtier's dilemma: While appearing the very paragon of elegance, they had to outwit and thwart their own opponents in the subdest of ways. The successful courtier learned over time to make all of his moves indirect; if he stabbed an opponent in the back, it was with a velvet glove on his hand and the sweetest of srniles on his face. Instead of using coercion or outright treachery, the perfect courtier got his way through seduction, charm, deception, and subtle strategy, always planning several moves ahead. Life in the court was a never-ending game that re­quired constant vigilance and tactical thinking. It was civilized war. Today we face a peculiarly similar paradox to that of the courtier: Everything must appear civilized, decent, democratic, and fair. But if we play by those rules too strictly, if we take them too literally, we are crushed by those around us who are not so foolish. As the great Renaissance diplo­mat and courtier Niccolö Machiavelli wrote, ''Any man who tries to be good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who are not good.\" The court imagined itself the pinnacle of refinement, but un-PREFACE xvii"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Courts are, unquestion­ably, the seats of polite­ness and good breeding; were they not so, they wOllld be the seals of slallghter and desolation.

LORD CIIESTERHELD, 1694-1773 There is nothing very odd abollt lambs disliking birds ofprey, bllt this is no reason fo r holding it against large birds 0/ prey that they carry ofnambs. Ami when the lambs whis­per {lmong themselves, \"These birds of prey are evii, and does this not give IlS a right to say that whatever is Ihe opposite of a bird of prey must be good?\" there is nothing intrin­sically wrong with such an argllment�though the birds of prey will look somewhat quizzi­cally and say, \"We have f/othing against these good lambs; in fa ct, we love them; nothing tastes beller than a tender lamb.\" FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, 1844-1900 xviii PREFACE derneath its glittering surface a cauldron of dark emotions---greed, envy, lust, hatred-boiled and simmered. Our world today similarly imagines it­self the pinnacle of fairness, yet the same ugly emotions still stir within us, as they have forever. The game is the same. Outwardly, you must seem to respect the niceties, but inwardly, unless you are a fool, you learn quickly to be prudent, and to do as Napoleon advised: Place your iron hand inside a velvet glove. If, like the courtier of times gone by, you can master the arts of indirection, leaming to seduce, charm, deceive, and subtly outmaneuver your opponents, you will attain the heights of power. You will be able to make people bend to your will without their realizing what you have done. And if they do not realize what you have done, they will neither resent nor resist you. To some people the notion of consciously playing power games---no mat­ter how indirect-seems evil, asocial, a relic of the past. They believe they can opt out of the game by behaving in ways that have nothing to do with power. You must beware of such people, for while they express such opin­ions outwardly, they are often among the most adept players at power. They utilize strategies that cleverly disguise the nature of the manipulation involved. These types, for example, will often display their weakness and lack of power as a kind of moral virtue. But true powerlessness, without any motive of self-interest, would not publicize its weakness to gain sympa­thy or respect. Making a show of one's weakness is actually a very effective strategy, subtle and deceptive, in the game of power (see Law 22, the Sur­render Tactic). Another strategy of the supposed nonplayer is to demand equality in every area oflife. Everyone must be treated alike, whatever their status and strength. But if, to avoid the taint of power, you attempt to treat everyone equally and fairly, you will confront the problem that some people do cer­tain things better than others. Treating everyone equally means ignoring their differences, elevating the less skillful and suppressing those who excel. Again, many of those who behave this way are actually deploying another power strategy, redistributing people's rewards in a way that they determine. Yet another way of avoiding the game would be perfect honesty and straightforwardness, since one of the main techniques of those who seek power is deceit and secrecy. But being perfectly honest will inevitably hurt and insult a great many people, some of whom will choose to injure you in return. No one will see your honest statement as completely objective and free of some personal motivation. And they will be right: In truth, the use ofhonesty is indeed apower strategy, intended to convince people of one's noble, good-hearted, selfless character. It is a form of persuasion, even a subtle form of coercion. Finally, those who claim to be nonplayers may affect an air of na'ivete, to protect them from the accusation that they are after power.

And even genuine naivete is not free of the snares of power. Children may be naive in many ways, but they often act from an elemental need to gain control over those around them.

JOHANN VON GOETlII', 1749-1S32 You can recognize these supposed nonplayers by the way they flaunt their moral qualities, their piety, their exquisite sense of justice. But since all ofus hunger for power, and almost all of our actions are aimed at gain­ing it, the nonplayers are merely throwing dust in OUf eyes, distracting us from their power plays with their air of moral superiority. If you observe them closely, you will see in fact that they are often the ones most skillful at indirect manipulation, even if some of them practice it unconsciously. And they greatly resent any publicizing of the tactics they use every day. If the world is like a giant scheming court and we are trapped inside it, there is no use in trying to opt out of the game. That will only render you powerless, and powerlessness will make you miserable. Instead of strug­gling against the inevitable, instead of arguing and whining and feeling guilty, it is far better to excel at power. In fact, the better you are at dealing with power, the better friend, lover, husband, wife, and person you be­come. By following the route of the perfect courtier (see Law 24) you learn to make others feel better about themselves, becoming a SOUfce of pleasure to them. They will grow dependent on YOUf abilities and desirous of YOUf presence. By mastering the 48 laws in this book, you spare others the pain that comes from bungling with power-by playing with fire without know­ing its properties.

It takes effort and years of practice, for much of the game may not come naturally. Certain basic skills are required, and once you master these skills you will be able to apply the laws of power more easily. The most important of these skills, and power's crucial foundation, is ] the ability to master your emotions. An emotional response to a situation is the single greatest barrier to power, amistake that will cost you a lot more than any temporary satisfaction you might gain by expressing YOUf feel­ings. Emotions cloud reason, and if you cannot see the situation clearly, you cannot prepare for and respond to it with any degree of contro!. Anger is the most destructive of emotional responses, for it clouds your vision the most. It also has a ripple effect that invariably makes situa­tions less controllable and heightens your enemy's resolve. If you are try­ing to destroy an enemy who has hurt you, far better to keep hirn off-guard by feigning friendliness than showing your anger. KAUTILYA, INDIAN PHILOSOPJlFR, rHIRn CENTURY B.C.

The superior man espouses events and circumstances in order to guide them. lf there were principles and fixed laws, nations would not change them as we change our shirts and a man can not be expected to be wiser than an entire nation. HONORE DF BALZAC', 1799-1850 xx PREFACE Love and affection are also potentially destructive, in that they blind you to the often self-serving interests of those whom you least suspect of playing a power game. You cannot repress anger or love, or avoid feeling them, and you should not try. But you should be careful about how you ex­press them, and most important, they should never influence your plans and strategies in any way. Related to mastering YOUf emotions is the ability to distance YOUfseif from the present moment and think objectively about the past and future. Like Janus, the double-faeed Roman deity and guardian of all gates and doorways, you must be able to look in both direetions at onee, the better to handle danger from wherever it comes. Such is the face you must create for YOUfself-one face looking continuously to the future and the other to the past. For the future, the motto is, \"No days unalert.\" Nothing should catch you by surprise because you are constantly imagining problems before they arise. Instead of spending your time dreaming of YOUf plan's happy ending, you must work on calculating every possible permutation and pit­fall that might emerge in it. The further you see, the more steps ahead you plan, the more powerful you become. The other face of Janus looks constantly to the past-though not to re­member past hUftS or bear grudges. That would only curb YOUf power. Half of the game is learning how to forget those events in the past that eat away at you and doud YOUf reason. The real purpose of the backward­glancing eye is to educate YOUfseif eonstantly-you look at the past to learn from those who came before you. (The many historical examples in this book will greatly help that process.) Then, having looked to the past, you look doser at hand, to YOUf own aetions and those of YOUf friends. This is the most vital school you ean learn from, because it comes from personal experience. You begin by examining the mistakes you have made in the past, the ones that have most grievously held you back. You analyze them in terms of the 48 laws of power, and you extraet from them a lesson and an oath: \"I shall never repeat such a mistake; I shall never fall into such a trap again.\" If you can evaluate and observe yourself in this way, you can learn to break the patterns of the past-an immensely valuable skill. Power requires the ability to play with appearanees. To this end you must learn to wear many masks and keep a bag full of deceptive tricks. De­ception and masquerade should not be seen as ugly or immoral. All human interaction requires deception on many levels, and in some ways what sep­arates humans from animals is our ability to lie and deceive. In Greek myths, in India's Mahabharata cyde, in the Middle Eastern epic of Gilga­mesh, it is the privilege of the gods to use deceptive arts; a great man, Odysseus for instance, was judged by his ability to riyal the craftiness of the gods, stealing some of their divine power by matching them in wits and de­ception. Deeeption is a developed art of civilization and the most potent weapon in the game of power."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"You cannot succeed at deception unless you take a somewhat dis­tanced approach to yourself-unless you can be many different people, wearing the mask that the day and the moment require. With such a flexi­ble approach to all appearances, induding your own, you lose a lot of the inward heaviness that holds people down. Make your face as malleable as the actor's, work to conceal your intentions from others, practice luring people into traps. Playing with appearances and mastering arts of decep­tion are among the aesthetic pleasures of life. They are also key compo­nents in the acquisition of power. If deception is the most potent weapon in your arsenal, then patience in all things is your crucial shield. Patience will protect you from making moronic blunders. Like mastering your emotions, patience is a skill-it does not come naturally. But nothing about power is natural; power is more godlike than anything in the natural world. And patience is the supreme virtue of the gods, who have nothing but time. Everything good will happen-the grass will grow again, if you give it time and see several steps into the future. Impatience, on the other hand, only makes you look weak. It is a principal impediment to power. Power is essentially amoral and one of the most important skills to ac­quire is the ability to see circumstances rather than good or evil. Power is a game-this cannot be repeated too often-and in games you do not judge your opponents by their intentions but by the effect of their actions. You measure their strategy and their power by what you can see and feel. How often are someone's intentions made the issue only to doud and deceive! What does it matter if another player, your friend or riyal, intended good things and had only your interests at heart, if the effects of his action lead to so much ruin and confusion? It is only natural for people to cover up their actions with all kinds of justifications, always assuming that they have acted out of goodness. You must learn to inwardly laugh each time you hear this and never get caught up in gauging someone's intentions and actions through a set of moral judgments that are really an excuse far the accumu­lation of power. It is agame. Your opponent sits opposite you. Both of you behave as gentlemen or ladies, observing the rules of the game and taking nothing personally. You play with a strategy and you observe your opponent's moves with as much calmness as you can muster. In the end, you will ap­preciate the politeness of those you are playing with more than their good and sweet intentions. Train your eye to follow the results of their moves, the outward circumstances, and do not be distracted by anything else. Half of your mastery of power comes from what you do not do, what you do not allow yourself to get dragged into. For this skill you must learn to judge all things by what they cost you. As Nietzsche wrote, \"The value of a thing sometimes lies not in what one attains with it, but in what one pays for it-what it costsus.\" Perhaps you will attain your goal, and a worthy goal at that, but at what price? Apply this standard to everything, induding whether to collaborate with other people or come to their aid. In the end, PREFACE xxi"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"xxii PREFACE life is short, opportunities are few, and you have only so much energy to draw on. And in this sense time is as important a consideration as any other. Never waste valuable time, or mental peace of mind, on the affairs of others-that is too high a price to pay. Power is a social game. To leam and master it, you must develop the ability to study and understand people. As the great seventeenth-century thinker and courtier Baltasar Graciän wrote: \"Many people spend time studying the properties of animals or herbs; how much more important it would be to study those of people, with whom we must live or die!\" To be a master player you must also be a master psychologist. You must recognize motivations and see through the cloud of dust with which people surround their actions. An understanding of people's hidden motives is the single greatest piece of knowledge you can have in acquiring power. It opens up endless possibilities of deception, seduction, and manipulation. People are of infinite complexity and you can spend a lifetime watch­ing them without ever fully understanding them. So it is all the more im­portant, then, to begin your education now. In doing so you must also keep ( one principle in mind: Never discriminate as to whom you study and i whom you trust. Never trust anyone completely and study everyone, in­cluding friends and loved ones. Finally, you must leam always to take the indirect route to power. Dis­guise your cunning. Like a billiard ball that caroms several times before it hits its target, your moves must be planned and developed in the least ob­vious way. By training yourself to be indirect, you can thrive in the modem court, appearing the paragon of decency while being the consummate ma­nipulator. Consider The 48 Laws of Po wer a kind of handbook on the arts of indirec­tion. The laws are based on the writings of men and women who have studied and mastered the game of power. These writings span aperiod of more than three thousand years and were created in civilizations as dis­parate as ancient China and Renaissance Italy; yet they share common threads and themes, together hinting at an essence of power that has yet to be fully articulated. The 48 laws of power are the distillation of this accu­mulated wisdom, gathered from the writings of the most illustrious strate­gists (Sun-tzu, Clausewitz), statesmen (Bismarck, Talleyrand), courtiers (Castiglione, Graciän), seducers (Ninon de Lenclos, Casanova), and con artists (\"Yellow Kid\" Weil) in history. The laws have a simple premise: Certain actions almost always in­crease one's power (the observance of the law), while others decrease it and even ruin us (the transgression of the law). These transgressions and observances are illustrated by historical examples. The laws are timeless and definitive. The 48 Laws of Po wer can be used in several ways. By reading the book straight through you can leam about power in general. Although several of the laws may seem not to pertain directly to your life, in time you will"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"probably find that all of them have some application, and that in fact they are interrelated. By getting an overview of the entire subject you will best be able to evaluate your own past actions and gain a greater degree of con­trol over your immediate affairs. A thorough reading of the book will in­spire thinking and reevaluation long after you finish it. The book has also been designed for browsing and for examining the law that seems at that particular moment most pertinent to you. Say you are experiencing problems with a superior and cannot understand why YOUf efforts have not lead to more gratitude or a promotion. Severallaws specifically address the master-underling relationship, and you are almost certainly transgressing one of them. By browsing the initial paragraphs for the 48 laws in the table of contents, you can identify the pertinent law. Finally, the book can be browsed through and picked apart for enter­tainment, for an enjoyable ride through the foibles and great deeds of our predecessors in power. A warning, however, to those who use the book for this purpose: It might be better to turn back. Power is endlessly seductive and deceptive in its own way. It is a labyrinth-your mind becomes con­sumed with solving its infinite problems, and you so on realize how pleas­antly lost you have become. In other words, it becomes most amusing by taking it seriously. Do not be frivolous with such a critical matter. The gods of power frown on the frivolous; they give ultimate satisfaction only to those who study and reflect, and punish those who skim the surfaces look­ing for a good time. Any man who tries to be good alt the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who are not good. Hence a prince who wants to keep his authority must leam how not to be good, and use that knowledge, or refrain from using it, as necessity requires.

He also loved money, for he led an extravagant lifestyle. Fouquet was clever and very much indispensable to the king, so when the prime minis­ter, Jules Mazarin, died, in 1661, the finance minister expected to be named the successor. Instead, the king decided to abolish the position. This and other signs made Fouquet suspect that he was falling out of favor, and so he decided to ingratiate hirnself with the king by staging the most spec­tacular party the world had ever seen. The party's ostensible purpose would be to commemorate the completion of Fouquet's chateau, Vaux-Ie­Vicomte, but its real function was to pay tribute to the king, the guest of honor. The most brilliant nobility of Europe and some of the greatest minds of the time-La Fontaine, La Rochefoucauld, Madame de Sevigne­attended the party. Moliere wrote a play for the occasion, in which he hirnselfwas to perform at the evening's conclusion. The party began with a lavish seven-course dinner, featuring foods from the Orient never be­fore tasted in France, as weH as new dishes created especiaHy for the night. The meal was accompanied with music commissioned by Fouquet to honor the king. Mter dinner there was a promenade through the chateau's gardens. The grounds and fountains of Vaux-Ie-Vicomte were to be the inspiration for Ve rsaiHes. Fouquet personally accompanied the young king through the geomet­rically aligned arrangements of shrubbery and flower beds. Arrlving at the gardens' canals, they witnessed a fireworks display, which was followed by the performance of Moliere's play. The party ran weH into the night and everyone agreed it was the most amazing affair they had ever attended. The next day, Fouquet was arrested by the king's head musketeer, D' Artagnan. Three months later he went on trial for stealing from the country's treasury. (Actually, most of the stealing he was accused of he had done on the king's behalf and with the king's permission.) Fouquet was found guilty and sent to the most isolated prison in France, high in the Pyrenees Mountains, where he spent the last twenty years of his life in soli­tary confinement. Interpretation Louis XN, the Sun King, was a proud and arrogant man who wanted to be the center of attention at all times; he could not countenance being out­done in lavishness by anyone, and certainly not his finance minister. To succeed Fouquet, Louis chose Jean-Baptiste Colbert, a man famous for his parsimony and for giving the duHest parties in Paris. Colbert made sure that any money liberated from the treasury went straight into Louis's hands. With the money, Louis built a palace even more magnificent than Fouquet's-the glorious palace of Versailles. He used the same architects,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"decorators, and garden designer. And at Versailles, Louis hosted parties even more extravagant than the one that cost Fouquet his freedom. Let us examine the situation. The evening of the party, as Fouquet pre­sented spectacle on spectacle to Louis, each more magnificent than the one before, he imagined the affair as demonstrating his loyalty and devotion to the king. Not only did he think the party would put hirn back in the king's favor, he thought it would show his good taste, his connections, and his popularity, making hirn indispensable to the king and demonstrating that he would make an excellent prime minister. Instead, however, each new spectacle, each appreciative smile bestowed by the guests on Fouquet, made it seem to Louis that his own friends and subjects were more charmed by the finance minister than by the king hirnself, and that Fouquet was actually flaunting his wealth and power. Rather than flattering Louis XIV, Fouquet's elaborate party offended the king's vanity. Louis would not admit this to anyone, of course--instead, he found a convenient excuse to rid hirns elf of a man who had inadvertently made hirn feel insecure. Such is the fate, in some form or other, of all those who unbalance the master's sense of self, poke holes in his vanity, or make hirn doubt his pre­eminence. When the evening began, Fouquet was at the top 0/ the world. By the time it had ended, he was at the bottom. Voltaire, 1694-1778 OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW In the early 1600s, the ltalian astronomer and mathematician Galileo found hirnself in a precarious position. He depended on the generosity of great rulers to support his research, and so, like all Renaissance scientists, he would sometimes make gifts of his inventions and discoveries to the leading patrons of the time. Once, for instance, he presented a military compass he had invented to the Duke of Gonzaga. Then he dedicated a book explaining the use of the compass to the Medicis. Both rulers were grateful, and through them Galileo was able to find more students to teach. No matter how great the discovery, however, his patrons usually paid hirn with gifts, not cash. This made for a life of constant insecurity and depen­dence. There must be an easier way, he thought. Galileo hit on a new strategy in 1610, when he discovered the moons of Jupiter. Instead of dividing the discovery among his patrons-giving one the telescope he had used, dedicating a book to another, and so on-as he had done in the past, he decided to focus exclusively on the Medicis. He chose the Medicis for one reason: Shortly after Cosimo I had established the Medici dynasty, in 1540, he had made Jupiter, the mightiest of the gods, the Medici symbol-a symbol of apower that went beyond politics and banking, one linked to ancient Rome and its divinities. Galileo tumed his discovery of Jupiter's moons into a cosmic event LAW 1 3"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"4 LAW 1 honoring the Medicis' greatness. Shortly after the discovery, he announced that \"the bright stars [the moons of Jupiterl offered themselves in the heav­ens\" to his telescope at the same time as Cosimo II's enthronement. He said that the number of the moons-four-harmonized with the number of the Medicis (Cosimo 11 had three brothers) and that the moons orbited Jupiter as these four sons revolved around Cosimo I, the dynasty's founder. More than coincidence, this showed that the heavens themselves reflected the ascendancy of the Medici family. After he dedicated the discovery to the Medicis, Galileo commissioned an emblem representingJupiter sitting on a cloud with the four stars circling about hirn, and presented this to Cosimo 11 as a symbol of his link to the stars. In 1610 Cosimo 11 made Galileo his official court philosopher and mathematician, with a full salary. For a scientist this was the coup of a life­time. The days of begging for patronage were over. Interpretation In one stroke, Galileo gained more with his new strategy than he had in years of begging. The reason is simple: All masters want to appear more brilliant than other people. They do not care about science or empirical truth or the latest inven­tion; they care about their name and their glory. Galileo gave the Medicis infinitely more glory by linking their name with cosmic forces than he had by making them the patrons of some new scientific gadget or discovery. Scientists are not spared the vagaries of court life and patronage. They too must serve masters who hold the purse strings. And their great intellec­tual powers can make the master feel insecure, as if he were only there to supply the funds-an ugly, ignoble job. The producer of a great work wants to feel he is more than just the provider of the financing. He wants to appear creative and powerful, and also more important than the work pro­duced in his name. Instead of insecurity you must give hirn glory. Galileo did not challenge the intellectu� authority of the Medicis with his discov­ery, or make them feel inferior in any way; by literally aligning them with the stars, he made them shine brilliantly among the courts of Italy. He did not outshine the master, he made the master outshine all others. KEYS TO POWER Everyone has insecurities. When you show yourself in the world and dis­play your talents, you naturally stir up all kinds of resentrnent, envy, and other manifestations of insecurity. This is to be expected. You cannot spend your life worrying about the petty feelings of others. With those above you, however, you must take a different approach: When it comes to power, outshining the master is perhaps the worst mi stake of all. Do not fool yourself into thinking that life has changed much since the days of Louis XIV and the Medicis. Those who attain high standing in life are like kings and queens: They want to feel secure in their positions, and"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"superior to those around them in intelligence, wit, and charm. It is a deadly but common misperception to believe that by displaying and vaunting YOUf gifts and talents, you are winning the master's affection. He may feign appreciation, but at his first opportunity he will replace you with someone less intelligent, less attractive, less threatening, just as Louis XIV replaced the sparkling Fouquet with the bland Colbert. And as with Louis, he will not admit the truth, but will find an excuse to rid hirnself of YOUf presence. This Law involves two rules that you must realize. First, you can inad­vertently outshine a master simply by being YOUfself. There are masters who are more insecure than others, monstrously insecUfe; you may natu­rally outshine them by YOUf charm and grace. No one had more natural talents than Astorre Manfredi, prince of Faenza. The most handsome of all the young princes of Italy, he captivated his subjects with his generosity and open spirit. In the year 1500, Cesare Borgia laid siege to Faenza. When the city surrendered, the citizens expected the worst from the cruel Borgia, who, however, decided to spare the town: He simply occupied its fortress, exe­cuted none of its citizens, and allowed Prince Manfredi, eighteen at the time, to remain with his court, in complete freedom. A few weeks later, though, soldiers hauled Astorre Manfredi away to a Roman prison. A year after that, his body was fished out of the River Tiber, a stone tied around his neck. Borgia justified the horrible deed with so me sort of trumped-up charge of treason and conspiracy, but the real problem was that he was notoriously vain and insecure. The young man was outshining hirn without even trying. Given Manfredi's natural talents, the prince's mere presence made Borgia seem less attractive and charis­matic. The lesson is simple: If you cannot help being charming and supe­rior, you must leam to avoid such monsters of vanity. Either that, or find a way to mute your good qualities when in the company of a Cesare Borgia. Second, never imagine that because the master loves you, you can do anything you want. Entire books could be written about favorites who fell out of favor by taking their status for granted, for daring to outshine. In late-sixteenth-century Japan, the favorite of Emperor Hideyoshi was a man called Sen no Rikyu. The premier artist of the tea ceremony, which had be­come an obsession with the nobility, he was one of Hideyoshi's most trusted advisers, had his own apartment in the palace, and was honored throughoutJapan. Yet in 1591, Hideyoshi had hirn arrested and sentenced to death. Rikyu took his own life, instead. The cause for his sudden change of fortune was discovered later: It seems that Rikyu, former peasant and later court favorite, had had a wooden statue made of hirnself wearing san­dals (a sign of nobility) and posing loftily. He had had this statue placed in the most important temple inside the palace gates, in clear sight of the roy­alty who often would pass by. To Hideyoshi this signified that Rikyu had no sense of limits. Presuming that he had the same rights as those of the highest nobility, he had forgotten that his position depended on the em­peror, and had co me to believe that he had earned it on his own. This was LAW 1 5"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"6 LAW 1 an unforgivable miscalculation of his own importance and he paid for it with his life. Remember the following: Never take your position for granted and never let any favors you receive go to your head. Knowing the dangers of outshining your master, you can turn this Law to your advantage. First you must flatter and puff up your master. Overt flattery can be effective but has its limits; it is too direct and obvious, and looks bad to other courtiers. Discreet flattery is much more powerful. If you are more intelligent than your master, for example, seem the opposite: Make hirn appear more intelligent than you. Act naive. Make it seem that you need his expertise. Commit harmless mistakes that will not hurt you in the long run but will give you the chance to ask for his help. Masters adore such requests. A master who cannot bestow on you the gifts of his experi­ence may direct rancor and ill will at you instead. If your ideas are more creative than your master's, ascribe them to hirn, in as public a manner as possible. Make it clear that your advice is merely an echo of his advice. If you surpass your master in wit, it is okay to play the role of the court jester, but do not make hirn appear cold and surly by comparison. To ne down your humor if necessary, and find ways to make hirn seem the dis­penser of amusement and good cheer. If you are naturally more sociable and generous than your master, be careful not to be the cloud that blocks his radiance from others. He must appear as the sun around which every­one revolves, radiating power and brilliance, the center of attention. If you are thrust into the position of entertaining hirn, a display of your limited means may win you his sympathy. Any attempt to impress hirn with your grace and generosity can prove fatal: Learn from Fouquet or pay the price. In all of these cases it is not a weakness to disguise your strengths if in the end they lead to power. By letting others outshine you, you remain in control, instead of being a victim of their insecurity. This will all come in handy the day you decide to rise above your inferior status. If, like Galileo, you can make your master shine even more in the eyes of others, then you are a godsend and you will be instantly promoted. Image: The Stars in the Sky.

If your superior is a falling star, there is nothing to fear from outshining hirn. Do not be merciful-your master had no such scruples in his own cold-blooded climb to the top. Gauge his strength. If he is weak, discreetly hasten his downfall: Outdo, outcharm, outsrnart hirn at key moments. If he is very weak and ready to fall, let nature take its course.

Basilius had no experience whatsoever in govemment and politics-in fact, he was the head of the royal stables-but he had proven his love and gratitude time and again. They had met a few years before, when Michael had been visiting the stables just as a wild horse got loose. Basilius, a young groom from peasant Macedonian stock, had saved Michael's life. The groom's strength and courage had impressed Michael, who immediately raised Basilius from the obscurity of being a horse trainer to the position of head of the stables. He loaded his friend with gifts and favors and they became inseparable. Basil­ius was sent to the finest school in Byzantium, and the cmde peasant be­came a cultured and sophisticated courtier. Now Michael was emperor, and in need of someone loyal. Who could he better trust with the post of chamberlain and chief councillor than a young man who owed hirn everything? Basilius could be trained for the job and Michael loved hirn like a brother. Ignoring the advice of those who recommended the much more qualified Bardas, Michael chose his friend. Basilius leamed weIl and was so on advising the emperor on all matters of state. The only problem seemed to be money-Basilius never had enough. Exposure to the splendor of Byzantine court life made hirn avari­cious for the perks of power. Michael doubled, then tripled his salary, en­nobled hirn, and married hirn off to his own mistress, Eudoxia Ingerina. Keeping such a trusted friend and adviser satisfied was worth any price. But more trouble was to come. Bardas was now head of the army, and Basilius convinced Michael that the man was hopelessly ambitious. Under the illusion that he could control his nephew, Bardas had conspired to put hirn on the throne, and he could conspire again, this time to get rid of Michael and assurne the crown hirnself. Basilius poured poison into Michael's ear until the emperor agreed to have his unde murdered. During a great horse race, Basilius dosed in on Bardas in the crowd and stabbed hirn to death. So on after, Basilius asked that he replace Bardas as head of the army, where he could keep control of the realm and quell rebellion. This was granted. Now Basilius's power and wealth only grew, and a few years later Michael, in financial straits from his own extravagance, asked hirn to pay back some of the money he had borrowed over the years. To Michael's shock and astonishment, Basilius refused, with a look of such impudence To have a good enemy, choose a [riend: He knows where to strike.

Mo ra I: When you see water fl owing uphill, it means that that the emperor suddenly realized his predicament: The former stable boy had more money, more allies in the army and senate, and in the end more power than the emperor hirnself. A few weeks later, after a night of heavy drinking, Michael awoke to find hirnself sUITounded by soldiers. Basilius watched as they stabbed the emperor to death. Then, after pro­claiming hirnself emperor, he rode his horse through the streets of Byzan­tium, brandishing the head of his former benefactor and best friend at the end of a lang pike. Interpretation Michael III staked his future on the sense of gratitude he thought Basilius must feel for hirn. Surely Basilius would serve hirn best; he owed the em­peror his wealth, his education, and his position. Then, once Basilius was in power, anything he needed it was best to give to hirn, strengthening the bonds between the two men. It was only on the fateful day when the em­peror saw that impudent smile on Basilius's face that he realized his deadly mistake. He had created a monster. He had allowed a man to see power up close-a man who then wanted more, who asked for anything and got it, who feit encumbered by the charity he had received and simply did what many people da in such a situation: They forget the favors they have re­ceived and imagine they have eamed their success by their own merits. At Michael's moment ofrealization, he could still have saved his own life, but friendship and love blind every man to their interests. Nobody be­lieves a friend can betray. And Michael went on disbelieving until the day his head ended up on a pike. Lord, protect me from my friends; I can take care of my enemies. Valtaire, 1694-1 778 OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW For several centuries after the fall of the Han Dynasty (A.D. 222), Chinese his­tory followed the same pattern of violent and bloody coups, one after the other. Army men would plot to kill a weak emperor, then would replace hirn on the Dragon Throne with a strong general. The general would start a new dynasty and crown hirnself emperor; to ensure his own survival he would kill offhis fellow generals. A few years later, however, the pattern would resume: New generals would rise up and assassinate hirn or his sons in their turn. To be emperor of China was to be alone, sUITounded by a pack of enemies-it was the least powerful, least secure position in the realm. In A.D. 959, General Chao K'uang-yin became Emperor Sung. He knew the odds, the prob ability that within a year or two he would be mur­dered; how could he break the pattern? Soon after becoming emperor, Sung ordered a banquet to celebrate the new dynasty, and invited the most powerful commanders in the army. Mter they had drunk much wine, he someone is re paying a kindnes.1: AFRICAN FOLK TA /I"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"dismissed the guards and everybody else except the generals, who now feared he would murder them in one fell swoop. Instead, he addressed them: \"The whole day is spent in fear, and I am unhappy both at the table and in my bed. For which one of you does not dream of ascending the throne? I do not doubt your allegiance, but if by some chance your subor­dinates, seeking wealth and position, were to force the emperor's yellow robe upon you in turn, how could you refuse it?\" Drunk and fearing for their lives, the generals proclaimed their innocence and their loyalty. But Sung had other ideas: \"The best way to pass one's days is in peaceful en­joyment of riches and honor. If you are willing to give up your commands, I am ready to provide you with fine estates and beautiful dwellings where you may take your pleasure with singers and girls as your companions.\" The astonished generals realized that instead of a life of anxiety and struggle Sung was offering them riches and security. The next day, all of the generals tendered their resignations, and they retired as nobles to the estates that Sung bestowed on them. In one stroke, Sung turned a pack of \"friendly\" wolves, who would likely have betrayed hirn, into a group of docile lambs, far from all power. Over the next few years Sung continued his campaign to secure his rule. In A.D. 971, King Liu of the Southern Han finally surrendered to him after years of rebellion. To Liu's astonishment, Sung gave hirn a rank in the imperial court and invited hirn to the palace to seal their newfound friend­ship with wine. As King Liu took the glass that Sung offered hirn, he hesi­tated, fearing it contained poison. \"Your subject's crimes certainly merit death,\" he cried out, \"but I beg Your Majesty to spare your subject's life. In­deed I dare not drink this wine.\" Emperor Sung laughed, took the glass from Liu, and swallowed it hirnself. There was no poison. From then on Liu became his �ost trusted and loyal friend. At the time, China had splintered into many smaller kingdoms. When Ch'ien Shu, the king of one of these, was defeated, Sung's ministers ad­vised the emperor to lock this rebel up. They presented documents prov­ing that he was still conspiring to kill Sung. When Ch'ien Shu came to visit the emperor, however, instead of locking hirn up, Sung honored hirn. He also gave hirn a package, which he told the former king to open when he was halfway horne. Ch'ien Shu opened the bundle on his return journey and saw that it contained all the papers documenting his conspiracy. He re­alized that Sung knew of his murderous plans, yet had spared hirn nonethe­less. This generosity won hirn over, and he too became one of Sung's most loyal vassals. Interpretation A Chinese proverb compares friends to the jaws and teeth of a dangerous animal: If you are not careful, you will find them chewing you up. Emperor Sung knew the jaws he was passing between when he assumed the throne: His \"friends\" in the army would chew hirn up like meat, and if he some­how survived, his \"friends\" in the government would have hirn for supper. There are many who think therefore that a wise prince ollght, when he has the chance, to foment astl/tely same enmity, so that hy suppressillg it he will augment his greatness. Princes, and especially new ones, have fO llnd more fäith and more usefulness in those men, wh om at the heginning oftheir power they regarded with slIspidon, than in those they at first con{ided in.

A.D. 55-120 12 LAW 2 Emperor Sung would have no truck with \"friends\" -he bribed his fellow generals with splendid estates and kept them far away. This was a much better way to emasculate them than killing them, which would only have led other generals to seek vengeance. And Sung would have nothing to do with \"friendly\" ministers. More often than not, they would end up drinking his famous cup of poisoned wine. Instead of relying on friends, Sung used his enemies, one after the other, transforming them into far more reliable subjects. While a friend ex­pects more and more favors, and seethes with jealousy, these former ene­mies expected nothing and got everything. A man suddenly spared the guillotine is a gratenIl man indeed, and will go to the ends of the earth for the man who has pardoned hirn. In time, these former enemies became Sung's most trusted friends. And Sung was finally able to break the pattern of coups, violence, and civil war-the Sung Dynasty ruled China for more than three hundred years. In a speech Abraham Lincoln delivered at the height of the Civil War, he referred to the Southerners as fellow human beings who were in erroT. An elderly lady chastised him for not calling them irreconcilable enemies who must be destroyed. \"Why, madam,\" Lincoln replied, \"do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends?\" KEYS TO POWE R It is natural to want to employ your friends when you find yourself in times of need. The world is a harsh place, and your friends soften the harshness. Besides, you know them. Why depend on a stranger when you have a friend at hand? The problem is that you often do not know your friends as weIl as you imagine. Friends often agree on things in order to avoid an argument. They cover up their unpleasant qualities so as to not offend each other. They laugh extra hard at each other's jokes. Since honesty rarely strength­ens friendship, you may never know how a friend truly feels. Friends will say that they love your poetry, adore your music, envy your taste in clothes-maybe they mean it, often they do not. When you decide to hire a friend, you gradually discover the qualities he or she has kept hidden. Strangely enough, it is your act of kindness that unbalances everything. People want to feel they des erve their good for­tune. The receipt of a favor can become oppressive: It means you have been chosen because you are a friend, not necessarily because you are de­serving. There is almost a touch of condescension in the act of hiring friends that secretly afflicts them. The injury will come out slowly: A little more honesty, flashes of resentment and envy here and there, and before you know it your friendship fades. The more favors and gifts you supply to revive the friendship, the less gratitude you receive. Ingratitude has a long and deep history. It has demonstrated its powers"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"for so many centuries, that it is truly amazing that people continue to un­derestimate them. Better to be wary. If you never expect gratitude from a fr iend, you will be pleasantly surprised when they do prove grateful. The problem with using or hiring fr iends is that it will inevitably limit your power. The fr iend is rarely the one who is most able to help you; and in the end, skill and competence are far more important than fr iendly feel­ings. (Michael III had a man right under his no se who would have steered hirn right and kept hirn alive: That man was Bardas.) All working situations require a kind of distance between people. You are trying to work, not make friends; friendliness (real or false) only ob­scures that fact. The key to power, then, is the ability to judge who is best able to further your interests in all situations. Keep fr iends for friendship, but work with the skilIed and competent. Your enemies, on the other hand, are an untapped gold mine that you must learn to exploit. When Talleyrand, Napoleon's foreign minister, de­cided in 1807 that his boss was leading France to ruin, and the time had come to turn against hirn, he understood the dangers of conspiring against the emperor; he needed a partner, a confederate--what friend could he trust in such a project? He chose Joseph Fouche, head of the secret police, his most hated enemy, a man who had even tried to have hirn assassinated. He knew that their former hatred would create an opportunity for an emo­tional reconciliation. He knew that Fouche would expect nothing fr om hirn, and in fact would work to prove that he was worthy of Talleyrand's choice; a person who has something to prove will move mountains for you. Finally, he knew that his relationship with Fouche would be based on mu­tual self-interest, and would not be contaminated by personal feeling. The selection proved perfect; although the conspirators did not succeed in top­pling Napoleon, the union of such powerful but unlikely partners gener­ated much interest in the cause; opposition to the emperor slowly began to spread. And from then on, Talleyrand and Fouche had a fruitful working relationship. Whenever you can, bury the hatchet with an enemy, and make a point of putting hirn in your service. As Lincoln said, you destroy an enemy when you make a friend of hirn. In 1971, during the Vietnam War, Henry Kissinger was the target of an unsuccessful kidnapping attempt, a conspiracy involving, among others, the renowned antiwar activist priests the Berrigan brothers, four more Catholic priests, and four nuns. In private, without informing the Secret Service or the Justice Department, Kissinger arranged a Saturday-morning meeting with three of the alleged kidnappers. Explaining to his guests that he would have most American soldiers out of Vietnam by mid-1972, he completely charmed them. They gave hirn some \"Kidnap Kissinger\" but­tons and one of them remained a fr iend of his for years, visiting hirn on several occasions. This was not just a onetime ploy: Kissinger made a pol­icy of working with those who disagreed with hirn. Colleagues commented that he seemed to get along better with his enemies than with his friends. Without enemies around us, we grow lazy.

Mao Tse-tung saw conflict as key in his approach to power. In 1937 the Japanese invaded China, interrupting the civil war between Mao's Com­munists and their enemy, the Nationalists. Fearing that the Japanese would wipe them out, some Communist leaders advocated leaving the Nationalists to fight the Japanese, and using the time to recuperate. Mao disagreed: The Japanese could not possibly defeat and occupy a vast country like China for long. Once they left, the Communists would have grown rusty if they had been out of combat for several years, and would be ill prepared to reopen their struggle with the Nationalists. To fight a formidable foe like the Japanese, in fact, would be the perfect training for the Communists' ragtag army. Mao's plan was adopted, and it worked: By the time the Japanese finally retreated, the Communists had gained the fighting experience that helped them defeat the Nationalists. Years later, a Japanese visitor tried to apologize to Mao for his coun­try's invasion of China. Mao interrupted, \"Should I not thank you in­stead?\" Without a worthy opponent, he explained, a man or group cannot grow stronger. Mao's strategy of constant conflict has several key components. First, be certain that in the long run you will emerge victorious. Never pick a fight with someone you are not sure you can defeat, as Mao knew the Japanese would be defeated in time. Second, if you have no apparent ene­mies, you must sometimes set up a convenient target, even tuming a friend into an enemy. Mao used this tactic time and again in politics. Third, use such enemies to define your cause more clearly to the public, even framing it as a struggle of good against evil. Mao actually encouraged China's dis­agreements with the Soviet Union and the United States; without clear-cut enemies, he believed, his people would lose any sense of what Chinese Communism meant. A sharply defined enemy is a far stronger argument for your side than all the words you could possibly put together. Never let the presence of enemies upset or distress you-you are far better off with a declared opponent or two than not knowing where your real enemies lie. The man of power welcomes conflict, using enemies to enhance his reputation as a surefooted fighter who can be relied upon in times of uncertainty."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Image : The Jaws of Ingratitude.

(Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658) REVERSAL Although it is generally best not to mix work with friendship, there are times when a friend can be used to greater effect than an enemy. A man of power, for example, often has dirty work that has to be done, but for the sake of appearances it is generally preferable to have other people do it for him; friends often do this the best, since their affection for hirn makes them willing to take chances. Also, if YOUf plans go awry for some reason, you can use a friend as a convenient scapegoat. This \"fall of the favorite\" was a trick often used by kings and sovereigns: They would let their dosest friend at court take the fall for a mistake, since the public would not believe that they would deliberately sacrifice a friend for such a purpose. Of course, after you play that card, you have lost your friend forever. It is best, then, to reserve the scapegoat role for someone who is dose to you but not too elose. Finally, the problem ab out working with friends is that it confuses the boundaries and distances that working requires. But if both partners in the arrangement understand the dangers involved, a friend often can be em­ployed to great effect. You must never let YOUf guard down in such a ven­ture, however; always be on the lookout for any signs of emotional disturbance such as envy and ingratitude. Nothing is stable in the realm of power, and even the dosest of friends can be transformed into the worst of enemies.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW Over several weeks, Ninon de Lenclos, the most infamous courtesan of seventeenth-century France, listened patiently as the Marquis de Sevigne explained his struggles in pursuing a heautiful hut difficult young countess. Ninon was sixty-two at the time, and more than experienced in matters of love; the marquis was a lad of twenty-two, handsome, dashing, hut hope­lessly inexperienced in romance. At first Ninon was amused to hear the marquis talk ahout his mistakes, hut finally she had had enough. Unahle to hear ineptitude in any realm, least of all in seducing a woman, she decided to take the young man under her wing. First, hE\\ had to und erstand that this was war, and that the heautiful countess was a Citadel to which he had to lay siege as carefully as any general. Every step had to he planned and exe­cuted with the utmost attention to detail and nuance. Instructing the marquis to start over, Ninon told him to approach the countess with a hit of distance, an air of nonchalance. The next time the two were alone together, she said, he would confide in the countess as would a friend hut nota potential lover. This was to throw her offthe scent. The countess was no longer to take his interest in her for granted-perhaps he was only interested in friendship. Ninon planned ahead. Once the countess was confused, it would he time to make her jealous. At the next encounter, at a major fete in Paris, the marquis would show up with a heautiful young woman at his side. This heautiful young woman had equally heautiful friends, so that wherever the countess would now see the marquis, he would he surrounded hy the most stunning young women in Paris. Not only would the countess he seething with jealousy, she would come to see the marquis as someone who was de­sired hy others. It was hard far Ninon to make the marquis understand, hut she patiently explained that a woman who is interested in a man wants to see that other women are interested in him, to�. Not only does that give him instant value, it makes it all the more satisfying to snatch him from their clutches. Once the countess was jealous hut intrigued, it would he time to he­guile her. On Ninon's instructions, the marquis would fail to show up at af­fairs where the countess expected to see him. Then, suddenly, he would appear at salons he had never frequented hefore, hut that the countess at-LAW 3 17"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"18 LAW 3 tended often. She would be unable to predict his moves. All of this would push her into the state of emotional confusion that is aprerequisite for suc­cessful seduction. These moves were executed, and took several weeks. Ninon moni­tored the marquis's progress: Through her network of spies, she heard how the countess would laugh a litde harder at his witticisms, listen more closely to his stories. She heard that the countess was suddenly asking ques­tions about hirn. Her friends told her that at social affairs the countess would often look up at the marquis, following his steps. Ninon feJt certain that the young woman was falling under his spell. It was a matter of weeks now, maybe a month or two, but if all went smoothly, the citadel would fall. A few days later the marquis was at the countess's horne. They were alone. Suddenly he was a different man: This time acting on his own im­pulse, rather than following Ninon's instructions, he took the countess's hands and told her he was in love with her. The young woman seemed confused, areaction he did not expect. She became polite, then excused herself. For the rest of the evening she avoided his eyes, was not there to say good-night to hirn. The next few times he visited he was told she was not at horne. When she finally admitted hirn again, the two feIt awkward and uncomfortable with each other. The spell was broken. Interpretation Ninon de Lenclos knew everything about the art of love. The greatest writ­ers, thinkers, and politicians of the time had been her lovers-men like La Rochefoucauld, Moliere, and Richelieu. Seduction was agame to her, to be practiced with skill. As she got older, and her reputation grew, the most im­portant families in France would send their sons to her to be instructed in matters oflove. Ninon knew that men and women are very different, but when it comes to seduction they feel the same: Deep down inside, they often sense when they are being seduced, but they give in because they enjoy the feel­ing of being led along. It is a pleasure to let go, and to allow the other per­son to detour you into a strange country. Everything in seduction, however, depends on suggestion. You cannot announce yOUf intentions or reveal them direcdy in words. Instead you must throw your targets off the scent. To surrender to YOUf guidance they must be appropriately confused. You have to scramble your signals-appear interested in another man or woman (the decoy), then hint at being interested in the target, then feign indifference, on and on. Such patterns not only confuse, they excite. Imagine this story from the countess's perspective: After a few of the marquis's moves, she sensed the marquis was playing some sort of game, but the game delighted her. She did not know where he was leading her, but so much the better. His moves intrigued her, each of them keeping her waiting for the next one--she even enjoyed her jealousy and confusion, for sometimes any emotion is better than the boredom of security. Perhaps the marquis had uIterior motives; most men do. But she was willing to wait and"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"see, and probably if she had been made to wait long enough, what he was up to would not have mattered. The moment the marquis uttered that fatal word \"love,\" however, all was changed. This was no longer agame with moves, it was an artless show of passion. His intention was revealed: He was seducing her. This put everything he had done in a new light. All that before had been charming now seemed ugly and conniving; the countess feit embarrassed \"and used. A door closed that would never open again.

The issues of the day were the unification of the many states (including Prussia) into which Germany was then divided, and a war against Austria, the powerful neighbor to the south that hoped to keep the Germans weak and at odds, even threatening to intervene if they tried to unite. Prince William, next in line to be Prussia's king, was in favor of going to war, and the parliament rallied to the cause, prepared to back any mobilization of troops. The only ones to oppose war were the present king, Frederick William IV, and his ministers, who preferred to appease the powerful Austrians. Throughout his career, Bismarck had been a loyal, even passionate supporter of Prussian might and power. He dreamed of German unifica­tion, of going to war against Austria and humiliating the country that for so long had kept Germany divided. A former soldier, he saw warf are as a glo­rious business. This, after all, was the man who years later would say, \"The great questions of the time will be decided, not by speeches and resolutions, but by iron and blood.\" Passionate patriot and lover of military glory, Bismarck nevertheless gave a speech in parliament at the height of the war fever that astonished all who heard it. \"Woe unto the statesman,\" he said, \"who makes war with­out a reason that will still be valid when the war is over! After the war, you will all look differently at these questions. Will you then have the courage to turn to the peasant contemplating the ashes of his farm, to the man who has been crippled, to the father who has lost his children?\" Not only did Bismarck go on to talk of the madness of this war, but, strangest of all, he praised Austria and defended her actions. This went against everything he had stood for. The consequences were immediate. Bismarck was against the war-what could this possibly mean? Other deputies were confused, and several of them changed their votes. Eventually the king and his minis­ters won out, and war was averted. A few weeks after Bismarck's infamous speech, the king, grateful that LAW 3 19"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"20 LAW 3 he had spoken for peace, made hirn a cabinet minister. A few years later he became the Prussian premier. In this role he eventuaIly led his country and a peace-loving king into a war against Austria, crushing the former empire and establishing a mighty German state, with Prussia at its head. Interpretation At the time of his speech in 1850, Bismarck made several calculations. First, he sensed that the Prussian military, which had not kept pace with other European armies, was unready for war-that Austria, in fact, might very weIl win, a disastrous result for the future. Second, if the war were lost and Bismarck had supported it, his career would be gravely jeopardized. The king and his conservative ministers wanted peace; Bismarck wanted power. The answer was to throw people off the scent by supporting a cause he detested, saying things he would laugh at if said by another. A whole country was fooled. It was because of Bismarck's speech that the king made hirn a minister, a position from which he quickly rose to be prime minister, attaining the power to strengthen the Prussian military and accomplish what he had wanted all along: the humiliation of Austria and the unifica­tion of Germany under Prussia's leadership. Bismarck was certainly one of the cleverest statesman who ever lived, a master of strategy and deception. No one suspected what he was up to in this case. Had he announced his real intentions, arguing that it was better to wait now and fight later, he would not have won the argument, since most Prussians wanted war at that moment and mistakenly believed that their army was superior to the Austrians. Had he played up to the king, asking to be made a minister in exchange for supporting peace, he would not have succeeded either: The king would have distrusted his ambition and doubted his sincerity. By being completely insincere and sending misleading signals, how­ever, he deceived everyone, concealed his purpose, and attained every­thing he wanted. Such is the power of hiding your intentions. KEYS TO POWER Most people are open books. They say what they feel, blurt out their opin­ions at every opportunity, and constantly reveal their plans and intentions. They do this for several reasons. First, it is easy and natural to always want to talk about one's feelings and plans for the future. It takes effort to control your tongue and monitor what you reveal. Second, many believe that by being honest and open they are winning people's hearts and showing their good nature.They are greatly deluded. Honesty is actually a blunt instru­ment, which bloodies more than it cuts. Your honesty is likely to offend people; it is much more prudent to tailor your words, telling people what they want to hear rather than the coarse and ugly truth of what you feel or think. More important, by being unabashedly open you make yourself so predictable and familiar that it is almost impossible to respect or fear you, and power will not accrue to a person who cannot inspire such emotions."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"If you yearn for power, quickly lay honesty aside, and train yourself in the art of concealing your intentions. Master the art and you will always have the upper hand. Basic to an ability to conceal one's intentions is a simple truth about human nature: Our first instinct is to always trust ap­pearances. We cannot go around doubting the reality of what we see and hear-constantly imagining that appearances concealed something else would exhaust and terrify uso This fact makes it relatively easy to conceal one's intentions. Simply dangle an object you seem to desire, a goal you seem to aim for, in front of people's eyes and they will take the appearance for reality. Once their eyes foeus on the decoy, they will fail to notice what you are really up to. In seduction, set up conflictin�signals, such as desire and indifference, and you not only throw them off the scent, you inflame their desire to possess you. A tactic that is often effective in setting up a red herring is to appear to support an idea or cause that is actually contrary to your own sentiments. (Bismarck used this to great effect in his speech in 1850.) Most people will believe you have experienced a change of heart, since it is so unusual to play so lightly with something as emotional as one's opinions and values. The same applies for any decoyed object of desire: Seem to want some­thing in which you are actually not at all interested and your enemies will be throWll off the scent, making all kinds of errors in their calculations. During the War of the Spanish Succession in 1711, the Duke of Marl­borough, head of the English army, wanted to destroy a key French fort, because it proteeted a vital thoroughfare into Franee. Yet he knew that if he destroyed it, the French would realize what he wanted-to advance down that road. Instead, then, he merely captured the fort, and garrisoned it with some of his troops, making it appear as if he wanted it for some purpose of his OWll. The French attaeked the fort and the duke let them reeapture it. Once they had it back, though, they destroyed it, figuring that the duke had wanted it for some important reason. Now that the fort was gone, the road was unprotected, and Marlborough could easily march into France. Use this tactie in the following manner: Hide your intentions not by closing up (with the risk of appearing secretive, and making people suspi­cious) but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals-just not yOUf real ones. You will kill three birds with one stone: You appear friendly, open, and trusting; you conceal YOUf intentions; and you send YOUf rivals on time-consuming wild-goose ehases. Another powerful tool in throwing people off the scent is false sineer­ity. People easily mistake sincerity for honesty. Remember-their first in­stinet is to trust appearances, and sinee they value honesty and want to believe in the honesty of those around them, they will rarely doubt you or see through YOUf aet. Seeming to believe what you say gives your words great weight. This is how Iago deceived and destroyed Othello: Given the depth of his emotions, the apparent sincerity of his coneems about Desde­mona's supposed infidelity, how eould Othello distrust hirn?

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I In 1910, a Mr. Sam Geezil of Chicago sold his warehouse business for close to $1 million. He settled down to semiretirement and the managing of his many properties, but deep inside he itched for the old days of deal-making. One day a young man namedJoseph Weil visited his office, wanting to buy an apartment he had up for sale. Geezil explained the terms: The price was $8,000, but he only required a down payment of $2,000. Weil said he would sleep on it, but he came back the following day and offered to pay the full $8,000 in cash, if Geezil could wait a couple of days, until a deal Weil was working on came through. Even in semiretirement, a clever busi­nessman like Geezil was curious as to how Weil would be able to come up with so much cash (roughly $150,000 today) so quickly. Weil seemed reluc­tant to say, and quickly changed the subject, but Geezil was persistent. Fi­nally, after assurances of confidentiality, Weil told Geezil the following story. Weil's uncle was the secretary to a coterie of multimillionaire fi­nanciers. These wealthy gentlemen had purchased a hunting lodge in Michigan ten years ago, at a cheap price. They had not used the lodge for a few years, so they had decided to seIl it and had asked Weil's uncle to get whatever he could for it. For reasons-good reasons-of his own, the uncle had been nursing a grudge against the millionaires for years; this was his chance to get back at them. He would seIl the property for $35,000 to a set­up man (whom it was Weil's job to find). The financiers were too wealthy to worry about this low price. The set-up man would then turn around and seIl the property again for its real price, around $155,000. The uncle, Weil, and the third man would split the profits from this second sale. It was all legal and for a good cause-the uncle's just retribution. Geezil had heard enough: He wanted to be the set-up buyer. Weil was reluctant to involve hirn, but Geezil would not back down: The idea of a large profit, plus a little adventure, had hirn champing at the bit. Weil ex­plained that Geezil would have to put up the $35,000 in cash to bring the deal off. Geezil, a millionaire, said he could get the money with a snap of his fingers. Weil finally relented and agreed to arrange a meeting between the uncle, Geezil, and the financiers, in the town of Galesburg, Illinois. On the train ride to Galesburg, Geezil met the uncle-an impressive .1 1 \"111 r \"I\"<: OF ISHAEI..

And they demolished the pillar of Ba'al and demolished the house of Ba 'al, and made it a latrine to this day. Thus Jehu wiped out Ba'al from Israel. OLD TESTAMENT, 2 KINGS 10:18-28 24 LAW 3 man, with whom he avidly discussed business, Weil also brought along a companion, a somewhat paunchy man named George Gross. Weil ex­plained to Geezil that he hirnself was a boxing trainer, that Gross was one of the promising prizefighters he trained, and that he had asked Gross to come along to make sure the fighter stayed in shape. For a promising fighter, Gross was unimpressive looking-he had gray hair and a beer belly-but Geezil was so excited about the deal that he didn't really think ab out the man's flabby appearance. Once in Galesburg, Weil and his uncle went to fetch the financiers while Geezil waited in a hotel room with Gross, who promptly put on his boxing trunks. As Geezil half watched, Gross began to shadowbox. Dis­tracted as he was, Geezil ignored how badly the boxer wheezed after a few minutes of exercise, although his style seemed real enough. An hour later, Weil and his uncle reappeared with the financiers, an impressive, intimidat­ing group of men, all wearing fancy suits. The meeting went well and the fi­nanciers agreed to sell the lodge to Geezil, who had already had the $35,000 wired to a local bank. This minor business now settled, the financiers sat back in their chairs and began to banter about high finance, throwing out the name 'j. P. Mor­gan\" as if they knew the man. Finally one of them noticed the boxer in the corner of the room. Weil explained what he was doing there. The financier countered that he too had a boxer in his entourage, whom he named. Weil laughed brazenly and exclaimed that his man could easily knock out their man. Conversation escalated into argument. In the heat of passion, Weil challenged the men to a bet. The financiers eagerly agreed and left to get their man ready for a fight the next day. As soon as they had left, the uncle yelled at Weil, right in front of Geezil: They did not have enough money to bet with, and once the fi­nanciers discovered this, the uncle would be fired. Weil apologized for get­ting hirn in this mess, but he had a plan: He knew the other boxer well, and with a little bribe, they could fix the fight. But where would the money come from for the bet? the uncle replied. Without it they were as good as dead. Finally Geezil had heard enough. Unwilling to jeopardize his deal with any ill will, he offered his own $35,000 cash for part of the bet. Even if he lost that, he would wire for more money and still make a profit on the sale of the lodge. The uncle and nephew thanked hirn. With their own $15,000 and Geezil's 1$35,000 they would manage to have enough for the bet. That evening, as Geezil watched the two boxers rehearse the fix in the hotel room, his mind reeled at the killing he was going to make from both the boxing match and the sale of the lodge. The fight took place in a gym the next day. Weil handled the cash, which was placed for security in a locked box. Everything was pro­ceeding as planned in the hotel room. The financiers were looking glum at how badly their fighter was doing, and Geezil was dreaming about the easy money he was about to make. Then, suddenly, a wild swing by the fi­nancier's fighter hit Gross hard in the face, knocking hirn down. When he hit the canvas, blood spurted from his mouth. He coughed, then lay still."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"One of the financiers, a fo rmer doctor, checked his pulse; he was dead. The millionaires panicked: Everyone had to get out before the police arrived­they could all be charged with murder. Te rrified, Geezil hightailed it out of the gym and back to Chicago, leav­ing behind his $35,000 which he was only too glad to forget, for it seemed a small price to pay to avoid being implicated in a crime. He never wanted to see Weil or any of the others again. After Geezil scurried out, Gross stood up, under his own steam. The blood that had spurted from his mouth came from a ball filled with chicken blood and hot water that he had hidden in his cheek. The whole affair had been masterminded by Weil, better known as \"the Ye llow Kid,\" one of the most creative con artists in history. Weil split the $35,000 with the fi­nanciers and the boxers (all fe llow con artists)-a nice little profit for a few days' work.

He knew the boxing-match scam would be the perfect ruse to separate Geezil from his money quickly and definitively. But he also knew that if he had begun by trying to interest Geezil in the boxing match, he would have failed miserably. He had to conceal his intentions and switch attention, create a smoke screen-in this case the sale of the lodge. On the train ride and in the hotel room Geezil's mind had been com­pletely occupied with the pending deal, the easy money, the chance to hobnob with wealthy men. He had failed to notice that Gross was out of shape and middle-aged at best. Such is the distracting power of a smoke screen. Engrossed in the business deal, Geezil's attention was easily di­verted to the boxing match, but only at a point when it was already too late for hirn to notice the details that would have given Gross away. The match, after all, now depended on a bribe rather than on the boxer's physical condi­tion. And Geezil was so distracted at the end by the illusion of the boxer's death that he completely fo rgot about his money. Learn fr om the Ye llow Kid: The familiar, inconspicuous front is the perfect smoke screen. Approach your mark with an idea that seems ordi­nary enough-a business deal, financial intrigue.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 11 In the mid-1920s, the powerful warlords of Ethiopia were coming to the re­alization that a young man of the nobility named Haile Selassie, also known as Ras Ta fari, was outcompeting them all and nearing the point where he could prodaim hirnself their leader, unifying the country for the first time in decades. Most of his rivals could not understand how this wispy, , quiet, mild-mannered man had been able to take control. Ye t in LAW 3 25"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"26 LAW 3 1927, Selassie was able to summon the warlords, one at a time, to come to Addis Ababa to declare their loyalty and recognize bim as leader. Some hurried, some hesitated, but only one, Dejazmach Balcha of Sidamo, dared defy Selassie totally. A blustery man, Balcha was a great warrior, and he considered the new leader weak and unworthy. He point­edly stayed away from the capital. Finally Selassie, in his gentle but stern way, commanded Balcha to come. The warlord decided to obey, but in doing so he would turn the tables on this pretender to the Ethiopian throne: He would come to Addis Ababa at his own speed, and with an army of 10,000 men, a fo rce large enough to defend hirnself, perhaps even start a civil war. Stationing this fo rmidable fo rce in a valley three rniles from the capital, he waited, as a king would. Selassie would have to come to bim. Selassie did indeed send emissaries, asking Balcha to attend an after­noon banquet in his honor. But Balcha, no fo ol, knew history-he knew that previous kings and lords of Ethiopia had used banquets as a trap. Once he was there and full of drink, Selassie would have hirn arrested or murdered. To signal his understanding of the situation, he agreed to come to the banquet, but only if he could bring his personal bodyguard-600 of bis best soldiers, all armed and ready to defend hirn and themselves. To Balcha's surprise, Selassie answered with the utmost politeness that he would be honored to play host to such warriors. On the way to the banquet, Balcha warned his soldiers not to get drunk and to be on their guard. When they arrived at the palace, Selassie was his charrning best. He deferred to Balcha, treated hirn as if he desper­ately needed his approval and cooperation. But Balcha refused to be charmed, and he warned Selassie that if he did not return to his camp by nightfall, his army had orders to attack the capital. Selassie reacted as if hurt by his mistrust. Over the meal, when it came time for the traditional singing of songs in honor of Ethiopia's leaders, he made a point of allowing only songs honoring the warlord of Sidamo. It seemed to Balcha that Se­lassie was scared, intimidated by this great warrior who could not be out­witted. Sensing the change, Balcha believed that he would be the one to call the shots in the days to come. At the end of the afternoon, Balcha and his soldiers began their march back to camp arnidst cheers and gun salutes. Looking back to the capital over his shoulder, he planned his strategy-how his own soldiers would march through the capital in triumph within weeks, and Selassie would be put in his place, his place being either prison or death. When Balcha came in sight of bis camp, however, he saw that something was terribly wrong. Where before there had been colorful tents stretching as far as the eye could see, now there was nothing, only smoke fr om doused fires. What devil's magie was this? A witness told Balcha what had happened. During the banquet, a large army, commanded by an ally of Selassie's, had stolen up on Balcha's en­campment by a side route he had not seen. This army had not come to fight, however: Knowing that Balcha would}lave heard a noisy battle and /"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"hurried back with his 600-man bodyguard, Selassie had ,armed his own troops with baskets of gold and cash. They had sUITounded Balcha's army and proceeded to purchase every last one of their weapons. Those who re­fused were easily intimidated. Within a few hours, Balcha's entire force had been disarmed and scattered in all directions. Realizing his danger, Balcha decided to march south with his 600 sol­diers to regroup, but the same army that had disarmed his soldiers blocked his way. The other way out was to march on the capital, but Selas sie had set a large army to defend it. Like a chess player, he had predicted Balcha's moves, and had checkrnated hirn. For the first time in his life, Balcha sur­rendered. To repent his sins of pride and ambition, he agreed to enter a monastery. Interpretation Throughout Selassie's long reign, no one could quite figure hirn out. Ethiopians like their leaders fierce, but Selassie, who wore the front of a gentle, peace-loving man, lasted longer than any of them. Never angry or impatient, he lured his victims with sweet smiles, lulling them with charm and obsequiousness before he attacked. In the case of Balcha, Selassie played on the man's wariness, his suspicion that the banquet was a trap-­which in fact it was, but not the one he expected. Selassie's way of allaying Balcha's fears-letting him bring his bodyguard to the banquet, giving hirn top billing there, making him feel in control--created a thick smoke screen, concealing the real action three miles away. Remember: The paranoid and wary are often the easiest to deceive. Win their trust in one area and you have a smoke screen that blinds their view in another, letting you creep up and level them with a devastating blow. A helpful or apparently honest ge sture, or one that implies the other person's superiority-these are perfect diversionary devices. Properly set up, the smoke screen is a weapon of great power. It en­abled the gentle Selassie to totally destroy his enemy, without firing a single bullet. Do not underestimate the power of Ta fari. He creeps like a mouse hut he has jaws like a lion. B([ll'!t([ ur Sidaillu 's last wards bejiJre entering the rnanastery KEYS TO POWER If you believe that deceivers are colorful folk who mislead with elaborate lies and tall tales, you are greatly mistaken. The best deceivers utilize a bland and inconspicuous front that calls no attention to themselves. They know that extravagant words and ge stures immediately raise suspicion. In­stead, they envelop their mark in the familiar, the banal, the harmless. In Yellow Kid Weil's dealings with Sam Geezil, the familiar was a business deal. In the Ethiopian case, it was Selassie's misleading obsequiousness­exactly what -Balcha would have expected from a weaker warlord. LAW 3 27"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"28 LAW 3 On ce you have lulled your suckers' attention with the familiar, they will not notice the deception being perpetrated behind their backs. This derives from a simple truth: people can only focus on one thing at a time. It is really too difficult for them to imagine that the bland and harmless per­son they are dealing with is simultaneously setting up something else. The grayer and more uniform the smoke in your smoke screen, the better it conceals your intentions. In the decoy and red herring devices discussed in Part I, you actively distract people; in the smoke screen, you lull your vic­tims, drawing them into your web. Because it is so hypnotic, this is often the best way of concealing your intentions. The simplest form of smoke screen is facial expression. Behind abland, unreadable exterior, all sorts of mayhem can be planned, without detection. This is a weapon that the most powerful men in history have learned to per­fect. It was said that no one could read Franklin D. Roosevelt's face. Baron James Rothschild made a lifelong practice of disguising his real thoughts be­hind bland smiles and nondescript looks. Stendhal wrote of Talleyrand, \"Never was a face less of a barometer.\" Henry Kissinger would bore his op­ponents around the negotiating table to tears with his monotonous voice, his blank look, his endless recitations of details; then, as their eyes glazed over, he would suddenly hit them with a list of bold terms. Caught off­guard, they would be easily intimidated. As one poker manual explains it, \"While playing his hand, the good player is seldom an actor. Instead he practices abland behavior that minimizes readable patterns, frustrates and confuses opponents, permits greater concentration.\" An adaptable concept, the smoke screen can be practiced on a num­ber of levels, all playing on the psychological principles of distraction and misdirection. On e of the most effective smoke screens is the noble gesture. People want to believe apparently noble gestures are genuine, for the belief is pleasant. They rarely notice how deceptive these gestures can be. The art dealer Joseph Duveen was once confronted with a terrible prob­lem. The millionaires who had paid so dearly for Duveen's paintings were running out of wall space, and with inheritance taxes getting ever higher, it seemed unlikely that they would keep buying. The solution was the National Gallery of Art in Wa shington, D.C., which Duveen helped create in 1937 by getting Andrew Mellon to donate his collection to it. The National Gallery was the perfect front for Duveen. In one gesture, his clients avoided taxes, cleared wall space for new purchases, and reduced the number of paintings on the market, maintaining the upward pressure on their prices. All this while the donors created the appearance of being public benefactors. Another effective smoke screen is the pattern, the establishment of a se­ries of actions that seduce the victim into believing you will continue in the same way. The pattern plays on the psychology of anticipation: Ou r behav­ior conforms to patterns, or so we like to think. In 1878 the American robber baronJay Gould created a company that began to threaten the monopoly of the telegraph company We stern Union. The directors of We stern Union decided to buy Gould's company up-"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"they had to spend a hefty sum, but they figured they had managed to rid themselves of an irritating competitor. A few months later, though, Gould was it at again, complaining he had been treated unfairly. He started up a second company to compete with Western Union and its new acquisition. The same thing happened again: Western Union bought hirn out to shut hirn up. Soon the pattern began for the third time, but now Gould went for the jugular: He suddenly staged a bloody takeover struggle and managed to gain complete control of Western Union. He had established a pattern that had tricked the company's directors into thinking his goal was to be bought out at a handsome rate. Once they paid hirn off, they relaxed and fa iled to notice that he was actually playing for higher stakes. The pattern is powerful in that it deceives the other person into expecting the opposite of what you are really doing. Another psychological weakness on which to construct a smoke screen is the tendency to mistake appearances for reality-the fe eling that if some­one seems to belong to your group, their belonging must be real. This habit makes the seamless blend a very effective fr ont. The trick is simple: Yo u sim­ply blend in with those around you. The better you blend, the less suspi­cious you become. During the Cold War of the 1950s and '60s, as is now notorious, a slew of British civil servants passed secrets to the Soviets. They went undetected for years because they were apparently decent chaps, had gone to all the right schools, and fit the old-boy network perfectly. Blend­ing in is the perfect smoke screen for spying. The better you do it, the bet­ter you can conceal your intentions. Remember: It takes patience and humility to dull your brilliant colors, to put on the mask of the inconspicuous. Do not despair at having to wear such a bland mask-it is often your unreadability that draws people to you and makes you appear a person of power. Image: A Sheep's Skin.

Everyone knows you practic e deception; persis t in playing naive and you run the risk of seeming the rankest hy pocrite, which will severely limit your room to maneuver. In such cases it is better to own up, to appear the honest rogue, or, better, the repentant rogue. Not only will you be admired for your frankness, but, most wonderful and strange of all, you will be able to continue your stratagems. As P. T. Barnum, the nineteenth-century king of humbuggery, grew older, he learned to embrace his reputation as a grand deceiver. At one point he organized a buffalo hunt in New Jersey, complete with Indians and a few imported buffalo. He publicized the hunt as genuine, but it came off as so completely fake that the crowd, instead of getting angry and as k­ing for their money back, was greatly amused. They knew Barnum pulled tricks all the time; that was the secret of his success, and they loved him for it. Learning a lesson from this affair, Barnum stopped conc ealing all of his devices, even revealing his deceptions in a tell-all autobiography. As Kierkegaard wrote, \"The world wants to be deceived.\" Finally, although it is wiser to divert attention from your purposes by presenting abland, familiar exterior, there are times when the colorful, cons picuous gesture is the right diversionary tactic . The great charlatan mountebanks of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe us ed humor and entertainment to deceive their audiences . Dazzled by a great show, the public would not notice the charlatans' real intentions. Thus the star charla­tan himself would appear in town in a night-black coac h drawn by black horses . Clowns, tightrope walkers, and star entertainers would accompany him, pulling people in to his demonstrations of elixirs and quack potions. The charlatan made entertainment seem like the business of the day; the business of the day was ac tually the sale of the elixirs and quack potions. Spectacle and entertainment, clearly, are excellent devices to conc eal your intentions, but they cannot be us ed indefinitely. The public grows tired and suspic ious, and eventually catc hes on to the trick. And indeed the charlatans had to move quickly from town to town, before word spread that the potions were us eless and the entertainment a trick.

In the first half of the fifth century B.C. he won many impor­tant battles, saving the city from calamity time and time again. Because he spent most ofhis time on the battlefield, few Romans knew him personally, making him something of a legendary figure. In 454 B.C., Coriolanus decided it was time to exploit his reputation and enter politics. He stood for election to the high rank of consul. Candi­dates for this position traditionally made a public address early in the race, and when Coriolanus came before the people, he began by displaying the dozens of scars he had accumulated over seventeen years of fighting for Rome. Few in the crowd really heard the lengthy speech that followed; those scars, proof of his valor and patriotism, moved the people to tears. Coriolanus's election seemed certain. When the polling day arrived, however, Coriolanus made an entry into the forum escorted by the entire senate and by the city's patricians, the aristocracy. The common people who saw this were disturbed by such a blustering show of confidence on election day. And then Coriolanus spoke again, mostly addressing the wealthy citi­zens who had accompanied him. His words were arrogant and insolent. Claiming certain victory in the vote, he boasted of his battlefield exploits, made sour jokes that appealed only to the patricians, voiced angry accusa­tions against his opponents, and speculated on the riches he would bring to Rome. This time the people listened: They had not realized that this leg­endary soldier was also a common braggart. News of Coriolanus's second speech spread quickly through Rome, and the people turned out in great numbers to make sure he was not elected. Defeated, Coriolanus returned to the battlefield, bitter and vowing revenge on the common folk who had voted against him. Same weeks later a large shipment of grain arrived in Rome. The senate was ready to distrib­ute this food to the people, for free, but just as they were preparing to vote on the question Coriolanus appeared on the scene and took the senate floor. The distribution, he argued, would have a harmful effect on the city as a whole. Several senators appeared won over, and the vote on the distri­bution fell into doubt. Coriolanus did not stop there: He went on to con­demn the concept of democracy itself. He advocated getting rid of the people's representatives-the tribunes-and turning over the governing of the city to the patricians. When word of Coriolanus's latest speech reached the people, their anger knew no bounds. The tribunes were sent to the senate to demand that Coriolanus appear before them. He refused. Riots broke out all over the city. The senate, fearing the people's wrath, finally voted in favor of the grain distribution. The tribunes were appeased, but the people still de­manded that Coriolanus speak to them and apologize. If he repented, and agreed to keep his opinions to himself, he would be allowed to return to the battlefield. Coriolanus did appear one last time before the people, who listened to"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"hirn in rapt silence. He started slowly and softly, but as the speech went on, he became more and more blunt. Yet again he hurled insults! His tone was arrogant, his expression disdainful. The more he spoke, the angrier the people became. Finally they shouted hirn down and silenced hirn. The tribunes conferred, condemned Coriolanus to death, and ordered the magistrates to take hirn at once to the top of the Tarpeian rock and throw hirn over. The delighted crowd seconded the decision. The patri­cians, however, managed to intervene, and the sentence was commuted to a lifelong banishment. When the people found out that Rome's great mili­tary hero would never return to the city, they celebrated in the streets. In fact no one had ever seen such a celebration, not even after the defeat of a foreign enemy. Interpretation Before his entrance into politics, the name of Coriolanus evoked awe. His battlefield accomplishments showed hirn as a man of great brav­ery. Since the citizens knew little about hirn, all kinds of legends became at­tached to his name. The moment he appeared before the Roman citizens, however, and spoke his mind, all that grandeur and mystery vanished. He bragged and blustered like a common soldier. He insulted and slandered people, as if he felt threatened and insecure. Suddenly he was not at all what the people had imagined. The discrepancy between the legend and the reality proved immensely disappointing to those who wanted to be­lieve in their hero. The more Coriolanus said, the less powerful he ap­peared-a person who cannot control his words shows that he cannot control hirnself, and is unworthy of respect. Had Coriolanus said less, the people would never have had cause to be offended by hirn, would never have known his true feelings. He would have maintained his powerful aura, would certainly have been elected con­sul, and would have been able to accomplish his antidemocratic goals. But the human tongue is a beast that few can master. It strains constantly to break out of its cage, and if it is not tamed, it will run wild and cause you grief. Power cannot accrue to those who squander their treasure of words.

I,eonardo da Vinci, 1452-1519 OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW In the court of Louis XIV, nobles and ministers would spend days and nights debating issues of state.

SIR WAU'ER RALE.IGH, 1554-1618 34 LAW 4 everyone would argue some more: How should the issues be phrased? What would appeal to Louis, what would annoy him? At what time of day should the representatives approach him, and in what part of the Ve rsailles palace? What expression should they have on their faces? Finally, after all this was settled, the fatend moment would finally ar­rive. The two men would approach Louis-always a delicate matter-and when they finally had his ear, they would talk about the issue at hand, spelling out the options in detail. Louis would listen in silence, a most enigmatic look on his face. Fi­nally, when each had finished his presentation and had asked for the king's opinion, he would look at them both and say, \"I shall see.\" Then he would walk away. The ministers and courtiers would never hear another word on this subject from the king-they would simply see the result, weeks later, when he would come to a decision and act. He would never bother to consult them on the matter again. Interpretation Louis XIV was a man of very few words. His most famous remark is \"L 'Uat, c'est moi\" (\"I am the state\"); nothing could be more pithy yet more eloquent. His infamous \"I shall see\" was one of several extremely short phrases that he would apply to all manner of requests. Louis was not always this way; as a young man he was known for talk­ing at length, delighting in his own eloquence. His later tacitumity was self­imposed, an act, a mask he used to keep everybody below him off-balance. No one knew exactly where he stood, or could predict bis reactions. No one could try to deceive him by saying what they thought he wanted to hear, because no one knew what he wanted to hear. As they talked on and on to the silent Louis, they revealed more and more about themselves, in­formation he would later use against them to great effect. In the end, Louis's silence kept those around him terrified and under his thumb. It was one of the foundations of his power. As Saint-Simon wrote, \"No one knew as weIl as he how to seIl his words, his smile, even his glances. Everything in him was valuable because he created differences, and his majesty was enhanced by the sparseness of his words.\" It is even more damagingfor a minister to say foolish things than to do them. Cardinal de Retz, 1613-1679 KEYS TO POWER Power is in many ways agame of appearances, and when you say less than necessary, you inevitably appear greater and more powerful than you are.

Saying less than necessary is not for kings and statesmen only. In most areas of life, the less you say, the more profound and mysterious you ap­pear. As a young man, the artist Andy Warhol had the revelation that it was generally impossible to get people to do what you wanted them to do by talking to them. They would turn against you, subvert YOUf wishes, disobey you out of sheer perversity. He once told a friend, \"I leamed that you actu­ally have more power when you shut up.\" In his later life Warhol employed this strategy with great success. His interviews were exercises in oracular speech: He would say something vague and ambiguous, and the interviewer would twist in circles trying to figure it out, imagining there was something prafound behind his often meaningless phrases. Warhol rarely talked ab out his work; he let others do the interpreting. He claimed to have leamed this technique from that mas­ter of enigma Marcel Duchamp, another twentieth-century artist who real­ized early on that the less he said about his work, the more people talked about it. And the more they talked, the more valuable his work became. By saying less than necessary you create the appearance of meaning and power. Also, the less you say, the less risk you run of saying something fo olish, even dangeraus. In 1825 a new czar, Nicholas I, ascended the throne of Russia. Arebellion immediately broke out, led by liberals de­manding that the country modernize-that its industries and civil struc­tures catch up with the rest of Europe. Brutally crushing this rebellion (the Decembrist Uprising), Nicholas I sentenced one of its leaders, Kondraty Ryleyev, to death. On the day of the execution Ryleyev stood on the gal­lows, the noose around his neck. The trapdoor opened-but as Ryleyev dangled, the rape brake, dashing hirn to the ground. At the time, events like this were considered signs of providence or heavenly will, and a man saved from execution this way was usually pardoned. As Ryleyev got to his feet, bruised and dirtied but believing his neck had been saved, he called out to the crowd, \"You see, in Russia they don't know how to do anything properly, not even how to make rape!\" A messenger immediately went to the Winter Palace with news of the failed hanging. Ve xed by this disappointing turnabout, Nicholas I never­theless began to sign the pardon. But then: \"Did Ryleyev say anything after this miracle?\" the czar asked the messenger. \"Sire,\" the messenger replied, \"he said that in Russia they don't even know how to make rope.\" \"In that case,\" said the Czar, \"let us prove the contrary,\" and he tore up the pardon. The next day Ryleyev was hanged again. This time the rope did not break. Learn the lesson: Once the words are out, you cannot take them back. Keep them under control.

REVERSAL There are times when it is unwise to be silent. Silence can arouse suspicion and even insecurity, especially in your superiors; a vague or ambiguous comment can open you up to interpretations you had not bargained for. Si­lence and saying less than necessary must be practiced with caution, then, and in the right situations. It is occasionally wiser to imitate the court jester, who plays the fool but knows he is smarter than the king. He talks and talks and entertains, and no one suspects that he is more than just a foo1. Also, words can sometimes act as a kind of smoke screen for any de­ception you might practice. By bending your listener's ear with talk, you can distract and mesmerize them; the more you talk, in fact, the less suspi­cious of you they become. The verbose are not perceived as sly and ma­nipulative but as helpless and unsophisticated.

He lit some incense, strummed his lute, and began to chant. Minutes later he could see the vast enemy army approaching, an endless phalanx of soldiers. Pretending not to notice them, he continued to sing and play the lute. Soon the army stood at the town gates, At its head was Sima Yi, who instantly recognized the man on the wall. Even so, as his soldiers itched to enter the unguarded town through its open gates, Sima Yi hesitated, held them back, and studied Liang on the wall. Then, he ordered an immediate and speedy retreat. Interpretation Chuko Liang was commonly known as the \"Sleeping Dragon.\" His ex­ploits in the War of the Three Kingdoms were legendary. Once a man daiming to be a disaffected enemy lieutenant came to his camp, offering help and information. Liang instantly recognized the situation as a setup; this man was a false deserter, and should be beheaded. At the last minute, though, as the ax was about to fall, Liang stopped the execution and of­fered to spare the man's life if he agreed to become a double agent. Grate­ful and terrified, the man agreed, and began supplying false information to the enemy. Liang won battle after battle. On another occasion Liang stole a military seal and created false docu­ments dispatching his enemy's troops to distant locations. Once the troops had dispersed, he was able to capture three eities, so that he controlled an entire corridor of the enemy's kingdom. He also once tricked the enemy into believing one of its best generals was a traitor, forcing the man to es­cape and join forces with Liang. The Sleeping Dragon carefully cultivated his reputation of being the deverest man in China, one who always had a trick up his sleeve. As powerful-as any weapon, this reputation struck fear into his enemy. Sima Yi had fought against Chuko Liang dozens of times and knew hirn weIl. When he came on the empty city, with Liang praying on the wall, he was stunned. The Taoist robes, the chanting, the incense--this had to be agame of intimidation. The man was obviously taunting hirn, daring hirn to walk into a trap. The game was so obvious that for one moment it crossed Yi's mind that Liang actually was alone, and desperate. But so great was his fear of Liang that he dared not risk finding out. Such is the"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"power of reputation. It can put a vast army on the defensive, even force them into retreat, without a single arrow being fired. FoT, as Cicero says, even those who argue against fame still want the books they write against it to bear their name in the title and hope to become famous for despising it. Everything else is subject to barter: we will let our Jriends have our goods and our lives if need be; but a case of sharing our fame and making someone else the gift of our reputation is hardly to be found. Montaigne, 1533-1592 OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II In 1841 the young P. T. Barnum, trying to establish his reputation as Amer­ica's premier showman, decided to purchase the American Museum in Manhattan and turn it into a collection of curiosities that would secure his farne. The problem was that he had no money. The museum's asking price was $15,000, but Barnum was able to put together a proposal that appealed to the institution's owners even though it replaced cash up front with dozens of guarantees and references. The owners came to a verbal agree­ment with Barnum, but at the last minute, the principal partner changed his mind, and the museum and its collection were sold to the directors of Peale's Museum. Barnum was infuriated, but the partner explained that business was business-the museum had been sold to Peale's because Peale's had areputation and Barnum had none. Barnum immediately decided that if he had no reputation to bank on, his only recourse was to ruin the reputation of Peale's. Accordingly he launched a letter-writing campaign in the newspapers, calling the owners a bunch of \"broken-down bank directors\" who had no idea how to run a mu­seum or entertain people. He warned the public against buying Peale's stock, since the business's purchase of another museum would invariably spread its resources thin. The campaign was effective, the stock plum­meted, and with no more confidence in Peale's track record and reputa­tion, the owners of the American Museum reneged on their deal and sold the whole thing to Barnum. It took years for Peale's to recover, and they never forgot what Bar­num had done. Mr. Peale hirnself decided to attack Barnum by building a reputation for \"high-brow entertainment,\" promoting his museum's pro­grams as more scientific than those of his vulgar competitor. Mesmerism (hypnotism) was one of Peale's \"scientific\" attractions, and for a while it drew big crowds and was quite successful. To fight back, Barnum decided to attack Peale's reputation yet again. Barnum organized a riyal mesmeric performance in which he hirnself apparently put a little girl into a trance. Once she seemed to have fallen deeply under, he tried to hypnotize members of the audience--but no mat­ter how hard he tried, none of the spectators fell under his speIl, and many of them began to laugh. A frustrated Barnum finally announced that to prove the little girl's trance was real, he would cut off one of her fingers many a sheep Who'd injured me in no re.\\'pect, And even in my time been known to try Shepherd pie. lf need be, then, f'll die.

But as he sharpened the knife, the little girl's eyes popped open and she ran away, to the audienee's delight. He repeated this and other parodies for several weeks. Soon no one eould take Peale's show seriously, and attendanee went way down. Within a few weeks, the show dosed. Over the next few years Barnum established areputation for audae­ity and eonsummate showmanship that lasted his whole life. Peale's reputa­tion, on the other hand, never reeovered. Interpretation Barnum used two different taeties to ruin Peale's reputation. The first was simple: He sowed doubts about the museum's stability and solveney. Doubt is a powerful weapon: Onee you let it out of the bag with insidious rumors, YOUf opponents are in a horrible dilemma. On the one hand they ean deny the rumors, even prove that you have slandered them. But a layer of suspieion will remain: Why are they defending themselves so des­perately? Maybe the rumor has some truth to it? If, on the other hand, they take the high road and ignore you, the doubts, unrefuted, will be even stronger. If done eorreetly, the sowing of rumors ean so infuriate and unset­tle YOUf rivals that in defending themselves they will make numerous mis­takes. This is the perfeet weapon for those who have no reputation of their own to work from. Onee Barnum did have a reputation of his own, he used the seeond, gentler taetie, the fake hypnotism demonstration: He ridieuled his rivals' reputation. This too was extremely sueeessful. Onee you have a solid base of respeet, ridieuling YOUf opponent both puts hirn on the defensive and draws more attention to you, enhancing your own reputation. Outright slander and insult are too strong at this point; they are ugly, and may hurt you more than help you. But gentle barbs and moekery suggest that you have a strong enough sense of your own worth to enjoy a good laugh at your rival's expense. A humorous front ean make you out as a harmless en­tertainer while poking holes in the reputation of YOUf rival. It is easier to cope with a bad conscience than with a bad reputation. Friedrich Nietzsehe, 1844-1900 KEYS TO POWER The people around us, even OUf dosest friends, will always to some extent remain mysterious and unfathomable.

Reputation has apower like magic: With one stroke of its wand, it can double your strength. It can also send people scurrying away from you. Whether the exact same deeds appear brilliant or dreadful can depend entirely on the reputation of the doer. In the aneient Chinese court of the Wei kingdom there was a man named Mi Tzu-hsia who had a reputation for supreme eivility and graeious­ness. He became the mler's favorite. It was a law in We i that \"whoever rides secretly in the mler's coach shall have his feet cut off,\" but when Mi Tzu-hsia's mother fell ill, he used the royal coach to visit her, pretending that the mler had given hirn permission. When the mler found out, he said, \"How dutiful is Mi Tzu-hsia! For his mother's sake he even forgot that he was committing a crime making hirn liable to lose his feet!\" Another time the two of them took a stroll in an orchard. Mi Tzu-hsia began eating a peach that he could not finish, and he gave the mler the other half to eat. The mler remarked, \"You love me so much that you would even forget your own saliva taste and let me eat the rest of the peach!\" Later, however, envious fellow courtiers, spreading word that Mi Tz u­hsia was actually devious and arrogant, succeeded in damaging his reputa­tion; the mler came to see his actions in a new light. \"This fellow once rode in my coach under pretense of my order,\" he told the courtiers angrily, \"and another time he gave me a half-eaten peach.\" For the same actions that had charmed the mler when he was the favorite, Mi Tzu-hsia now had to suffer the penalties. The fate of his feet depended solelyon the strength of his reputation. In the beginning, you must work to establish a reputation for one out­standing quality, whether generosity or honesty or cunning. This quality sets you apart and gets other people to talk ab out you. You then make your reputation known to as many people as possible (subtly, though; take care to build slowly, and with a firm foundation), and watch as it spreads like wildfire. A solid reputation increases your presence and exaggerates your strengths without your having to spend much energy. It can also create an aura around you that will instill respect, even fear. In the fighting in the North African desert during World War II, the German general Erwin Rommel had a reputation for cunning and for deceptive maneuvering that struck terror into everyone who faced hirn. Even when his forces were de­pleted, and when British tanks outnumbered his by five to one, entire eities would be evacuated at the news of his approach. As they say, your reputation inevitably precedes you, and if it inspires respect, a lot of your work is done for you before you arrive on the scene, or utter a single word. Your success seems destined by your past triumphs. Much of the suc-LAW 5 41"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"42 LAW 5 cess of Henry Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy rested on bis reputation for ironing out differences; no one wanted to be seen as so unreasonable that Kissinger could not sway hirn. A peace treaty seemed a fait accompli as soon as Kissinger's name became involved in the negotiations. Make your reputation simple and base it on one sterling quality. This single quality--efficiency, say, or seductiveness-becomes a kind of calling card that announces your presence and places others under a speIl. A repu­tation for honesty will allow you to practice all manner of deception. Casanova used bis reputation as a great seducer to pave the way for his fu­ture conquests; women who had heard of his powers became immensely curious, and wanted to discover for themselves what had made hirn so ro­mantically successful. Perhaps you have already stained your reputation, so that you are pre­vented from establishing a new one. In such cases it is wise to associate with someone whose image counteracts your own, using their good name to whitewash and elevate yours. It is hard, for example, to erase a reputa­tion for dishonesty by yourself; but a paragon of honesty can help. When P. T. Barnum wanted to dean up a reputation for promoting vulgar enter­tainment, he brought the singer Jenny Lind over from Europe. She had a stellar, high-dass reputation, and the American tour Bamum sponsored for her greatly enhanced his own image. Similarly the great robber barons of nineteenth-century America were long unable to rid themselves of a repu­tation for cruelty and mean-spiritedness. Only when they began collecting art, so that the names of Morgan and Frick became permanently associated with those of da Vinci and Rembrandt, were they able to soften their un­pleasant image. Reputation is a treasure to be carefully collected and hoarded. Espe­cially when you are first establishing it, you must protect it strictly, antici­pating all attacks on it. Once it is solid, do not let yourself get angry or defensive at the slanderous comments of your enemies-that reveals inse­curity, not confidence in your reputation. Take the high road instead, and never appear desperate in your self-defense. On the other hand, an attack on another man's reputation is a potent weapon, particularly when you have less power than he does. He has much more to lose in such a battle, and your own thus-far-small reputation gives hirn a small target when he tries to return your fire. Bamum used such campaigns to great effect in his early career. But this tactic must be practiced with skill; you must not seem to engage in petty vengeance. If you do not break your enemy's reputation deverly, you will inadvertently ruin your own. Thomas Edison, considered the inventor who hamessed electricity, believed that a workable system would have to be based on direct cur­rent (DC). When the Serbian scientist Nikola Te sla appeared to have suc­ceeded in creating a system based on alternating current (AC), Edison was furious. He determined to ruin Te sla's reputation, by making the public be­lieve that the AC system was inherently unsafe, and Te sla irresponsible in promoting it. To this end he captured all kinds of household pets and electrocuted"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"them to death with an AC current. When this wasn't enough, in 1890 he got New York State prison authorities to organize the world's first execution by electrocution, using an AC current. Eut Edison's electrocution experiments had all been with small creatures; the charge was too weak, and the man was only half killed. In perhaps the country's cruelest state-authorized exe­cution, the procedure had to be repeated. It was an awful spectacle. Although, in the long run, it is Edison's name that has survived, at the time his campaign damaged his own reputation more than Tesla's. He backed off. The lesson is simple-never go too far in attacks like these, for that will draw more attention to your own vengefulness than to the person you are slandering. When your own reputation is solid, use subtIer tactics, such as satire and ridicule, to weaken YOUf opponent while making you out as a charming rogue. The mighty lion toys with the mouse that crosses his path-any other reaction would mar his fearsome reputation. Image: A Mine Full of Diamonds and Rubies.

Perhaps, not caring what others think of you, you gain a reputation for insolence and arrogance, but that can be a valuable image in itself-Oscar Wilde used it to great advantage. Since we must live in soci­ety and must depend on the opinions of others, there is nothing to be gained by neglecting your reputation.

Barnum, America's premier nineteenth-century showman, started his career as an assistant to the owner of a circus, Aaron Turner. In 1836 the circus stopped in Annapolis, Maryland, for aseries of performances. On the morning of opening day, Bamum took a stroll through town, wearing a new black suit. People started to follow hirn. Someone in the gathering crowd shouted out that he was the Reverend Ephraim K. Avery, infamous as a man acquitted of the charge of murder but still believed guilty by most Americans. The angry mob tore off Barnum's suit and was ready to lynch hirn. After desperate appeals, Barnum finally convinced them to follow hirn to the circus, where he could verify his identity. Once there, old Turner confirmed that this was all a practical joke-he hirnself had spread the rumor that Barnum was Avery. The crowd dis­persed, but Barnum, who had nearly been killed, was not amused. He wanted to know what could have induced his boss to play such a trick. \"My dear Mr. Barnum,\" Turner replied, \"it was all for our good. Remember, all we need to ensure success is notoriety.\" And indeed everyone in town was talking about the joke, and the circus was packed that night and every night it stayed in Annapolis. Barnum had learned a lesson he would never forget. Barnum's first big venture of his own was the American Museum-a collection of curiosities, located in New York. One day a beggar ap­proached Barnum in the street. Instead of giving hirn money, Barnum de­cided to employ hirn. Taking hirn back to the museum, he gave the man five bricks and told hirn to make a slow circuit of several blocks. At certain points he was to lay down a brick on the sidewalk, always keeping one brick in hand. On the return journey he was to replace each brick on the street with the one he held. Meanwhile he was to remain serious of counte­nance and to answer no questions. Once back at the museum, he was to enter, walk around inside, then leave through the back door and make the same bricklaying circuit again. On the man's first walk through the streets, several hundred people watched his mysterious movements. By his fourth circuit, onlookers swarmed around hirn, debating what he was doing. Every time he entered the museum he was followed by people who bought tickets to keep watch­ing hirn. Many of them were distracted by the museum's collections, and stayed inside. By the end of the first day, the brick man had drawn over a THE WASP y'm TIW PHI\\CE A wasp named Pin Ta U was long in quest of some deed that would make hirn forever famous. So one day he entered the king's palace and stung the little prince, who was in bed. The prince awoke with loud cries. The king and his courtiers rushed in to see what had happened. The prince was yelling as the wasp stung hirn again and again. The courtiers tried to catch the wasp, and each in turn was stung. The whole royal household rushed in, the news so on spread, and people flocked to the palace. The city was in an uproar, all business suspended. Said the wasp to itself, before it expired from its efforts, \"A name without farne is like fire without flame. There is nothing like attracting notice at any cost.\" INDIAN FABLE LAW 6 45"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Even ,,,hen Fm miled al, I Rel my if\"ola or reflOlVfl.

A few days later the police ordered hirn to cease and desist from his walks-the crowds were blocking traffic. The bricklaying stopped but thousands of New Yorkers had entered the mu­seum, and many of those had become P. T. Barnum converts. Barnum would put a band of musicians on a balcony overlooking the street, beneath a huge banner proclaiming FREE MUSIC FOR THE MILLIONS. What generosity, New Yorkers thought, and they flocked to hear the free concerts. But Barnum took pains to hire the worst musicians he could find, and soon after the band struck up, people would hurry to buy tickets to the museum, where they would be out of earshot of the band's noise, and of the booing of the crowd. One of the first oddities Barnum toured around the country was Joice Heth, a woman he claimed was 161 years old, and whom he advertised as a slave who had once been George Washington's nurse. After several months the crowds began to dwindle, so Barnum sent an anonymous letter to the papers, claiming that Heth was a clever fraud. joice Heth,\" he wrote, \"is not a human being but an automaton, made up of whalebone, india-rubber, and numberless springs.\" Those who had not bothered to see her before were immediately curious, and those who had already seen her paid to see her again, to find out whether the rumor that she was a robot was true. In 1842, Barnum purchased the carcass of what was purported to be a mermaid. This creature resembled a monkey with the body of a fish, but the head and body were perfectly joined-it was truly a wonder. After some research Barnum discovered that the creature had been expertly put together in Japan, where the hoax had caused quite a stir. He nevertheless planted articles in newspapers around the country claiming the capture of a mermaid in the Fiji Islands. He also sent the pa­pers woodcut prints of paintings showing mermaids. By the time he showed the specimen in his museum, anational debate had been sparked over the existence of these mythical creatures. A few months before Barnum's cam­paign, no one had cared or even known about mermaidsj now everyone was talking about them as if they were real. Crowds flocked in record num­bers to see the Fiji Mermaid, and to hear debates on the subject. A few years later, Barnum toured Europe with General Tom Thumb, a five-year-old dwarf from Connecticut whom Barnum claimed was an eleven-year-old English boy, and whom he had trained to do many re­markable acts. During this tour Barnum's name attracted such attention that Queen Victoria, that paragon of sobriety, requested a private audience with hirn and his talented dwarf at Buckingham Palace. The English press may have ridiculed Bamum, but Victoria was royally entertained by hirn, and respected hirn ever after. Interpretation Barnum understood the fundamental truth about attracting attention: Once people's eyes are on you, you have a speciallegitimacy. For Barnum,"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"creating interest meant creating a crowd; as he later wrote, \"Every crowd has a silver lining.\" And crowds tend to act in conjunction. If one person stops to see your beggarman laying bricks in the street, more will do the sarne. They will gather like dust bunnies. Then, given a gentle push, they will enter your museum or watch your show. To create a crowd you have to do something different and odd. Any kind of curiosity will serve the pur­pose, for crowds are magnetically attracted by the unusual and inexplica­ble. And once you have their attention, never let it go. If it veers toward other people, it does so at your expense. Barnum would ruthlessly suck at­tention fr om his competitors, knowing what a valuable commodity it iso At the beginning of your rise to the top, then, spend all your energy on attracting attention. Most important: The quality of the attention is irrele­vant. No matter how badly his shows were reviewed, or how slanderously personal were the attacks on his hoaxes, Barnum would never complain. If a newspaper critic reviled hirn particularly badly, in fact, he made sure to invite the man to an opening and to give hirn the best seat in the house. He would even write anonymous attacks on his own work, just to keep his name in the papers. From Barnum's vantage, attention-whether negative or positive-was the main ingredient of his success. The worst fate in the world for a man who yearns farne, glory, and, of course, power is to be ig nored. If the courtier happens to engage in arms in some public spectacle such as jousting ... he will ensure that the horse he has is beautifully caparisoned, that he himself is suitably attired, with appropriate mottoes and ingenious devices to attract the eyes 0/ the onlookers in his direction as surely as the lodestone attracts iron. Raidassare Castiglione, 1478-1529 KEYS TO POWER Burning more brightly than those around you is a skill that no one is born with. You have to team to attract attention, \"as surely as the lodestone at­tracts iron.\" At the start of your career, you must attach your narne and rep­utation to a quality, an image, that sets you apart fr om other people. This image can be something like a characteristic style of dress, or a personality quirk that amuses people and gets talked about. Once the image is estab­lished, you have an appearance, a place in the sky for your star. It is a common mistake to imagine that this peculiar appearance of yours should not be controversial, that to be attacked is somehow bad. Nothing could be further fr om the truth. To avoid being a flash in the pan, and having your notoriety eclipsed by another, you must not discriminate between different types of attention; in the end, every kind will work in your fa vor.

The duke was short, almost dwarfish, and he was prone to the most insolent kinds of behavior-he slept with the king's mistress, and openly insulted not only other courtiers but the king hirnself. Louis, however, was so beguiled by the duke's eccen­tricities that he could not bear his absences from the court. It was simple: The strangeness of the duke's character attracted attention. Once people were enthralled by hirn, they wanted hirn around at any cost. Society craves larger-than-life figures, people who stand above the general mediocrity. Never be afraid, then, of the qualities that set you apart and draw attention to you. Court controversy, even scandal. It is better to be attacked, even slandered, than ignored. All professions are ruled by this law, and all professionals must have a bit of the showman about them. The great scientist Thomas Edison knew that to raise money he had to remain in the public eye at any cost. Almost as important as the inventions themselves was how he presented them to the public and courted attention. Edison would design visually dazzling experiments to display his dis­coveries with electricity. He would talk of future inventions that seemed fantastic at the time-robots, and machines that could photograph thought-and that he had no intention of wasting his energy on, but that made the public talk about hirn. He did everything he could to make sure that he received more attention than his great riyal Nikola Tesla, who may actually have been more brilliant than he was but whose name was far less known. In 1915, it was rumored that Edison and Tesla would be joint recip­ients of that year's Nobel Prize in physics. The prize was eventually given to a pair of English physicists; only later was it discovered that the prize com­mittee had actually approached Edison, but he had tumed them down, re­fusing to share the prize with Tesla. By that time his fame was more seeure than Tesla's, and he thought it better to refuse the honor than to allow his riyal the attention that would have come even from sharing the prize. If you find yourself in a lowly position that offers little opportunity for you to draw attention, an effective trick is to attack the most visible, most famous, most powerful person you can find. When Pietro Aretino, a young Roman servant boy of the early sixteenth century, wanted to get attention as a writer of verses, he decided to publish aseries of satirical poems ridi­culing the pope and his affection for a pet elephant. The attack put Aretino in the public eye immediately. A slanderous attack on a person in a posi­tion of power would have a similar effect. Remember, however, to use such tactics sparingly after you have the public's attention, when the act can wear thin. Once in the limelight you must constantly renew it by adapting and varying your method of courting attention. If you don't, the public will grow tired, will take you for granted, and will move on to a newer star. The game requires constant vigilance and creativity.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW Beginning in 1905, rumors started to spread throughout Paris of a young Oriental girl who danced in a private horne, wrapped in veils that she grad­ually discarded. A local journalist who had seen her dancing reported that \"a woman from the Far East had come to Europe laden with perfume and jewels, to introduce some of the richness of the Oriental colour and life into the satiated society of European cities.\" Soon everyone knew the dancer's name: Mata Hari. Early that year, in the winter, small and select audiences would gather in a salon filled with Indian statues and other relics while an orchestra played music inspired by Hindu andJavanese melodies. Mter keeping the audience waiting and wondering, Mata Hari would suddenly appear, in a startling costume: a white cotton brassiere coyered with Indian-type jewels; jeweled bands at the waist supporting a sarong that revealed as much as it concealed; bracelets up the arms. Then Mata Hari would dance, in a style no one in France had seen before, her whole body swaying as if she were in a trance. She told her excited and curious audience that her dances told stories from Indian mythology and Javanese folktales. Soon the cream of Paris, and ambassadors from far-off lands, were competing for invitations to the salon, where it was rumored that Mata Hari was actually performing sacred dances in the nude. The public wanted to know more about her. She told journalists that she was actually Dutch in origin, but had grown up on the island of Java. She would also talk about time spent in India, how she had leamed sacred Hindu dances there, and how Indian women \"can shoot straight, ride horseback, and are capable of doing logarithms and talk philosophy.\" By the summer of 1905, although few Parisians had actually seen Mata Hari dance, her name was on everyone's lips. As Mata Hari gave more interviews, the story of her origins kept changing: She had grown up in India, her grandmother was the daughter of a Javanese princess, she had lived on the island of Sumatra where she had spent her time \"horseback riding, gun in hand, and risking her life.\" No one knew anything certain about her, but journalists did not mind these changes in her biography. They compared her to an Indian goddess, a creature from the pages of Baudelaire--whatever their imagination wanted to see in this mysterious woman from the East. In August of 1905, Mata Hari performed for the first time in public."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"rCrowds thronging to see her on opening night caused a riot. She had now become a cult figure, spawning many imitations. One reviewer wrote, \"Mata Hari personifies all the poetry of India, its mysticism, its voluptuous­ness, its hypnotizing charm.\" Another noted, \"If India possesses such unex­pected treasures, then all Frenchmen will emigrate to the shores of the Ganges.\" Soon the fame of Mata Hari and her sacred Indian dances spread be­yond Paris. She was invited to Berlin, Vienna, Milan. Over the next few years she performed throughout Europe, mixed with the highest social cir­eIes, and eamed an income that gave her an independence rarely enjoyed by a woman of the period. Then, near the end of World War I, she was ar­rested in France, tried, convicted, and finally executed as a German spy. Only during the trial did the truth come out: Mata Hari was not from Java or India, had not grown up in the Orient, did not have a drop of Eastem blood in her body. Her real name was Margaretha Zelle, and she came from the stolid northem province of Friesland, Holland. Interpretation When Margaretha Zelle arrived in Paris, in 1904, she had half a franc in her pocket. She was one of the thousands of beautiful young girls who flocked to Paris every year, taking work as artists' models, nightclub dancers, or vaudeville performers at the Folies Bergere. Mter a few years they would inevitably be replaced by younger girls, and would often end up on the streets, tuming to prostitution, or else retuming to the town they came from, older and chastened. Zelle had higher ambitions. She had no dance experience and had never performed in the theater, but as a young girl she had traveled with her family and had witnessed local dances in Java and Sumatra. Zelle eIearly understood that what was important in her act was not the dance it­self, or even her face or figure, but her ability to create an air of mystery about herself. The mystery she created lay not just in her dancing, or her costumes, or the stories she would tell, or her endless lies about her origins; it lay in an atmosphere enveloping everything she did. There was nothing you could say for sure about her-she was always changing, always sur­prising her audience with new costumes, new dances, new stories. This air of mystery left the public always wanting to know more, always wondering about her next move. Mata Hari was no more beautiful than many of the other young girls who came to Paris, and she was not a particularly good dancer. What separated her from the mass, what attracted and held the public's attention and made her famous and wealthy, was her mystery. People are enthralled by mystery; because it invites constant interpreta­tion, they never tire of it. The mysterious cannot be grasped. And what cannot be seized and consumed creates power. LAW 6 51"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"52 LAW 6 KEYS TO POWER In the past, the world was filled with the terrifying and unknowable­diseases, disasters, capricious despots, the mystery of death itself. What we could not understand we reimagined as myths and spirits. Over the cen­turies, though, we have managed, through science and reason, to illumi­nate the darkness; what was mysterious and forbidding has grown familiar and comfortable. Yet this light has a price: in a world that is ever more banal, that has had its mystery and myth squeezed out of it, we secretly crave enigmas, people or things that cannot be instantly interpreted, seized, and consumed. That is the power of the mysterious: It invites layers of interpretation, excites our imagination, seduces us into believing that it conceals some­thing marvelous. The world has become so familiar and its inhabitants so predictable that what wraps itself in mystery will almost always draw the limelight to it and make us watch it. Do not imagine that to create an air of mystery you have to be grand and awe-inspiring. Mystery that is woven into your day-to-day demeanor, and is subtle, has that much more power to fascinate and attract attention. Remember: Most people are upfront, can be read like an open book, take little care to control their words or image, and are hopelessly predictable. By simply holding back, keeping silent, occasionally uttering ambiguous phrases, deliberately appearing inconsistent, and acting odd in the subtlest of ways, you will emanate an aura of mystery. The people around you will then magnify that aura by constantly trying to interpret you. Both artists and con artists understand the vital link between being mysterious and attracting interest. Count Victor Lustig, the aristocrat of swindlers, played the game to perfection. He was always doing things that were different, or seemed to make no sense. He would show up at the best hotels in a limo driven by a Japanese chauffeur; no one had ever seen a Japanese chauffeur before, so this seemed exotic and strange. Lustig would dress in the most expensive clothing, but always with something-a medal, a flower, an armband-out of place, at least in conventional terms. This was seen not as tasteless but as odd and intriguing. In hotels he would be seen receiving telegrams at all hours, one after the other, brought to hirn by his Japanese chauffeur-telegrams he would tear up with utter noncha­lance. (In fact they were fakes, completely blank.) He would sit alone in the dining room, reading a large and impressive-Iooking book, smiling at peo­pIe yet remaining aloof. Within a few days, of course, the entire hotel would be abuzz with interest in this strange man. All this attention allowed Lustig to lure suckers in with ease. They would beg for his confidence and his company. Everyone wanted to be seen with this mysterious aristocrat. And in the presence of this distracting enigma, they wouldn't even notice that they were being robbed blind. An air of mystery can make the mediocre appear intelligent and pro­found. It made Mata Hari, a woman of average appearance and intelli­gence, seem like a goddess, and her dancing divinely inspired. An air of"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"mystery about an artist makes his or her artwork immediately more intrigu­ing, a trick Marcel Duchamp played to great effect. It is all very easy to do-say little about your work, tease and titillate with alluring, even contra­dictory comments, then stand back and let others try to make sense of it all. Mysterious people put others in a kind of inferior position-that of try­ing to figure them out. To degrees that they can control, they also elicit the fear surrounding anything uncertain or unknown. All great leaders know that an aura of mystery draws attention to them and creates an intimidating presence. Mao Tse-tung, for example, cleverly cultivated an enigmatic image; he had no worries about seeming inconsistent or contradicting him­self-the very contradictoriness of his actions and words meant that he al­ways had the upper hand. No one, not even his own wife, ever feIt they understood hirn, and he therefore seemed larger than life. This also meant that the public paid constant attention to hirn, ever anxious to witness his next move. If your social position prevents you from completely wrapping your actions in mystery, you must at least learn to make yourself less obvious. Every now and then, act in a way that does not mesh with other people's perception of you. This way you keep those around you on the defensive, eliciting the kind of attention that makes you powerful. Done right, the cre­ation of enigma can also draw the kind of attention that strikes terror into your enemy. During the Second Punic War (219-202 B.C.), the great Carthaginian general Hannibal was wreaking havoc in his march on Rome. Hannibal was known for his cleverness and duplicity. Under his leadership Carthage's army, though smaller than those of the Romans, had constantly outmaneuvered them. On one occasion, though, Hannibal's scouts made a horrible blunder, leading his troops into a marshy terrain with the sea at their back. The Roman army blocked the mountain passes that led inland, and its general, Fabius, was ecstatic-at last he had Hannibal trapped. Posting his best sentries on the passes, he worked on a plan to destroy Hannibal's forces. But in the middle of the night, the sentries looked down to see a mysterious sight: A huge pro ces­sion of lights was heading up the mountain. Thousands and thousands of lights. If this was Hannibal's army, it had suddenly grown a hundredfold. The sentries argued heatedly about what this could mean: Reinforce­ments from the sea? Troops that had been hidden in the area? Ghosts? No explanation made sense. As they watched, fires broke out all over the mountain, and a horrible noise drifted up to them from below, like the blowing of a million horns. Demons, they thought. The sentries, the bravest and most sensible in the Roman army, fled their posts in a panic. By the next day, Hannibal had escaped from the marshland. What was his trick? Had he really cOI�ured up demons? Actually what he had done was order bundles of twigs to be fastened to the horns of the thousands of oxen that traveled with his troops as beasts of burden. The twigs were then LAW 6 53"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"54 , LAW 6 lit, giving the impression of the torches of a vast army heading up the mountain. When the flarnes burned down to the oxen's skin, they stam­peded in all directions, bellowing like mad and setting fires all over the mountainside. The key to this device's success was not the torches, the fires, or the noises in themselves, however, but the fact that Hannibal had created a puzzle that captivated the sentries' attention and gradually terri­fied them. From the mountaintop there was no way to explain this bizarre sight. If the sentries could have explained it they would have stayed at their posts. If you find yourself trapped, cornered, and on the defensive in some situation, try a simple experiment: Do something that cannot be easily ex­plained or interpreted. Choose a simple action, but carry it out in a way that unsettles your opponent, a way with many possible interpretations, making your intentions obscure. Don't just be unpredictable (although this tactic too can be successful-see Law 17); like Hannibal, create a scene that cannot be read. There will seem to be no method to your madness, no rhyme or reason, no single explanation. If you do this right, you will in­spire fear and trembling and the sentries will abandon their posts. Call it the \"feigned madness of Harnlet\" tactic, for Harnlet uses it to great effect in Shakespeare's play, frightening his stepfather Claudius through the mys­tery of his behavior. The mysterious makes your forces seem larger, your power more terrifying. Image: The Dance of the Ve ils-the veils envelop the dancer. What they reveal causes excitement.

Never wear the pub­lic out with the same tactic. An air of mystery works wonders for those who need to develop an aura of power and get themselves noticed, but it must seem measured and under control. Mata Hari went too far with her fabri­cations; although the accusation that she was a spy was false, at the time it was a reasonable presumption because all her lies made her seem suspi­cious and nefarious. Do not let your air of mystery be slowly transformed into a reputation for deceit. The mystery you create must seem agame, playful and unthreatening. Recognize when it goes too far, and puH back. There are times when the need for attention must be deferred, and when scandal and notoriety are the last things you want to create. The at­tention you attraet must never offend or challenge the reputation of those above you-not, at any rate, if they are secure. You will seem not only pal­try but desperate by comparison. There is an art to knowing when to draw notice and when to withdraw. Lola Montez was one of the great practitioners of the art of attracting attention. She managed to rise from a middle-class lrish background to being the lover of Franz Liszt and then the mistress and political adviser of King Ludwig of Bavaria. In her later years, though, she lost her sense of proportion. In London in 1850 there was to be a performance of Shakespeare's Macbeth featuring the greatest actor of the time, Charles John Kean. Every­one of consequence in English society was to be there; it was rumored that even Qu een Victoria and Prince Albert were to make a public appearance. The custom of the period demanded that everyone be seated before the queen arrived. So the audience got there a little early, and when the queen entered her royal box, they observed the convention of standing up and applauding her. The royal couple waited, then bowed. Everyone sat down and the lights were dimmed. Then, suddenly, all eyes turned to a box op­posite Queen Victoria's: A woman appeared from the shadows, taking her seat later than the queen. It was Lola Montez. She wore a diamond tiara on her dark hair and a long fur coat over her shoulders. People whispered in amazement as the ermine cloak was dropped to reveal a low-necked gown of crimson velvet. By turning their heads, the audience could see that the royal couple deliberately avoided looking at Lola's box. They foHowed Victoria's example, and for the rest of the evening Lola Montez was ig­nored. Mter that evening no one in fashionable society dared to be seen with her. All her magnetic powers were reversed. People would flee her sight. Her future in England was finished. Never appear overly greedy for attention, then, for it signals insecurity, and insecurity drives power away. Understand that there are times when it is not in your interest to be the center of attention. When in the presence of a king or queen, for instance, or the equivalent thereof, bow and retreat to the shadows; never compete.

He was a brilliant inventor, and Charles Batchelor, a plant manager and a personal friend of Thomas Edison, persuaded him he should seek his fortune in America, giv­ing hirn a letter of introduction to Edison hirnself. So began a life of woe and tribulation that lasted until Tesla's death. When Tesla met Edison in New York, the famous inventor hired him on the spot. Te sla worked eighteen-hour days, finding ways to improve the primitive Edison dynamos. Finally he offered to redesign them completely. To Edison this seemed a monumental task that could last years without paying off, but he told Tesla, \"There's fifty thousand dollars in it for you-if you can do it.\" Tesla labored day and night on the project and after only a year he produced a greatly improved version of the dynamo, complete with automatie controls. He went to Edison to break the good news and re­ceive his $50,000. Edison was pleased with the improvement, for which he and his company would take credit, but when it came to the issue of the money he told the young Serb, \"Tesla, you don't understand our American humor!,\" and offered a small raise instead. Tesla's obsession was to create an altemating-current system (AC) of electricity. Edison believed in the direct-current system (DC), and not only refused to support Te sla's research but later did all he could to sabotage him. Te sla tumed to the great Pittsburgh magnate George We stinghouse, who had started his own electricity company. Westinghouse completely funded Te sla's research and offered hirn a generous royalty agreement on future profits. The AC system Te sla developed is still the standard today­but after patents were filed in his name, other scientists came forward to take credit for the invention, claiming that they had laid the groundwork for hirn. His name was lost in the shuffle, and the public came to associate the invention with Westinghouse hirnself. A year later, Westinghouse was caught in a takeover bid from J. Pierpont Morgan, who made hirn rescind the generous royalty contract he had signed with Te sla. Westinghouse explained to the scientist that his company would not survive if it had to pay hirn his full royalties; he per­suaded Tesla to accept a buyout of his patents for $216,000-a large sum, no doubt, but far less than the $12 million they were worth at the time. The financiers had divested Te sla of the riches, the patents, and essentially the credit for the greatest invention of his career. The name of Guglielmo Marconi is forever linked with the invention of radio. But few know that in producing his invention-he broadcast a sig­nal across the English Channel in 1899-Marconi made use of a patent Te sla had filed in 1897, and that his work depended on Te sla's research. Once again Te sla received no money and no credit. Te sla invented an in­duction motor as well as the AC power system, and he is the real \"father of radio.\" Yet none of these discoveries bear his name. As an old man, he lived in poverty.

CENTllRY H.C, 58 LAW 7 In 1917, during his later impoverished years, Tesla was told he was to receive the Edison Medal of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. He tumed the medal down. \"You propose, \" he said, \"to honor me with a medal which I could pin upon my coat and strut for a vain hOUf before the members of your Institute. You would decorate my body and continue to let starve, for failure to supply recognition, my mind and its creative prod­ucts, which have supplied the foundation upon which the major portion of your Institute exists.\" Interpretation Many harbor the illusion that science, dealing with facts as it does, is be­yond the petty rivalries that trouble the rest of the world. Nikola Tesla was one of those. He believed science had nothing to do with politics, and claimed not to care for farne and riches, As he grew older, though, this ru­ined his scientific work. Not associated with any particular discovery, he could attract no investors to his many ideas. While he pondered great in­ventions for the future, others stole the patents he had already developed and got the glory for themselves. He wanted to do everything on his own, but merely exhausted and im­poverished hirnself in the process. Edison was Tesla's polar opposite. He wasn't actually much of a scien­tific thinker or inventor; he once said that he had no need to be a mathe­matician because he could always hire one. That was Edison's main method. He was really a businessman and publicist, spotting the trends and the opportunities that were out there, then hiring the best in the field to do the work for him. If he had to he would steal from his competitors. Yet his name is much better known than Tesla's, and is associated with more in­ventions. The lesson is twofold: First, the credit for an invention or creation is as important, if not more important, than the invention itself. You must seeUfe the credit for YOUfseif and keep others from stealing it away, or from piggy­backing on YOUf hard work. To accomplish this you must always be vigilant and ruthless, keeping YOUf creation quiet until you can be SUfe there are no vultures circling overhead. Second, leam to take advantage of other peo­ple's work to further YOUf own cause. Time is precious and life is short. If you try to do it all on YOUf own, you run yourself ragged, waste energy, and bum yourself out. It is far better to conserve your forces, pounce on the work others have done, and find a way to make it YOUf own. Everybody steals in commerce and industry. I've stolen a lot myself. But I know how to steal. Thomas Edison, 1847 -1931"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"KEYS TO POWER The world of power has the dynamics of the jungle: There are those who live by hunting and killing, and there are also vast numbers of creatures (hyenas, vultures) who live off the hunting of others. These latter, less imaginative types are often incapable of doing the work that is essential for the creation of power. They understand early on, though, that if they wait long enough, they can always find another animal to do the work for them. Do not be naive: At this very moment, while you are slaving away on some project, there are vultures cirding above trying to figure out a way to sur­vive and even thrive off your creativity. It is useless to complain about this, or to wear yourself ragged with bittemess, as Te sla did. Better to protect yourself and join the game. Once you have established a power base, be­come a vulture yourself, and save yourself a lot of time and energy. Of the two poles of this game, one can be illustrated by the example of the explorer Vasco Nliiiez de Balboa. Balboa had an obsession-the dis­covery of EI Dorado, a legendary city of vast riches. Early in the sixteenth century, after countless hardships and brushes with death, he found evidence of a great and wealthy empire to the south of Mexico, in present-day Peru. By conquering this empire, the Incan, and seizing its gold, he would make hirnself the next Cortes. The problem was that even as he made this discovery, word of it spread among hundreds of other conquistadors. He did not understand that half the game was keeping it quiet, and carefully watching those around hirn. A few years after he dis­covered the location of the Incan empire, a soldier in his own army, Fran­cisco Pizarro, helped to get hirn beheaded for treason. Pizarro went on to take what Balboa had spent so many years trying to find. The other pole is that of the artist Peter Paul Rubens, who, late in his career, found hirnself deluged with requests for paintings. He created a sys­tem: In his large studio he employed dozens of outstanding painters, one specializing in robes, another in backgrounds, and so on. He created a vast production line in which a large number of canvases would be worked on at the same time. When an important dient visited the studio, Rubens would shoo his hired painters out for the day. While the dient watched fr om a balcony, Rubens would work at an incredible pace, with unbeliev­able energy. The dient would leave in awe of this prodigious man, who could paint so many masterpieces in so short a time. This is the essence of the Law: Leam to get others to do the work for you while you take the credit, and you appear to be of godlike strength and power. If you think it important to do all the work yourself, you will never get far, and you will suffer the fate of the Balboas and Te slas of the world. Find people with the skills and creativity you lack. Either hire them, while putting your own name on top of theirs, or find a way to take their work and make it your own. Their creativity thus becomes yours, and you seem a genius to the world.

How many later writers have in their turn borrowed from-plagiarized--Shakespeare? We all know how few of today's politicians write their own speeches.

The city was fuH of gai­ety and the balls were the most splendid in memory. Hovering over the proceedings, however, was the shadow of Napoleon hirnself. Instead of being executed or exiled far away, he had been sent to the island of Elba, not far from the co ast of Italy. Even imprisoned on an island, a man as bold and creative as Napoleon Bonaparte made everyone nervous. The Austrians plotted to kill hirn on Elba, but decided it was too risky. Alexander I, Russia's tempera­mental czar, heightened the anxiety by throwing a fit during the congress when apart of Poland was denied him: \"Beware, I shall loose the mon­ster!\" he threatened. Everyone knew he meant Napoleon. Of all the states­men gathered in Vienna, only Talleyrand, Napoleon's former foreign minister, seemed calm and unconcerned. It was as if he knew something the others did not. Meanwhile, on the island of Elba, Napoleon's life was a mockery of his previous glory. As Elba's \"king,\" he had been allowed to form a court­there was a cook, a wardrobe mistress, an official pianist, and a handful of courtiers. All this was designed to humiliate Napoleon, and it seemed to work. That winter, however, there occurred aseries of events so strange and dramatic they might have been scripted in a play. Elba was surrounded by British ships, their cannons covering all possible exit points. Yet somehow, in broad daylight on 26 February 1815, a ship with nine hundred men on board picked up Napoleon and put to sea. The English gave chase but the ship got away. This almost impossible escape astonished the public throughout Europe, and terrified the statesmen at the Congress of Vienna. Although it would have been safer to leave Europe, Napoleon not only chose to return to France, he raised the odds by marching on Paris with a tiny army, in hopes of recapturing the throne. His strategy worked-people of all classes threw themselves at his feet. An army under Marshal Ney sped from Paris to arrest hirn, but when the soldiers saw their beloved former leader, they changed sides. Napoleon was declared emperor again. Volun­teers swelled the ranks of his new army. Delirium swept the country. In Paris, crowds went wild. The king who had replaced Napoleon fled the country. For the next hundred days, Napoleon ruled France. Soon, however, the giddiness subsided. France was bankrupt, its resources nearly exhausted, and there was little Napoleon could do about this. At the Battle of Waterloo, in June of that year, he was finally defeated for good. This time his enemies had learned their lesson: They exiled hirn to the barren island of Saint He­lena, off the west coast of Mrica. There he had no more hope of escape. Interpretation Only years later did the facts of Napoleon's dramatic escape from Elba come to light. Before he decided to attempt this bold move, visitors to his court had told hirn that he was more popular in France than ever, and that LAW 8 63"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"64 LAW 8 the country would embrace hirn again. One of these visitors was Austria's General Koller, who convinced Napoleon that if he escaped, the European powers, England included, would welcome him back into power. Napoleon was tipped off that the English would let hirn go, and indeed his escape oc­curred in the middle of the afternoon, in full view of English spyglasses. What Napoleon did not know was that there was a man behind it all, pulling the strings, and that this man was his former minister, Talleyrand. And Talleyrand was doing all this not to bring back the glory days but to crush Napoleon once and for all. Considering the emperor's ambition un­settling to Europe's stability, he had turned against hirn long ago. When Napoleon was exiled to Elba, Talleyrand had protested. Napoleon should be sent farther away, he argued, or Europe would never have peace. But no one listened. Instead of pushing his opinion, Talleyrand bided his time. Working quietly, he eventually won over Castlereagh and Mettemich, the foreign ministers of England and Austria. Together these men baited Napoleon into escaping. Even Koller's visit, to whisper the promise of glory in the exile's ear, was part of the plan. Like a master cardplayer, Talleyrand figured everything out in advance. He knew Napoleon would fall into the trap he had set. He also foresaw that Napoleon would lead the country into a war, which, given France's weak­ened condition, could only last a few months. One diplomat in Vienna, who understood that Talleyrand was behind it all, said, \"He has set the house ablaze in order to save it from the plague.\" When I have laid bait for deer, I don 't shoot at the first doe that comes to sniff, but rpait until the whole herd has gathered mund. Dito von Bismarck, 1815-1898 KEYS TO POWER How many times has this scenario played itself out in history: An aggres­sive leader initiates a series of bold moves that begin by bringing hirn much power. Slowly, however, his power reaches a peak, and soon every­thing turns against hirn. His numerous enemies band together; trying to maintain his power, he exhausts hirnself going in this direction and that, and inevitably he collapses. The reason for this pattern is that the aggres­sive person is rarely in full control. He cannot see more than a couple of moves ahead, cannot see the consequences of this bold move or that one. Because he is constantly being forced to react to the moves of his ever­growing host of enemies, and to the unforeseen consequences of his own rash actions, his aggressive energy is turned against hirn. In the realm of power, you must ask yourself, what is the point of chas­ing here and there, trying to solve problems and defeat my enemies, if I never feel in contro!? Why am I always having to react to events instead of directing them? The answer is simple: Your idea of power is wrong. You"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"have mistaken aggressive action for effective action. And most often the most effective action is to stay back, keep calm, and let others be frustrated by the traps you lay for them, playing for long-term power rather than quick victory. Remember: The essence of power is the ability to keep the initiative, to get others to react to your moves, to keep YOUf opponent and those around you on the defensive. When you make other people come to you, you suddenly become the one controlling the situation. And the one who has control has power. Two things must happen to place you in this posi­tion: You yourself must learn to master YOUf emotions, and never to be in­fluenced by anger; meanwhile, however, you must play on people's natural tendency to react angrily when pushed and baited. In the long run, the ability to make others come to you is a weapon far more powerful than any tool of aggression. Study how Talleyrand, the master of the art, performed this delicate trick. First, he overcame the urge to try to convince his fellow statesmen that they needed to banish Napoleon far away. It is only natural to want to persuade people by pleading YOUf case, imposing YOUf will with words. But this often turns against you. Few of Talleyrand's contemporaries believed Napoleon was still a threat, so that if he had spent a lot of energy trying to convince them, he would only have made himself look foolish. Instead, he held his tongue and his emotions in check. Most important of all, he laid Napoleon a sweet and irresistible trap. He knew the man's weakness, his impetuosity, his need for glory and the love of the masses, and he played all this to perfection. When Napoleon went for the bait, there was no dan­ger that he might succeed and turn the tables on Talleyrand, who better than anyone knew France's depleted state. And even had Napoleon been able to overcome these difficulties, the likelihood of bis success would have been greater were he able to choose his time and place of action. By setting the proper trap, Talleyrand took the time and place into his own hands. All of us have only so much energy, and there is a moment when OUf energies are at their peak. When you make the other person come to you, he wears himself out, wasting his energy on the trip. In the year 1905, Rus­sia and Japan were at war. The J apanese had only recently begun to mod­emize their warships, so that the Russians had a stronger navy, but by spreading false information the Japanese marshal Togo Heihachiro baited the Russians into leaving their docks in the Baltic Sea, making them believe they could wipe out the J apanese fleet in one swift attack. The Russian fleet could not reach Japan by the quickest route-through the Strait of Gibral­tar and then the Suez Canal into the Indian Ocean-because these were controlled by the British, and Japan was an ally of Great Britain. They had to go around the Cape of Good Hope, at the southern tip of Africa, adding over more than six thousand miles to the voyage. Once the fleet passed the Cape, the Japanese spread another false story: They were sailing to launch a counterattack. So the Russians made the entire journey to Japan on com­bat alert. By the time they arrived, their seamen were tense, exhausted, and overworked, while the Japanese had been waiting at their ease. Despite the LAW 8 65"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"66 LAW 8 odds and their lack of experience in modem naval warfare, the Japanese crushed the Russians. One added benefit of making the opponent come to you, as the Japa­nese discovered with the Russians, is that it forces hirn to operate in your territory. Being on hostile ground will make hirn nervous and often he will rush his actions and make mistakes. For negotiations or meetings, it is al­ways wise to lure others into your territory, or the territory of your choice. You have your bearings, while they see nothing familiar and are subtly placed on the defensive. Manipulation is a dangerous game. Once someone suspects he is being manipulated, it becomes harder and harder to control hirn. But when you make your opponent come to you, you create the illusion that he is controlling the situation. He does not feel the strings that pull hirn, just as Napoleon imagined that he hirnself was the master of his daring escape and return to power. Everything depends on the sweetness of your bait. If your trap is at­tractive enough, the turbulence of your enemies' emotions and desires will blind them to reality. The greedier they become, the more they can be led around. The great nineteenth-century robber baron Daniel Drew was a master at playing the stock market. When he wanted a particular stock to be bought or sold, driving prices up or down, he rarely resorted to the direct approach. One of his tricks was to hurry through an exclusive club near Wall Street, obviously on his way to the stock exchange, and to pull out his customary red bandanna to wipe his perspiring brow. A slip of paper would fall from this bandanna that he would pretend not to notice. The club's members were always trying to foresee Drew's moves, and they would pounce on the paper, which invariably seemed to contain an inside tip on a stock. Word would spread, and members would buy or seIl the stock in droves, playing perfectly into Drew's hands. If you can get other people to dig their own graves, why sweat your­self? Pickpockets work this to perfection. The key to picking a pocket is knowing which pocket contains the wallet. Experienced pickpockets often ply their trade in train stations and other places where there is a clearly marked sign reading BEWARE OF PICKPOCKETS.

Pickpockets have even been known to place their own BEWARE OF PICKPOCKETS signs to ensure their success.

But when the city officials hired a second man, Lorenzo Ghiberti, to work with Brunelleschi, the great artist brooded in se­cret. He knew that Ghiberti had gotten the job through his connections, and that he would do none of the work and get half the credit. At a critical moment of the construction, then, Brunelleschi suddenly developed a mys­terious illness. He had to stop work, but pointed out to city officials that they had hired Ghiberti, who should have been able to continue the work on his OWll. Soon it became dear that Ghiberti was useless and the officials came begging to Brunelleschi. He ignored them, insisting that Ghiberti should finish the project, until finally they realized the problem: They fired Ghiberti. By some mirade, Brunelleschi recovered within days. He did not have to throw a tautrum or make a fool of hirnself; he simply practiced the art of \"making others come to you.\" If on one occasion you make it a point of dignity that others must come to you and you succeed, they will continue to do so even after you stop trying. Image: The Honeyed Bear Tr ap . The bear hunter does not chase his prey; a bear that knows it is hunted is nearly impossible to catch and is fero­cious if cornered. Instead, the hunter lays traps baited with honey. He does not exhaust himself and risk his life in pursuit He baits, then waits. Authority: Good warriors make others come to them, and do not go to others. This is the principle of emptiness and fullness of others and self. When you induce oppo­nents to come to you, then their fo rce is always empty; as long as you do not go to them, your fo rce is always full. Attack­ing emptiness with fullness is like throwing stones on eggs.

Instead of making others come to you, you go to them, force the issue, take the lead. Fast attack can be an awesome weapon, for it forces the other person to react without the time to think or plan. With no time to think, people make errors of judgment, and are thrown on the defensive. This tactic is the ob­verse of waiting and baiting, but it serves the same function: You make your enemy respond on your terms. Men like Cesare Borgia and Napoleon used the element of speed to in­timidate and control. A rapid and unforeseen move is terrifying and de­moralizing. You must choose YOUf tactics depending on the situation. If you have time on YOUf side, and know that you and your enemies are at least at equal strength, then deplete their strength by making them come to you.

He had seen a couple of hefty ship's masts in a shipyard in Athens a few days before, and he ordered that the larger of these be sent to hirn immediately. The military engineer in Athens who received the order fe it certain that the consul really wanted the smaller of the masts. He argued endlessly with the soldiers who delivered the request: The smaller mast, he told them, was much better suited to the task. And indeed it would be easier to transport. The soldiers warned the engineer that their master was not a man to argue with, but he insisted that the smaller mast would be the only one that would work with a machine that he was constructing to go with it. He drew diagram after diagram, and went so far as to say that he was the expert and they had no clue what they were talking about. The soldiers knew their leader and at last convinced the engineer that it would be better to swallow his expertise and obey. After they left, though, the engineer thought about it some more. What was the point, he asked hirnself, in obeying an order that would lead to fail­ure? And so he sent the smaller mast, confident that the consul would see how much more effective it was and reward hirn justly. When the smaller mast arrived, Mucianus asked his soldiers for an ex­planation. They described to hirn how the engineer had argued endlessly for the smaller mast, but had finally promised to send the larger one. Mu­cianus went into a rage. He could not concentrate on the siege, or consider the importance of breaching the walls before the town received reinforce­ments. All he could think about was the impudent engineer, whom he or­dered to be brought to hirn immediately. Arriving a few days later, the engineer gladly explained to the consul, one more time, the reasons for the smaller mast. He went on and on, using the same arguments he had made with the soldiers. He said it was wise to listen to experts in these matters, and if the attack was only tried with the battering ram he had sent, the consul would not regret it. Mucianus let hirn finish, then had him stripped naked before the soldiers and flogged and scourged with rods until he died. Interpretation The engineer, whose name has not been recorded by history, had spent his life designing masts and pillars, and was respected as the finest engineer in a city that had excelled in the science. He knew that he was right. A smaller ram would allow more speed and carry more force. Larger is not necessar­ily better. Of course the consul would see his logic, and would eventually understand that science is neutral and reason superior. How could the con­sul possibly persist in his ignorance if the engineer showed him detailed di­agrams and explained the theories behind his advice? The military engineer was the quintessence of the Arguer, a type found everywhere among uso The Arguer does not understand that words"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"are never neutral, and that by arguing with a superior he impugns the intel­ligenee of one more powerful than he. He also has no awareness of the per­son he is dealing with. Sinee each man believes that he is right, and words will rarely eonvinee hirn otherwise, the arguer's reasoning falls on deaf ears. When eornered, he only argues more, digging his own grave. Onee he has made the other person feel inseeure and inferior in his beliefs, the eloquenee of Socrates could not save the situation. It is not simply a question of avoiding an argument with those who stand above you. We all believe we are masters in the realm of opinions and reasoning. You must be careful, then: Learn to demonstrate the cor­rectness of your ideas indirectly. OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW In 1502, in Florenee, Italy, an enormous block of marble stood in the works department of the church of Santa Maria deI Fiore. It had once been a magnificent piece of raw stone, but an unskillful sculptor had mistakenly bored a hole through it where there should have been a figure's legs, gen­erally mutilating it. Piero Soderini, Florence's mayor, had contemplated trying to save the block by eommissioning Leonardo da Vinci to work on it, or some other master, but had given up, since everyone agreed that the stone had been ruined. So, despite the money that had been wasted on it, it gathered dust in the dark halls of the church. This was where things stood until some Florentine friends of the great Michelangelo decided to write to the artist, then living in Rome. He alone, they said, could do something with the marble, which was still magnificent raw material. Michelangelo traveled to Florence, examined the stone, and eame to the conclusion that he could in fact carve a fine figure from it, by adapting the pose to the way the rock had been mutilated. Soderini argued that this was a waste of time-nobody could salvage such a disaster-but he finally agreed to let the artist work on it. Michelangelo decided he would depict a young David, sling in hand. Weeks later, as Michelangelo was putting the final touch es on the statue, Soderini entered the studio. Fancying hirnself a bit of a connoisseur, he studied the huge work, and told Michelangelo that while he thought it was magnificent, the nose, he judged, was too big. Michelangelo realized that Soderini was standing in a place right under the giant figure and did not have the proper perspeetive. Without a word, he gestured for Soderini to fo llow hirn up the scaffolding. Reaching the nose, he picked up his ehisel, as well as a bit of marble dust that lay on the planks. With Soderini just a few feet below hirn on the scaffolding, Michelangelo started to tap lightly with the ehisel, letting the bits of dust he had gathered in his hand to fall little by little. He actually did nothing to change the nose, but gave every appearance of working on it. Mter a few minutes of this charade he stood aside: \"Look at it now.\" \"I like it better,\" replied Soderini, \"you've made it come alive.\" dogs. lIe ofJ,'red Ihis man the one hundred gold pieces (lnd said. \"LeI me look aJler Ihe dogs Jo r ten days. \" The hunlsrnan agre<'d. anti Jo r Ihe nexl ten day.\\· the vizier cared fo r fhe hellsls wilh greal alIen­Iion, grooming Ihem weil and fe eding thCln h(/fulsomely.

At first the Egyptians were inclined to be contemp­tuous, and did not think much of him because ofhis humble and undistinguished origin; but later on he cleverly brought them to heel, without having recourse to harsh measures. Amongst his innumer­able treasures, he had a gold footbath, whieh he and his guests used on occasion to wash their feet in. This he broke up, and with the mate­rial had a statue made to one of the gods, which he then set up in what he thought the most suitable spot in the city. The Egyptians constantly eoming upon the statue, treated it with profound re ver­enee, and as soon as Amasis heard of the effeet it had upon them, he cal/ed a meeting and revealed the fa ct that the deeply revered statue was unce a fo ot­bath, which they washed their feet and pissed and vomited in.

Yet Soderini was a patron who prided hirnself on his aesthetic judgment. To offend such a man by arguing would not only gain Michelangelo nothing, it would put future commissions in jeopardy. Michelangelo was too clever to argue. His solution was to change Soderini's perspective (literally bringing hirn closer to the no se) without making hirn reaHze that this was the cause of bis misperception. Fortunately for posterity, Michelangelo found a way to keep the per­f�ction of the statue intact while at the same time making Soderini believe he had improved it. Such is the double power of winning through actions rather than argument: No one is offended, and your point is proven. KEYS TO POWER In the realm of power you must leam to judge your moves by their long­term effects on other people. The problem in trying to prove a point or gain a victory through argument is that in the end you can never be certain how it affects the people you're arguing with: They may appear to agree with you politely, but inside they may resent you. Or perhaps something you said inadvertently even offended them-words have that insidious ability to be interpreted according to the other person's mood and insecuri­ties. Even the best argument has no solid foundation, for we have all come to distrust the slippery nature of words. And days after agreeing with some­one, we often revert to our old opinion out of sheer habit. Understand this: Words are a dime a dozen. Everyone knows that in the heat of an argument, we will all say anything to support our cause. We will quote the Bible, refer to unverifiable statistics. Who can be persuaded by bags of air like that? Action and demonstration are much more power­ful and meaningful. They are there, before our eyes, for us to se�\"Yes, now the statue's no se does look just right.\" There are no offensive words, no possibility of misinterpretation. No one can argue with a demonstrated proof. As Baltasar Graciän remarks, \"The truth is generally seen, rarely heard.\" Sir Christopher Wren was England's version of the Renaissance man. He had mastered the sciences of mathematics, astronomy, physics, and physiology. Yet during bis extremely long career as England's most cele­brated architect he was often told by his patrons to make impractical changes in his designs. Never once did he argue or offend. He had other ways of proving his point. In 1688 Wren designed a magnificent town hall for the city of West­minster. The mayor, however, was not satisfied; in fact he was nervous. He told Wren he was afraid the second floor was not seeure, and that it could all come crashing down on his office on the first floor. He demanded that Wren add two stone columns for extra support. Wren, the consummate en­gineer, knew that these columns would serve no purpose, and that the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"mayor's fe ars were baseless. But build them he did, and the mayor was grateful. It was only years later that workmen on a high scaffold saw that the columns stopped just short of the ceiling. They were dummies. But both men got what they wanted: The mayor could relax, and Wren knew posterity would understand that his original design worked and the columns were unnecessary. The power of demonstrating your idea is that your opponents do not get defensive, and are therefore more open to persuasion. Making them lit­erally and physically fe el your meaning is infinitely more powerful than ar­gument. A heckler once interrupted Nikita Khrushchev in the middle of a speech in which he was denouncing the crimes of Stalin. \"You were a col­league of Stalin's,\" the heckler yelled, \"why didn't you stop hirn then?\" Khrushschev apparently could not see the heckler and barked out, \"Who said that?\" No hand went up. No one moved a muscle. After a few seconds of tense silen ce, Khrushchev finally said in a quiet voice, \"Now you know why I didn't stop hirn.\" Instead of just arguing that anyone facing Stalin was afraid, knowing that the slightest sign of rebellion would mean certain death, he had made them feel what it was like to fa ce Stalin-had made them fe el the paranoia, the fe ar of speaking up, the terror of confronting the leader, in this case Khrushchev. The demonstration was visceral and no more argument was necessary. The most powerful persuasion goes beyond action into symbol. The power of a symbol-a flag, a mythic story, a monument to some emotional event-is that everyone understands you without anything being said. In 1975, when Henry Kissinger was engaged in some frustrating negotiations with the Israelis over the return of part of the Sinai desert that they had seized in the 1967 war, he suddenly broke off a tense meeting and decided to do some sight-seeing. He paid a visit to the ruins of the ancient fo rtress of Masada, known to all Israelis as the place where seven hundred J ewish warriors committed mass suicide in A.D. 73 rather than give in to the Roman troops besieging them. The Israelis instantly understood the mes­sage of Kissinger's visit: He was indirectly accusing them of courting mass suicide. Although the visit did not by itself change their minds, it made them think far more seriously than any direct warning would have. Sym­bols like this one carry great emotional significance. When aiming fo r power, or trying to conserve it, always look for the in direct route. And also choose your battles carefully. If it does not matter in the long run whether the other person agrees with you-or if time and their own experience will make them understand what you mean-then it is best not even to bother with a demonstration.

But one Sheriff Richards,"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"of Remsen County, Oklahoma, was not the kind of man to accept being conned out of $10,000, and one moming he tracked Lustig down to a hotel in Chicago.

Did you operate it properly?\" \"I did exactly what you told me to do,\" said the sheriff. \"No, you must have done something wrong,\" said Lustig. The argument went in circles. The barrel of the gun was gently low­ered. Lustig next went to phase two in the argument tactic: He poured out a whole bunch of technical gobbledygook ab out the box's operation, com­pletely beguiling the sheriff, who now appeared less sure of himself and ar­gued less fo rcefully. \"Look,\" said Lustig, \"1'11 give you your money back right now. 1'11 also give you written instructions on how to work the ma­chine and 1'11 come out to Oklahoma to make sure it's working properly.

Taking the name Lola Montez (her mother was of distant Spanish descent), she claimed to be a flamenco dancer from Spain. By 1845 her career was languishing, and to survive she became a courtesan-quickly one of the more successful in Paris. Only one man could salvage Lola's dancing career: Alexandre Du­jarier, owner of the newspaper with the largest circulation in France, and also the newspaper's drama critic. She decided to woo and conquer hirn. Investigating his habits, she discovered that he went riding every morning. An excellent horsewoman herself, she rode out one moming and \"acciden­talIy\" ran into hirn. Soon they were riding together every day. A few weeks later Lola moved into his apartment. For a while the two were happy together. With Dujarier's help, Lola began to revive her dancing career. Despite the risk to his social standing, Dujarier told fr iends he would marry her in the spring. (Lola had never told hirn that she had eloped at age nineteen with an Englishman, and was stilliegally married.) Although Dujarier was deeply in love, rns life started to slide downhill. His fo rtunes in business changed and influential fr iends began to avoid hirn. One night Dujarier was invited to a party, attended by some of the wealthiest young men in Paris. Lola wanted to go too but he would not allow it. They had their first quarrel, and Dujarier attended the party by hirnself. There, hopelessly drunk, he insulted an influential drama critic, Jean-Baptiste Rosemond de Beauvalion, perhaps because of something the critic had said about Lola. The fo llowing morning Beauvalion challenged hirn to a duel. Beauvalion was one of the best pistol shots in France. Du­jarier tried to apologize, but the duel took place, and he was shot and killed. Thus ended the life of one of the most promising young men of Paris society. Devastated, Lola left Paris. In 1846 Lola Montez found herself in Munich, where she decided to woo and conquer King Ludwig of Bavaria. The best way to Ludwig, she discovered, was through his aide-de-camp, Count Otto von Rechberg, a man with a fo ndness for pretty girls. One day when the count was break­fa sting at an outdoor cafe, Lola rode by on her horse, was \"accidentally\" thrown fr om the saddle, and landed at Rechberg's fe et. The count rushed to help her and was enchanted. He promised to introduce her to Ludwig. Rechberg arranged an audience with the king for Lola, but when she arrived in the anteroom, she could hear the king saying he was too busy to meet a fa vor-seeking stranger. Lola pushed aside the sentries and entered his roorn anyway. In the process, the fr ont of her dress somehow got tom (perhaps by her, perhaps by one of the sentries), and to the astonishment of all, most especially the king, her bare breasts were brazenly exposed. Lola was granted her audience with Ludwig. Fifty-five hours later she made her debut on the Bavarian stage; the reviews were terrible, but that did not stop Ludwig fr om arranging more performances.

He started to appear in public with her on his arm, and then he bought and furnished an apartment for her on one of Munich's most fa shionable boulevards. Al­though he had been known as amiser, and was not given to flights of fancy, he started to shower Lola with gifts and to write poetry for her. Now his favored mistress, she catapulted to farne and fo rtune ovemight. Lola began to lose her sense of proportion. One day when she was out riding, an elderly man rode ahead of her, a bit too slowly for her liking. Unable to pass him, she began to slash hirn with her riding crop. On an­other occasion she took her dog, unleashed, out for a stroll. The dog at­tacked a passerby, but instead of helping the man get the dog away, she whipped hirn with the leash. Incidents like this infuriated the stolid citizens of Bavaria, but Ludwig stood by Lola and even had her naturalized as a Bavarian citizen. The king's entourage tried to wake hirn to the dangers of the affair, but those who criticized Lola were surnmarily fired. While Bavarians who had loved their king now outwardly disre­spected hirn, Lola was made a countess, had a new palace built for herself, and began to dabble in politics, advising Ludwig on policy. She was the most powernd fo rce in the kingdom. Her influence in the king's cabinet continued to grow, and she treated the other ministers with disdain. As a result, riots broke out throughout the realm. A once peacefulland was vir­tually in the grip of civil war, and students everywhere were chanting, ''Raus mit Lola!\" By February of 1848, Ludwig was finally unable to withstand the pres­sure. With great sadness he ordered Lola to leave Bavaria immediately. She left, but not until she was paid off. For the next five weeks the Bavari­ans' wrath was tumed against their fo rmerly beloved king. In March of that year he was fo rced to abdicate. Lola Montez moved to England. More than anything she needed re­spectability, and despite being married (she still had not arranged a divorce fr om the Englishman she had wed years before), she set her sights on George Tr afford Heald, a promising young army officer who was the son of an influential barrister. Although he was ten years younger than Lola, and could have chosen a wife among the prettiest and wealthiest young girls of English society, Heald fell under her speIl. They were married in 1849. Soon ar rested on the charge of bigamy, she skipped bail, and she and Heald made their way to Spain. They quarreled horribly and on one occa­sion Lola slashed him with a knife. Finally, she drove him away. Retuming to England, he fo und he had lost his position in the army. Ostracized fr om English society, he moved to Portugal, where he lived in poverty. After a few months his short life ended in a boating accident. A few years later the man who published Lola Montez's autobiogra­phy went bankrupt In 1853 Lola moved to Califomia, where she met and married a man named Pat Hull. Their relationship was as stormy as all the others, and she left Hull for an other man.

Men were sucked into the maelstrom she churned up around her. They feIt confused, upset, but the strength of the emotions she stirred also made them feel more alive.

They would find themselves drawn into her problems, but their emotional attachment to her would make them want to help her. This was the crucial point of the disease--for Lola Montez could not be helped. Her problems were too deep. Once the lover identified with them, he was lost.

They often present themselves as victims, making it difficult, at first, to see their mis­eries as self-inflicted. Before you realize the real nature of their problems you have been infected by them. Understand this: In the game of power, the people you associate with are critical. The risk of associating with infectors is that you will waste valu­able time and energy trying to free yourself. Through a kind of guilt by as­sociation, you will also suffer in the eyes of others. Never underestimate the dangers of infection. There are many kinds of infector to be aware of, but one of the most insidious is the sufferer from chronic dissatisfaction. Cassius, the Roman conspirator againstJulius Caesar, had the discontent that comes from deep envy. He simply could not endure the presence of anyone of greater talent. Probably because Caesar sensed the man's interminable soumess, he passed hirn up for the position of first praetorship, and gave the position to Brutus instead. Cassius brooded and broorl.ed, his hatred for Caesar be­coming pathological. Brutus himself, a devoted republican, disliked Cae­sar's dictatorship; had he had the patience to wait, he would have become the first man in Rome after Caesar's death, and could have undone the evil that the leader had wrought. But Cassius infected hirn with his own rancor, bending his ear daily with tales of Caesar's evil. He finally won Brutus over to the conspiracy. It was the beginning of a great tragedy. How many mis­fortunes could have been avoided had Brutus learned to fe ar the power of infection. There is only one solution to infection: quarantine. But by the time you recognize the problem it is often too late. A Lola Montez overwhelms you with her forceful personality. Cassius intrigues you with his confiding nature and the depth of his feelings. How can you protect yourself against such insidious viruses? The answer lies in judging people on the effects they have on the world and not on the reasons they give for their prob-Image: A Virus. Unseen, it lems. Infectors can be recognized by the misfortune they draw on them­enters your pores without selves, their turbulent past, their long line of broken relationships, their un­waming, spreading silently and stable careers, and the very force of their character, which sweeps you up slowly. Before you are aware of and makes you lose your reason. Be forewarned by these signs of an infec-the infection, it is deep inside you. tor; learn to see the discontent in their eye. Most important of all, do not take pity. Do not enmesh yourself in trying to help. The infector will re­main unchanged, but you will be unhinged. The other side of infection is equally valid, and perhaps more readily understood: There are people who attract happiness to themselves by their good cheer, natural buoyancy, and intelligence. They are a source of plea­sure, and you must associate with them to share in the prosperity they draw upon themselves."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"This applies to more than good cheer and success: All positive quali­ties can infect uso Talleyrand had many strange and intimidating traits, but most agreed that he surpassed all Frenchmen in graciousness, aristocratic charm, and wit. Indeed he came from one of the oldest noble families in the country, and despite his belief in democracy and the French Republic, he retained his courtly manners. His contemporary Napoleon was in many ways the opposite--a peasant from Corsica, tacitum and ungracious, even violent. There was no one Napoleon admired more than Ta lleyrand. He en­vied his minister's way with people, his wit and his ability to c.l,arm women, and as best he could, he kept Ta lleyrand around him, hoping to soak up the culture he lacked. There is no doubt that Napoleon changed as his rule cvntinued. Many of the rough edges were smoothed by his con­staut association with Ta lleyrand. Use the positive side of this emotional osmosis to advantage. If, for ex­ample, you are miserly by nature, you will never go beyond a certain limit; only generous souls attain greatness. Associate with the generous, then, and they will infect you, opening up everything that is tight and restricted in you. If you are gl oomy, gravitate to the cheerful. If you are prone to iso­lation, fo rce yourself to befriend the gregarious. Never associate with those who share your defects-they will reinforce everything that holds you back. Only create associations with positive affinities. Make this a rule of life and you will benefit more than from all the therapy in the world.

How could the good citizens of Siena reward hirn? No amount of money or honor could possibly compare in value to the preservation of a city's liberty. The citizens thought of making the mercenary the lord of the city, but even that, they decided, wasn't recompense enough. At last one of them stood before the assembly called to debate this matter and said, \"Let us kill hirn and then worship hirn as our patron saint.\" And so they did. The Count of Carmagnola was ene of the bravest and most successful of all the condottieri. In 1442, late in his life, he was in the employ of the city of Ve nice, which was in the midst of a long war with Florence. The count was suddenly recalled to Ve nice. A favorite of the people, he was received there with all kinds of honor and splendor. That evening he was to dine with the doge hirnself, in the doge's palace. On the way into the palace, however, he noticed that the guard was leading hirn in a different direction fr om usual. Crossing the famous Bridge of Sighs, he suddenly realized where they were taking him-to the dunge on. He was convicted on a trumped-up charge and the next day in the Piazza San Marco, before a horrified crowd who could not understand how his fate had changed so drastically, he was beheaded. Interpretation Many of the great condottieri of Renaissance Italy suffered the same fate as the patron saint of Siena and the Count of Carmagnola: They won battle after battle for their employers only to find themselves banished, impris­oned, or executed. The problem was not ingratitude; it was that there were so many other condottieri as able and valiant as they were. They were re­placeable. Nothing was lost by killing them. Meanwhile, the older among them had grown powerful themselves, and wanted more and more money for their services. How much better, then, to do away with them and hire a younger, cheaper mercenary. That was the fate of the Count of Carma­gnola, who had started to act impudently and independently. He had taken his power fo r granted without making sure that he was truly indispensable. Such is the fate (to a less violent degree, one hopes) of those who do not make others dependent on them. Sooner or later someone comes along who can do the job as weIl as they can-someone younger, fr esher, less ex­pensive, less threatening. Be the only one who can do what you do, and make the fate of those who hire you so entwined with yours that they cannot possibly get rid of you.

It was with the king, Frederick William IV. This was an odd choice to say the least, for Frederick was at a low point of his power. A weak, indecisive man, he consistently gave in to the liberals in parlia­ment; in fact he was spineless, and stood for much that Bismarck disliked, personally and politically. Yet Bismarck courted Frederick night and day. When other deputies attacked the king for his many inept moves, only Bis­marck stood by hirn. Finally, it all paid off: In 1851 Bismarck was made a minister in the king's ca))inet. Now he went to work. Time and again he forced the king's hand, getting rum to build up the military, to stand up to the liberals, to do exactly as Bismarck wished. He worked on Frederick's insecurity about his manliness, challenging rum to be firm and to mle with pride. And he slowly restored the king's powers until the monarchy was once again the most powernd force in Prussia. When Frederick died, in 1861, his brother William assumed the throne. William disliked Bismarck intensely and had no intention of keep­ing hirn around. But he also inherited the same situation his brother had: enernies galore, who wanted to rubble his power away. He actually consid­ered abdicating, feeling he lacked the strength to deal with this dangerous and precarious position. But Bismarck insinuated hirnself once again. He stood by the new king, gave hirn strength, and urged hirn into firm and de­cisive action. The king grew dependent on Bismarck's strong-arm tactics to keep his enemies at bay, and despite his antipathy toward the man, he soon made rum his prime minister. The two quarreled often over policy­Bismarck was much more conservative-but the king understood his own dependency. Whenever the prime minister threatened to resign, the king gave in to rum, time after time. It was in fact Bismarck who set state policy. Years later, Bismarck's actions as Prussia's prime minister led the vari­ous German state� to be united into one country. Now Bismarck finagled the king into letting hirnself be crowned emperor of Germany. Yet it was really Bismarck who had reached the heights of power. As right-hand man to the emperor, and as imperial chancellor and knighted prince, he pulled all the levers. Interpretation Most young and ambitious politicians looking out on the politicallandscape of 1840s Germany would have tried to build a power base among those with the most power. Bismarck saw different. Joirung forces with the pow­ernd can be foolish: They will swallow you up, just as the doge of Venice swallowed up the Count of Carmagnola. No one will come to depend on you if they are already strong. If you are ambitious, it is much wiser to seek out weak mlers or masters with whom you can create a relationsrup of de­pendency. You become their strength, their intelligence, their spine. What power you hold! If they got rid of you the whole edifice would collapse."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Necessity mIes the world.

Thus a wise prince will think 0/ ways to keep his citizens 0/ every sar t and under every circumstance dependent on the state and on him; and then they will always be trustworthy. Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527 KEYS TO POWER The ultimate power is the power to get people to do as you wish. When you can do this without having to fo rce people or hurt them, when they will­ingly grant you what you desire, then your power is untouchable. The best way to achieve this position is to create a relationship of dependence. The master requires your services; he is weak, or unable to function without you; you have enmeshed yourself in his work so deeply that doing away with you would bring hirn great difficulty, or at least would mean valuable time lost in training another to replace you. Once such a relationship is es­tablished you have the upper hand, the leverage to make the master do as you wish. It is the classic case of the man behind the throne, the servant of the king who actually controls the king. Bismarck did not have to bully ei­ther Frederick or William into doing his bidding. He simply made it clear that unless he got what he wanted he would walk away, leaving the king to twist in the wind. Both kings soon danced tn Bismarck's tune. Do not be one of the many who mistakenly believe that the ultimate form of power is independence. Power involves a relationship between people; you will always need others as allies, pawns, or even as weak mas­ters who serve as your fr ont. The completely independent man would live in a cabin in the woods-he would have the fr eedom to come and go as he pleased, but he would have no power. The best you can hope fo r is that others will grow so dependent on you that you enjoy a kind of reverse in­dependence: Their need fo r you fr ees you. Louis XI (1423-1483), the great Spider King of France, had a weak­ness for astrology. He kept a court astrologer whom he admired, until one day the man predicted that a lady of the court would die within eight days. When the prophecy came true, Louis was terrified, thinking that either the man had murdered the woman to prove his accuracy or that he was so versed in his science that his powers threatened Louis hirnself. In either case he had to be killed. One evening Louis summoned the astrologer to his room, high in the castle.

The astrologer so on arrived, but before giving the signal, Louis de-­cided to ask him one last question: \"You claim to understand astrology and to know the fate of others, so tell me what your fate will be and how long you have to live.\" \"I shall die just three days before Your Majesty,\" the astrologer replied. The king's signal was never given. The man's life was spared. The Spider King not only protected bis astrologer for as long as he was alive, he lav­ished him with gifts and had him tended by the finest court doctors. The astrologer survived Louis by several years, disproving his power of prophecy but proving his mastery of power. This is the model: Make others dependent on you. To get rid of you might spell disaster, even death, and your master dares not tempt fate by finding out. There are many ways to obtain such aposition. Foremost among them is to possess a talent and creative skill that simply cannot be replaced. During the Renaissance, the major obstacle to a painter's success was finding the right patron. Michelangelo did this better than anyone else: His patron was Pope Julius H. But he and the pope quarreled over the building of the pope's marble tomb, and Michelangelo left Rome in disgust. To the amazement of those in the pope's circle, not only did the pope not fire him, he sought him out and in his own haughty way begged the artist to stay. Michelangelo, he knew, could find another patron, but he could never find another Michelangelo. You do not have to have the talent of a Michelangelo; you do have to have a skill that sets you apart from the crowd. You should create a situa­tion in which you can always latch on to another master or patron but your master cannot easily find another servant with your particular talent. And if, in reality, you are not actually indispensable, you must find a way to make it look as if you are. Having the appearance of specialized knowledge and skill gives you leeway in your ability to deceive those above you into thinking they cannot do without you. Real dependence on your master's part, however, leaves him more vulnerable to you than the faked variety, and it is always within your power to make your skill indispensable. This is what is meant by the intertwining of fates: Like creeping ivy, you have wrapped yourself around the source of power, so that it would cause great trauma to cut you away. And you do not necessarily have to en­twine yourself around the master; another person will do, as long as he or she too is indispensable in the chain. One day Harry Cohn, president of Columbia Pictures, was visited in his office by a gloomy group of his executives. It was 1951, when the witch­hunt against Communists in Hollywood, carried on by the U.S. Congress's House Un-American Activities Committee, was at its height. The execu­tives had bad news: One of their employees, the screenwriter John Howard Lawson, had been singled out as a Communist. They had to get rid of him right away or suffer the wrath of the committee."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Harry Cohn was no bleeding-heart liberal; in fact, he had always been a die-hard Republican. His favorite politician was Benito Mussolini, whom he had once vis­ited, and whose framed photo hung on his wall. If there was someone he hated Cohn would call him a \"Communist bastard.\" But to the executives' amazement Cohn told them he would not fire Lawson. He did not keep the screenwriter on because he was a good writer-there were many good writers in Hollywood. He kept hirn because of achain of dependence: Lawson was Humphrey Bogart's writer and Bogart was Columbia's star. If Cohn messed with Lawson he would ruin an immensely profitable rela­tionship. That was worth more than the terrible publicity brought to hirn by his defiance of the committee. Henry Kissinger managed to survive the many bloodlettings that went on in the Nixon White House not because he was the best diplomat Nixon could find-there were other fine negotiators-and not because the two men got along so well: They did not. Nor did they share their beliefs and politics. Kissinger survived because he entrenched hirnself in so many areas of the political structure that to do away with hirn would lead to chaos. Michelangelo's power was intensive, depending on one skilI, his abil­ity as an artist; Kissinger's was extensive. He got hirnself involved in so many aspects and departments of the administration that his involvement became a card in his hand. It also made hirn many allies. If you can arrange such a position for yourself, getting rid of you becomes dangerous-all sorts of interdependencies will unravel. Still, the intensive fo rm of power provides more freedom than the extensive, because those who have it depend on no particular master, or particular position of power, for their security. To make others dependent on you, one route to take is the secret­intelligence tactic. By knowing other people's secrets, by holding informa­tion that they wouldn't want broadcast, you seal your fate with theirs. You are untouchable. Ministers of secret police have held this position through­out the ages: They can make or break a king, or, as in the case of J. Edgar Hoover, a president. But the role is so full of insecurities and paranoia that the power it provides almost cancels itself out. You cannot rest at ease, and what good is power if it brings you no peace? One last waming: Do not imagine that your master's dependence on you will make him love you. In fact, he may resent and fe ar you. But, as Machiavelli said, it is better to be fe ared than loved. Fear you can control; love, never. Depending on an emotion as subtle and changeable as love or friendship will only make you insecure. Better to have others depend on you out of fear of the consequences of losing you than out of love of your company. LAW 11 87"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Image: Vines with Many Thorns.

(Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) The weakness of making others depend on you is that you are in some measure dependent on them. But trying to move beyond that point means getting rid of those above you-it means standing alone, depending on no one. Such is the monopolistic drive of aJ. P. Morgan or aJohn D. Rocke­feller-to drive out all competition, to be in complete control. If you can corner the market, so much the better. No such independence comes without a price. You are fo rced to isolate yourself. Monopolies often turn inward and destroy themselves fr om the in­ternal pressure. They also stir up powernd resentment, making their ene­mies bond together to fight them. The drive for complete control is often ruinous and fruitless. Interdependence remains the law, independence a rare and often fatal exception.

Speaking with an elegant Continental accent, the man introduced hirnself as Count Victor Lustig. He promised that if Capone gave hirn $50,000 he could double it. Capone had more than enough funds to cover the \"investment,\" but he wasn't in the habit of entrusting large sums to total strangers. He looked the count over: Some­thing about the man was different-his classy style, his manner-and so Capone decided to play along. He counted out the bills personally and handed them to Lustig. \"Okay, Count,\" said Capone. \"Double it in sixty days like you said.\" Lustig left with the money, put it in a safe-deposit box in Chicago, then headed to New York, where he had several other money­making schemes in progress. The $50,000 remained in the bank box untouched. Lustig made no ef­fo rt to double it. Two months later he retumed to Chicago, took the money fr om the box, and paid Capone another visit. He looked at the gangster's stony-faced bodyguards, smiled apologetically, and said, \"Please accept my profound regrets, Mr. Capone. l'm sorry to report that the plan failed ... 1 failed.\" Capone slowly stood up. He glowered at Lustig, debating which part of the river to throw hirn in. But the count reached into his coat pocket, withdrew the $50,000, and placed it on the desk. \"Here, sir, is your money, to the penny. Again, my sincere apologies. This is most embarrassing. Things didn't work out the way 1 thought they would. 1 would have loved to have doubled your money for you and for myself-Lord knows 1 need it-but the plan just didn't materialize.\" Capone sagged back into his chair, confused. \"I know you're a con man, Count,\" said Capone. \"I knew it the moment you walked in here. 1 expected either one hundred thousand dollars or nothing. But this . .. get­ting my money back ... well.\" \"Again my apologies, Mr. Capone,\" said Lustig, as he picked up his hat and began to leave. \"My God! You're hon­est!\" yelled Capone. \"If you're on the spot, here's five to help you along.\" He counted out five one-thousand-dollar bills out of the $50,000. The count seemed stunned, bowed deeply, mumbled his thanks, and left, tak­ing the money. The $5,000 was what Lustig had been after all along. Interpretation Count Victor Lustig, a man who spoke severallanguages and prided him­self on his refinement and culture, was one of the great con artists of mod­em times. He was known for his audacity, his fe arlessness, and, most important, his knowledge of human psychology. He could size up a man in minutes, discovering his weaknesses, and he had radar for suckers. Lustig knew that most men build up defenses against crooks and other trouble­makers. The con artist's job is to bring those defenses down. One sure way to do this is through an act of apparent sincerity and honesty. Who will distrust a person literally caught in the act of being hon-"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"est? Lustig used selective honesty many times, but with Capone he went a step further. No normal con man would have dared such a con; he would have chosen his suckers for their meekness, for that look about them that says they will take their medicine without complaint. Con Capone and you would spend the rest of your life (whatever remained of it) afraid. But Lustig understood that a man like Capone spends his life rrlistrusting oth­ers. No one around hirn is honest or generous, and being so much in the company of wolves is exhausting, even depressing. A man like Capone yearns to be the recipient of an honest or generous gesture, to fe el that not everyone has an angle or is out to rob hirn. Lustig's act of selective honesty disarmed Capone because it was so unexpected. A con artist loves conflicting emotions like these, since the person caught up in them is so easily distracted and deceived. Do not shy away from practicing this law on the Capones of the world. With a well-timed gesture of honesty or generosity, you will have the most brutal and cynical beast in the kingdom eating out of your hand. Everything turns gray when I don 't have at least one mark on the horizon. Life then seems empty and depressing. I cannot understand honest men. They lead desperate lives, fu ll of boredom. CO/IIII \"ir/or j,nl/ig, /891J-/'N7 KEYS TO POWER The essence of deception is distraction. Distracting the people you want to deceive gives you the time and space to do something they won't notice, An act of kindness, generosity, or honesty is often the most powerful fo rm of distraction because it disarms other people's suspicions, It turns them into children, eagerly lapping up any kind of affectionate gesture. In ancient China this was called \"giving before you take\"-the giving makes it hard for the other person to notice the taking. It is a device with infinite practical uses. Brazenly taking something fr om someone is danger­ous, even for the powerful. The victim will plot revenge, It is also danger­ous simply to ask for what you need, no matter how politely: Unless the other person sees some gain for themselves, they may come to resent your neediness. Learn to give before you take. It softens the ground, takes the bite out of a future request, or simply creates a distraction. And the giving can take many fo rms: an actual gift, a generous act, a kind fa vor, an \"hon­est\" admission-whatever it takes, Selective honesty is best employed on your first encounter with some­one. We are all creatures of habit, and our first impressions last a long time. If someone believes you are honest at the start of your relationship it takes a lot to convince them otherwise. This gives you room to maneuver. Jay Gould, like Al Capone, was a man who distrusted everyone. By the time he was thirty-three he was already a multimillionaire, mostly through deception and strong-arming. In the late 1860s, Gould in­vested heavily in the Erle Railroad, then discovered that the market had LAW 12 91"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"92 LAW 12 been flooded with a vast amount of phony stock certificates for the com­pany. He stood to lose a fortune and to suff er a lot of embarrassment. In the midst ofthis crlsis, a man named LordJohn Gordon-Gordon of­fered to help. Gordon-Gordon, a Scottish lord, had apparendy made a small fortune investing in railroads. By hirlng some handwriting experts· Gordon-Gordon was able to prove to Gould that the culprlts for the phony stock certificates were actu­ally several top executives with the Erle Railroad itself. Gould was grateful. Gordon-Gordon then proposed that he and Gould join forces to buy up a controlling interest in Erle. Gould agreed. For a while the venture ap­peared to prosper. The two men were now good friends, and every time Gordon-Gordon came to Gould asking for money to buy more stock, Gould gave it to him. In 1873, however, Gordon-Gordon suddenly dumped all of his stock, making a fortune but drastically lowering the value of Gould's own holdings. Then he disappeared from sight. Upon investigation, Gould found out that Gordon-Gordon's real name was John Crowningsfield, and that he was the bastard son of a merchant seaman and a London barmaid. There had been many clues before then that Gordon-Gordon was a con man, but his initial act of honesty and sup­port had so blinded Gould that it took the loss of millions for hirn to see through the scheme. A single act of honesty is often not enough. What is required is a repu­tation for honesty, built on a serles of acts--but these can be quite inconse­quential. Once this reputation is established, as with first impressions, it is hard to shake. In ancient China, Duke Wu of CMng decided it was time to take over the increasingly powerful kingdom of Hu. Telling no one of his plan, he married his daughter to Hu' s roler. He then called a council and asked his ministers, \"I am considering a military campaign. Which country should we invade?\" As he had expected, one of his ministers replied, \"Hu should be invaded.\" The duke seemed angry, and said, \"Hu is a sister state now. Why do you suggest invading her?\" He had the minister executed for his impolitic remark. The ruler of Hu heard about this, and considerlng other tokens ofW u's honesty and the marriage with his daughter, he took no pre­cautions to defend hirnself from Cheng. A few weeks later, Cheng forces swept through Hu and took the country, never to relinquish it. Honesty is one of the best ways to disarm the wary, but it is not the only one. Any kind of noble, apparendy selfless act will serve. Perhaps the best such act, though, is one of generosity. Few people can resist a gUt, even from the most hardened enemy, which is why it is often the perfect way to disarm people. A gift brings out the child in us, instandy lowerlng our de­fenses. Although we often view other people's actions in the most cynical light, we rarely see the Machiavellian element of a gift, which quite often hides ulterlor motives. A gift is the perfect object in which to hide a decep­tive move. Over three thousand years ago the ancient Greeks traveled across the sea to recapture the beautiful Helen, stolen away from them by Paris, and"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"to destroy Paris's city, Troy. The siege lasted ten years, many heroes died, yet neither side had come elose to victory. One day, the prophet Calchas assembled the Greeks. \"Stop battering away at these walls!\" he told them. \"You must find some other way, some ruse. We cannot take Troy by fo rce alone. We I mag e: T h e must find some cunning stratagern.\" The cun-Trojan Horse. ning Greek leader Odysseus then came up Y 0 u r g u i lei s with the idea of building a giant wooden horse, hidden inside hiding soldiers inside it, then offering it to the a magnificent Trojans as a gift. Neoptolemus, son of gift that proves Achilles, was disgusted with this idea; it was irresistible to unmanly. Better fo r th ousands to die on the YOUf opponent. battlefield than to gain victory so deceitfully. The walls open. But the soldiers, fa ced with a choice between Once inside, another ten years of manliness, honor, and wreak havoc. death, on the one hand and a quick victory on the other, chose the horse, which was promptly built. The trick was successful and Troy fe ll. One gift did more for the Greek cause than ten years of fighting. Selective kindness should also be part of your arsenal of deception. For years the ancient Romans had besieged the city of the Faliscans, always un­su ccessfully. One day, however, when the Roman general Camillus was encamped outside the city, he suddenly saw a man leading some children toward hirn. The man was a Faliscan teacher, and the children, it turned out, were the sons and daughters of the noblest and wealthiest citizens of the town. On the pretense of taking these children out fo r a walk, he had led them straight to the Romans, offering them as hostages in hopes of in­gratiating hirnself with Camillus, the city's enemy. Camillus did not take the children hostage. He stripped the teacher, tied his hands behind his back, gave each child a rod, and let them whip him all the way back to the city. The gesture had an immediate effect on the Faliscans. Had Camillus used the children as hostages, some in the city would have voted to surrender. And even if the Faliscans had gone on fighting, their resistance would have been halfhearted. Camillus's refusal to take advantage of the situation broke down the Faliscans' resistance, and they surrendered. The general had calculated correctly. And in any case he had had nothing to lose: He knew that the ho stage ploy would not have ended the war, at least not right away. By tuming the situation around, he earned his enemy's trust and respect, disarming them. Selective kindness will often break down even the most stubborn foe: Aiming right for the heart, it corrodes the will to fight back. Remember: By playing on people's emotions, calculated acts of kind­ness can turn a Capone into a gullible child. As with any emotional ap­proach, the tactic must be practiced with caution: If people see through it, their disappointed fe elings of gratitude and warmth will become the most violent hatred and distrust. Unless you can make the gesture seem sincere and heartfelt, do not play with fire.

Count Lustig, pulling the biggest con of his career, was about to sell the Eiffel Tower to an unsuspecting industrialist who believed the govern­ment was auctioning it off for scrap metal. The industrialist was prepared to hand over a huge sum of money to Lustig, who had successfully imper­sonated a government official. At the last minute, however, the mark was suspicious. Something about Lustig bothered hirn. At the meeting in which he was to hand over the money, Lustig sensed his sudden distrust. Leaning over to the industrialist, Lustig explained, in a low whisper, how low his salary was, how difficult his finances were, on and on. After a fe w minutes of this, the industrialist realized that Lustig was asking for a bribe. For the first time he relaxed. Now he knew he could trust Lustig: Since all government officials were dishonest, Lustig had to be real. The man forked over the money. By acting dishonest, Lustig seemed the real McCoy. In this case selective honesty would have had the opposite effect. As the French diplomat Talleyrand grew older, his reputation as a mas­ter liar and deceiver spread. At the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815), he would spin fa bulous stories and make impossible remarks to people who knew he had to be lying. His dishonesty had no purpose except to cloak the moments when he really was deceiving them. One day, for example, among fr iends, Talleyrand said with apparent sincerity, \"In business one ought to show one's hand.\" No one who heard him could believe their ears: A man who never once in his life had shown his cards was telling other people to show theirs. Tactics like this made it impossible to distin­guish Talleyrand's real deceptions from his fake ones. By embracing his reputation for dishonesty, he preserved his ability to deceive.

SIXTH CENTURY B.C. 96 LAW 13 TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW In the early fourteenth century, a young man named Castruccio Castracani rose from the rank of common soldier to become lord of the great city of Lucca, Italy. One of the most powerful families in the city, the Poggios, had been instrumental in his climb (which succeeded through treachery and bloodshed), but after he came to power, they came to fe el he had for­gotten them. His ambition outweighed any gratitude he feh. In 1325, while Castruccio was away fighting Lucca's main rival, Florence, the Poggios conspired with other noble families in the city to rid themselves of this troublesome and ambitious prince. Mounting an insurrection, the plotters attacked and murdered the gov­emor whom Castruccio had left behind to rule the city. Riots broke out, and the Castruccio supporters and the Poggio supporters were poised to do battle. At the height of the tension, however, Stefano di Poggio, the oldest member of the family, intervened, and made both sides lay down their arms. A peaceful man, Stefano had not taken part in the conspiracy. He had told his family it would end in a useless bloodbath. Now he insisted he should intercede on the family's behalf and persuade Castruccio to listen to their complaints and satisfy their demands. Stefano was the oldest and wis­est member of the clan, and his family agreed to put their trust in his diplo­macy rather than in their weapons. When news of the rebellion reached Castruccio, he hurried back to Lucca. By the time he arrived, however, the fighting had ceased, through Stefano's agency, and he was surprised by the city's calm and peace. Ste­fano di Poggio had imagined that Castruccio would be grateful to him for his part in quelling the rebellion, so he paid the prince a visit. He explained how he had brought peace, then begged for Castruccio's mercy. He said that the rebels in his family were young and impetuous, hungry for power yet inexperienced; he recalled his farnily's past generosity to Castruccio. For an these reasons, he said, the great prince should pardon the Poggios and listen to their complaints. This, he said, was the only just thing to do, since the fa mily had willingly laid down their arms and had always sup­ported him. Castruccio listened patiently. He seemed not the slightest bit angry or resentful. Instead, he told Stefano to rest assured that justice would prevail, and he asked him to bring his entire family to the palace to talk over their grievances and come to an agreement. As they took leave of one another, Castruccio said he thanked God for the chance he had been given to show his clemency and kindness. That evening the entire Poggio family came to the palace. Castruccio immediately had them imprisoned and a few days later all were executed, including Stefano. Interpretation Stefano di Poggio is the embodiment of all those who believe that the jus­tice and nobility of their cause will prevail. Certainly appeals to justice and gratitude have occasionally succeeded in the past, but more often than not"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"they have had dire consequences, especially in dealings with the Castruc­cios of the world. Stefano knew that the prince had risen to power through treachery and ruthlessness. This was a man, after all, who had put a elose and devoted friend to death. When Castruccio was told that it had been a terrible wrong to kill such an old friend, he replied that he had executed not an old friend but a new enemy. A man like Castruccio knows only force and self-interest. When the re­bellion began, to end it and place oneself at his mercy was the most dan­gerous possible move. Even once Stefano di Poggio had made that fatal mistake, however, he still had options: He could have offered money to Castruccio, could have made promises for the future, could have pointed out what the Poggios could still contribute to Castruccio's power-their in­fluence with the most influential families of Rome, for example, and the great marriage they could have brokered. Instead Stefano brought up the past, and debts that carried no obliga­tion. Not only is a man not obliged to be grateful, gratitude is often a terri­ble burden that he gladly discards. And in this case Castruccio rid himself ofhis obligations to the Poggios by eliminating the Poggios. OBSERVA NCE OF THE LAW In 433 B.C., just before the Peloponnesian War, the island of Corcyra (later called Corfu) and the Greek city-state of Corinth stood on the brink of con­flict. Both parties sent ambassadors to Athens to try to win over the Atheni­ans to their side. The stakes were high, since whoever had Athens on his side was sure to win. And whoever won the war would certainly give the defeated side no mercy. Corcyra spoke first. Its ambassador began by admitting that the island had never helped Athens before, and in fact had allied itself with Athens's enemies. There were no ties of friendship or gratitude between Corcyra and Athens. Yes, the ambassador admitted, he had come to Athens now out of fear and concern for Corcyra's safety. The only thing he could offer was an alliance of m utual interests. Corcyra had a navy only surpassed in size and strength by Athens's own; an alliance between the two states would create a formidable force, one that could intimidate the riyal state of Sparta. That, unfortunately, was all Corcyra had to offer. The representative from Corinth then gave a brilliant, passionate speech, in sharp contrast to the dry, colorless approach of the Corcyran. He talked of everything Corinth had done for Athens in the past. He asked how it would look to Athens's other allies if the city put an agreement with a former enemy over one with a present friend, one that had served Athens's interest loyally: Perhaps those allies would break their agreements with Athens if they saw that their loyalty was not valued. He referred to Hellenic law, and the need to repay Corinth for all its good deeds. He fi­nally went on to list the many services Corinth had performed for Athens, and the importance of showing gratitude to one's friends. After the speech, the Athenians debated the issue in an assembly. On Most men are so thor· oughly subjective that nothing real/y interests them but themselves. They always think of their own case as soon as ever any remark is made, and their whole attention is engrossed and absorbed by the merest chance refer­ence to anything which affects them persona/ly, be it never so remote.

Interpretation History has remembered the Athenians nobly, but they were the preemi­nent realists of classical Greece. With them, all the rhetoric, all the emo­tional appeals in the world, could not match a good pragmatic argument, especially one that added to their power. What the Corinthian ambassador did not realize was that his refer­ences to Corinth's past generosity to Athens only irritated the Athenians, subtly asking them to feel guilty and putting them under obligation. The Athenians couldn't care less about past favors and friendly feelings. At the same time, they knew that if their other allies thought them ungrateful for abandoning Corinth, these city-states would still be unlikely to break their ties to Athens, the preeminent power in Greece. Athens ruled its empire by fo rce, and would simply compel any rebellious ally to return to the fo ld. When people choose between talk about the past and talk about the future, a pragmatic person will always opt for the future and forget the past. As the Corcyrans realized, it is always best to speak pragmatically to a pragmatic person. And in the end, most people are in fact pragmatic-they will rarely act against their own self-interest. It has always been a ruZe that the weak should be subject to the strong; and besides, we consider that we are worthy of our power. Up tilZ the present moment you, too, used to think that we were; but now, after calculating your own interest, you are beginning to talk in terms of right and wrong.

KEYS TO POWER In your quest for power, you will constantly find yourself in the position of asking for help from those more powerful than you. There is an art to ask­ing for help, an art that depends on your ability to understand the person you are dealing with, and to not confuse your needs with theirs. Most people never succeed at this, because they are completely trapped in their own wants and desires. They start from the assumption that the people they are appealing to have a selfless interest in helping them. They talk as if their needs mattered to these people--who probably couldn't care less. Sometimes they refer to larger issues: a great cause, or grand emotions such as love and gratitude. They go for the big picture when simple, everyday realities would have much more appeal. What they do not realize is that even the most powerful person is locked inside needs of his own, and that if you make no appeal to his self-interest, he merely sees you as desperate or, at best, a waste of time."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"In the sixteenth century, Portuguese missionaries tried fo r years to con­vert the people of Japan to Catholicism, while at the same time Po rtugal had a monopoly on trade between Japan and Europe.

Khan saw the wis­dom in this and did as Ch'u-Ts 'ai advised. When Khan took the city of Kaifeng, after a long siege, and decided to massacre its inhabitants (as he had in other cities that had resisted hirn), Ch'u-Ts 'ai told hirn that the finest craftsmen and engineers in China had fled to Kaifeng, and it would be better to put them to use.

By the time he moved into action, he knew Mellon about as well as Mellon's wife did. In 1921 Mellon was visiting London, and staying in a palatial suite on the third floor of Claridge's Hotel. Duveen booked hirnself into the suite just below Mellon's, on the second floor. He had arranged for his valet to befriend Mellon's valet, and on the fateful day he had chosen to make his move, Mellon's valet told Duveen's valet, who told Duveen, that he had just helped Mellon on with his overcoat, and that the industrialist was mak­ing his way down the corridor to ring for the lift. Duveen's valet hurriedly helped Duveen with his own overcoat. Sec­onds later, Duveen entered the lift, and 10 and behold, there was Mellon. \"How do you do, Mr. Mellon?\" said Duveen, introducing hirnself. \"I am on my way to the National Gallery to look at some pictures.\" How uncanny­that was precisely where Mellon was headed. And so Duveen was able to accompany his prey to the one location that would ensure his success. He knew Mellon's taste inside and out, and while the two men wandered through the museum, he dazzled the magnate with his knowledge. Once again quite uncannily, they seemed to have remarkably similar tastes. Mellon was pleasantly surprised: This was not the Duveen he had ex­pected. The man was charming and agreeable, and dearly had exquisite taste. When they retumed to New Yo rk, Mellon visited Duveen's exdusive gallery and fell in love with the collection. Everything, surprisingly enough, seemed to be precisely the kind of work he wanted to collect. For the rest of his life he was Duveen's best and most generous dient. Interpretation A man as ambitious and competitive as Joseph Duveen left nothing to chance. What's the point of winging it, of just hoping you may be able to charm this or that dient? It's like shooting ducks blindfolded. Arm yourself with a little knowledge and your aim improves. Mellon was the most spectacular of Duveen's catches, but he spied on many a millionaire. By secretly putting members of his clients' household staffs on his own payroll, he would gain constant access to valuable infor-"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"mation about their masters' comings and goings, changes in taste, and other such tidbits of information that would put hirn a step ahead. A riyal of Duveen's who wanted to make Henry Frick a dient noticed that when­ever he visited this wealthy New Yo rker, Duveen was there before hirn, as if he had a sixth sense. To other dealers Duveen seemed to be everywhere, and to know everything before they did. His powers discouraged and dis­heartened them, until many simply gave up going after the wealthy dients who could make a dealer rich. Such is the power of artful spying: It makes you seem all-powerful, clairvoyant. Yo ur knowledge of your mark can also make you seem charm­ing, so well can you anticipate his desires. No one sees the source of your power, and what they cannot see they cannot fight. Rulers see through spies, as cows through smell, Brahmins through scriptures and the rest 01 the people through their normal eyes. Kautilya, Indian philosopher, third antury B.C. KEYS TO POWER In the realm of power, your goal is a degree of control over future events. Part of the problem you face, then, is that people won't tell you all their thoughts, emotions, and plans. Controlling what they say, they often keep the most critical parts of their character hidden-their weaknesses, ulterior motives, obsessions. The result is that you cannot predict their moves, and are constantly in the dark. The trick is to find a way to probe them, to find out their secrets and hidden intentions, without letting them know what you are up to. This is not as difficult as you might think. A friendly front will let you secretly gather information on friends and enemies alike. Let others con­sult the horoscope, or read tarot cards: Yo u have more concrete me ans of seeing into the future. The most common way of spying is to use other people, as Duveen did. The method is simple, powerful, but risky: Yo u will certainly gather in­fo rmation, but you have little control over the people who are doing the work. Perhaps they will ineptly reveal your spying, or even secretly turn against you. It is far better to be the spy yourself, to pose as a fr iend while secretly gathering information. The French politician Ta lleyrand was one of the greatest practitioners of this art. He had an uncanny ability to worm secrets out of people in po­lite conversation. A contemporary of his, Baron de Vitrolles, wrote, \"Wit and grace marked his conversation. He possessed the art of concealing his thoughts or his malice beneath a transparent veil of insinuations, words that imply something more than they express. Only when necessary did he inject his own personality.\" The key here is Ta lleyrand's ability to suppress himself in the conversation, to make others talk endlessly about themselves and inadvertently reveal their intentions and plans. LAW 14 103"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"If you have reason to suspect that a person is telling you a lie, look as though you believed every word he said. This will give him courage to go on; he will hecome more vehement in his assertions, and in the end betray himself Again, if you perceive that a person is trying to conceal something from you, but with only partial success, look as though you did not believe him. The oppo­sition on your part will provoke him into lead-ing out his reserve of tYUth and bringing the whole fo rce of it to hear upon your incredulity. ARTHUR SnlOPFNIIAUER, 171l8-1860 104 LAW 14 Throughout Talleyrand's life, people said he was a superb conversa­tionalist-yet he actually said very litde. He never talked about his own ideas; he got others to reveal theirs. He would organize friendly games of charades for foreign diplomats, social gatherings where, however, he would carefully weigh their words, cajole confidences out of them, and gather information invaluable to his work as France's foreign minister. At the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) he did his spying in other ways: He would blurt out what seemed to be a secret (actually something he had made up), then watch his listeners' reactions. He might tell a gathering of diplomats, for instance, that a reliable source had revealed to him that the czar of Russia was planning to arrest his top general fo r treason. By watch­ing the diplomats' reactions to this made-up story, he would know which ones were most excited by the weakening of the Russian army-perhaps their goverments had designs on Russia? As Baron von Stetten said, \"Monsieur Ta lleyrand fires a pistol into the air to see who will jump out the window.\" During social gatherings and innocuous encounters, pay attention. This is when people's guards are down. By suppressing your own personal­ity, you can make them reveal things. The brilliance of the maneuver is that they will mistake your interest in them for fr iendship, so that you not only leam, you make allies. Nevertheless, you should practice this tactic with caution and care. If people begin to suspect you are worming secrets out of them under the cover of conversation, they will stricdy avoid you. Emphasize friendly chatter, not valuable information. Yo ur search for gems of information can­not be too obvious, or your probing questions will reveal more about your­self and your intentions than about the information you hope to find. A trick to try in spying comes from La Rochefoucauld, who wrote, \"Sincerity is found in very few men, and is often the cleverest of ruses-­one is sincere in order to draw out the confidence and secrets of the other.\" By pretending to bare your heart to another person, in other words, you make them more likely to reveal their own secrets. Give them a fals� con­fe ssion and they will give you a real one. Another trick was identified by the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, who suggested vehemendy contra­dicting people you're in conversation with as a way of irritating them, stir­ring them up so that they lose some of the control over their words. In their emotional re action they will reveal all kinds of truths about themselves, truths you can later use against them. Another method of indirect spying is to test people, to lay litde traps that make them reveal things about themselves. Chosroes 11, a notoriously clever seventh-century king of the Persians, had many ways of seeing through his subjects without raising suspicion. If he noticed, for instance, that two of his courtiers had become particularly friendly, he would call one of them aside and say he had information that the other was a traitor, and would soon be killed. The king would tell the courtier he trusted him more than anyone, and that he must keep this information secret. Then he"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"would watch the two men carefully. If he saw that the second courtier had not changed in his behavior toward the king, he would conclude that the first courtier had kept the secret, and he would quickly promote the man, later taking hirn aside to confess, \"I meant to kill your fr iend because of certain information that had reached me, but, when 1 investigated the mat­ter, 1 found it was untrue.\" If, on the other hand, the second courtier started to avoid the king, acting aloof and tense, Chosroes would know that the se­cret had been revealed. He would ban the second courtier from his court, letting hirn know that the whole business had only been a test, but that even though the man had done nothing wrong, he could no longer trust hirn. The first courtier, however, had revealed a secret, and hirn Chosroes would ban from his entire kingdom. It may seem an odd form of spying that reveals not empirical informa­tion but a person's character. Often, however, it is the best way of solving problems before they arise. By tempting people into certain acts, you leam about their loyalty, their honesty, and so on. And this kind of knowledge is often the most valuable of all: Armed with it, you can predict their actions in the future. Image: The Third Eye of the Spy.

This was because, in fixing their targets, the Ger­mans relied on secret agents they had plan ted in England.

The bombs would hit farther and farther from their targets every time they fell. By the end of the campaign they were landing on cows in the country.

These two generals began their careers as fr iends, fighting on the same side. Hsiang Yu came fr om the no­bility; large and powerful, given to bouts of violence and temper, a bit dull­witted, he was yet a mighty warrior who always fo ught at the head of his troops. Liu Pang came from peasant stock. He had never been much of a soldier, and preferred women and wine to fighting; in fa ct, he was some­thing of a scoundrel. But he was wily, and he had the ability to recognize the best strategists, keep them as his advisers, and listen to their advice. He had risen in the army through these strengths. In 208 B.C., the king of Ch'u sent two massive armies to conquer the powerful kingdom of Ch'in. One army went north, under the generalship of Sung Yi, with Hsiang Yu second in command; the other, led by Liu Pang, headed straight toward Ch'in. The target was the kingdom's splendid capital, Hsien-yang. And Hsiang Yu, ever violent and impatient, could not stand the idea that Liu Pang would get to Hsien-yang first, and perhaps would assurne command of the entire army. At one point on the northem fr ont, Hsiang's commander, Sung Yi, hesitated in sending his troops into battle. Furious, Hsiang entered Sung Yi's tent, proclaimed hirn a traitor, cut off his head, and assumed sole com­mand of the army. Without waiting for orders, he left the northem fr ont and marched directly on Hsien-yang. He fe it certain he was the better sol­dier and general than Liu, but, to his utter astonishment, his riyal, leading a smaller, swifter army, managed to reach Hsien-yang first. Hsiang had an adviser, Fan Tseng, who wamed him, \"This village headman [Liu Pang] used to be greedy only for riches and women, but since entering the capital he has not been led astray by wealth, wine, or sex. That shows he is aiming high.\" Fan Tseng urged Hsiang to kill his riyal before it was too late. He told the general to invite the wily pe asant to a banquet at their camp outside Hsien-yang, and, in the midst of a celebratory sword dance, to have his head cut off. The invitation was sent; Liu fe ll for the trap, and came to the banquet. But Hsiang hesitated in ordering the sword dance, and by the time he gave the signal, Liu had sensed a trap, and managed to escape. \"Bah!\" cried Fan Tseng in disgust, seeing that Hsiang had botched the plot. \"One cannot plan with a simpleton. Liu Pang will steal your empire yet and make us all his prisoners.\" Realizing his mistake, Hsiang hurriedly marched on Hsien-yang, this time determined to hack off his rival's head. Liu was never one to fight when the odds were against hirn, and he abandoned the city. Hsiang cap­tured Hsien-yang, murdered the young prince of Ch'in, and bumed the city to the ground. Liu was now Hsiang's bitter enemy, and he pursued hirn for many months, finally comering hirn in a walled city. Lacking food, his army in disarray, Liu sued for peace. Again Fan Tseng wamed Hsiang, \"Crush hirn now! If you let hirn go"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"again, you will be sorry later.\" But Hsiang decided to be merciful. He wanted to bring Liu back to Ch'u alive, and to fo rce his fo rmer friend to ac­knowledge hirn as master. But Fan proved right: Liu managed to use the negotiations for his surrender as a distraction, and he escaped with a small army. Hsiang, amazed that he had yet again let his riyal slip away, once more set out after Liu, this time with such fe rocity that he seemed to have lost his mind. At one point, having captured Liu's fa ther in battle, Hsiang stood the old man up during the fighting and yelled to Liu across the line of tr oops, \"Surrender now, or 1 shall boi! your father alive!\" Liu calmly an­swered, \"But we are sworn brothers. So my father is your father also. If you insist on boiling your own fa ther, send me a bowl of the soup!\" Hsiang backed down, and the struggle continued. A few weeks later, in the thick of the hunt, Hsiang scattered his fo rces unwisely, and in a surprise attack Liu was able to surround his main garri­son. For the first time the tables were turned. Now it was Hsiang who sued for peace. Liu's top adviser urged hirn to destroy Hsiang, crush his army, show no mercy. \"To let hirn go would be like rearing a tiger-it will devour you later,\" the adviser said. Liu agreed. Making a fa lse treaty, he lured Hsiang into relaxing his defense, then slaughtered almost all of his army. Hsiang managed to escape. Alone and on fo ot, knowing that Liu had put a bounty on his head, he came upon a small group of his own retreating soldiers, and cried out, \"I hear Liu Pang has offered one thousand pieces of gold and a fief of ten thousand families for my head. Let me do you a fa vor.\" Then he slit his own throat and died. Interpretation Hsiang Yu had proven his ruthlessness on many an occasion. He rarely hesitated in doing away with a riyal if it served his purposes. But with Liu Pang he acted differently. He respected his rival, and did not want to defeat hirn through deception; he wanted to prove his superiority on the battle­field, even to fo rce the clever Liu to surrender and to serve hirn. Every time he had his riYal in his hands, something made hirn hesitate-a fatal sympa­thy with or respect for the man who, after all, had once been a friend and comrade in arms. But the moment Hsiang made it clear that he intended to do away with Liu, yet failed to accomplish it, he sealed his own doom. Liu would not suffer the same hesitation on ce the tables were turned. This is the fa te that faces all of us when we sympathize with our ene­mies, when pity, or the hope of reconciliation, makes us pull back fr om doing away with them. We only strengthen their fe ar and hatred of uso We have beaten them, and they are humiliated; yet we nurture these resentful vipers who will one day kill uso Power cannot be dealt with this way.

Crushing his next rival-the king of Ch'u, his own fo rmer leader-he crowned himself emperor, defeated everyone in his path, and went down in history as one of the greatest rulers of China, the immortal Han Kao-tsu, founder of the Han Dynasty. Those who seek to achieve things should show no mercy. Kautilya, Indian philosopher, third century B,C, OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW Wu Chao, born in A.D. 625, was the daughter of a duke, and as a beautiful young woman of many charms, she was accordingly attached to the harem of Emperor T'ai Tsung. The imperial harem was a dangerous place, full of young concubines vying to become the emperor's favorite. Wu's beauty and forceful charac­ter quickly won her this battle, but, knowing that an emperor, like other powerful men, is a creature of whim, and that she could easily be replaced, she kept her eye on the future. Wu managed to seduce the emperor's dissolute son, Kao Tsung, on the only possible occasion when she could find him alone: while he was reliev­ing himself at the royal urinal. Even so, when the emperor died and Kao Ts ung took over the throne, she still suffered the fate to which all wives and concubines of a deceased emperor were bound by tradition and law: Her head shaven, she entered a convent, for what was supposed to be the rest of her life. For seven years Wu schemed to escape. By communicating in secret with the new emperor, and by befriending his wife, the empress, she managed to get a highly unusual royal edict allowing her to return to the palace and to the royal harem. Once there, she fawned on the empress, while still sleeping with the emperor. The empress did not discourage this-she had yet to provide the emperor with an heir, her position was vulnerable, and Wu was a valuable ally. In 654 Wu Chao gave birth to a child. One day the empress came to visit, and as so on as she had left, Wu smothered the newborn-her own baby. When the murder was discovered, suspicion immediately fell on the empress, who had been on the scene moments earlier, and whose jealous nature was known by all. This was precisely Wu's plan. Shortly thereaft er, the empress was charged with murder and executed. Wu Chao was crowned empress in her place. Her new husband, addicted to his life of pleasure, gladly gave up the reins of govemment to Wu Chao, who was fr om then on known as Empress Wu. Although now in a position of great power, Wu hardly feh secure. There were enemies everywhere; she could not let down her guard for one moment. Indeed, when she was forty-one, she began to fear that her beau­tiful young niece was becoming the emperor's favorite. She poisoned the woman with a day mixed into her fo od. In 675 her own son, touted as the"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"heir apparent, was poisoned as weIl. The next-eldest son-illegitimate, but now the crown prince-was exiled a little later on trumped-up charges. And when the emperor died, in 683, Wu managed to have the son after that declared unfit for the throne. All this meant that it was her youngest, most ineffectual son who finallybecame emperor. In this way she contin­ued to rule. Over the next five years there were innumerable palace coups. All of them failed, and all of the conspirators were executed. By 688 there was no one left to challenge Wu. She proclaimed herself a divine descendant of Buddha, and in 690 her wishes were finally granted: She was named Holy and Divine \"Emperor\" of China. Wu became emperor because there was literally nobody left from the previous T'ang dynasty. And so she ruled unchallenged, for over a decade ofrelative peace. In 705, at the age of eighty, she was forced to abdicate. Interpretation All who knew Empress Wu remarked on her energy and intelligence. At the time, there was no glory available for an ambitious woman beyond a few years in the imperial harem, then a lifetime walled up in a convent. In Wu's gradual but remarkable rise to the top, she was never naive. She knew that any hesitation, any momentary weakness, would speIl her end. If, every time she got rid of a riyal a new one appeared, the solution was simple: She had to crush them all or be killed herself. Other emperors be­fore her had followed the same path to the top, but Wu-who, as a woman, had next to no chance to gain power-had to be more ruthless still. Empress Wu's forty-year reign was one of the longest in Chinese his­tory. Although the story of her bloody rise to power is weIl known, in China she is considered one ofthe period's most able and effective rulers. A priest asked the dying Spanish statesman and general Ram6n Maria Narvaez (1800-1868), \"Does your Exceltency forgive alt your enemies?\" \"[ do not have to forgive my enemies, \" answered Narvaez, \"[ have had them alt shot. \" KEYS TO POWER It is no accident that the two stories illustrating this law come from China: Chinese history abounds with examples of enemies who were left alive and retumed to haunt the lenient. \"Crush the enemy\" is a key strategie tenet of Sun-tzu, the fourth-century-B.c. author of The Art of War. The idea is simple: Your enemies wish you ill. There is nothing they want more than to elimi­nate you. If, in your struggles with them, you stop halfway or even three quarters of the way, out of mercy or hope of reconciliation, you only make them more determined, more embittered, and they will someday take re­venge. They may act friendly for the time being, but this is only because you have defeated them. They have no choice but to bide their time. The solution: Have no mercy. Crush your enemies as totally as they LAW 15 111"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"112 LAW 15 would crush you. Ultimately the only peace and security you can hope for from your enemies is their disappearance. Mao Ts e-tung, a devoted reader of Sun-tzu and of Chinese history gen­erally, knew the importance of this law. In 1934 the Communist leader and some 75,000 poorly equipped soldiers fled into the desolate mountains of western China to escape Chiang Kai-shek's much larger army, in what has since been called the Long March. Chiang was determined to eliminate every last Communist, and by a few years later Mao had less than 10,000 soldiers left. By 1937, in fact, when China was invaded by Japan, Chiang calculated that the Commu­nists were no longer a threat. He chose to give up the ehase and concen­trate on the Japanese. Te n years later the Communists had recovered enough to rout Chiang's army. Chiang had forgotten the ancient wisdom of erushing the enemy; Mao had not. Chiang was pursued until he and his en­tire army fled to the island of Ta iwan. Nothing remains of his regime in mainland China to this day. The wisdom behind \"crushing the enemy\" is as ancient as the Bible: Its first praetitioner may have been Moses, who learned it from God Him­self, when He parted the Red Sea for the Jews, then let the water flow back over the pursuing Egyptians so that \"not so much as one of them re­mained.\" When Moses returned from Mount Sinai with the Te n Com­mandments and found his people worshipping the Golden Calf, he had every last offender slaughtered. And just before he died, he told his fo llow­ers, finally about to enter the Promised Land, that when they had defeated the tribes of Canaan they should \"utterly destroy them . . . make no eovenant with them, and show no merey to them.\" The goal of total victory is an axiom of modem warfare, and was codi­fied as such by Carl von Clausewitz, the premier philosopher of war. Ana­lyzing the campaigns of Napoleon, von Clausewitz wrote, \"We do claim that direct annihilation of the enemy's forees must always be the dominant consideration .... Onee a major victory is achieved there must be no talk of rest, of breathing space . . . but only of the pursuit, going for the enemy again, seizing his eapital, attacking his reserves and anything else that might give his country aid and eomfort.\" The reason for this is that after war come negotiation and the division of territory. If you have only won a partial victory, you will inevitably lose in negotiation what you have gained by war. The solution is simple: Allow your enemies no options. Annihilate them and their territory is yours to carve. The goal of power is to control your enemies completely, to make them obey your will. Yo u cannot afford to go halfway. If they have no options, they will be fo rced to do your bid­ding. This law has applieations far beyond the battlefield. Negotiation is the insidious viper that will eat away at your vietory, so give your enemies nothing to negotiate, no hope, no room to maneuver. They are crushed and that is that. Realize this: In your struggle for power you will stir up rivalries and"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"create enemies. There will be people you cannot win over, who will re­main your enemies no matter what. But whatever wound you inflicted on them, deliberately or not, do not take their hatred personally. Just recog­nize that there is no possibility of peace between you, especially as long as you stay in power. If you let them stick around, they will seek revenge, as certainly as night follows day. To wait for them to show their cards is just silly; as Empress Wu understood, by then it will be too late. Be realistic: With an enemy like this around, you will never be secure. Remember the lessons of history, and the wisdom of Moses and Mao: Never go halfway. It is not, of course, a question of murder, it is a question of banishment. Sufficiently weakened and then exiled from your court forever, your ene­mies are rendered harmless. They have no hope of recovering, insinuating themselves and hurting you. And if they cannot be banished, at least un­derstand that they are plotting against you, and pay no heed to whatever friendliness they feign. Your only weapon in such a situation is your own wariness. If you cannot banish them immediately, then plot for the best time to act. Image: A Viper crushed beneath your foot but left alive, will rear up and bite you with a double dose of venom. An enemy that is left around is like a half­dead viper that you nurse back to health.

In warfare, for example, a good general knows that if he attacks an army when it is comered, its sol­diers will fight much more fiercely. It is sometimes better, then, to leave them an escape route, a way out. As they retreat, they wear themselves out, and are ultiinately more demoralized by the retreat than by any defeat he rnight inflict on the battlefield. When you have someone on the ropes, then-but only when you are SUfe they have no chance of recovery-you rnight let them hang themselves. Let them be the agents of their own de­struction. The result will be the same, and you won't feel half as bad. Finally, sometimes by crushing an enemy, you embitter them so much that they spend years and years plotting revenge. The Treaty of Versailles had such an effect on the Germans. Some would argue that in the long run it would be better to show some leniency. The problem is, your leniency involves another risk-it may embolden the enemy, which still harbors a grudge, but now has some room to operate. It is almost always wiser to crush YOUf enemy.

At the castle of Javiac he met and fell in love with the beautifullady of the house, Madame Guillelma de J aviac, He sang her his songs, recited his poetry, played chess with her, and little by little she in turn fell in love with him. Guillaume had a friend, Sir Pierre de Bar­jac, who traveled with him and who was also received at the castle, And Pierre too fell in love with a lady in Javiac, the gracious but temperamental Viernetta. Then one day Pierre and Viernetta had a violent quarrel. The lady dismissed him, and he sought out his friend Guillaume to help heal the breach and get him back in her good graces. Guillaume was about to leave the castle for a while, but on his return, several weeks later, he worked his magie, and Pierre and the lady were reconciled. Pierre feit that his love had increased tenfold-that there was no stronger love, in fact, than the love that follows reconciliation. The stronger and longer the disagreement, he told Guillaume, the sweeter the feeling that comes with peace and rapprochement. As a troubadour, Sir Guillaume prided himself on experiencing all the joys and sorrows of love. On hearing his friend's talk, he too wanted know the bliss of reconciliation after a quarrel. He therefore feigned great anger with Lady Guillelma, stopped sending her love letters, and abruptly left the castle and stayed away, even during the festivals and hunts. This drove the young lady wild. Guillelma sent messengers to Guillaume to find out what had hap­pened, but he turned the messengers away. He thought an this would make her angry, forcing him to plead for reconciliation as Pierre had. Instead, however, his absence had the opposite effect: It made Guillelma love him all the more. Now the lady pursued her knight, sending messengers and love notes of her own. This was almost unheard of-a lady never pursued her troubadour. And Guillaume did not like it. Guillelma's forwardness made him feel she had lost some of her dignity. Not only was he no longer sure of his plan, he was no longer sure of his lady. Finally, after several months of not hearing from Guillaume, Guillelma gave up. She sent him no more messengers, and he began to wonder-per­haps she was angry? Perhaps the plan had worked after all? So much the better if she was. He would wait no more-it was time to reconcile. So he put on his best robe, decked the horse in its fanciest caparison, chose a magnificent heImet, and rode off to Javiac. On hearing that her beloved had returned, Guillelma rushed to see him, knelt before him, dropped her veil to kiss him, and begged forgive­ness for whatever slight had caused his anger. Imagine his confusion and despair-his plan had failed abysmally. She was not angry, she had never been angry, she was only deeper in love, and he would never experience the joy of reconciliation after a quarrel. Seeing her now, and still desperate"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"to taste that jOY, he decided to try one more time: He drove her away with harsh words and threatening gestures. She left, this time vowing never to see hirn again. The next morning the troubadour regretted what he had done. He rode back to Javiac, but the lady would not receive hirn, and ordered her servants to chase hirn away, across the drawbridge and over the hill. Guil­laume fled. Back in his chamber he collapsed and started to cry: He had made a terrible mistake. Over the next year, unable to see his lady, he ex­perienced the absence, the terrible absence, that can only inflame love. He wrote one of his most beautiful poems, \"My song ascends for mercy pray­ing.\" And he sent many letters to Guillelma, explaining what he had done, and begging forgiveness. After a great deal of this, Lady Guillelma, remembering his beautiful songs, his handsome figure, and his skills in dancing and falconry, found herself yearning to have hirn back. As penance for his cruelty, she ordered hirn to remove the nail from the little finger of his right hand, and to send it to her along with a poem describing his miseries. He did as she asked. Finally Guillaume de Balaun was able to taste the ultimate sensation-a reconciliation even surpassing that of his friend Pierre. Interpretation Trying to discover the joys of reconciliation, Guillaume de Balaun inadver­tently experienced the truth of the law of absence and presence. At the start of an affair, you need to heighten your presence in the eyes of the other. If you absent yourself too early, you may be forgotten. But once your lover's emotions are engaged, and the feeling of love has crystallized, absence inflames and excites. Giving no reason for your absence excites even more: The other person assurnes he or she is at fault. While you are away, the lover's imagination takes flight, and a stimulated imagination cannot help but make love grow stronger. Conversely, the more Guillelma pursued Guillaume, the less he loved her-she had become too present, too accessible, leaving no room for his imagination and fancy, so that his feelings were suffocating. When she finally stopped sending messengers, he was able to breathe again, and to return to his plan. What withdraws, what becomes scarce, suddenly seems to deserve our respect and honor. What stays too long, inundating us with its presence, makes us disdain it. In the Middle Ages, ladies were constantly putting their knights through trials of love, sending them on some long and ardu­ous quest-all to create a pattern of absence and presence. Indeed, had Guillaume not left his lady in the first place, she might have been forced to send hirn away, creating an absence of her own. Absence diminishes minor passions and inflames great ones, as the wind douses a candle and fans a fire.

In the eighth century B.C., however, the people of Medea (now northwestem Iran) revolted against them, and finally broke free. Now the Medes had to establish a new govemment. Determined to avoid any form of despotism, they refused to give ultimate power to any one man, or to establish a monarchy. Without aleader, however, the country soon fe ll into chaos, and fr actured into small kingdoms, with village fighting against village. In one such village lived a man named Deioces, who began to make a name for hirnself for fair dealing and the ability to settle disputes. He did this so successfully, in fact, that soon any legal conflict in the area was brought to hirn, and his power increased. Throughout the land, the law had fallen into disrepute--the judges were corrupt, and no one en­trusted their cases to the courts any more, resorting to violence instead. When news spread of Deioces' wisdom, incorruptibility, and unshakable impartiality, Medean villages far and wide tumed to hirn to settle all man­ner of cases. Soon he became the sole arbiter of justice in the land. At the height of his power, Deioces suddenly decided he had had enough. He would no longer sit in the chair of judgment, would hear no more suits, settle no more disputes between brother and brother, village and village. Complaining that he was spending so much time dealing with other people's problems that he had neglected his own affairs, he retired. The country once again descended into chaos. With the sudden with­drawal of a powerful arbiter like Deioces, crime increased, and contempt for the law was never greater. The Medes held a meeting of all the villages to decide how to get out of their predicament. \"We cannot continue to live in this country under these conditions,\" said one triballeader. \"Let us ap­point one of our number to rule so that we can live under orderly govem­ment, rather than losing our hornes altogether in the present chaos.\" And so, despite all that the Medes had suffered under the Assyrian des­potism, they decided to set up a monarchy and name a king. And the man they most wanted to rule, of course, was the fair-minded Deioces. He was hard to convince, for he wanted nothing more to do with the villages' in­fighting and bickering, but the Medes begged and pleaded-without him the country had descended into a state of lawlessness. Deioces finally agreed. Ye t he also imposed conditions. An enormous palace was to be con­structed for him, he was to be provided with bodyguards, and a capital city was to be built from which he could rule. All of this was done, and Deioces settled into his palace. In the center of the capital, the palace was sur­rounded by walls, and completely inaccessible to ordinary people. Deioces then established the terms of his rule: Admission to his presence was for­bidden. Communication with the king was only possible through messen­gers. No one in the royal court could see him more than once a week, and then only by permission. Deioces ruled for fifty-three years, extended the Medean empire, and established the foundation for what would later be the Persian empire, under his great-great-grandson Cyrus. During Deioces' reign, the people's"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"respect for hirn gradually tumed into a form of worship: He was not a mere mortal, they believed, but the son of a god. Interpretation Deioces was a man of great ambition. He determined early on that the country needed a strong ruler, and that he was the man for the job. In a land plagued with anarchy, the most powerful man is the judge and arbiter. So Deioces began his career by making his reputation as a man of impeccable fairness. At the height of his power as a judge, however, Deioces realized the truth of the law of absence and presence: By serving so many clients, he had become too noticeable, too available, and had lost the respect he had earlier enjoyed. People were taking his services for granted. The only way to regain the veneration and power he wanted was to withdraw com­pletely, and let the Medes taste what life was like without hirn. As he ex­pected, they came begging for hirn to rule. Once Deioces had discovered the truth of this law, he carried it to its ultimate realization. In the palace his people had built for hirn, none could see hirn except a few courtiers, and those only rarely. As Herodotus wrote, \"There was a risk that if they saw him habitually, it might lead to jealousy and resentment, and plots would follow; but if nobody saw hirn, the legend would grow that he was a being of a different order from mere men.\" A man said to a Dervish: \"\"Why do I not see you more often ?\" The Dervish replied, \"Because the words '\"Why have you not been to see me?' are sweeter to my ear than the words '\"Why have you come again?'\" Mulla Jami, quoted in ldries Shah 's Caravan 01' Dreams, 1968 KEYS TO POWER Everything in the world depends on absence and presence. A strong pres­ence will draw power and attention to you-you shine more brightly than those around you. But a point is inevitably reached where too much pres­ence creates the opposite effect: The more you are seen and heard fr om, the more your value degrades. Yo u become a habit. No matter how hard you try to be different, subtly, without your knowing why, people respect you less and less. At the right moment you must leam to withdraw yourself before they unconsciously push you away. It is agame of hide-and-seek. The truth of this law can most easily be appreciated in matters of love and seduction. In the beginning stages of an affair, the lover's absence stim­ulates your imagination, forming a sort of aura around hirn or her. But this aura fades when you know too much-when your imagination no longer has room to roam. The loved one becomes a person like anyone else, a person whose presence is taken for granted. This is why the seventeenth­century French courtesan Ninon de Lenclos advised constant feints at with­drawal from one's lover. \"Love never dies of starvation,\" she wrote, \"but often of indigestion. \" LAW 16 119"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"120 LAW 16 The moment you allow yourself to be treated like anyone else, it is too late-you are swallowed and digested. To prevent this you need to starve the other person of your presence. Force their respect by threatenir1g them with the possibility that they will lose you far good; create a pattern of pres­ence and absence. Once you die, everything about you will seem different Yo u will be surrounded by an instant aura of respect. People will remember their criti­cisms of you, their arguments with you, and will be filled with regret and guilt. They are rnissing a presence that will never return. But you do not have to wait until you die: By completely withdrawing for a while, you cre­ate a kind of death before death. And when you come back, it will be as if you had come back from the dead-an air of resurrection will ding to you, and people will be relieved at your return. This is how Deioces made him­selfking. Napoleon was recognizing the law of absence and presence when he said, \"If I am often seen at the theater, people will cease to notice me.\" To day, in a world inundated with presence through the flood of images, the game of withdrawal is all the more powerful. We rarely know when to withdraw anymore, and nothing seems private, so we are awed by anyone who is able to disappear by choice. Novelists J. D. Salinger and Thomas Pynchon have created cultlike followings by knowing when to disappear. Another, more everyday side of this law, but one that demonstrates its truth even further, is the law of scarcity in the science of economics. By withdrawing something from the market, you create instant value. In seventeenth-century Holland, the upper classes wanted to make the tulip more than just a beautiful flower-they wanted it to be a kind of status sym­bol. Making the flower scarce, indeed almost impossible to obtain, they sparked what was later called tulipomania. A single flower was now worth more than its weight in gold. In our own century, similarly, the art dealer Joseph Duveen insisted on making the paintings he sold as scarce and rare as possible. To keep their prices elevated and their status high, he bought up whole collections and stored them in his basement. The paintings that he sold became more than just paintings--they were felish objects, their value increased by their rarity. \"You can get all the pictures you want at fifty thou­sand dollars apiece-that's easy,\" he once said. \"But to get pictures at a quarter of a million apiece-that wants doing!\" I mag e: The Sun. lt can only be appreciated by its absence. The longer the days of rain, the more the sun is craved. But too many hot days and the sun overwhelms. Learn to keep yourself obscure and make people demand your return."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Extend the law of scarcity to your own skills. Make what you are offer­ing the world rare and hard to find, and you instantly increase its value. There always comes a moment when those in power overstay their welcome. We have grown tired of them, lost respect for them; we see them as no different from the rest of mankind, which is to say that we see them as rather worse, since we inevitably compare their current status in our eyes to their former one. There is an art to knowing when to retire. If it is done right, you regain the respect you had lost, and retain a part of your power. The greatest mler of the sixteenth century was Charles V. King of Spain, Hapsburg emperor, he governed an empire that at one point in­cluded much of Europe and the New Wo rld. Ye t at the height of his power, in 1557, he retired to the monastery of Yuste. All of Europe was captivated by his sudden withdrawal; people who had hated and fe ared hirn suddenly called hirn great, and he came to be seen as a saint. In more recent times, the film actress Greta Garbo was never more admired than when she re­tired, in 1941. For some her absence came too soon-she was in her mid­thirties-but she wisely preferred to leave on her own terms, rather than waiting for her audience to grow tired of her. Make yourself too available and the aura of power you have created around yourself will wear away. Tu rn the game around: Make yourself less accessible and you increase the value of your presence. Authority: Use absence to create respect and esteern. If presence diminishes farne, absence augments it. A man who when absent is regarded as a lion becomes when present so me thing com­mon and ridiculous. Ta lents lose their luster if we become too familiar with them, for the outer shell of the mind is more readily seen than its rich inner kernel. Even the outstand-ing genius makes use of retirement so that men rnay honor hirn and so that the yearning aroused by his absence rnay cause hirn to be esteerned.

Until that status is attained, absence is dangerous-instead of fanning the flarnes, it will ex­tinguish them. In love and seduction, similarly, absence is only effective once you have sUfrounded the other with YOUf image, been seen by hirn or her everywhere.

The two men had been scheduled to meet for the World Championship of Chess, but Fischer had not arrived on time and the match was on hold. Fischer had problems with the size of the prize money, problems with the way the money was to be distributed, problems with the logistics of holding the match in Iceland. He might back out at any moment. Spassky tried to be patient. His Russian bosses feit that Fischer was hu­miliating him and told him to walk away, but Spassky wanted this match. He knew he could destroy Fischer, and nothing was going to spoil the greatest victory of his career. \"So it seems that all OUT work may come to nothing,\" Spassky told a comrade. \"But what can we do? It is Bobby's move. If he comes, we play. If he does not come; we do not play. A man who is willing to commit suicide has the initiative.\" Fischer finally arrived in Reykjavik, but the problems, and the threat of cancellation, continued. He disliked the hall where the match was to be fought, he criticized the lighting, he complained about the noise of the cameras, he even hated the chairs in which he and Spassky were to sit. Now the Soviet Union took the initiative and threatened to withdraw their man. The bluff apparently worked: After all the weeks of waiting, the end­less and infuriating negotiations, Fischer agreed to play. Everyone was re­lieved, no one more than Spassky. But on the day of the official introductions, Fischer arrived very late, and on the day when the \"Match of the Century\" was to begin, he was late again. This time, however, the consequences would be dire: If he showed up too late he would forfeit the first game. What was going on? Was he playing some sort of mind game? Or was Bobby Fischer perhaps afraid ofBoris Spassky? It seemed to the as­sembled grand masters, and to Spassky, that this young kid from Brooklyn had a terrible case of the jitters. At 5:09 Fischer showed up, exactly one minute before the match was to be canceled. The first game of a chess toumament is critical, since it sets the tone for the months to come. It is often a slow and quiet struggle, with the two play­ers preparing themselves for the war and trying to read each other's strate­gies. This game was different. Fischer made a terrible move early on, perhaps the worst of his career, and when Spassky had hirn on the ropes, he seemed to give up. Yet Spassky knew that Fischer never gave up. Even when facing checkmate, he fought to the bitter end, wearing the opponent down. This time, though, he seemed resigned. Then suddenly he broke out a bold move that put the room in a buzz. The move shocked Spassky, but he recovered and managed to win the game. But no one could figure out what Fischer was up to. Had he lost deliberately? Or was he rattled? Unset­tled? Even, as some thought, insane? After his defeat in the first game, Fischer complained all the more loudly about the room, the cameras, and everything else. He also failed to"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"show up on time for the second game. This time the organizers had had enough: He was given a forfeit. Now he was down two games to none, a position from which no one had ever come back to win a chess champi­onship. Fischer was clearly unhinged. Ye t in the third game, as all those who witnessed it remember, he had a ferocious look in his eye, a look that clearly bothered Spassky. And despite the hole he had dug for hirnself, he seemed supremely confident. He did make what appeared to be another blunder, as he had in the first game-but his cocky air made Spassky smell a trap. Ye t despite the Russian's suspicions, he could not figure out the trap, and before he knew it Fischer had checkmated hirn. In fact Fischer's un­orthodox tactics had completely unnerved his opponent. At the end of the game, Fischer leaped up and rushed out, yelling to his confederates as he smashed a fist into his palm, \"I'm crushing him with brute force!\" In the next games Fischer pulled moves that no one had seen from hirn before, moves that were not his style. Now Spassky started to make blunders. After losing the sixth game, he started to cry. One grand master said, \"Mter this, Spassky's got to ask hirnself if it's safe to go back to Rus­sia.\" After the eighth game Spassky decided he knew what was happening: Bobby Fischer was hypnotizing hirn. He decided not to look Fischer in the eye ; he lost anyway. After the fourteenth game he called a staff conference and announced, \"An attempt is being made to control my mind.\" He wondered whether the orange juice they drank at the chess table could have been drugged. Maybe chemicals were being blown into the air. Finally Spassky went pub­Hc, accusing the Fischer team of putting something in the chairs that was al­tering Spassky's mind. The KGB went on alert: Boris Spassky was embarrassing the Soviet Union! The chairs were taken apart and X-rayed. A chemist found nothing unusual in them. The only things anyone found anywhere, in fact, were two dead flies in a Hghting fixture. Spassky began to complain of hallucina­tions. He tried to keep playing, but his mind was unraveling. He could not go on. On September 2, he resigned. Although still relatively young, he never recovered fr om this defeat. Interpretation In previous games between Fischer and Spassky, Fischer had not fared we Il. Spassky had an uncanny ability to read his opponent's strategy and use it against hirn. Adaptable and patient, he would build attacks that would defeat not in seven moves but in seventy. He defeated Fischer every time they played because he saw much further ahead, and because he was a bril­Hant psychologist who never lost control. One master said, \"He doesn't just look for the best move. He looks for the move that will disturb the man he is playing.\" Fischer, however, finaHy understood thll;t this was one of the keys to Spassky's success: He played on your predictability, defeated you at your own game.

Clearly the endless waiting had an effect on Spassky's psyche. Most power­ful of all, though, were Fischer's deliberate blunders and his appearance of having no clear strategy. In fact, he was doing everything he could to scramble his old patterns, even if it meant losing the first match and forfeit­ing the second. Spassky was known for his sangfroid and levelheadedness, but for the first time in his life he could not figure out his opponent. He slowly melted down, until at the end he was the one who seemed insane. Chess contains the concentrated essence of life: First, because to win you have to be supremely patient and farseeing; and second, because the game is built on patterns, whole sequences of moves that have been played before and will be played again, with slight alterations, in any one match. Your opponent analyzes the patterns you are playing and uses them to try to fore see your moves. Allowing hirn nothing predictable to base his strat­egy on gives you a big advantage. In chess as in life, when people cannot figure out what you are doing, they are kept in astate of terror-waiting, uncertain, confused. Life at court is a serious, melancholy game of chess, which requires us to draw up our pieces and batteries, form a plan, pursue it, parry that of our adversary. Sometimes, however, it is better to take risks and play the most capricious, unpredictable move. leall de La Bmyere, 1645-1696 KEYS TO POWER Nothing is more terrifying than the sudden and unpredictable. That is why we are so frightened by earthquakes and tornadoes: We do not know when they will strike. Mter one has occurred, we wait in terror for the next one. To a lesser degree, this is the effect that unpredictable human behavior has on uso Animals behave in set patterns, which is why we are able to hunt and kill them. Only man has the capacity to consciously alter his behavior, to improvise and overcome the weight of routine and habit. Yet most men do not realize this power. They prefer the comforts of routine, of giving in to the animal nature that has them repeating the same compulsive actions time and time again. They do this because it requires no effort, and be­cause they mistakenly believe that if they do not unsettle others, they will be left alone. Understand: A person of power instills a kind of fear by delib­erately unsettling those around hirn to keep the initiative on his side. You sometimes need to strike without warning, to make others tremble when they least expect it. It is a device that the powerful have used for centuries. Filippo Maria, the last of the Visconti dukes of Milan in fifteenth­century Italy, consciously did the opposite of what everyone expected of hirn. For instance, he might suddenly shower a courtier with attention, and then, once the man had come to expect a promotion to higher office,"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"would suddenly start treating hirn with the utmost disdain. Confused, the man might leave the court, when the duke would suddenly recall hirn and start treating hirn weIl again. Doubly confused, the courtier would wonder whether his assumption that he would be promoted had become obvious, and offensive, to the duke, and would start to behave as if he no longer ex­pected such honor. The duke would rebuke hirn for his lack of ambition and would send hirn away. The secret of dealing with Filippo was simple: Do not presume to know what he wants. Do not try to guess what will please hirn. Never inject your will; just surrender to his will. Then wait to see what happens. Amidst the confusion and uncertainty he created, the duke ruled supreme, unchal­lenged and at peace. Unpredictability is most often the tactic of the master, but the under­dog too can use it to great effect. If you find yourself outnumbered or cor­nered, throw in a series of unpredictable moves. Your enemies will be so confused that they will pull back or make a tactical blunder. In the spring of 1862, during the American Civil War, General StonewallJackson and a force of 4,600 Confederate soldiers were torment­ing the larger Union forces in the Shenandoah Valley. Meanwhile, not far away, General George Brinton McClellan, heading a force of 90,000 Union soldiers, was marching south from Washington, D.C., to lay siege to Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital. As the weeks of the cam­paign went by, Jackson repeatedly led his soldiers out of the Shenandoah Valley, then back to it. His movements made no sense. Was he preparing to help defend Richmond? Was he marching on Washington, now that McClellan's ab­sence had left it unprotected? Was he heading north to wreak havoc up there? Why was his small force moving in circles? Jackson's inexplicable moves made the Union generals delay the march on Richmond as they waited to figure out what he was up to. Mean­while, the South was able to pour reinforcements into the town. A battle that could have crushed the Confederacy tumed into a stalemate. Jackson used this tactic time and again when facing numerically superior forces. \"Always mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy, if possible,\" he said, \" ... such tactics will win every time and a small army may thus destroy a large one.\" This law applies not only to war but to everyday situations. People are always trying to read the motives behind your actions and to use your pre­dictability against you. Throw in a completely inexplicable move and you put them on the defensive. Because they do not und erstand you, they are unnerved, and in such astate you can easily intimidate them. Pablo Picasso once remarked, \"The best calculation is the absence of calculation. Once you have attained a certain level of recognition, others generally figure that when you do something, it's for an intelligent reason. So it's really foolish to plot out your movements too carefully in advance. Yo u're better off acting capriciously.\" For a while, Picasso worked with the art dealer Paul Rosenberg.

I'd go on working and sleeping and Rosenberg would spend his time figuring. In two days he'd come back, nerves jangled, anxious, say­ing, 'After all, dear friend, you wouldn't turn me down if I offered you this much [naming a substantially higher figure] for those paintings rather than the price I've been accustomed to paying you, would you?' \" Unpredictability is not only a weapon of terror: Scrambling YOUf pat­terns on a day-to-day basis will cause a stir around you and stimulate inter­est.

They have prepared everything according to their preconceived notions about you. Yo u can use this in several ways: First, it sets up a smoke screen, a comfortable front behind which you can carry on deceptive actions. Sec­ond, it allows you on rare occasions to do something completely against the pattern, unsettling YOUf opponent so deeply he will fall to the ground without being pushed. In 1974 Muhammad Ali and George Foreman were scheduled to fight for the world heavyweight boxing championship. Everyone knew what would happen: Big George Foreman would try to land a knockout punch while Ali would dance around hirn, wearing hirn out. That was Ali's way of fighting, his pattern, and he had not changed it in more than ten years. But in this case it seemed to give Foreman the advantage: He had a devastating punch, and if he waited, sooner or later Ali would have to come to hirn. Ali, the master strategist, had other plans: In press conferences before the big fight, he said he was going to change his style and punch it out with Foreman. No one, least of all Foreman, believed this for a second. That plan would be suicide on Ali's part; he was playing the comedian, as usual. Then, before the fight, Ali's trainer loosened the ropes around the ring, something a trainer would do if his boxer were intending to slug it out. But no one believed this ploy; it had to be a setup. To everyone's amazement, Ali did exactly what he had said he would do. As Foreman waited for hirn to dance around, Ali went right up to hirn and slugged it out. He completely upset his opponent's strategy. At a loss, Foreman ended up wearing hirnself out, not by chasing Ali but by throw­ing punches wildly, and taking more and more counterpunches. Finally, Ali landed a dramatic right cross that knocked out Foreman. The habit of assuming that a person's behavior will fit its previous patterns is so strong that not even Ali's announcement of a strategy change was enough to upset it. Foreman walked into a trap-the trap he had been told to expect. A warning: Unpredictability can work against you sometimes, es­pecially if you are in a subordinate position. There are times when it is bet­ter to let people fe el comfortable and settled around you than to disturb them. To o much unpredictability will be seen as a sign of indecisiveness, or even of some more serious psychic problem. Patterns are powerful, and you can terrify people by disrupting them. Such power should only be used judiciously.

His empire was vaster and more powernd than that of Alexander the Great. He had conquered all of the kingdoms sur­rounding his own kingdom of Ch'in and unified them into one massive realm called China. But in the last years ofhis life, few, if anyone, saw hirn. The emperor lived in the most magnificent palace built to that date, in the capital of Hsien-yang. The palace had 270 pavilions; all of these were connected by secret underground passageways, allowing the emperor to move through the palace without anyone seeing him. He slept in a differ­ent room every night, and anyone who inadvertently laid eyes on hirn was instantly beheaded. Only a handful of men knew his whereabouts, and if they revealed it to anyone, they, too, were put to death. The first emperor had grown so terrified of human contact that when he had to leave the palace he traveled incognito, disguising hirnself care­fully. On one such trip through the provinces, he suddenly died. His body was borne back to the capital in the emperor's carriage, with a cart packed with salted fish trailing behind it to cover up the smell of the rotting corpse-no one was to know of his death. He died alone, far from his wives, his family, his friends, and his courtiers, accompanied only by a minister and a handful of eunuchs. Interpretation Shih Huang Ti started off as the king of Ch'in, a fearless warrior of unbri­dled ambition. Writers of the time described hirn as a man with \"a waspish nose, eyes like slits, the voice of a jackal, and the heart of a tiger or wolf.\" He could be merciful sometimes, but more often he \"swallowed men up without ascrupIe.\" It was through trickery and violence that he conquered the provinces surrounding his own and created China, forging a single na­tion and culture out of many. He broke up the feudal system, and to keep an eye on the many members of the royal families that were scattered across the realm's various kingdoms, he moved 120,000 ofthem to the cap­ital, where he housed the most important courtiers in the vast palace of Hsien-yang. He consolidated the many walls on the borders and built them into the Great Wall of China. He standardized the country's laws, its writ­ten language, even the size of its cartwheels. As part of this process of unification, however, the first emperor out­lawed the writings and teachings of Confucius, the philosopher whose ideas on the moral life had already become virtually a religion in Chinese culture. On Shih Huang Ti's order, thousands of books relating to Confu­cius were burned, and anyone who quoted Confucius was to be beheaded. This made many enemies for the emperor, and he grew constantly afraid, even paranoid. The executions mounted. A contemporary, the writer Han­fei-tzu, noted that \"Ch'in has been victorious for four generations, yet has lived in constant terror and apprehension of destruction.\" As the emperor withdrew deeper and deeper into the palace to protect 1'111-: \\1 1,,<')1 1·: 01 1'111'.

Eunuchs and ministers enacted political policies without his approval or even his knowledge; they also plotted against hirn. By the end, he was emperor in name only, and was so isolated that barely anyone knew he had died. He had probably been poi­soned by the same scheming ministers who encouraged his isolation. That is what isolation brings: Retreat into a fortress and you lose con­tact with the sources of your power. You lose your ear for what is happen­ing around you, as weIl as a sense of proportion. Instead of being safer, you cut yourself off from the kind of knowledge on which your life depends. Never enclose yourself so far from the streets that you cannot hear what is happening around you, including the plots against you. OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW Louis XIV had the palace of Ve rsailles built for hirn and his court in the 1660s, and it was like no other royal palace in the world. As in a beehive, everything revolved around the royal person. He lived surrounded by the nobility, who were allotted apartments nestled around his, their closeness to hirn dependent on their rank. The king's bedroom occupied the literal center of the palace and was the focus of everyone's attention. Every mom­ing the king was greeted in this room by a ritual known as the lever. At eight A.M., the king's first valet, who slept at the foot of the royal bed, would awaken His Majesty. Then pages would open the door and admit those who had a function in the lever. The order of their entry was precise: First came the king's illegitimate sons and his grandchildren, then the princes and princesses of the blood, and then his physician and sur­geon. There followed the grand officers of the wardrobe, the king's official reader, and those in charge of entertaining the king. Next would arrive var­ious govemment officials, in ascending order of rank. Last but not least came those attending the lever by special invitation. By the end of the cere­mony, the room would be packed with weIl over a hundred royal atten­dants and visitors. The day was organized so that all the palace's energy was directed at and passed through the king. Louis was constantly attended by courtiers and officials, all asking for his advice and judgment. To all their questions he usually replied, \"I shall see.\" As Saint-Simon noted, \"If he tumed to someone, asked hirn a ques­tion, made an insignificant remark, the eyes of all present were tumed on this person. It was a distinction that was talked of and increased prestige.\" There was no possibility of privacy in the palace, not even for the king­every room communicated with another, and every hallway led to larger rooms where groups of nobles gathered constantly. Everyone's actions were interdependent, and nothing and no one passed unnoticed: \"The king not only saw to it that all the high nobility was present at his court,\" wrote Saint-Simon, \"he demanded the same of the minor nobility. At his lever and coucher, at his meals, in his gardens of Versailles, he always looked"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"about hirn, noticing everything. He was offended if the most distinguished nobles did not live permanently at court, and those who showed them­selves never or hardly ever, incurred his full displeasure. If one of these de­sired something, the king would say proudly: 'I do not know hirn,' and the judgment was irrevocable.\" Interpretation Louis XIV came to power at the end of a terrible civil war, the Fronde. A principal instigator of the war had been the nobility, which deeply resented the growing power of the throne and yearned for the days of feudalism, when the lords ruled their own fiefdoms and the king had little authority over them. The nobles had lost the civil war, but they remained a fr actious, resentfullot. The construction of Ve rsailles, then, was far more than the decadent whim of a luxury-loving king. It served a crucial function: The king could keep an eye and an ear on everyone and everything around hirn. The once proud nobility was reduced to squabbling over the right to help the king put on his robes in the morning. There was no possibility here of pri­vacy-no possibility of isolation. Louis XIV very early grasped the truth that for a king to isolate hirnself is gravely dangerous. In his absence, con­spiracies will spring up like mushrooms after rain, animosities will crystal­lize into factions, and rebellion will break out before he has the time to react. To combat this, sociability and openness must not only be encour­aged, they must be formally organized and channeled. These conditions at Ve rsailles lasted for Louis's entire reign, some fifty years of relative peace and tranquillity. Through it all, not a pin dropped without Louis hearing it. Solitude is dangerous to re ason, without beingjavorable to virtue .... Remember that the solitary mortal is certainly luxurious, probably superstitious, and possibly mad. Dr. SamuelJohnson, 1709-1784 KEYS TO POWER Machiavelli makes the argument that in a strictly military sense a fortress is invariably a mistake. It becomes a symbol of power's isolation, and is an easy target for its builders' enemies. Designed to defend you, fortresses ac­tually cut you off from help and cut into your flexibility. They may appear impregnable, but once you retire to one, everyone knows where you are; and a siege does not have to succeed to turn your fortress into a prison. With their small and confined spaces, fortresses are also extremely vulner­ab le to the plague and contagious diseases. In a strategic sense, the iso­lation of a fortress provides no protection, and actually creates more problems than it solves. was made so near/y to resemb/e the counle­nanee of a stiffened corpse Ihal Ihe closest serutiny musl have had dijficu/ty in detecting Ihe cheal.

EDGAR ALLAN POlO. 1809-1849 LAW 18 1.13"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"134 LAW 18 Because humans are social creatures by nature, power depends on so­cial interaction and circulation. To make yourself powerful you must place yourself at the center of things, as Louis XIV did at Ve rsailles. All activity should revolve around you, and you should be aware of everything hap­pening on the street, and of anyone who might be hatching plots against you. The danger for most people comes when they feel threatened. In such times they tend to retreat and elose ranks, to find security in a kind of fortress. In doing so, however, they come to rely for information on a smaller and smaller cirele, and lose perspective on events around them. They lose maneuverability and become easy targets, and their isolation makes them paranoid. As in warfare and most games of strategy, isolation often precedes defeat and death. In moments of uncertainty and danger, you need to fight this desire to turn inward. Instead, make yourself more accessible, seek out old allies and make new ones, force yourself into more and more different cireles. This has been the trick of powerful people for centuries. The Roman statesman Cicero was born into the lower nobility, and had little chance of power unless he managed to make a place for himself among the aristocrats who controlled the city. He succeeded brilliantly, identifying everyone with influence and figuring out how they were con­nected to one another. He mingled everywhere, knew everyone, and had such a vast network of connections that an enemy here could easily be counterbalanced by an ally there. The French statesman Talleyrand played the game the same way. Al­though he came from one of the oldest aristocratic families in France, he made a point of always staying in touch with what was happening in the streets of Paris, allowing him to foresee trends and troubles. He even got a certain pleasure out of mingling with shady criminal types, who supplied him with valuable information. Every time there was a crisis, a transition of power-the end of the Directory, the fall of Napoleon, the abdication of Louis XVIII-he was able to survive and even thrive, because he never elosed himself up in a small cirele but always forged connections with the neworder. This law pertains to kings and queens, and to those of the highest power: The moment you lose contact with your people, seeking security in isolation, rebellion is brewing. Never imagine yourself so elevated that you can afford to cut yourself off from even the lowest echelons. By retreating to a fortress, you make yourself an easy target for your plotting subjects, who view your isolation as an insult and a reason for rebellion. Since humans are such social creatures, it follows that the social arts that make us pleasant to be around can be practiced only by constant ex­posure and circulation. The more you are in contact with others, the more graceful and at ease you become. Isolation, on the other hand, engenders an awkwardness in your gestures, and leads to further isolation, as people start avoiding you. In 1545 Duke Cosimo I de' Medici decided that to ensure the immor-"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"tality of his name he would commission frescoes for the main chapel of the church of San Lorenzo in Florence. He had many great painters to choose from, and in the end he picked J acopo da Pontormo. Getting on in years, Pontormo wanted to make these frescoes his chef d'oeuvre and legacy. His first decision was to elose the chapel off with walls, partitions, and blinds. He wanted no one to witness the creation of his masterpiece, or to steal his ideas. He would outdo Michelangelo hirns elf. When some young men broke into the chapel out of curiosity, J acopo sealed it off even further. Pontormo filled the chapel's ceiling with biblical scenes-the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah's ark, on and on. At the top of the middle wall he painted Christ in his majesty, raising the dead on Judgment Day. The artist worked on the chapel for eleven years, rarely leaving it, since he had de­veloped a phobia for human contact and was afraid his ideas would be stolen. Pontormo died before completing the frescoes, and none of them has survived. But the great Renaissance writer Vasari, a friend of Pontormo's who saw the frescoes shortly after the artist's death, left a description of what they looked like. There was a total lack of proportion. Scenes bumped against scenes, figures in one story being juxtaposed with those in another, in maddening numbers. Pontormo had become obsessed with de­tail but had lost any sense of the overall composition. Vasari left off his de­scription of the frescoes by writing that if he continued, \"I think I would go mad and become entangled in this painting, just as I believe that in the eleven years of time Jacopo spent on it, he entangled hirnself and anyone else who saw it.\" 1nstead of crowning Pontormo's career, the work became his undoing. These frescoes were visual equivalents of the effects of isolation on the human mind: a loss of proportion, an obsession with detail combined with an inability to see the larger picture, a kind of extravagant ugliness that no longer communicates. Clearly, isolation is as deadly for the creative arts as for the social arts. Shakespeare is the most famous writer in history be­cause, as a dramatist for the popular stage, he opened hirns elf up to the masses, making his work accessible to people no matter what their educa­tion and taste. Artists who hole themselves up in their fortress lose a sense of proportion, their work communicating only to their small circle. Such art remains comered and powerless. Finally, since power is a human creation, it is inevitably increased by contact with other people. 1nstead of falling into the fortress mentality, view the world in the following manner: 1t is like a vast Ve rsailles, with every room communicating with another. You need to be permeable, able to float in and out of different circles and mix with different types. That kind of mobility and social contact will protect you from plotters, who will be unable to keep secrets from you, and from YOUf enemies, who will be unable to isolate you from yoUf allies. Always on the move, you mix and mingle in the rooms of the palace, never sitting or settling in one place. No hunter can fix his aim on such a swift-moving creature.

Without keeping an ear on what is happening in the streets, you will be unable to protect YOUfself. About the only thing that constant human contact cannot facili­tate is thought.

The danger is, however, that this kind of isolation will sire all kinds of strange and perverted ideas.

The hig hest form of the art of power is the ability to dis­tinguish the wolves from the lambs, the foxes from the hares, the hawks from the vultures. If you make this distinction weIl, you will succeed with­out needing to coerce anyone too much. But if you deal blindly with whomever crosses your path, you will have a life of constant sorrow, if you even live that long. Being able to recognize types of people, and to act ac­cordingly, is critical. The following are the five most dangerous and diffi­cult types of mark in the jungle, as identified by artists-con and otherwise-of the past. The Arrogant and Proud Man. Although he may initially disguise it, this man's touchy pride makes hirn very dangerous. Any perceived slight will lead to a vengeance of overwhelming violence. You may say to yourself, \"But I only said such-and-such at a party, where everyone was drunk. ... \" It does not matter. There is no sanity behind his overreaction, so do not waste time trying to figure hirn out. If at any point in your deal­ings with a person you sense an oversensitive and overactive pride, flee. Whatever you are hoping for from hirn isn't worth it. The Hopelessly Insecure Man. This man is related to the proud and ar­rogant type, but is less violent and harder to spot. His ego is fragile, his sense of self insecure, and if he feels hirnself deceived or attacked, the hurt will simmer. He will attack you in bites that will take forever to get big enough for you to notice. If you find you have deceived or harmed such a man, disappear for a long time. Do not stay around hirn or he will nibble you to death. Mr. Suspicion. Another variant on the breeds above, this is a future Joe Stalin. He sees what he wants to see-usually the worst-in other people, and imagines that everyone is after hirn. Mr. Suspicion is in fact the least dangerous of the three: Genuinely unbalanced, he is easy to deceive, just as Stalin hirnself was constantly deceived. Play on his suspicious nature to get hirn to turn against other people. But if you do become the target of his sus­picions, watch out. The Serpent with a Long Memory. If hurt or deceived, this man will show no anger on the surface; he will calculate and wait. Then, when he is in a position to turn the tables, he will exact a revenge marked by a cold­blooded shrewdness. Recognize this man by his calculation and cunning in the different areas of his life. He is usually cold and unaffectionate. Be dou­bly careful of this snake, and if you have somehow injured hirn, either crush him completely or get hirn out of your sight. The Plain, Unassuming, and Often Unintelligent Man. Ah, your ears prick up when you find such a tempting victim. But this man is a lot harder"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"to deceive than you imagine. Falling for a ruse often takes intelligence and imagination-a sense of the possible rewards. The blunt man will not take the bait because he does not recognize it. He is that unaware. The danger with this man is not that he will harm you or seek revenge, but rnerely that he will waste your time, energy, resources, and even your san­ity in trying to deceive him. Have a test ready for a mark-a joke, a story. If his re action is utterly literal, this is the type you are dealing with. Continue at your own risk. TRANSGRESSIONS OF THE LAW Tr ansgression I In the early part of the thirteenth century, Muhammad, the shah of Khwarezm, managed after many wars to forge a huge empire, extending west to present-day Turkey and south to Mghanistan. The empire's center was the great Asian capital of Samarkand. The shah had a powernd, well­trained army, and could mobilize 200,000 warriors within days. In 1219 Muhammad received an embassy from a new tribal leader to the east, Genghis Khan. The embassy included all sorts of gifts to the great Muhammad, representing the finest goods from Khan's small but growing Mongoi empire. Genghis Khan wanted to reopen the Silk Route to Europe, and offered to share it with Muhammad, while promising peace between the two empires. Muhammad did not know this upstart from the east, who, it seemed to hirn, was extremely arrogant to try to talk as an equal to one so clearly his superior. He ignored Khan's offer. Khan tried again: This time he sent a caravan of a hundred camels filled with the rarest articles he had plun­dered from China. Before the caravan reached Muhammad, however, Inalchik, the govemor of a region bordering on Samarkand, seized it for hirnself, and executed its leaders. Genghis Khan was sure that this was a mistake--that Inalchik had acted without Muhammad's approval. He sent yet another mission to Muhammad, reiterating his offer and asking that the govemor be punished. This time Muhammad hirnself had one of the ambassadors beheaded, and sent the other two back with shaved heads-a horrifying insult in the Mon­goI code of honor. Khan sent a message to the shah: \"You have chosen war. What will happen will happen, and what it is to be we know not; only God knows.\" Mobilizing his forces, in 1220 he attacked Inalchik's province, where he seized the capital, captured the govemor, and ordered hirn exe­cuted by having molten silver poured into his eyes and ears. Over the next year, Khan led a series of guerrilla-like campaigns against the shah's much larger army. His method was totally novel for the tirne-his soldiers could move very fast on horseback, and had mastered the art of firing with bow and arrow while mounted. The speed and flexi­bility of his forces allowed hirn to deceive Muhammad as to his intentions and the directions of his movements.

Interpretation Never assurne that the person you are dealing with is weaker or less impor­tant than you are. Some men are slow to take offense, which may make you misjudge the thickness of their skin, and fail to worry about insulting them. But should you offend their honor and their pride, they will over­whelm you with a violence that seems sudden and extreme given their slowness to anger. If you want to turn people down, it is best to do so po­litely and respectfully, even if you feel their request is impudent or their offer ridiculous. Never reject them with an insult until you know them bet­ter; you may be dealing with a Genghis Khan. Transgression II In the late 1910s some of the best swindlers in America formed a con-artist ring based in Denver, Colorado. In the winter months they would spread across the southern states, plying their trade. In 1920 Joe Furey, aleader of the ring, was working his way through Texas, making hundreds of thou­sands of dollars with classic con games. In Fort Worth, he met a sucker named J. Frank Norfleet, a cattleman who owned a large ranch. Norfleet fell for the con. Convinced of the riches to come, he emptied his bank ac­count of $45,000 and handed it over to Furey and his confederates. A few days later they gave him his \"millions,\" which tumed out to be a fe w good dollars wrapped around a packet of newspaper clippings. Furey and his men had worked such cons a hundred times before, and the sucker was usually so embarrassed by his gullibility that he quietly leamed his lesson and accepted the loss. But Norfleet was not like other suckers. He went to the police, who told hirn there was little they could do. \"Then 1'11 go after those people myself,\" Norfleet told the detectives. \"1'11 get them, too, if it takes the rest of my life.\" His wife took over the ranch as Norfleet scoured the country, looking for others who had been fleeced in the same game. One such sucker came fo rward, and the two men identified one of the con artists in San Francisco, and managed to get hirn locked up. The man committed suicide rather than fa ce a long term in prison. Norfleet kept going. He tracked down another of the con artists in Montana, roped him like a calf, and dragged hirn through the muddy streets to the town jail. He traveled not only across the country but to England, Canada, and Mexico in search of Joe Furey, and also of Furey's right-hand man, W B. Spencer. Finding Spencer in Montreal, Norfleet chased him through the streets. Spencer escaped but the rancher stayed on his trail and caught up with him in Salt Lake City. Preferring the mercy of the law to Norfleet's wrath, Spencer turned hirnself in. Norfleet found Furey in Jacksonville, Florida, and personally hauled him off to face justice in Texas. But he wouldn't stop there: He continued on to Denver, determined to break up the entire ring. Spending not only"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"large sums of money but another year of his life in the pursuit, he managed to put all of the con ring's leaders behind bars. Even some he didn't catch had grown so terrified of hirn that they too turned themselves in. After five years of hunting, Norfleet had single-handedly destroyed the eountry's largest confederation of con artists. The effort bankrupted hirn and ruined his marriage, but he died a satisfied man. Interpretation Most men accept the humiliation of being conned with a sense of resigna­tion. They leam their lesson, recognizing that there is no such thing as a free lunch, and that they have usually been brought down by their own greed for easy money. Some, however, refuse to take their medicine. In­stead of reflecting on their own gullibility and avarice, they see themselves as totally innocent victims. Men like this may seem to be crusaders for justice and honesty, but they are actually immoderately insecure. Being fooled, being conned, has activated their self-doubt, and they are desperate to repair the damage. Were the mortgage on Norfleet's ranch, the collapse of his marriage, and the years of borrowing money and living in cheap hotels worth his revenge over his embarrassment at being fleeced? To the Norfleets of the world, overcoming their embarrassment is worth any price. All people have insecurities, and often the best way to deceive a sucker is to play upon his insecurities. But in the realm of power, everything is a question of degree, and the person who is decidedly more insecure than the average mortal presents great dangers. Be wamed: If you practice de­eeption or trickery of any sort, study your mark weIl. Some people's inse­eurity and ego fragility cannot tolerate the slightest offense. To see if you are dealing with such a type, test them first-make, say, a mild joke at their expense. A confident person williaugh; an overly insecure one will react as if personally insulted. If you suspect you are dealing with this type, find an­other victim. Transgression III In the fifth century B.C., Ch'ung-erh, the prince of Ch'in (in present-day China), had been forced into exile. He lived modestly-even, sometimes, in poverty-waiting for the time when he could return horne and resurne his princely life. Once he was passing through the state of Cheng, where the mler, not knowing who he was, treated hirn rudely. The ruler's minis­ter, Shu Chan, saw this and said, \"This man is a worthy prince. May Your Highness treat hirn with great courtesy and thereby place hirn under an obligation!\" But the ruler, able to see only the prince's lowly station, ig­nored this advice and insulted the prince again. Shu Chan again warned his master, saying, \"If Your Highness cannot treat Ch'ung-erh with cour­tesy, you should put hirn to death, to avoid calamity in the future.\" The mler only scoffed. Years later, the prince was finally able to return horne, his circum­stances greatly changed. He did not forget who had been kind to hirn, and LAW 19 141"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"142 LAW 19 who had been insolent, during his years of poverty. Least of a1l did he for­get his treatment at the hands of the ruler of Cheng. At his first opportunity he assembled a vast army and marched on Cheng, taking eight eities, de­stroying the kingdom, and sending the ruler into an exile of his own. Interpretation You can never be sure who you are dealing with. A man who is of litde im­portance and me ans today can be a person of power tomorrow. We forget a lot in our lives, but we rarely forget an insult How was the ruler of Cheng to know that Prince Ch'ung-erh was an ambitious, calculating, cunning type, a serpent with a long memory? There was really no way for him to know, you may say-but since there was no way, it would have been better not to tempt the fates by finding out. There is nothing to be gained by insulting a person unnecessarily. Swa1low the impulse to offend, even if the other person seems weak. The satisfaction is meager compared to the danger that someday he or she will be in a posi­tion to hurt you. Tr ansgression IV The year of 1920 had been a particularly bad one for American art dealers. Big buyers-the robber-baron generation of the previous century-were getting to an age where they were dying off like flies, and no new rnillion­aires had emerged to take their place. Things were so bad that a number of the major dealers decided to pool their resources, an unheard-of event, since art dealers usually get along like cats and dogs. Joseph Duveen, art dealer to the richest tycoons of America, was suf­fering more than the others that year, so he deeided to go along with this alliance. The group now consisted of the five biggest dealers in the country. Looking around for a new client, they deeided that their last best hope was Henry Ford, then the wealthiest man in America. Ford had yet to venture into the art market, and he was such a big target that it made sense for them to work together. The dealers deeided to assemble a list, \"The 100 Greatest Paintings in the World\" (a1l of which they happened to have in stock), and to offer the lot of them to Ford. With one purchase he could make himself the world's greatest collector. The consortium worked for weeks to produce a magnifi­cent object: a three-volume set of books containing beautiful reproductions of the paintings, as well as scholarly texts accompanying each picture. Next they made a personal visit to Ford at his home in Dearbom, Michigan. There they were surprised by the simplicity of his house: Mr. Ford was ob­viously an extremely unaffected man. Ford received them in his study. Looking through the book, he ex­pressed astonishment and delight. The exeited dealers began imagining the millions of dollars that would short1y flow into their coffers. Fina1ly, how­ever, Ford looked up from the book and said, \"Gendemen, beautiful books like these, with beautiful colored pictures like these, must cost an awful lot!\" \"But Mr. Ford!\" exclaimed Duveen, \"we don't expect you to buy these"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"books. We got them up especially for you, to show you the pietures. These books are a present to you.\" Ford seemed puzzled. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"it is extremely nice of you, but I really don't see how I can accept a beau­tiful, expensive present like this from strangers.\" Duveen explained to Ford that the reproductions in the books showed paintings they had hoped to seIl to hirn. Ford finally understood. \"But gentlemen,\" he exclaimed, \"what would I want with the original pietures when the ones right here in these books are so beautiful?\" Interpretation Joseph Duveen prided hirnself on studying his victims and clients in ad­vance, figuring out their weaknesses and the peculiarities of their tastes be­fore he ever met them. He was driven by desperation to drop this tactic just once, in his assault on Henry Ford. It took hirn months to recover from his misjudgment, both mentally and monetarily. Ford was the unassuming plain-man type who just isn't worth the bother. He was the incarnation of those literal-minded folk who do not possess enough imagination to be de­eeived. From then on, Duveen saved his energies for the Mellons and Mor­gans of the world-men crafty enough for hirn to entrap in his snares. KEYS TO POWER The ability to meaSUfe people and to know who you're dealing with is the most important skill of all in gathering and conserving power. Without it you are blind: Not only will you off end the wrong people, you will choose the wrong types to work on, and will think you are flattering people when you are actually insulting them. Before embarking on any move, take the measure of YOUf mark or potential opponent. Otherwise you will waste time and make mistakes. Study people's weaknesses, the chinks in their annor, their areas ofboth pride and insecurity. Know their ins and outs be­fore you even decide whether or not to deal with them. Two final words of caution: First, in judging and measuring your oppo­nent, never rely on your instincts. You will make the greatest mistakes of all if you rely on such inexact indicators. Nothing can substitute for gathering eonerete knowledge. Study and spy on YOUf opponent for however long it takes; this will pay off in the long run. Second, never trust appearances. Anyone with a serpent's heart can use a show of kindness to cloak it; a person who is blustery on the outside is often really a coward. Leam to see through appearances and their contra­c1ietions. Never trust the version that people give of themselves-it is ut­terly unreliable. LAW 19 143"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"144 LAW 19 REVERSAL Image: The Hunter.

Play the Virgin Queen: Give them hope but never satisfaction. OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW When Queen Elizabeth I ascended the throne of England, in 1558, there was much to-do about her finding a husband. The issue was debated in Par­liament, and was a main topic of conversation among Englishmen of all classes; they often disagreed as to whom she should marry, but everyone thought she should marry as soon as possible, for a queen must have a king, and must bear heirs for the kingdom. The debates raged on for years. Meanwhile the most handsome and eligible bachelors in the re alm-Sir Robert Dudley, the Earl of Essex, Sir Walter Raleigh-vied for Elizabeth's hand. She did not discourage them, but she seemed to be in no hurry, and her hints as to which man might be her favorite often contradicted each other. In 1566, Parliament sent a delegation to Elizabeth urging her to marry before she was too old to bear children. She did not argue, nor did she discourage the delegation, but she remained a virgin nonetheless. The delicate game that Elizabeth played with her suitors slowly made her the subject of innumerable sexual fantasies and the ob ject of cultish worship. The court physician, Simon Forman, used his diary to describe his dreams of deflowering her. Painters represented her as Diana and other goddesses. The poet Edmund Spenser a'\"'d others wrote eulogies to the Vir­gin Queen. She was referred to as \"thc world's Empresse,\" \"that virtuous Virgo\" who rules the world and sets the stars in motion. In conversation with her, her many male suitors would employ bold sexual innuendo, a dare that Elizabeth did not discourage. She did an she could to stir their in­terest and simultaneously keep them at bay. Throughout Europe, kings and princes knew that a marriage with Eliz­abeth would seal an alliance between England and any nation. The king of Spain wooed her, as did the prince of Sweden and the archduke of Austria. She politely refused them alt The great diplomatie issue of Elizabeth's day was posed by the revolt of the Flemish and Dutch Lowlands, which were then possessions of Spain. Should England break its alliance with Spain and choose France as its main ally on the Continent, thereby encouraging Flemish and Dutch indepen­dence? By 1570 it had come to seem that an alliance with France would be England's wisest course. France had two eligible men of noble blood, the dukes of Anjou and Alenc;on, brothers of the French king. Would either of them marry Elizabeth? Both had advantages, and Elizabeth kept the hopes of both alive. The issue simmered for years. The duke of Anjou made sev-"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"eral visits to England, kissed Elizabeth in public, even called her by pet names; she appeared to requite his affections. Meanwhile, as she flirted with the two brothers, a treaty was signed that sealed peace between France and England. By 1582 Elizabeth feit she could break off the courtship. In the case of the duke of Anjou in particular, she did so with great relief: For the sake of diplomacy she had aHowed herself to be courted by a man whose presence she could not stand and whom she found physically repulsive. Once peace between France and England was secure, she dropped the unctuous duke as politely as she could. By this time Elizabeth was too old to bear children. She was accord­ingly able to live the rest of her life as she desired, and she died the Vrrgin Queen. She left no direct heir, but mIed through aperiod of incomparable peace and cultural fertility. Interpretation Elizabeth had good reason not to marry: She had witnessed the mistakes of Mary Queen of Scots, her cousin. Resisting the idea of being mIed by a woman, the Scots expected Mary to marry and marry wisely. To wed a for­eigner would be unpopular; to favor any particular noble house would open up terrible rivalries. In the end Mary chose Lord Damley, a Ca tholic. In doing so she incurred the wrath of Scotland's Protestants, and endless turmoil ensued. Elizabeth knew that marriage can often lead to a female mler's undo­ing: By marrying and committing to an alliance with one party or nation, the queen becomes embroiled in conflicts that are not of her choosing, con­fliets which may eventually overwhelm her or lead her into a futile war. Also, the husband becomes the de facto mler, and often tries to do away with his wife the queen, as Damley tried to get rid of Mary. Elizabeth learned the lesson weH. She had two goals as amier: to a--oid marriage and to avoid war. She managed to combine these goals by t....:ngling the possi­bility of marriage in order to forge alliances. The moment she committed to any single suitor would have been the moment she lost her power. She had to emanate mystery and desirability, never discouraging anyone's hopes but never yielding. Through this lifelong game of flirting and withdrawing, Elizabeth dominated the country and every man who sought to conquer her. As the center of attention, she was in contro!. Keeping her independence above all, Elizabeth protected her power and made herself an object of worship. I would rather be a beggar and single than a queen and married. Queen Elizabeth I, 1533-1603 KEYS TO POWER Since power depends greatly on appearances, you must leam the tricks that will enhance your image. Refusing to commit to a person or group is one of these. When you hold yourself back, you incur not anger but a kind LAW 20 147"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"148 LAW 20 of respect. You instantly seem powerful because you make yourself un­graspable, rather than succumbing to the group, or to the relationship, as most people do. This aura of power only grows with time: As your reputa­tion for independence grows, more and more people will come to desire you, wanting to be the one who gets you to commit. Desire is like a virus: If we see that someone is desired by other people, we tend to find this person desirable too. The moment you commit, the magic is gone. You become like every­one else. People will try all kinds of underhanded methods to get you to commit. They will give you gifts, shower you with favors, all to put you under obligation. Encourage the attention, stimulate their interest, but do not commit at any cost. Accept the gifts and favors if you so desire, but be careful to maintain your inner aloofness. You cannot inadvertently allow yourself to feel obligated to anyone. Remember, though: The goal is not to put people off, or to make it seem that you are incapable of commitment. Uke the Virgin Queen, you need to stir the pot, excite interest, lure people with the possibility of having you. You have to bend to their attention occasionally, then-but never too far. The Greek soldier and statesman Alcibiades played this game to per­fection. It was Alcibiades who inspired and led the massive Athenian ar­mada that invaded Sicily in 414 B.C. When envious Athenians back horne tried to bring hirn down by accusing hirn of trumped-up charges, he de­fected to the enemy, the Spartans, instead of facing a trial back horne. Then, after the Athenians were defeated at Syracuse, he left Sparta for Persia, even though the power of Sparta was now on the rise. Now, however, both the Athenians and the Spartans courted Alcibiades because of his influence with the Persians; and the Per lans showered hirn with honors because of his power over the Athenians an d the Spartans. He made promises to every side but committed to none, and in the end he held all the cards. If you aspire to power and influence, try the Alcibiades tactic: Put yourself in the middle between competing powers. Lure one side with the promise of your help; the other side, always wanting to outdo its enemy, will pursue you as weIl. As each side vies for your attention, you will im­mediately seem a person of great influence and desirability. More power will accrue to you than if you had rashly committed to one side. To perfect this tactic you need to keep yourself inwardly free from emotional entan­glements, and to view all those around you as pawns in your rise to the top. You cannot let yourself become the lackey for any cause. In the midst of the 1968 U.S. presidential election, Henry Kissinger made a phone call to Richard Nixon's team. Kissinger had been allied with Nelson RockefeIler, who had unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomina­tion. Now Kissinger offered to supply the Nixon camp with valuable inside information on the negotiations for peace in Vietnam that were then going on in Paris. He had a man on the negotiating team keeping rum informed of the latest developments. The Nixon team gladly accepted his offer. At the same time, however, Kissinger also approached the Democratic nominee, Hubert Humphrey, and offered his aid. The Humphrey people"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"asked hirn for inside information on Nixon and he supplied it. \"Look,\" Kissinger told Humphrey's people, \"I've hated Nixon for years.\" In fact he had no interest in either side. What he really wanted was what he got: the promise of a high-level cabinet post from both Nixon and Humphrey. Whichever man won the election, Kissinger's career was secure. The winner, of course, was Nixon, and Kissinger duly went on to his cabinet post. Even so, he was careful never to appear too much of a Nixon man. When Nixon was reelected in 1972, men much more loyal to hirn than Kissinger were fired. Kissinger was also the only Nixon high official to survive Watergate and serve under the next president, Gerald Ford. By maintaining a little distance he thrived in turbulent times. Those who use this strategy often notice a strange phenomenon: People who rush to the support of others tend to gain little respect in the process, for their help is so easily obtained, while those who stand back find themselves besieged with supplicants. Their aloofness is powerful, and everyone wants them on their side. When Picasso, after early years of poverty, had become the most suc­cessful artist in the world, he did not commit hirnself to this dealer or that dealer, although they now besieged hirn from all sides with attractive offers and grand promises. Instead, he appeared to have no interest in their ser­vices; this technique drove them wild, and as they fought over hirn his prices only rose. When Henry Kissinger, as U.S. secretary of state, wanted to re ach dHente with the Soviet Union, he made no concessions or concil­iatory gestures, but courted China instead. This infuriated and also scared the Soviets-they were already politica 11y isolated and feared further isola­tion if the United States and China_came together. Kissinger's move pushed them to the negotiating table. The tactic has a parallel in seduction: When you want to seduce a woman, Stendhal advises, court her sister first. Stay aloof and people will come to you. It will become achalienge for them to win your affections. As long as you imitate the wise Virgin Queen and stimulate their hopes, you will remain a magnet of attention and desire. Image: The Virgin Queen. The center of attention, desire, and worship.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW In the late fifteenth century, the strongest city-states in Italy-Venice, Flo­rence, Rome, and Milan-found themselves constantly squabbling. Hover­ing above their struggles were the nations of France and Spain, ready to grab whatever they could from the weakened Italian powers. And trapped in the middle was the small state of Mantua, roled by the young Duke Gianfrancesco Gonzaga. Mantua was strategically located in northern Italy, and it seemed only a matter of time before one of the powers swal­lowed it up and it ceased to exist as an independent kingdom. Gonzaga was a fierce warrior and a skilled commander of tro ops, and he became a kind of mercenary general for whatever side paid hirn best. In the year 1490, he married Isabella d'Este, daughter of the roler of another small Italian duchy, Ferrara. Since he now spent most of his time away fron Mantua, it fell to Isabella to rule in his stead. Isabella's first true test as roler came in 1498, when King Louis XII of France was preparing armies to attack Milan. In their usual perfidious fash­ion, the Italian states immediately looked for ways to profit from Milan's difficulties. Pope Alexander VI promised not to intervene, thereby giving the French carte blanche. The Venetians signaled that they would not help Milan, either-and in exchange for this, they hoped the French would give them Mantua. The roler of Milan, Lodovico Sforza, suddenly found him­self alone and abandoned. He turned to Isabella d'Este, one of his dosest friends (also ro mored to be his lover), and begged her to persuade Duke Gonzaga to come to his aid. Isabella tried, but her husband balked, for he saw Sforza's cause as hopeless. And so, in 1499, Louis swooped down on Milan and took it with ease. Isabella now faced a dilemma: If she stayed loyal to Lodovico, the French would now move against her. But if, instead, she allied herself with France, she would make enemies elsewhere in Italy, compromising Man­tua once Louis eventually withdrew. And if she looked to Ve nice or Rome for help, they would simply swallow up Mantua under the doak of coming to her aid. Yet she had to do something. The mighty king of France was breathing down her neck: She decided to befriend him, as she had be­friended Lodovico Sforza before him-with alluring gifts, witty, intelligent letters, and the possibility of her company, for Isabella was famous as a woman of incomparable beauty and charm."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"In 1500 Louis invited Isabella to a great party in Milan to celebrate his victory. Leonardo da Vinci built an enormous mechanical lion for the af­fair: When the lion opened its mouth, it spewed fresh lilies, the symbols of French royalty. At the party Isabella wore one of her celebrated dresses (she had by far the largest wardrobe of any of the Italian princesses), and just as she had hoped, she charmed and captivated Louis, who ignored all the other ladies vying for his attention. She so on became his constant com­panion, and in exchange for her friendship he pledged to protect Mantua's independence from Venice. As one danger receded, however, another, more worrying one arose, this time from the south, in the form of Cesare Borgia. Starting in 1500, Borgia had marched steadily northward, gobbling up all the small king­doms in his path in the name of his father, Pope Alexander. Isabella under­stood Cesare perfectly: He could be neither trusted nor in any way offended. He had to be cajoled and kept at arm's length. Isabella began by sending hirn gifts-falcons, prize dogs, perfumes, and dozens of masks, which she knew he always wore when he walked the streets of Rome. She sent messengers with flattering greetings (although these messengers also acted as her spies). At one point Cesare asked if he could house some troops in Mantua; Isabella managed to dissuade hirn politely, knowing full weIl that once the troops were quartered in the city, they would never leave. Even while Isabella was charming Cesare, she convinced everyone around her to take care never to utter a harsh word about hirn, since he had spies everywhere and would use the slightest pretext for invasion. When Isabella had a child, she asked Cesare to be the godfather. She even dangled in front of hirn the possibility of a marriage between her family and his. Somehow it all worked, for although elsewhere he seized every­thing in his path, he spared Mantua. In 1503 Cesare's father, Alexander, died, and a few years later the new pope, Julius 11, went to war to drive the French troops from Italy. When the mler of Ferrara-Alfonso, Isabella's brother-sided with the French, Julius decided to attack and humble hirn. Once again Isabella found herself in the middle: the pope on one side, the French and her brother on the other. She dared not ally herself with either, but to off end either would be equally disastrous. Again she played the double game at which she had be­come so expert. On the one hand she got her husband Gonzaga to fight for the pope, knowing he would not fight very hard. On the other she let French troops pass through Mantua to come to Ferrara's aid. While she publidy complained that the French had \"invaded\" her territory, she pri­vately supplied them with valuable information. To make the invasion plausible to Julius, she even had the French pretend to plunder Mantua. It worked once again: The pope left Mantua alone. In 1513, after a lengthy siege, Julius defeated Ferrara, and the French troops withdrew. Worn out by the effort, the pope died a few months later. With his death, the nightrnarish cyde of battles and petty squabbles began to repeat itself. leisurely feeding on the dead kites and crows. and then left the place haie and hearty, observing, \"The weak benefit by the quarrels ofthe mighty. \" INDIAN FABLES Men of great abi!ities are slow to aet, for it is easier to avoid oeea­sions fo r committing yourself than to come weil out of a commit­ment.

FABLES, LEO TOLSTOY, 1828-1910 152 LAW 20 A great deal changed in ltaly during Isabella's reign: Popes came and went, Cesare Borgia rose and then fell, Venice lost its empire, Milan was in­vaded, Florence fell into decline, and Rome was sacked by the Hapsburg Emperor Charles V. Through all this, tiny Mantua not only survived but thrived, its court the envy of Italy. Its wealth and sovereignty would remain intact for a century after Isabella's death, in 1539. Interpretation Isabella d'Este understood Italy's political situation with amazing clarity: Once you took the side of any of the forces in the field, you were doomed. The powerful would take you over, the weak would wear you down. Any new alliance would lead to a new enemy, and as this cycle stirred up more conflict, other forces would be dragged in, until you could no longer extri­cate yourself. Eventually you would collapse from exhaustion. Isabella steered her kingdom on the only course that would bring her safely through. She would not allow herself to lose her head through loy­alty to a duke or a king. Nor would she try to stop the conflict that raged around her-that would only drag her into it. And in any case the conflict was to her advantage. If the various parties were fighting to the death, and exhausting themselves in the process, they were in no position to gobble up Mantua. The source of Isabella's power was her clever ability to seem interested in the affairs and interests of each side, while actually commit­ting to no one but herself and her kingdom. Once you step into a fight that is not of your own choosing, you lose all initiative. The combatants' interests become your interests; you become their tool. Leam to control yourself, to restrain your natural tendency to take sides and join the fight. Be friendly and charming to each of the com­batants, then step back as they collide. With every battle they grow weaker, while you grow stronger with every battle you avoid. When the snipe and the mussel struggle, the fisherman gets the benefit. Ancient Chinese saying KEYS TO POWER To succeed in the game of power, you have to master your emotions. But even if you succeed in gaining such self-control, you can never control the temperamental dispositions of those around you. And this presents a great danger. Most people operate in a whirlpool of emotions, constantly react­ing, chuming up squabbles and conflicts. Your self-control and autonomy will only bother and infuriate them. They will try to draw you into the whirlpool, begging you to take sides in their endless battles, or to make peace for them. If you succumb to their emotional entreaties, little by little you will find your mind and time occupied by tkeir problems. Do not allow whatever compassion and pity you possess to suck you in. You can never win in this game; the conflicts can only multiply. On the other hand, you cannot completely stand aside, for that would"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"cause needless offense. To play the game properly, you must seem inter­ested in other people's problems, even sometimes appear to take their side. But while you make outward gestures of support, you must maintain your inner energy and sanity by keeping your emotions disengaged. No matter how hard people try to puH you in, never let your interest in their affairs and petty squabbles go beyond the surface. Give them gifts, listen with a sympathetic look, even occasionally play the charmer-but inwardly keep both the friendly kings and the perfidious Borgias at arm's length. By refus­ing to commit and thus maintaining your autonomy you retain the initia­tive: Yo ur moves stay matters of your own choosing, not defensive reactions to the push-and-puH of those around you. Slowness to pick up your weapons can be a weapon itself, especially if you let other people exhaust themselves fighting, then take advantage of their exhaustion. In ancient China, the kingdom of Chin once invaded the kingdom of Hsing. Huan, the ruler of a nearby province, thought he should rush to Hsing's defense, but his adviser counseled hirn to wait: \"Hsing is not yet going to ruin,\" he said, \"and Chin is not yet exhausted. If ehin is not exhausted, [we] cannot become very influential. Moreover, the merit of supporting a state in danger is not as great as the virtue of reviving a ruined one.\" The adviser's argument won the day, and as he had pre­dicted, Huan later had the glory both of rescuing Hsing from the brink of destruction and then of conquering an exhausted Chin. He stayed out of the fighting until the forces engaged in it had worn each other down, at which point it was safe for hirn to intervene. That is what holding back from the fray allows you: time to position yourself to take advantage of the situation once one side starts to lose. Yo u can also take the game a step further, by promising your support to both sides in a conflict while maneuvering so that the one to come out ahead in the struggle is you. This was what Castruccio Castracani, ruler of the Italian town of Lucca in the fourteenth century, did when he had designs on the town of Pistoia. A siege would have been expensive, costing both lives and money, but Castruccio knew that Pistoia contained two riyal factions, the Blacks and the Whites, which hated one another. He negotiated with the Blacks, promising to help them against the Whites; then, without their knowledge, he promised the Whites he would help them against the Blacks. And Castruccio kept his promises-he sent an army to a Black­controlled gate to the city, which the sentries of course welcomed in. Meanwhile another of his armies entered through a White-controHed gate. The two armies united in the middle, occupied the town, kiHed the leaders ofboth factions, ended the internal war, and took Pistoia for Castruccio. Preserving your autonomy gives you options when people come to blows-you can play the mediator, broker the peace, while really securing YOUT own interests. You can pledge support to one side and the other may have to court you with a higher bid. ür, like Castruccio, you can appear to take both sides, then play the antagonists against each other. Oftentimes when a conflict breaks out, you are tempted to side with the stronger party, or the one that offers you apparent advantages in an al-THE PRICE OF EI'\\YY While a poor woman stood in the market­place selling cheeses, a cat came along and carried off a cheese.

In France's July Revolution of 1830, after three days of riots, the states­man Talleyrand, now elderly, sat by his Paris window, listening to the peal­ing bells that signaled the riots were over. Tuming to an assistant, he said, \"Ah, the bells! We're winning.\" \"Who's 'we,' mon prince?\" the assistant asked. Gesturing for the man to keep quiet, Talleyrand replied, \"Not a word! 1'11 tell you who we are tomorrow.\" He well knew that only fools rush into a situation-that by committing too quickly you lose your ma­neuverability. People also respect you less: Perhaps tomorrow, they think, you will commit to another, different cause, since you gave YOUfself so eas­ily to this one. Good fortune is a fickle god and will often pass from one side to the other. Commitment to one side deprives you of the advantage of time and the luxury of waiting. Let others fall in love with this group or that; for YOUf part don't rush in, don't lose YOUf head. Finally, there are occasions when it is wisest to drop all pretence of ap­pearing supportive and instead to trumpet your independence and self­reliance. The aristocratic pose of independence is particularly important for those who need to gain respect. George Washington recognized this in his work to establish the young American republic on firm ground. As president, Washington avoided the temptation of making an alliance with France or England, despite the pressUfe on hirn to do so. He wanted the country to eam the world's respect through its independence. Although a treaty with France mighthave helped in the short term, in the long run he knew it would be more effective to establish the nation's autonomy. Eu­rope would have to see the United States as an equal power. Remember: You have only so much energy and so much time. Every moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from YOUf strength. You may be afraid that people will condemn you as heartless, but in the end, maintaining YOUf independence and self-reliance will gain you more re­spect and place you in a position of power from which you can choose to help others on YOUf own initiative."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"REVERSAL Image: A Thicket of Shrubs.

The cable came from a reliable source-William Ralston, owner of the Bank of California-but Harpending nevertheless took it as a practical joke, probably inspired by the recent discovery of huge diamond mines in South Africa. Tr ue, when reports had first come in of gold being discovered in the western United States, everyone had been skeptical, and those had turned out to be true. But a diamond mine in the We st! Harpending showed the cable to his fellow financier Baron Roth­schild (one of the richest men in the world), saying it must be a joke. The baron, however, replied, \"Don't be too sure ab out that. America is a very large country. It has furnished the world with many surprises already. Per­haps it has others in store.\" Harpending promptly took the first ship back to the States. When Harpending reached San Francisco, there was an excitement in the air recalling the Gold Rush days of the late 1840s. Two crusty prospec­tors named Philip Amold and John Slack had been the ones to find the di­amond rnine. They had not divulged its location, in Wyoming, but had led a highly respected mining expert to it several weeks back, taking a circular route so he could not guess his whereabouts. Once there, the expert had watched as the miners dug up diamonds. Back in San Francisco the expert bad taken the gems to various jewelers, one of whom had estimated their worth at $1.5 million. Harpending and Ralston now asked Amold and Slack to accompany them back to New Yo rk, where the jeweler Charles Tiffany would verify the original estimates. The prospectors responded uneasily-they smelled a trap: How could they trust these city slickers? What if Tiffany and the fi­nanciers managed to steal the whole mine out from under them? Ralston tried to allay their fears by giving them $100,000 and placing another $300,000 in escrow for them. If the deal went through, they would be paid an additional $300,000. The miners agreed. The little group traveled to New Yo rk, where a meeting was held at the mansion of Samuel L. Barlow. The cream of the city's aristocracy was in at­tendance-General George Brinton McClellan, commander of the Union for ces in the Civil War; General Benjamin Butler; Horace Greeley, editor of the newspaper the Ne w York Tribune; Harpending; Ralston; and Tiffany. Only Slack and Amold were missing-as tourists in the city, they had de­cided to go sight-seeing. When Tiffany announced that the gems were real and worth a fortune, the financiers could barely control their excitement. They wired Roth­schild and other tycoons to tell them ab out the diamond mine and inviting them to share in the investment. At the same time, they also told the prospectors that they wanted one more test: They insisted that a mining ex­pert of their choosing accompany Slack and Amold to the site to verify its wealth. The prospectors reluctantly agreed. In the meantime, they said, Now. there is nothing of whieh a man is prouder than of intel­leetual ability, fo r it is this that gives hirn his eommanding plaee in the animal warld.

Several weeks later, a man named Louis Janin, the best mining expert in the country, met the prospectors in San Francisco. Janin was a born skeptic who was determined to make sure that the mine was not a fraud. Accompanying Janin were Harpending, and several other interested fi­nanciers. As with the previous expert, the prospectors led the team through a complex series of canyons, completely confusing them as to their where­abouts. Arriving at the site, the financiers watched in amazement as Janin dug the area up, leveling anthills, turning over boulders, and finding emer­alds, rubies, sapphires, and most of all diamonds. The dig lasted eight days, and by the end, Janin was convinced: He told the investors that they now possessed the richest field in mining history. \"With a hundred men and proper machinery,\" he told them, \"1 would guarantee to send out one mil­lion dollars in diamonds every thirty days.\" Returning to San Francisco a few days later, Ralston, Harpending, and company acted fast to form a $10 million corporation of private investors. First, however, they had to get rid of Amold and Slack. That meant hiding their excitement-they certainly did not want to reveal the field's real value. So they played possum. Who knows if Janin is right, they told the prospectors, the mine may not be as rich as we think. This just made the prospectors angry. Trying a different tactic, the financiers told the two men that if they insisted on having shares in the mine, they would end up being fleeced by the unscrupulous tycoons and investors who would run the cor­poration; better, they said, to take the $700,000 already offered-an enor­mous sum at the time-and put their greed aside. This the prospectors seemed to understand, and they finally agreed to take the money, in return signing the rights to the site over to the financiers, and leaving maps to it. News of the mine spread like wildfire. Prospectors farmed out across Wyoming. Meanwhile Harpending and group began spending the millions they had collected fr om their investors, buying equipment, hiring the best men in the business, and fumishing luxurious offices in New York and San Francisco. A few weeks later, on their first trip back to the site, they learned the hard truth: Not a single diamond or ruby was to be found. It was all a fake. They were ruined. Harpending had unwittingly lured the richest men in the world into the biggest scam of the century. Interpretation Amold and Slack pulled off their stupendous con not by using a fake engi­neer or bribing Tiffany: All of the experts had been real. All of them hon­estly believed in the existence of the mine and in the value of the gems. What had fooled them all was nothing else than Amold and Slack them­selves. The two men seemed to be such rubes, such hayseeds, so naive, that no one for an instant had believed them capable of an audacious scam. The prospectors had simply observed the law of appearing more stupid than the mark-the deceiver's First Commandment."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"The logistics of the con were quite simple. Months before Amold and Slack announced the \"discovery\" of the diamond mine, they traveled to Europe, where they purchased some real gems for around $12,000 (part of the money they had saved from their days as gold miners). They then salted the \"mine\" with these gems, which the first expert dug up and brought to San Francisco. The jewelers who had appraised these stones, in­cluding Tiffany hirnself, had gotten caught up in the fever and had grossly overestimated their value. Then Ralston gave the prospectors $100,000 as security, and immediately after their trip to New York they simply went to Amsterdam, where they bought sacks of uncut gems, before retuming to San Francisco. The second time they salted the mine, there were many more jewels to be found. The effectiveness of the scherne, however, rested not on tricks like these but on the fact that Amold and Slack played their parts to perfection. On their trip to New York, where they mingled with rnillionaires and ty­coons, they played up their clodhopper image, wearing pants and coats a size or two too small and acting incredulous at everything they saw in the big city. No one believed that these country simpletons could possibly be conning the most devious, unscrupulous financiers of the time. And once Harpending, Ralston, and even Rothschild accepted the mine's existence, anyone who doubted it was questioning the intelligence of the world's most successful businessmen. In the end, Harpending's reputation was ruined and he never recov­ered; Rothschild leamed bis lesson and never fell for another con; Slack took his money and disappeared from view, never to be found. Amold simply went horne to Kentucky. After all, his sale of his mining rights had been legitimate; the buyers had taken the best advice, and if the mine had run out of diamonds, that was their problem. Amold used the money to greatly enlarge his farm and open up a bank of his OWll. KEYS TO POWER The feeling that someone else is more intelligent than we are is almost in­tolerable. We usually try to justify it in different ways: \"He only has book knowledge, whereas I have real knowledge.\" \"Her parents paid for her to get a good education. If my parents had had as much money, if I had been as privileged .... \" \"He's not as smart as he thinks.\" Last but not least: \"She may know her narrow little field better than I do, but beyond that she's re­ally not smart at all. Even Einstein was a boob outside physics.\" Given how important the idea of intelligence is to most people's van­ity, it is critical never inadvertently to insult or impugn a person's brain power. That is an unforgivable sin. But if you can make this iron rule work for you, it opens up all sorts of avenues of deception. Subliminally reassure people that they are more intelligent than you are, or even that you are a bit of amoron, and you can run rings around them. The feeling of intellec­tual superiority you give them will disarm their suspicion-muscles. In 1865 the Prussian councillor Otto von Bismarck wanted Austria to LAW 21 159"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"160 LAW 21 sign a certain treaty. The treaty was totally in the interests of Prussia and against the interests of Austria, and Bismarck would have to strategize to get the Austrians to agree to it. But the Austrian negotiator, Count BIome, was an avid cardplayer. His particular game was quinze, and he often said that he could judge a man's character by the way he played quinze. Bis­marck knew of this saying of BIome's. The night before the negotiations were to begin, Bismarck innocently engaged BIome in a game of quinze. The Prussian would later write, \"That was the very last time l ever played quinze. I played so recklessly that everyone was astonished. I lost several thousand talers [the currency of the time], but I succeeded in fooling [BIome], for he believed me to be more venturesome than lamand I gave way.\" Besides appearing reckless, Bis­marck also played the witless fool, saying ridiculous things and bumbling about with a surplus of nervous energy. All this made BIome feel he had gathered valuable information. He knew that Bismarck was aggressive--the Prussian already had that reputa­tion, and the way he played had confirmed it. And aggressive men, BIome knew, can be foolish '.md rash. Accordingly, when the time came to sign the treaty, BIome thought he had the advantage. A heedless fool like Bis­marck, he thought, is incapable of cold-blooded calculation and deception, so he only glanced at the treaty before signing it-he failed to read the fine print. As soon as the ink was dry, a joyous Bismarck exelaimed in his face, \"WeIl, I could never have believed that I should find an Austrian diplomat willing to sign that document!\" The Chinese have a phrase, \"Masquerading as a swine to kill the tiger.\" This refers to an ancient hunting technique in which the hunter elothes himself in the hide and snout of a pig, and mimics its grunting. The mighty tiger thinks a pig is coming his way, and lets it get elose, savoring the prospect of an easy meal. But it is the hunter who has the last laugh. Masquerading as a swine works wonders on those who, like tigers, are arrogant and overconfident: The easier they think it is to prey on you, the more easily you can turn the tables. This trick is also useful if you are ambi­tious yet find yourself low in the hierarchy: Appearing less intelligent than you are, even a bit of a fool, is the perfect disguise. Look like a harmless pig and no one will believe you harbor dangerous ambitions. They may even promote you since you seem so likable, and subservient. Claudius before he became emperor of Rome, and the prince of France who later became Louis XIII, used this tactic when those above them suspected they might have designs on the throne. By playing the fool as young men, they were left alone. When the time came for them to strike, and to act with vigor and decisiveness, they caught everyone off-guard. Intelligence is the obvious quality to downplay, but why stop there? Taste and sophistication rank elose to intelligence on the vanity scalej make people feel they are more sophisticated than you are and their guard will come down.

Duveen just laughed. \"How very amus­ing,\" he said. \"Do you realize, young man, that at least twenty other art ex­perts here and in Europe have been taken in too, and have said that painting isn't genuine? And now you've made the same mistake.\" His con­fident tone and air of authority intimidated the Frenchman, who apolo­gized for his mistake. Duveen knew that the art market was flooded with fakes, and that . many paintings had been falsely ascribed to old masters. He tried his best to distinguish the real from the fake, but in his zeal to seIl he often over­played a work's authenticity. What mattered to him was that the buyer be­lieved he had bought a Dürer, and that Duveen himself convinced everyone of his \"expertness\" through his air of irreproachable authority.

In classical times, the city of Athens dominated the sea and coastal areas around Greece, but Sparta, in the Peloponnese, had been Melos's original colonizer. During the Peloponnesian War, then, the Melians re­fused to ally themselves with Athens and remained loyal to Mother Sparta. In 416 B.C. the Athenians sent an expedition against Melos. Before launch­ing an all-out attack, however, they dispatched adelegation to persuade the Melians to surrender and become an ally rather than suffer devastation and defeat. \"You know as weIl as we do,\" the delegates said, \"that the standard of justice depends on the equality of power to compel, and that in fact the strong do what they have the power to do and the weak accept what they have to accept.\" When the Melians responded that this denied the notion of fair play, the Athenians said that those in power determined what was fair and what was not. The Melians argued that this authority belonged to the gods, not to mortals. \"Our opinion of the gods and our knowledge of men,\" replied a member of the Athenian delegation, \"lead us to conclude that it is a general and necessary law of nature to rule whatever one can.\" The Melians would not budge. Sparta, they insisted, would come to their defense. The Athenians countered that the Spartans were a conserva­tive, practical people, and would not help Melos because they had nothing to gain and a lot to lose by doing so. Finally the Melians began to talk of honor and the principle of resisting brute force. \"Do not be led astray by a false sense of honor,\" said the Athe­nians. \"Honor often brings men to ruin when they are faced with an obvi­ous danger that somehow affects their pride. There is nothing disgraceful in giving way to the greatest city in Hellas when she is offering you such rea­sonable terms.\" The debate ended. The Melians discussed the issue among themselves, and decided to trust in the aid of the Spartans, the will of the gods, and the rightness of their cause. They politely declined the Athenians' offer. A few days later the Athenians invaded Melos. The Melians fought nobly, even without the Spartans, who did not come to their rescue. It took several attempts before the Athenians could surround and besiege their main city, but the Melians finally surrendered. The Athenians wasted no time-they put to death all the men of military age that they could capture, they sold the women and children as slaves, and they repopulated the is­land with their own colonists. Only a handful of Melians survived. Interpretation The Athenians were one of the most eminently practical people in history, and they made the most practical argument they could with the Melians: When you are weaker, there is nothing to be gained by fighting a useless fight. No one comes to help the weak-by doing so they would only put themselves in jeopardy. The weak are alone and must submit. Fighting"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"gives you nothing to gain but martyrdom, and in the process a lot of people who do not believe in your cause will die. We akness is no sin, and can even become a strength if you leam how to play it right. Had the Melians surrendered in the first place, they would have been able to sabotage the Athenians in subtle ways, or might have gotten what they could have out of the alliance and then left it when the Athenians themselves were weakened, as in fact happened several years later. Fortunes change and the mighty are often brought down. Surrender conceals great power: Lulling the enemy into complacency, it gives you time to recoup, time to undermine, time for revenge. Never sacrifice that time in exchange for honor in a battle that you cannot win. Weak people never give way when they ought to. Cardinal de Retz, 1613-1679 OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW Sametime in the 1920s the German writer BertoIt Brecht became a convert to the cause of Communism. From then on his plays, essays, and poems re­flected his revolutionary fervor, and he generally tried to make his ideolog­ical statements as clear as possible. When Hitler came to power in Germany, Brecht and his Communist colleagues became marked men. He had many friends in the United States-Americans who sympathized with his beliefs, as well as fellow German intellectuals who had fled Hitler. In 1941, accordingly, Brecht emigrated to the United States, and chose to set­tle in Los Angeles, where he hoped to make a living in the film business. Over the next few years Brecht wrote screenplays with a pointedly an­ticapitalist slant. He had little success in Hollywood, so in 1947, the war having ended, he decided to return to Europe. That same year, however, the U.S. Congress's House Un-American Activities Committee began its investigation into supposed Communist infiltration in Hollywood. It began to gatber information on Brecht, who had so openly espoused Marxism, and on September 19, 1947, only a month before he had planned to leave the United States, he received a subpoena to appear before the committee. In addition to Brecht, a number of other writers, producers, and directors were summoned to appear as well, and this group came to be known as the Hollywood 19. Before going to Washington, the Hollywood 19 met to decide on a plan of action. Their approach would be confrontational. Instead of answering questions about their membership, or lack of it, in the Communist Party, they would read prepared statements that would challenge the authority of the committee and argue that its activities were unconstitutional. Even if this strategy meant imprisonment, it would gain publicity for their cause. Brecht disagreed. What good was it, he asked, to play the martyr and gain a little public sympathy if in the process they lost the ability to stage their plays and sell their scripts for years to come? He feIt certain they were Vo ltaire was living in exile in London at a time when anti-French sentiment was at its highest.

Am I not punished enough in not being born an Englishman?\" The crowd cheered his Ihoughtful words, and escorted him safely back 10 his lodgings.

Why lower them­selves to the level of their opponents by arguing with them? Why not out­fox the committee by appearing to surrender to it wbile subtly mocking it? The Hollywood 19 listened to Brecht politely, but decided to stick to their plan, leaving Brecht to go bis own way. The committee finally summoned Brecht on October 30. They ex­pected hirn to do what others among the Hollywood 19 who had testified before hirn had done: Argue, refuse to answer questions, challenge the committee's right to hold its hearing, even yell and hurI insults. Much to their surprise, however, Brecht was the very picture of congeniality. He wore a suit (something he rarely did), smoked a cigar (he had heard that the committee chairman was a passionate cigar smoker), answered their questions politely, and generally deferred to their authority. Unlike the other witnesses, Brecht answered the question of whether he belonged to the Communist Party: He was not a member, he said, which happened to be the truth. One committee member asked hirn, \"Is it true you have written a number of revolutionary plays?\" Brecht had writ­ten many plays with overt Communist messages, but he responded, \"I have written a number of poems and songs and plays in the fight against Hitler and, of course, they can be considered, therefore, as revolutionary because I, of course, was for the overthrow of that government.\" This state­ment went unchallenged. Brecht's English was more than adequate, but he used an interpreter throughout his testimony, a tactic that allowed hirn to play subtle games with language. When committee members found Communist leanings in lines from English editions of his poems, he would repeat the lines in Ger­man for the interpreter, who would then retranslate them; and somehow they would c;ome out innocuous. At one point a committee member read one of Brecht's revolutionary poems out loud in English, and asked hirn if he had written it. \"No,\" he responded, \"I wrote a German poem, wbich is very different from this.\" The author's elusive answers baffled the commit­tee members, but his politeness and the way he yielded to their authority made it impossible for them to get angry with hirn. After only an hour of questioning, the committee members had had enough. \"Thank you very much,\" said the chairman, \"You are a good ex­ample to the [other] witnesses.\" Not only did they free hirn, they offered to help hirn if he had any trouble with immigration officials who might detain hirn for their own reasons. The following day, Brecht left the United States, never to return. Interpretation The Hollywood 19's confrontational approach won them a lot of sympa­thy, and years later they gained a kind of vindication in public opinion. But they were also blacklisted, and lost valuable years of profitable working time. Brecht, on the other hand, expressed his disgust at the committee more indirectly. It was not that he changed his beliefs or compromised his values; instead, during his short testimony, he kept the upper hand by ap-"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"pearing to yield while all the time running cireles around the committee with vague responses, outright lies that went unchallenged because they were wrapped in enig mas, and word games. In the end he kept the free­dom to continue his revolutionary writing (as opposed to suffering impris­onment or detainment in the United States), even while subtly mocking the committee and its authority with his pseudo-obedience. Keep in mind the following: People trying to make a show of their au­thority are easily deceived by the surrender tactic. Your outward sign of submission makes them feel important; satisfied that you respect them, they become easier targets for a later counterattack, or for the kind of indi­rect ridicule used by Brecht. Measuring your power over time, never sacri­fice long-term maneuverability for the short-lived glories of martyrdom. When the great lord passes, the wise peasant bows deeply and silently Jarts. Ethiopian proverb KEYS TO POWER What gets us into trouble in the realm of power is often our own overreac­tion to the moves of our enemies and rivals. That overreaction creates problems we would have avoided had we been more reasonable. It also has an endless rebound effect, for the enemy then overreacts as well, much as the Athenians did to the Melians. It is always our first instinct to react, to meet aggression with some other kind of aggression. But the next time someone pushes you and you find yourself starting to react, try this: Do not resist or fight back, but yield, turn the other cheek, bend. You will find that this often neutralizes their behavior-they expected, even wanted you to react with force and so they are caught off-guard and confounded by your lack of resistance. By yielding, you in fact control the situation, because your surrender is part of a larger plan to lull them into believing they have defeated you. This is the essence of the surrender tactic: Inwardly you stay firm, but outwardly you bend. Deprived of a reason to get angry, your opponents will often be bewildered instead. And they are unlikely to react with more violence, which would demand areaction from you. Instead you are al­lowed the time and space to plot the countermoves that will bring them down. In the battle of the intelligent against the brutal and the aggressive, the surrender tactic is the supreme weapon. It does require self-control: Those who genuinely surrender give up their freedom, and may be crushed by the humiliation of their defeat. You have to remember that you only appear to surrender, like the animal that plays dead to save its hide. We have seen that it can be better to surrender than to fight; faced with a more powerful opponent and a sure defeat, it is often also better to sur­render than to run away. Running away may save you for the time being, but the aggressor will eventually catch up with you. If you surrender in­stead, you have an opportunity to coil around your enemy and strike with your fangs from elose up. LAW 22 167"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"168 LAW 22 In 473 B.C., in ancient China, King Goujian ofYue suffered a horrible defeat from the mler of Wu in the battle of Fujiao. Goujian wanted to flee, but he had an adviser who told hirn to surrender and to place hirnself in the service of the mler of Wu, from which position he could study the man and plot his revenge. Deciding to follow this advice, Goujian gave the mler all of his riches, and went to work in his conqueror's stables as the lowest ser­vant. For three years he humbled himselfbefore the mler, who then, finally satisfied of his loyalty, allowed hirn to return horne. Inwardly, however, Goujian had spent those three years gathering information and plotting re­venge. When a terrible drought struck Wu, and the kingdom was weak­ened by inner turmoil, he raised an army, invaded, and won with ease. That is the power behind surrender: It gives you the time and the flexibility to plot a devastating counterblow. Had Goujian mn away, he would have lost this chance. When foreign trade began to threaten Japanese independence in the mid-nineteenth century, the Japanese debated how to defeat the foreign­ers. One minister, Hotta Masayoshi, wrote a memorandum in 1857 that in­fluencedJapanese policy for years to come: \"I am therefore convinced that our policy should be to condude friendly alliances, to send ships to foreign countries everywhere and conduct trade, to copy the foreigners where they are at their best and so repair our own shortcomings, to foster our national strength and complete our armaments, and so gradually subject the foreign­ers to our inf luence until in the end all the countries of the world know the blessings of perfect tranquillity and our hegemony is acknowledged throughout the globe.\" This is a brilliant application of the Law: Use sur­render to gain access to your enemy. Learn his ways, insinuate yourself with hirn slowly, outwardly conform to his customs, but inwardly maintain your own culture. Eventually you will emerge victorious, for while he con­siders you weak and inferior, and takes no precautions against you, you are using the time to catch up and surpass him. This soft, permeable form of in­vasion is often the best, for the enemy has nothing to react against, prepare for, or resist. And had Japan resisted Western influence by force, it might well have suffered a devastating invasion that would have permanently al­tered its culture. Surrender can also offer a way of mocking your enemies, of turning their power against them, as it did for Brecht. Milan Kundera's novel The Joke, based on the author's experiences in a penal camp in Czechoslovakia, tells the story of how the prison guards organized a relay race, guards against prisoners. For the guards this was a chance to show off their physi­cal superiority. The prisoners knew they were expected to lose, so they went out of their way to oblige-miming exaggerated exertion while barely moving, mnning a few yards and collapsing, limping, jogging ever so slowly while the guards raced ahead at full speed. Both by joining the race and by losing it, they had obliged the guards obediently; but their \"overobedience\" had mocked the event to the point of mining it. Overobe­dience-surrender-was here a way to demonstrate superiority in a re­verse manner. Resistance would have engaged the prisoners in the cyde of"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"violence, lowering them to the guards' level. Overobeying the guards, how­ever, made them ridiculous, yet they could not rightly punish the prison­ers, who had only done what they asked. Power is always in flux-since the game is by nature fluid, and an arena of constant struggle, those with power almost always find themselves even­tually on the downward swing. If you find yourself temporarily weakened, the surrender tactic is perfect for raising yourself up again-it disguises your ambition; it teaches you patience and self-control, key skills in the game; and it puts you in the best possible position for taking advantage ofyour op­pressor's sudden slide. If you run away or fight back, in the long run you cannot win. If you surrender, you will almost always emerge victorious. Image: An Oak Tree.

Furthermore, if you are willing to die, others may gain power and inspiration from your example. Yet martyrdom, surrender's reversal, is a messy, inexact tactic, and is as violent as the aggression it combats.

Wu was a growing power, but it lacked the great history and civilization of the Mid­dIe Kingdom, for centuries the center of Chinese culture. By defeating the Middle Kingdom, the king of Wu would instantly raise his status. The war began with great fanfare and several victories, but it soon bogged down. A victory on one front would leave the Wu armies vulnera­ble on another. The king's chief minister and adviser, Wu Tzu-hsiu, wamed hirn that the barbarous state of Yueh, to the south, was beginning to notice the kingdom of Wu's problems and had designs to invade. The king only laughed at such worries-one more big victory and the great Middle King­dom would be his. In the year 490, Wu Tzu-hsiu sent his son away to safety in the king­dom of Ch'i. In doing so he sent the king a signal that he disapptoved of the war, and that he believed the king's selfish ambition was leading Wu to ruin. The king, sensing betrayal, lashed out at his minister, accusing hirn of a lack of loyalty and, in a fit of anger, ordered hirn to kill hirnself. Wu Tzu­hsiu obeyed his king, but before he plunged the knife into his chest, he cried, \"Tear out my eyes, oh King, and fix them on the gate of Wu, so that I may see the triumphant entry ofYueh.\" As Wu Tzu-hsiu had predicted, within a few years a Yueh army passed beneath the gate of Wu. As the barbarians surrounded the palace, the king remembered his minister's last words-and feit the dead man's disembod­ied eyes watching his disgrace. Unable to bear his shame, the king killed hirnself, \"covering his face so that he would not have to meet the reproach­ful gaze ofhis minister in the next world.\" Interpretation The story of Wu is a paradigm of all the empires that have come to ruin by overreaching. Drunk with success and siek with ambition, such empires ex­pand to grotesque proportions and meet a ruin that is total. This is what happened to ancient Athens, which lusted for the faraway island of Sicily and ended up losing its empire. The Romans stretched the boundaries of their empire to encompass vast territories; in doing so they increased their vulnerability, and the chances of invasion from yet another barbarian tribe. Their useless expansion led their empire into oblivion. For the Chinese, the fate of the kingdom of Wu serves as an elemental lesson on what happens when you dissipate your forces on several fronts, losing sight of distant dangers for the sake of present gain. \"If you are not in danger,\" says Sun-tzu, \"do not fight.\" It is almost a physicallaw: What is bloated beyond its proportions inevitably collapses. The mind must not wander from goal to goal, or be distracted by success from its sense of pur­pose and proportion. What is concentrated, coherent, and connected to its past has power. What is dissipated, divided, and distended rots and falls to the ground.

The city's harsh laws made it impossible for Jews to mingle outside the ghetto, but the Jews had turned this into a virtue-it made them self-reliant, and zealous to preserve their culture at all costs. Mayer Amschel, the first of the Rothschilds to accumulate wealth by lending money, in the late eighteenth century, weIl understood the power that comes from this kind of concentration and cohesion. First, Mayer Amschel allied hirnself with one family, the powernd princes of Thurn und Taxis. Instead of spreading his services out, he made himself these princes' primary banker. Second, he entrusted none of his business to outsiders, using only his children and close relatives. The more unified and tight-knit the family, the more powerful it would become. Soon Mayer Amschel's five sons were running the business. And when Mayer Amschellay dying, in 1812, he refused to name a principal heir, instead set­ting up all of his sons to continue·the family tradition, so that they would stay united and would resist the dangers of diffusion and of infiltration by outsiders. Once Mayer Amschel's sons controlled the family business, they de­cided that the key to wealth on a larger scale was to secure a foothold in the finances of Europe as a whole, rather than being tied to any one country or prinee. Of the five brothers, Nathan had already opened up shop in Lon­don. In 1813 James moved to Paris. Amschel remained in Frankfurt, Salomon established hirnself in Vienna, and Karl, the youngest son, went to Naples. With each sphere of influence covered, they could tighten their hold on Europe's financial markets. This widespread network, of course, opened the Rothschilds to the very danger of which their father had warned them: diffusion, division, dis­sension. They avoided this danger, and established themselves as the most powerful force in European finance and politics, by once again resorting to the strategy of the ghetto--excluding outsiders, concentrating their forces. The Rothschilds established the fastest courier system in Europe, allowing them to get news of events before all their competitors. They held a virtual monopoly on information. And their internal communications and corre­spondence were written in Frankfurt Yiddish, and in a code that only the brothers could decipher. There was no point in stealing this information­no one could understand it. \"Even the shewdest bankers cannot find their way through the Rothschild maze,\" admitted a financier who had tried to infiltrate the clan. In 1824 James Rothschild decided it was time to get married. This pre­sented a problem for the Rothschilds, since it meant incorporating an out­sider into the Rothschild clan, an outsider who could betray its secrets. James therefore decided to marry within the family, and chose the daugh­ter of his brother Salomon. The brothers were ecstatic-this was the per­feet solution to their marriage problems. James's choice now became the family policy: Two years later, Nathan married off his daughter to hissing at everyone who passes by, you bring upon yourself the derision of all behold· ers. I confess that I am only fo rmed to move upon the ground; but how graceful is my makel How weil turned my limbs! How highly finished my whole body! How great my strength! How aston­ishing my speed!

While other rich and powerful families suffered irrecoverable downturns during the tumultous first half of the nineteenth century, the tight-knit Rothschilds managed not only to pre­serve but to expand their unprecedented wealth. Interpretation The Rothschilds were born in strange times. They came from a place that had not changed in centuries, but lived in an age that gave birth to the In­dustrial Revolution, the French Revolution, and an endless series of up­heavals.

French styles and fashions changed at a relentless pace dur­ing all trus turmoil. Without appearing to be a relic of the past, J ames steered his family as if the ghetto lived on within them. He kept alive his clan's inner cohesion and strength. Only through such an anchoring in the past was the family able to thrive amidst such chaos. Concentration was the foundation of the Rothschilds' power, wealth, and stability. The best strategy is always to be very strong; first in general, then at the decisive point ....

On War, Carl von Clausewitz, 1780-1831 KEYS TO POWER The world is plagued by greater and greater division-within countries, political groups, families, even individuals. We are all in astate of total dis­traction and diffusion, hardly able to keep our minds in one direction be­fore we are pulled in a thousand others. The modem world's level of conflict is higher than ever, and we have internalized it in our own lives. The solution is a form of retreat inside ourselves, to the past, to more concentrated forms of thought and action. As Schopenhauer wrote, \"Intel­lect is a magnitude of intensity, not a magnitude of extensity.\" Napoleon knew the value of concentrating your forces at the enemy's weakest spot-"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"it was the secret of his success on the battlefield. But his willpower and his mind were equally modeled on this notion. Single-mindedness of purpose, total concentration on the goal, and the use of these qualities against peo­pIe less focused, people in a state of distraction-such an arrow will find its mark every time and overwhelm the enemy. Casanova attributed his success in life to his ability to concentrate on a single goal and push at it until it yielded. It was his ability to give hirnself over completely to the women he desired that made hirn so intensely se­ductive. For the weeks or months that one of these women lived in his orbit, he thought of no one else. When he was imprisoned in the treacher­ous \"leads\" of the doge's palace in Ve nice, a prison from which no one had ever escaped, he concentrated his mind on the single goal of escape, day after day. A change of cells, which meant that months of digging had all been for naught, did not discourage hirn; he persisted and eventually es­caped. \"I have always believed,\" he later wrote, \"that when a man gets it into his head to do something, and when he exclusively occupies hirnself in that design, he must succeed, whatever the difficulties. That man will be­come Grand Vizier or Pope.\" Concentrate (,la single goal, a single task, and beat it into submission. In the world of power you will constantIy need help from other people, usually those more powerful than you. The fool flits from one person to an­other, believing that he will survive by spreading hirnself out. It is a corol­lary of the law of concentration, however, that much energy is saved, and more power is attained, by affixing yourself to a single, appropriate source of power. The scientist Nikola Tesla ruined hirnself by believing that he somehow maintained his independence by not having to serve a single master. He even turned down J. P. Morgan, who offered hirn a rich con­tract. In the end, Tesla's \"independence\" meant that he could depend on no single patron, but was always having to toady up to a dozen of them. Later in his life he realized his mistake. All the great Renaissance painters and writers wrestIed with this prob­lem, none more so than the sixteenth-century writer Pietro Aretino. Throughout his life Aretino suffered the indignities of having to pIe ase this prince and that. At last, he had had enough, and decided to woo Charles V, promising the emperor the services of his powerful pen. He finally dis­covered the freedom that came from attachment to a single source of power. Michelangelo found this freedom with Pope Julius H, Galileo with the Medicis. In the end, the single patron appreciates your loyalty and be­comes dependent on your services; in the long run the master serves the slave. Finally, power itself always exists in concentrated forms. In any orga­nization it is inevitable for a small group to hold the strings. And often it is not those with the titIes. In the game of power, only the fool flails about without fixing his target. You must find out who controls the operations, who is the real director behind the scenes.

Image: The Arrow. You cannot hit two targets with one arrow. If your thoughts stray, you miss the enemy's heart. Mind and arrow must become one. Only with such concentration of mental and physical power can your arrow hit the target and pierce the heart. Authority: Prize intensity more than extensity. Perfection re­sides in quality, not quantity. Extent alone never rises above mediocrity, and it is the misfortune of men with wide general interests that while they would like to have their finger in every pie, they have one in none. Intensity gives eminen ce, and rises to the heroic in matters sublime. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) REVERSAL There are dangers in concentration, and moments when dispersion is the proper tactical move. Fighting the Nationalists for control of China, Mao Tse-tung and the Communists fought a protracted war on several fronts, using sabotage and ambush as their main weapons. Dispersal is often suit­able for the weaker side; it is, in fact, a crucial principle of guerrilla warfare. When fighting a stronger army, concentrating YOUf forces only makes you an easier target-better to dissolve into the scenery and frustrate your enemy with the elusiveness of YOUf presence. Tying YOUfself to a single SOUfce of power has one preeminent danger: If that person dies, leaves, or falls from grace, you suff er. This is what hap­pened to Cesare Borgia, who derived his power from his father, Pope Alexander VI. It was the pope who gave Cesare armies to fight with and wars to wage in his name. When he suddenly died (perhaps from poison),"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Cesare was as good as dead. He had made far too many enemies over the years, and was now without his father's protection. In cases when you may need protection, then, it is often wise to entwine YOUfseif around several sources of power. Such a move would be especially prudent in periods of great tumult and violent change, or when YOUf enemies are numerous. The more patrons and masters you serve the less risk you run if one of them falls from power. Such dispersion will even allow you to play one off against the other. Even if you concentrate on the single SOUfce of power, you still must practice caution, and I cepare for the day when YOUf master or patron is no longer there to help you. Finally, being too single-minded in purpose can make you an intolera­ble bore, especially in the arts. The Renaissance painter Paolo Uccello was so obsessed with perspective that his paintings look lifeless and contrived. Whereas Leonardo da Vinci interested himself in everything-architec­ture, painting, warfare, sculpture, mechanics. Diffusion was the source of his power. But such genius is rare, and the rest of us are better off erring on the side of intensity.

In the past;' llie court gathered around the roler, and had many functions: Besides keeping the roler amused, it was a way to solidify the hierarchy of royalty, nobility, and the upper classes, and to keep the nobility both sub ordinate and elose to the ruler, so that he could keep an eye on them. The court serves power in many ways, but most of all it glori­fies the roler, providing him with a microcosmic world that must struggle to pIe ase him. To be a courtier was a dangerous game. A nineteenth-century Arab traveler to the court of Darfur, in what is now Sudan, reported that courtiers there had to do whatever the sultan did: If he were injured, they had to suffer the same injury; if he fell off his horse during a hunt, they fell, to o. Mimicry like this appeared in courts all over the world. More trouble­same was the danger of displeasing the roler-one wrong move spelled death or exile. The successful courtier had to walk a tightrope, pleasing but not pleasing too much, obeying but somehow distinguishing himself from the other courtiers, while also never distinguishing himself so far as to make the roler insecure. Great courtiers throughout history have mastered the science of ma­nipulating people. They make the king fe el more kingly; they make every­one else fe ar their power. They are magicians of appearance, knowing that most things at court are judged by how they seem. Great courtiers are gra­cious and polite; their aggression is veiled and indirect. Masters of the word, they never say more than necessary, getting the most out of a com­pliment or hidden insult. They are magnets of pleasure-people want to be around them because they know how to please, yet they neither fawn nor humiliate themselves. Great courtiers become the king's favorites, enjoying the benefits of that position. They often end up more powernd than the ruler, for they are wizards in the accumulation of influence. Many today dismiss court life as a relic of the past, a historical curios­ity. They reason, according to Machiavelli, \"as though heaven, the sun, the elements, and men had changed the order of their motions and power, and were different from what they were in ancient times.\" There may be no more Sun Kings but there are still plenty of people who believe the sun re­volves around them. The royal court may have more or less disappeared, or at least lost its power, but courts and courtiers still exist because power still exists. A courtier is rarely asked to fall off a horse anymore, but the laws that govem court politics are as timeless as the laws of power.

You also stir up enough envy among your peers to induce treachery and backstabbing. Be careful, ever so careful, in trumpeting your own achievements, and always talk less ab out yourself than about other people. Modesty is generally preferable. Practice Nonchalance. Never seem to be working too hard. Your talent must appear to flow naturally, with an ease that makes people take you for a genius rather than a workaholic. Even when something demands a lot of sweat, make it look effortless-people prefer to not see your blood and toil, which is another form of ostentation. It is better for them to marvel at how gracefully you have achieved your accomplishment than to wonder why it took so much work. Be Frugal with Flattery. It may seem that your superiors cannot get enough flattery, but too much of even a good thing loses its value. It also stirs up suspicion among your peers. Leam to flatter indirectly-by down­playing your own contribution, for example, to make your master look bet­ter. Arrange to Be Noticed. There is a paradox: You cannot display yourself too brazenly, yet you must also get yourself noticed. In the court of Louis XIV, whoever the king decided to look at rose instantly in the court hierar­chy. You stand no chance of rising if the ruler does not notice you in the swamp of courtiers. This task requires much art. It is often initially a matter of being seen, in the literal sense. Pay attention to your physical appear­ance, then, and find a way to create a distinctive-a subtly distinctive-style andimage. Alter Your Style and Language According to the Person You Are Dealing With. The pseudo-belief in equality-the idea that talking and acting the same way with everyone, no matter what their rank, makes you somehow a paragon of civilization-is a terrible mistake. Those below you will take it as a form of condescension, which it is, and those above you will be offended, although they may not admit it. You must change your style and your way of speaking to suit each person. This is not lying, it is acting; and acting is an art, not a gift from God. Leam the art. This is also true for the great variety of cultures found in the modem court: Ne ver assume that your criteria of behavior and judgment are universal. Not only is an inabil­ity to adapt to anoth er culture the height of barbarism, it puts you at a dis­advantage. Never Be the Bearer of Bad News. The king kills the messenger who brings bad news: This is a diche but there is truth to it. You must struggle and if necessary lie and cheat to be sure that the lot of the bearer of bad news falls on a colleague, never on you. Bring only good news and your approach will gladden your master."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Never Affect Friendliness and Intirnacy with Your Master. He does not want a friend for a subordinate, he wants a sub ordinate. Never ap­proach hirn in an easy, friendly way, or act as if you are on the best of terrns-that is his prerogative. If he chooses to deal with you on this level, assume a wary chumminess. Otherwise err in the opposite direction, and make the distance between you clear. Never Criticize Those Above You Directly. This may seem obvious, but there are often times when some sort of criticism is necessary-to say nothing, or to give no advice, would open you to risks of another sort. You must leam, however, to couch YOUf advice and criticism as indirectly and as politely as possible. Think twice, or three times, before deciding you have made them sufficiently circuitous. Err on the side of subtlety and gentleness. Be Frugal in Asking Those Above You for Favors. Nothing irritates a master more than having to reject someone's request. It stirs up guilt and resentment. Ask for favors as rarely as possible, and know when to stop. Rather than making YOUfself the supplicant, it is always better to eam YOUf favors, so that the ruler bestows them willingly. Most important: Do not ask for favors on another person's behalf, least of all a friend's. Never Joke About Appearances or Taste. A lively wit and a humorous disposition are essential qualities for a good courtier, and there are times when vulgarity is appropriate and engaging. But avoid any kind of joke about appearance or taste, two highly sensitive areas, especially with those above you. Do not even try it when you are away from them. You will dig YOUf OWD grave. Do Not Be the Court Cynic. Express admiration for the good work of others. If you constantly criticize YOUf equals or subordinates some of that criticism will rub off on you, hovering over you like a gray cloud wherever you go. People will groan at each new cynical comment, and you will irri­tate them. By expressing modest admiration for other people's achieve­ments, you paradoxically call attention to your OWD. The ability to express wonder and amazement, and seem like you mean it, is a rare and dying tal­ent, but one still greatly valued. Be Self-observant. The mirror is a miraculous invention; without it you would commit great sins against beauty and decorum. You also need a mir­ror for your actions. This can sometimes come from other people telling you what they see in you, but that is not the most trustworthy method: You must be the mirror, training your mind to try to see YOUfself as others see you. Are you acting too obsequious? Are you trying too hard to please? Do you seem desperate for attention, giving the impression that you are on the decline?

Call it lying if you like; but if you prefer to not play the game and to always be honest and up­front, do not complain when others call you obnoxious and arrogant. Fit the Spirit of the Times. A slight affeetation of a past era can be charming, as long as you choose aperiod at least twenty years back; wear­ing the fashions of ten years ago is ludicrous, unless you enjoy the role of court jester. Your spirit and way of thinking must keep up with the times, even if the times offend your sensibilities. Be too forward-thinking, how­ever, and no one will understand you. It is never a good idea to stand out too much in this area; you are best off at least being able to mimic the spirit of the times. Be a Source of Pleasure. This is critical. It is an obvious law of human nature that we will flee what is unpleasant and distasteful, while charm and the promise of delight will draw us like moths to a flame. Make yourself the flame and you will rise to the top. Since life is otherwise so full of unpleas­antness and pleasure so scarce, you will be as indispensable as food and drink. This may seem obvious, but what is obvious is often ignored or un­appreciated. There are degrees to this: Not everyone can play the role of favorite, for not everyone is blessed with charm and wit. But we can all control our unpleasant qualities and obscure them when necessary. A man who knows the court is master of his gestures, of his eyes and of his face; he is profound, impenetrable; he dissimulates bad offices, smiles at his enemies, controls his irritation, disguises his passions, belies his heart, speaks and acts against his feelings. Jean de La Bruyere, 1645-1696 SCENES OF COURT LIFE: Exemplary Deeds and Fatal Mistakes Scene I Alexander the Great, conqueror of the Mediterranean basin and the Mid­dIe East through to India, had had the great Aristotle as his tutor and men­tor, and throughout his short life he remained devoted to philosophy and his master's teachings. He once complained to Aristotle that during his long campaigns he had no one with whom he could discuss philosophical matters. Aristotle responded by suggesting that he take Callisthenes, a for­mer pupil of Aristotle's and a promising philosopher in his own right, along on the next campaign. Aristotle had schooled Callisthenes in the skills ofbeing a courtier, but"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"the young man secretly scoffed at them. He believed in pure philosophy, in unadorned words, in speaking the naked truth. If Alexander loved learning so much, Callisthenes thought, he could not object to one who spoke his mind. During one of Alexander's major campaigns, Callisthenes spoke his mind one too many times and Alexander had him put to death. Interpretation In court, honesty is a fool's game. Never be so self-absorbed as to believe that the master is interested in your criticisms of hirn, no matter how accu­rate they are. Scene II Beginning in the Han Dynasty two thousand years ago, Chinese scholars compiled a series ofwritings called the 27 Histories, an official biography of each dynasty, including stories, statistics, census figures, and war chroni­des. Each history also contained a chapter called \"Unusual Events,\" and here, among the listings of earthquakes and floods, there would sometimes suddenly appear descriptions of such bizarre manifestations as two-headed sheep, geese flying backward, stars suddenly appearing in different parts of the sky, and so on. The earthquakes could be historically verified, but the monsters and weird natural phenomena were clearly inserted on purpose, and invariably occurred in clusters. What could this mean? The Chinese emperor was considered more than a man-he was a fo rce of nature. His kingdom was the center of the universe, and every­thing revolved around hirn. He embodied the world's perfection. To criti­cize hirn or any of his actions would have been to criticize the divine order. No minister or courtier dared approach the emperor with even the slightest cautionary word. But emperors were fallible and the kingdom suffered greatly by their mistakes. Inserting sightings of strange phenomena into the court chronicles was the only way to warn them. The emperor would read of geese flying backward and moons out of orbit, and realize that he was being cautioned. His actions were unbalancing the universe and needed to change. Interpretation For Chinese courtiers, the problem of how to give the emperor advice was an important issue. Over the years, thousands of them had died trying to warn or counsel their master. To be made safely, their criticisms had to be indirect-yet if they were too indirect they would not be heeded. The chronicles were their solution: Identify no one person as the source of criti­cism, make the advice as impersonal as possible, but let the emperor know the gravity of the situation. Your master is no longer the center of the universe, but he still imag­ines that everything revolves around hirn. When you criticize hirn he sees the person criticizing, not the criticism itself. Like the Chinese courtiers, you must find a way to disappear behind the warning. Use symbols and other indirect methods to paint a picture of the problems to come, without putting your neck on the line. LAW 24 183"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"184 LAW 24 Scene III Early in his career, the French architect Jules Mansart received commis­sions to design minor additions to Ve rsailles for King Louis XIV. For each design he would draw up his plans, making sure they followed Louis's in­structions closely. He would then present them to His Majesty. The courtier Saint-Simon described Mansart's technique in dealing with the king: \"His particular skill was to show the king plans that pur­posely included something imperfect about them, often dealing with the gardens, which were not Mansart's specialty. The king, as Mansart ex­pected, would put his finger exactly on the problem and propose how to solve it, at which point Mansart would exclaim for all to hear that he would never have seen the problem that the king had so masterfully found and solved; he would burst with admiration, confessing that next to the king he was but a lowly pupil.\" At the age of thirty, having used these methods time and time again, Mansart received a prestigious royal commission: Al­though he was less talented and experienced than a number of other French designers, he was to take charge of the enlargement of Ve rsailles. He was the king's architect from then on. Interpretation As a young man, Mansart had seen how many royal craftsmen in the ser­vice of Louis XIV had lost their positions not through a lack of talent but through a costly social blunder. He would not make that mistake. Mansart always strove to make Louis feel better about hirnself, to feed the king's vanity as publicly as possible. Never imagine that skill and talent are all that matter. In court the courtier's art is more important than his talent; never spend so much time on your studies that you neglect your social skills. And the greatest skill of all is the ability to make the master look more talented than those around hirn. Scene IV Jean-Baptiste Isabey had become the unofficial painter of the Napoleonic court. During the Congress of Vienna in 1814, after Napoleon, defeated, had been imprisoned on the island of Elba, the participants in these meet­ings, which were to decide the fate of Europe, invited Isabey to immortal­ize the historie events in an epic painting. When Isabey arrived in Vienna, Talleyrand, the main negotiator for the French, paid the artist a visit. Considering his role in the proceedings, the statesman explained, he expected to occupy center stage in the paint­ing. Isabey cordially agreed. A few days later the Duke of Wellington, the main negotiator for the English, also approached Isabey, and said much the same thing that Talleyrand had. The ever polite Isabey agreed that the great duke should indeed be the center of attention. Back in his studio, Isabey pondered the dilemma. If he gave the spot­light to either of the two men, he could create a diplomatie rift, stirring up all sorts of resentrnent at a time when peace and concord were critical."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"When the painting was finally unveiled, however, both Talleyrand and Wellington feIt honored and satisfied. The work depicts a large hall filled with diplomats and politicians from all over Europe. On one side the Duke of Wellington enters the room, and all eyes are turned toward him; he is the \"center\" of attention. In the very center of the painting, meanwhile, sits Talleyrand. Interpretation It is often very difficult to satisfy the master, but to satisfy two masters in one stroke takes the genius of a great courtier. Such predicaments are com­mon in the life of a courtier: By giving attention to one master, he dis­pleases another. You must find a way to navigate this Scylla and Charybdis safely. Masters must receive their due; never inadvertently stir up the re­sentment of one in pleasing another. Scene V George Brummell, also known as Beau Brummell, made his mark in the late 1700s by the supreme elegance of his appearance, his popularization of shoe buckles (soon imitated by all the dandies), and his clever way with words. His London house was the fashionable spot in town, and Brummell was the authority on all matters of fashion. If he disliked your footwear, you immediately got rid of it and bought whatever he was wearing. He per­feeted the art of tying a cravat; Lord Byron was said to spend many a night in front of the mirror trying to figure out the secret behind Brummell's per­feet knots. One of Brummell's greatest admirers was the Prince of Wales, who fancied himself a fashionable young man. Becoming attached to the prince's court (and provided with a royal pension), Brummell was soon so sure of his own authority there that he took to joking about the prince's weight, referring to his host as Big Ben. Since trimness of figure was an im­portant quality for a dandy, this was a withering criticism. At dinner once, when the service was slow, Brummell said to the prince, \"Do ring, Big Ben.\" The prince rang, but when the valet arrived he ordered the man to show Brummell the door and never admit him again. Despite falling into the prince's disfavor, Brummell continued to treat everyone around him with the same arrogance. Without the Prince of Wales' patronage to support him, he sank into horrible debt, but he main­tained his insolent manners, and everyone so on abandoned him. He died in the most pitiable poverty, alone and deranged. Interpretation Beau Brummell's devastating wit was one of the qualities that endeared him to the Prince ofWales. But not even he, the arbiter oftaste and fashion, could get away with a joke about the prince's appearance, least of all to his face. Never joke about a person's plumpness, even indirectly-and particu­lady when he is your master. The poorhouses of history are filled with peo­pIe who have made such jokes at their master's expense.

One of Testi's letters to the duke reveals why he was chosen: \"Once our discussion was over, I kneeled to depart, but His Holiness made a signal and walked to another room where he sleeps, and after reaching a small table, he grabbed a bundle of papers and thus, tuming to me with a smiling face, he said: 'We want Your Lordship to listen to some of our compositions.' And, in fact, he read me two very long Pindaric poems, one in praise of the most holy Virgin, and the other one ab out Countess Matilde.\" We do not know exactly what Te sti thought of these very long poems, since it would have been dangerous for hirn to state his opinion freely, even in a letter. But he went on to write, \"I, following the mood, com­mented on each line with the needed praise, and, after having kissed His Holiness's foot for such an unusual sign of benevolence [the reading of the poetry], I left.\" Weeks later, when the duke hirnself visited the pope, he managed to recite entire verses of the pope's poetry and praised it enough to make the pope \"so jubilant he seemed to lose his mind.\" Interpretation In matters of taste you can never be too obsequious with your master. Taste is one of the ego's prickliest parts; never impugn or question the master's taste-his poetry is sublime, his dress impeccable, and his manner the model for all. Scene VII One aftemoon in ancient China, Chao, ruler of Han from 358 to 333 B.C., got drunk and fell asleep in the palace gardens. The court crown-keeper, whose sole task was to look after the ruler's head apparel, passed through the gardens and saw his master sleeping without a coat. Since it was getting cold, the crown-keeper placed his own coat over the ruler, and left. When Chao awoke and saw the coat upon hirn, he asked his atten­dants, \"Who put more clothes on my body?\" \"The crown-keeper,\" they replied. The ruler immediately called for his official coat-keeper and had hirn punished for neglecting his duties. He also called for the crown­keeper, whom he had beheaded. Interpretation Do not overstep your bounds. Do what you are assigned to do, to the best of your abilities, and never do more. To think that by doing more you are doing better is a common blunder. It is never good to seem to be trying too hard-it is as if you were covering up some deficiency. Fulfilling a task that has not been asked of you just makes people suspicious.

There they were captured by two Moorish galleys, which hauled them off in chains to Barbary, where they were sold as slaves. For eighteen long months Filippo toiled with no hope of returning to ltaly. On several occasions Filippo saw the man who had bought hirn pass by, and one day he decided to sketch this man's portrait, using burnt coal-charcoal-from the fire. Still in his chains, he found a white wall, where he drew a full-Iength likeness of his owner in Moorish clothing. The owner so on heard about this, for no one had seen such skill in drawing be­fore in these parts; it seemed like a miracle, a gift from God. The drawing so pleased the owner that he instantly gave Filippo his freedom and em­ployed hirn in his court. All the big men on the Barbary coast came to see the magnificent color portraits that Fra Filippo then proceeded to do, and finally, in gratitude for the honor in this way brought upon hirn, Filippo's owner returned the artist safely to ltaly. Interpretation We who toil for other people have all in some way been captured by pi­rates and sold into slavery. But like Fra Filippo (if to a lesser degree), most of us possess some gift, same talent, an ability to do something better than other people. Make your master a gift of YOUf talents and you will rise above other courtiers. Let hirn take the credit if necessary, it will only be temporary: Use hirn as a stepping stone, a way of displaying your talent and eventually buying your freedom fr om enslavement. Scene IX Alfonso 1 of Aragon once had a servant who told the king that the night before he had had a dream: Alfonso had given hirn a gift of weapons, horses, and clothes. Alfonso, a generous, lordly man, decided it would be amusing to make this dream come true, and promptly gave the servant exaetly these gifts. A little while later, the same servant announced to Alfonso that he had had yet another dream, and in this one Alfonso had given hirn a consider­able pile of gold florins. The king smiled and said, \"Don't believe in dreams from now on; they He.\" Interpretation In his treatment of the servant's first dream, Alfonso remained in control. By making a dream come true, he claimed a godlike power for hirnself, if in a mild and humorous way. In the second dream, however, all appear­anee of magic was gone; this was no thing but an ugly con game on the ser­vant's part. Never ask for too much, then, and know when to stop. It is the master's prerogative to give-to give when he wants and what he wants, and to do so without prompting. Do not give hirn the chance to reject your requests.

The painter Sir Thomas Lawrence once had the misfortune of seeing Turner's masterpiece Cologne hanging in an exhibition between two works of his own. Lawrence complained bitterly to the gallery owner, who gave hirn no satisfaction: After all, someone's paintings had to hang next to Turner's. But Turner heard of Lawrence's complaint, and before the exhibi­tion opened, he toned down the brilliant golden sky in Cologne, making it as dull as the colors in Lawrence's works. A friend of Turner's who saw the painting approached the artist with a horrified look: \"What have you done to your picture!\" he said. \"Well, poor Lawrence was so unhappy,\" Turner replied, \"and it's only larnpblack. It'll wash off after the exhibition.\" Interpretation Many of a courtier's anxieties have to do with the master, with whom most dangers lie. Yet it is amistake to imagine that the master is the only one to detennine your fate. Your equals and subordinates play integral parts also. A court is a vast stew of resentments, fears, and powernd envy. You have to placate everyone who might someday hann you, deflecting their resent­ment and envy and diverting their hostility onto other people. Turner, eminent courtier, knew that his good fortune and farne de­pended on his fellow painters as well as on his dealers and patrons. How many of the great have been felled by envious colleagues! Better temporar­ily to dull your brilliance than to suffer the slings and arrows of envy. Scene XI Winston Churchill was an amateur artist, and after World War 11 his paint­ings became collector's items. The American publisher Henry Luce, in fact, creator of Time and Lift magazines, kept one of Churchill's landscapes hanging in his private office in New York. On a tour through the United States once, Churchill visited Luce in his office, and the two men looked at the painting together. The publisher re­marked, \"It's a good picture, but I think it needs something in the fore­ground-a sheep, perhaps.\" Much to Luce's horror, Churchill's secretary called the publisher the next day and asked hirn to have the painting sent to England. Luce did so, mortified that he had perhaps offended the former prime minister. A few days later, however, the painting was shipped back, but slightly altered: a single sheep now grazed peacefully in the fore­ground. Interpretation In stature and farne, Churchill stood head and shoulders above Luce, but Luce was certainly a man of power, so let us imagine a slight equality be­tween them. Still, what did Churchill have to fear from an American pub­lisher? Why bow to the criticism of a dilettante ?"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"A court-in this case the entire world of diplomats and intemational statesmen, and also of the joumalists who court them-is a place of mutual dependence.

It is always beneficial to play the obliging courtier, even when you are not serving a master. TRE DELICATE GAME OF COURTIERSHIP: A Waming Talleyrand was the consummate courtier, especially in serving his master Napoleon. When the two men were first getting to know each other, Napoleon once said in passing, \"I shall come to lunch at your house one of these days.\" Talleyrand had a house at Auteuil, in the suburbs of Paris. \"I should be delighted, mon general, \" the minister replied, \"and since my house is elose to the Bois de Boulogne, you will be able to amuse yourself with a bit of shooting in the aftemoon.\" \"I do not like shooting,\" said Napoleon, \"But I love hunting. Are there any boars in the Bois de Boulogne?\" Napoleon came from Corsica, where boar hunting was a great sport. By asking if there were boars in a Paris park, he showed hirnself still a provincial, almost a rube. Talleyrand did not laugh, however, but he could not resist a practical joke on the man who was now his master in politics, although not in blood and nobility, since Talleyrand came from an old aristocratic family. To Napoleon's question, then, he simply replied, \"Very few, mon general, but I dare say you will man­age to find one.\" It was arranged that Napoleon would arrive at Talleyrand's house the fo llowing day at seven A.M. and would spend the moming there. The \"boar hunt\" would take place in the aftemoon. Throughout the moming the ex­cited general talked nothing but boar hunting. Meanwhile, Talleyrand se­cretly had his servants go to the market, buy two enormous black pigs, and take them to the great park. After lunch, the hunters and their hounds set off for the Bois de Boulogne. At a secret signal from Talleyrand, the servants loosed one of the pigs. \"I see aboar,\" Napoleon cried joyfully, jumping onto his horse to give chase. Talleyrand stayed behind. It took half an hour of galloping through the park before the \"boar\" was finally captured. At the moment of triumph, however, Napoleon was approached by one of his aides, who knew the creature could not possibly be aboar, and feared the general would be ridiculed once the story got out: \"Sir,\" he told Napoleon, \"you realize of course that this is not a boar but a pig.\" Flying into a rage, Napoleon immediately set off at a gallop for Tal­leyrand's house. He realized along the way that he would now be the butt of many a joke, and that exploding at Talleyrand would only make hirn LAW 24 189"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"190 LAW 24 more ridiculous; it would be better to make a show of good humor. Still, he did not hide his displeasure weIl. Talleyrand decided to try to soothe the general's bruised ego. He told Napoleon not to go back to Paris yet-he should again go hunting in the park. There were many rabbits there, and hunting them had been a fa­vorite pastime of Louis XVI. Talleyrand even offered to let Napoleon use a set of guns that had once belonged to Louis. With much flattery and cajol­ery, he once again got Napoleon to agree to a hunt. The party left for the park in the late aftemoon. Along the way, Napoleon told Talleyrand, \"I'm not Louis XVI, I surely won't kill even one rabbit.\" Yet that aftemoon, strangely enough, the park was teeming with rabbits. Napoleon killed at least fifty of them, and his mood changed from anger to satisfaction. At the end of his wild shooting spree, however, the same aide approached hirn and whispered in his ear, \"To tell the truth, sir, I am beginning to believe these are not wild rabbits. I suspect that rascal Tal­leyrand has played another joke on us.\" (The aide was right: Talleyrand had in fact sent his servants back to the market, where they had purchased dozens of rabbits and then had released them in the Bois de Boulogne.) Napoleon immediately mounted his horse and galloped away, this time retuming straight to Paris. He later threatened Talleyrand, wamed hirn not to tell a soul what had happened; if he became the laughingstock of Paris, there would be hell to pay. It took months for Napoleon to be able to trust Talleyrand again, and he never totally forgave hirn his humiliati on. Interpretation Courtiers are like magicians: They deceptively play with appearances, only letting those around them see what they want them to see. With so much deception and manipulation afoot, it is essential to keep people fr om seeing your tricks and glimpsing your sleight of hand. Talleyrand was normally the Grand Wizard of Courtiership, and but for Napoleon's aide, he probably would have gotten away completely with both pleasing his master and having a joke at the general's expense. But courtiership is a subtle art, and overlooked traps and inadvertent mistakes can ruin your best tricks. Never risk being caught in your maneuvers; never let people see your devices. If that happens you instantly pass in peo­ple's perceptions from a courtier of great manners to a loathsome rogue.

MEMOIRS, GIOVANNI CASANOVA, 1725-1798 192 LAW 25 OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I Julius Caesar made his first significant mark on Roman society in 65 B.C., when he assumed the post of aedile, the official in charge of grain distribu­tion and public games. He began his entrance into the public eye by orga­nizing a series of carefully crafted and well-timed spectacles-wild-beast hunts, extravagant gladiator shows, theatrical contests. On several occa­sions, he paid for these spectacles out of his own pocket. To the common man, Julius Caesar became indelibly associated with these much-Ioved events. As he slowly rose to attain the position of consul, his popularity among the masses served as the fo undation of his power. He had created an image of hirnself as a great public showman. In 49 B.C., Rome was on the brink of a civil war between rivalleaders, Caesar and Pompey. At the height of the tension, Caesar, an addict of the stage, attended a theatrical performance, and afterward, lost in thought, he wandered in the darkness back to his camp at the Rubicon, the river that divides ltaly from Gaul, where he had been campaigning. To march his army back into Italy across the Rubicon would mean the beginning of a war with Pompey. Before his staff Caesar argued both sides, forming the options like an actor on stage, aprecursor of Hamlet. Finally, to put his soliloquy to an end, he pointed to a seemingly innocent apparition at the edge of the river-a very tall soldier blasting a call on a trumpet, then going across a bridge over the Rubicon-and pronounced, \"Let us accept this as a sign from the Gods and follow where they beckon, in vengeance on our double­dealing enemies. The die is cast.\" All of this he spoke portentously and dra­matically, gesturing toward the river and looking his generals in the eye. He knew that these generals were uncertain in their support, but his ora­tory overwhelmed them with a sense of the drama of the moment, and of the need to seize the time. A more prosaic speech would never have had the same effect. The generals rallied to his cause; Caesar and his army crossed the Rubicon and by the following year had vanquished Pompey, making Caesar dictator of Rome. In warfare, Caesar always played the leading man with gusto. He was as skilIed a horseman as any of his soldiers, and took pride in outdoing them in fe ats of bravery and endurance. He entered battle astride the strongest mount, so that his soldiers would see hirn in the thick of battle, urging them on, always positioning hirnself in the center, a godlike symbol of power and a model for them to follow. Of all the armies in Rome, Cae­sar's was the most devoted and loyal. His soldiers, like the common people who had attended his entertainments, had come to identify with hirn and with his cause. After the defeat of Pompey, the entertainments grew in scale. Nothing like them had ever been seen in Rome. The chariot races became more spectacular, the gladiator fights more dramatic, as Caesar staged fights to the death among the Roman nobility. He organized enormous mock naval battles on an artificiallake. Plays were performed in every Roman ward. A"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"giant new theater was built that sloped dramatically down the Tarpeian Rock. Crowds from all over the empire flocked to these events, the roads to Rome lined with visitors' tents. And in 45 B.C., timing his entry into the city for maximum effect and surprise, Caesar brought Cleopatra back to Rome after his Egyptian campaign, and staged even more extravagant public spectacles. These events were more than devices to divert the masses; they dra­matically enhanced the public's sense of Caesar's character, and made hirn seem larger than life. Caesar was the master of his public image, of which he was forever aware. When he appeared before crowds he wore the most spectacular purple robes. He would be upstaged by no one. He was notori­ously vain about his appearance-it was said that one reason he enjoyed being honored by the Senate and people was that on these occasions he could wear a laurel wreath, hiding his baldness. Caesar was a masterful or­ator. He knew how to say a lot by saying a little, intuited the moment to end a speech for maximum effect. He never failed to incorporate a surprise into his public appearances-a startling announcement that would heighten their drama. Immensely popular among the Roman people, Caesar was hated and feared by his rivals. On the ides of March-March 15-in the year 44 B.C., a group of conspirators led by Brutus and Cassius surrounded hirn in the senate and stabbed hirn to death. Even dying, however, he kept his sense of drama. Drawing the top of his gown over his face, he let go of the cloth's lower part so that it draped his legs, allowing hirn to die covered and de­cent. According to the Roman historian Suetonius, his final words to his old friend Brutus, who was about to deliver a second blow, were in Greek, and as if rehearsed for the end of a play: \"You too, my child?\" Interpretation The Roman theater was an event for the masses, attended by crowds unimaginable today. Packed into enormous auditoriums, the audience would be amused by raucous comedy or moved by high tragedy. Theater seemed to contain the essence of life, in its concentrated, dramatic form. Like a religious ritual, it had a powerful, instant appeal to the common man. Julius Caesar was perhaps the first public figure to understand the vital link between power and theater. This was because of his own obsessive in­terest in drama. He sublimated this interest by making bimself an actor and director on the world stage. He said his lines as if they had been scripted; he gestured and moved through a crowd with a constant sense of how he appeared to his audience. He incorporated surprise into his repertoire, building drama into bis speeches, staging into his public appearances. His gestures were broad enough for the common man to grasp them instantly. He became immensely popular .. Caesar set the ideal for all leaders and people of power.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II In the year 1831, a young woman named Aurore Dupin Dudevant left her husband and family in the provinces and moved to Paris. She wanted to be a writer; marriage, she feIt, was worse than prison, for it left her neither the time nor the freedom to pursue her passion. In Paris she would establish her independence and make her living by writing. Soon after Dudevant arrived in the capital, however, she had to con­front certain harsh realities. To have any degree of freedom in Paris you had to have money. For a woman, money could only come through mar­riage or prostitution. No woman had ever come close to making a living by writing. Women wrote as a hobby, supported by their husbands, or by an inheritance. In fact when Dudevant first showed her writing to an editor, he told her, \"You should make babies, Madame, not literature.\" Clearly Dudevant had come to Paris to attempt the impossible. In the end, though, she came up with a strategy to do what no woman had ever done-a strategy to re-create herself completely, forging a public image of her own making. Women writers before her had been forced into a ready­made role, that of the second-rate artist who wrote mostly for other women. Dudevant decided that if she had to playa role, she would turn the game around: She would play the part of a man. In 1832 a publisher accepted Dudevant's first major novel, In diana. She had chosen to publish it under a pseudonym, \"George Sand,\" and all of Paris assumed this impressive new writer was male. Dudevant had sometimes worn men's clothes before creating \"George Sand\" (she had al­ways found men's shirts and riding breeches more comfortable); now, as a public figure, she exaggerated the image. She added long men's coats, gray hats, heavy boots, and dandyish cravats to her wardrobe. She smoked cigars and in conversation expressed herself like a man, unafraid to domi­nate the conversation or to use a saucy word. This strange \"malelfernale\" writer fascinated the public. And unlike other women writers, Sand found herself accepted into the clique of male artists. She drank and smoked with them, even carried on affairs with the most famous artists of Europe---Musset, Liszt, Chopin. It was she who did the wooing, and also the abandoning-she moved on at her discretion. Those who knew Sand well understood that her male persona pro­tected her from the public's prying eyes. Out in the world, she enjoyed playing the part to the extreme; in private she remained herself. She also realized that the character of \"George Sand\" could grow stale or pre­dictable, and to avoid this she would every now and then dramatically alter"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"the character she had created; instead of conducting affairs with famous men, she would begin meddling in politics, Ieading demonstrations, inspir­ing student rebellions. No one would dictate to her the limits of the charac­ter she had created. Long after she died, and after most people had stopped reading her noveIs, the Iarger-than-life theatricality of that character has eontinued to fascinate and inspire. Interpretation Throughout Sand's public life, acquaintances and other artists who spent time in her company had the feeling they were in the presence of a man. But in her journals and to her dosest friends, such as Gustave Flaubert, she eonfessed that she had no desire to be a man, but was playing a part for public consumption. What she really wanted was the power to determine her own character. She refused the limits her society would have set on her. She did not attain her power, however, by being herself; instead she cre­ated a persona that she could constantly adapt to her own desires, a per­sona that attracted attention and gave her presence. Understand this: The world wants to assign you a role in life. And onee you accept that role you are doomed. Your power is lirnited to the tiny amount allotted to the role you have selected or have been forced to assurne. An actor, on the other hand, plays many roles. Enjoy that protean power, and if it is beyond you, at least forge a new identity, one of YOUf own making, one that has had no boundaries assigned to it by an envious and resentful world. This act of defiance is Promethean: It makes you re­sponsible for your own creation. Your new identity will protect you from the world precisely because it is not \"you\"; it is a costume you put on and take off. Yo u need not take it personally. And your new identity sets you apart, gives you theatrical pres­en ce. Those in the back rows can see you and hear you. Those in the front rows marvel at your audacity. Do not people talk in society of a man being a great actor? They do not mean by that that he feets, but that he excels in simulating, though he feets nothing. Denis Diderot, 1713-1784 KEYS TO POWER The character you seem to have been born with is not necessarily who you are; beyond the characteristics you have inherited, YOUf parents, your friends, and your peers have helped to shape your personality. The Promethean task of the powerful is to take control of the process, to stop al­lowing others that ability to limit and mold them. Remake YOUfself into a eharacter of power. Working on yourself like day should be one of YOUf greatest and most pleasurable Iife tasks. It makes you in essence an artist­an artist creating YOUfself. In fact, the idea of self-creation comes from the world of art. For thou-LAW 25 195"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"196 LAW 25 sands of years, only kings and the highest courtiers had the freedom to shape their public image and determine their own identity. Similarly, only kings and the wealthiest lords could contemplate their own image in art, and consciously alter it. The rest of mankind played the limited role that society demanded of them, and had little self-consciousness. A shift in this condition can be detected in Ve läzquez's painting Las Meninas, made in 1656. The artist appears at the left of the canvas, standing before a painting that he is in the process of creating, but that has its back to us-we cannot see it. Beside hirn stands a princess, her attendants, and one of the court dwarves, all watching hirn work. The people posing fo r the painting are not directly visible, but we can see them in tiny reflections in a mirror on the back wall-the king and queen of Spain, who must be sitting somewhere in the foreground, outside the picture. The painting represents a dramatic change in the dynamics of power and the ability to determine one's own position in society. For Veläzquez, the artist, is far more prominently positioned than the king and queen. In a sense he is more powerful than they are, since he is clearly the one control­ling the image-their image. Ve läzquez no longer saw hirnself as the slav­ish, dependent artist. He had remade hirnself into a man of power. And indeed the first people other than aristocrats to play openly with their image in Western society were artists and writers, and later on dandies and bohemians. To day the concept of self-creation has slowly filtered down to the rest of society, and has become an ideal to aspire to. Like Ve läzquez, you must demand for yourself the power to determine your position in the painting, and to create your own image. The first step in the process of self-creation is self-consciousness­being aware of yourself as an actor and taking control of your appearance and emotions. As Diderot said, the bad actor is the one who is always sin­cere. People who wear their hearts on their sleeves out in society are tire­some and embarrassing. Their sincerity notwithstanding, it is hard to take them seriously. Those who cry in public may temporarily elicit sympathy, but sympathy so on turns to scorn and irritation at their self­obsessiveness-they are crying to get attention, we feel, and a malicious part of us wants to deny them the satisfaction. Good actors control themselves better. They can play sincere and heartfelt, can affect a tear and a compassionate look at will, but they don't have to feel it. They externalize emotion in a form that others can und er­stand. Method acting is fatal in the real world. No mler or leader could possibly play the part if all of the emotions he showed had to be real. So leam self-control. Adopt the plasticity of the actor, who can mold his or her face to the emotion required. The second step in the process of self-creation is a variation on the George Sand strategy: the creation of a memorable character, one that compels attention, that stands out above the other players on the stage. This was the game Abraham Lincoln played. The homespun, common country man, he knew, was a kind of president that America had never had"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"but would delight in electing. Although many of these qualities came natu­rally to hirn, he played them up-the hat and clothes, the beard. (No presi­dent before hirn had worn a beard.) Lincoln was also the first president to use photographs to spread his image, helping to create the icon of the \"homespun president.\" Good drama, however, needs more than an interesting appearance, or a single stand-out moment. Drama takes place over time--it is an unfold­ing event. Rhythm and timing are critical. One of the most important ele­ments in the rhythm of drama is suspense. Houdini for instance, could sometimes complete his escape acts in seconds-but he drew them out to minutes, to make the audience sweat. The key to keeping the audience on the edge of their seats is letting events unfold slowly, then speeding them up at the right moment, accord­ing to a pattern and tempo that you control. Great mlers fr om Napoleon to Mao Tse-tung have used theatrical timing to surprise and divert their pub­Iic. Franklin Delano Roosevelt understood the importance of staging politi­cal events in a particular order and rhythm. At the time of his 1932 presidential election, the United States was in the midst of a dire economic crisis. Banks were failing at an alarming rate. Shortly after winning the election, Roosevelt went into a kind of retreat. He said nothing about his plans or his cabinet appointments. He even re­fused to meet the sitting president, Herbert Hoover, to discuss the transi­tion. By the time of Roosevelt's inauguration the country was in astate of high anxiety. In his inaugural address, Roosevelt shifted gears. He made a powernd sp eech, making it clear that he intended to lead the country in a completely new direction, sweeping away the timid ge stures of his predecessors. From then on the pace of his speeches and public decisions-cabinet appoint­ments, bold legislation-unfolded at an incredibly rapid rate. The period after the inauguration became known as the \"Hundred Days,\" and its suc­cess in altering the country's mood partly stemmed fr om Roosevelt's clever pacing and use of dramatic contrast. He held his audience in suspense, then hit them with aseries of bold ge stures that seemed all the more mo­mentous because they came fr om nowhere. You must leam to orchestrate events in a similar manner, never revealing all your cards at once, but un­folding them in a way that heightens their dramatic effect. Besides covering a multitude of sins, good drama can also confuse and deceive your enemy. During World War II, the German playwright Bertolt Brecht worked in Hollywood as a screenwriter. After the war he was called before the House Committee on Un-American Activities for his supposed Communist sympathies. Other writers who had been called to testify planned to humiliate the committee members with an angry emotional stand. Brecht was wiser: He would play the committee like a violin, charm­ing them while fooling them as weIl. He carefully rehearsed his responses, and brought along some props, notably a cigar on which he puffed away, knowing the head of the committee liked cigars. And indeed he proceeded LAW 25 197"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"198 LAW 25 to beguile the committee with well-crafted responses that were ambiguous, funny, and double-edged. Instead of an angry, heartfelt tirade, he ran cir­cles around them with a staged production, and they let hirn off scot-free. Other dramatic effects for your repertoire include the beau geste, an action at a climactic moment that symbolizes your triumph or your bold­ness. Caesar's dramatic crossing of the Rubicon was a beau geste--a move that dazzled the soldiers and gave hirn heroic proportions. Yo u must also appreciate the importance of stage entrances and exits. When Cleopatra first met Caesar in Egypt, she arrived rolled up in a carpet, which she arranged to have unfurled at his fe et. George Washington twice left power with flourish and fanfare (first as a general, then as a president who refused to sit for a third term), showing he knew how to make the moment count, dramatically and symbolically. Yo ur own entrances and exits should be crafted and planned as carefully. Remember that overacting can be counterproductive--it is another way of spending too much effort trying to attract attention. The actor Richard Burton discovered early in his career that by standing totally still onstage, he drew attention to hirnself and away from the other actors. It is less what you do that matters, clearly, than how you do it-your graceful­ness and imposing stillness on the sodal stage count for more than overdo­ing your part and moving around too much. Finally: Learn to play many roles, to be whatever the moment re­quires. Adapt your mask to the situation-be protean in the faces you wear. Bismarck played this game to perfection: To a liberal he was a liberal, to a hawk he was a hawk. He could not be grasped, and what cannot be grasped cannot be consumed. 1 mag e The Creek Sea-God Proteus. His power came from his ability tb change shape at will, to be whatever the moment required. When Menelaus, brother of Agamemnon, tried to seize hirn, Proteus transformed hirnself into a lion, then a serpent, a panther, aboar, running water, and finally a leafy tree. Authority: Know how to be all things to all men. A discreet Proteus-a scholar among scholars, a saint among saints. That is the art of winning over everyone, far like attracts like.

Seeking to extend his power base and to rid hirnself of the last of his rivals, Ts 'ao Ts'ao began a campaign to take control of the strategically vital Central Plain. During the siege of a key city, he slightly miscalculated the timing for supplies of grain to arrive from the capital. As he waited for the shipment to come in, the army ran low on food, and Ts 'ao Ts'ao was forced to order the chief of commissariat to reduce its rations. Ts 'ao Ts 'ao kept a tight rein on the army, and ran a network of inform­ers. His spies soon reported that the men were complaining, grumbling timt he was living weIl while they themselves had barely enough to eat. Perhaps Ts 'ao Ts'ao was keeping the food for hirnself, they murmured. If the grumbling spread, Ts 'ao Ts'ao could have a mutiny on his hands. He summoned the chief of commissariat to his tent. \"I want to ask you to lend me something, and you must not refuse,\" Ts'ao Ts 'ao told the chief. \"What is it?\" the chief replied. \"I want the loan of your head to show to the troops,\" said Ts 'ao Ts'ao. \"But I've done nothing wrong!\" cried the chief. \"I know,\" said Ts 'ao Ts 'ao with a sigh, ;'but if I do not put you to death, there will be a mutiny. Do not grieve-after you're gone, I'Il look after your farnily.\" Put this way, the request left the chief no choice, so he resigned hirnself to his fate and was beheaded that very day. Seeing his head on public display, the soldiers stopped grumbling. Some saw through Ts'ao Ts'ao's ge sture, but kept quiet, stunned and intimidated by his violence. And most accepted his version of who was to bIarne, pre­ferring to believe in his wisdom and fairness than in his incompetence and cruelty.

A.D. 155-220 OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II For several years Cesare Borgia campaigned to gain control of large parts of Italy in the name of his father, Pope Alexander. In the year 1500 he managed to take Romagna, in northem Italy. The region had for years been ruled by a series of greedy masters who had plundered its wealth for themselves. Without police or any disciplining fo rce, it had descended into lawlessness, whole areas being ruled by robbers and fe uding families. To establish order, Cesare appointed a lieutenant general of the region­Remirro qe Orco, \"a cruel and vigorous man,\" according to Niccolö Machiavelli. Cesare gave de Orco absolute powers. With energy and violence, de Orco established a severe, brutal justice in Romagna, and so on rid it of almost all of its lawless elements. But in his zeal he sometimes went too far, and after a couple of years the local popu­lation resented and even hated hirn. In December of 1502, Cesare took de­cisive action. He first let it be known that he had not approved of de Orco's cruel and violent deeds, which stemmed fr om the lieutenant's brutal na­ture. Then, on December 22, he imprisoned de Orco in the town of Ce­sena, and the day after Christmas the townspeople awoke to find a strange spectade in the middle of the piazza: de Orco's headless body, dressed in a lavish suit with a purple cape, the head impaled beside it on a pike, the bloody knife and executioner's block laid out beside the head. As Machi­avelli concluded his comments on the affair, \"The fe rocity of this scene left the people at once stunned and satisfied.\" Interpretation Cesare Borgia was a master player in the game of power. Always planning several moves ahead, he set his opponents the cleverest traps. For this Machiavelli honored rum above all others in The Prince."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Cesare foresaw the future with amazing clarity in Romagna: Only bru­tal justice would bring order to the region. The process would take several years, and at first the people would welcome it. But it would soon make many enemies, and the citizens would come to resent the imposition of such unforgiving justice, especially by outsiders. Cesare hirnself, then, could not be seen as the agent of this justice-the people's hatred would cause too many problems in the future. And so he chose the one man who could do the dirty work, knowing in advance that once the task was done he would have to display de Orco's head on a pike. The scapegoat in this case had been planned from the beginning. With Ts 'ao Ts 'ao, the scapegoat was an entirely innocent man; in the Romagna, he was the offensive weapon in Cesare's arsenal that let hirn get the dirty work done without bloodying his own hands. With this second kind of scapegoat it is wise to separate yourself from the hatchet man at some point, either leaving hirn dangling in the wind or, like Cesare, even making yourself the one to bring hirn to justice. Not only are you free of in­volvement in the problem, you can appear as the one who cleaned it up. The Athenians regularly maintained a number of degraded and useless beings at the public expense; and when any calamity, such as plague, drought, or famine, befeil the city ... [these scapegoatsl were led about ... and then sacrificed, apparently by being stoned outside the city. The Colden Bough, Sir!ames George Frazer, 1854-1941 KEYS TO POWER The use of scapegoats is as old as civilization itself, and examples of it can be fo und in cultures around the world. The main idea behind these sacri­fices is the shifting of guilt and sin to an outside figure-object, animal, or man-which is then banished or destroyed. The Hebrews used to take a live goat (hence the term \"scapegoat\") upon whose head the priest would lay both hands while confessing the sins of the Children of Israel. Having thus had those sins transferred to it, the be ast would be led away and aban­doned in the wildemess. With the Athenians and the Aztecs, the scapegoat was human, often a person fe d and raised for the purpose. Since famine and plague were thought to be visited on humans by the gods, in punish­ment for wrongdoing, the people suffered not only from the famine and plague themselves but from blame and guilt. They freed themselves of guilt by transferring it to an innocent person, whose death was intended to sat­isfy the divine powers and banish the evil fr om their midst. It is an extremely human response to not look inward after a mistake or crime, but rather to look outward and to affix blame and guilt on a con­venient object. When the plague was ravaging Thebes, Oedipus looked everywhere for its cause, everywhere except inside hirnself and his own sin of incest, which had so offended the gods and occasioned the plague. This profound need to exteriorize one's guilt, to project it on another person or object, has an immense power, which the clever know how to hamess. Sac-LAW 26 203"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"204 LAW 26 rifice is a ritual, perhaps the most ancient ritual of all; ritual too is a well­spring of power. In the killing of de Orco, note Cesare's symbolic and ritu­alistic display of his body. By framing it in this dramatic way he fo cused guilt outward. The citizens of Romagna responded instantly. Because it comes so naturally to us to look outward rather than inward, we readily ac­cept the scapegoat's guilt. The bloody sacrifice of the scapegoat seems a barbaric relic of the past, but the practice lives on to this day, if indirectly and symbolically; since power depends on appearances, and those in power must seem never to make mistakes, the use of scapegoats is as popular as ever. What modem leader will take responsibility for his blunders? He searches out others to blame, a scapegoat to sacrifice. When Mao Ts e-tung's Cultural Rev­olution failed miserably, he made no apologies or excuses to the Chinese people; instead, like Ts 'ao Ts 'ao before hirn, he offered up scapegoats, in­du ding his own personal secretary and high-ranking memher of the Party, eh ' en Po-ta. Franklin D. Roosevelt had areputation for honesty and fairn ess. Throughout his career, however, he faced many situations in which being the nice guy would have spelled political disaster-yet he could not be seen as the agent of any foul play. For twenty years, then, his secretary, Louis Howe, played the role de Orco had. He handled the backroom deals, the manipulation of the press, the underhanded campaign maneuvers. And whenever amistake was committed, or a dirty trick contradicting Roo­sevelt's carefully crafted image became public, Howe served as the scape­goat, and never complained. Besides conveniently shifting biarne, a scapegoat can serve as a wam­ing to others. In 1631 a plot was hatched to oust France's Cardinal Riche­lieu from power, a plot that became known as \"The Day of the Dupes.\" It almost succeeded, since it involved the upper echelons of govemment, in­duding the queen mother. But through luck and his own connivances, Richelieu survived. One of the key conspirators was a man named Marillac, the keeper of the seals. Richelieu could not imprison him without implicating the queen mother, an extremely dangerous tactic, so he targeted Marillac's brother, a marshai in the army. This man had no involvement in the plot. Richelieu, however, afraid that other conspiracies might be in the air, especially in the army, decided to set an example. He tried the brother on trumped-up charges and had hirn executed. In this way he indirectly punished the real perpetrator, who had thought hirnself protected, and warned any future conspirators that he would not shrink from sacrificing the innocent to pro-tect his own power. , In fact it is often wise to choose the most irbocent victim possible as a sacrificial goat. Such people will not be powerful enough to fight you, and their naive protests may be seen as protesting too much-may be seen, in other words, as a sign of their guilt. Be careful, however, not to create a martyr. It is important that you remain the victim, the poor leader betrayed"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"by the incompetence of those around you. If the scapegoat appears too weak and his punishment too cruel, you may end up the victim of your own device. Sometimes you should find a more powerful scapegoat-one who will elicit less sympathy in the long run. In this vein, history has time and again shown the value of using a elose associate as a scapegoat. This is known as the \"fall of the favorite.\" Most kings had a personal favorite at court, a man whom they singled out, sometimes for no apparent reason, and lavished with favors and attention. But this court favorite could serve as a convenient scapegoat in case of a threat to the king's reputation. The public would readily believe in the scapegoat's guilt-why would the king sacrifice his favorite unless he were guilty ? And the other courtiers, resentful of the favorite anyway, would re­joice at his downfall. The king, meanwhile, would rid hirnself of a man who by that time had probably learned too much about hirn, perhaps becoming arrogant and even disdainful of hirn. Choosing a elose associate as a scape­goat has the same value as the \"fall of the favorite.\" Yo u may lose a friend or aide, but in the long-term scheme of things, it is more important to hide your mistakes than to hold on to someone who one day will probably turn against you. Besides, you can always find a new favorite to take hi� place. Image: The Innocent Goat. On the Day of Atonement, the high priest brings the goat into the temple, places his hands on its head, and confesses the peo­ple's sins, transferring guilt to the guiltless beast, which is then led to the wildemess and abandoned, the people's sins and blame vanishing with hirn. Authority : Folly consists not in committing Folly, but in being incapable of concealing it. All men make mistakes, but the wise conceal the blunders they have made, while fo ols make them pub­lic.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I In 59 B.C., the future queen Cleopatra of Egypt, then ten years old, wit­nessed the overthrow and banishment of her father, Ptolemy XII, at the hand of his eIder daughters-her own sisters. One of the daughters, Berenice, emerged as the leader of the rebellion, and to ensure that she would now rule Egypt alone, she imprisoned her other sisters and mur­dered her own husband. This may have been necessary as a practical step to secure her rule. But that a member of the royal family, a queen no less, would so overtly exact such violence on her own family horrified her sub­jects and stirred up powerful opposition. Four years later this opposition was able to return Ptolemy to power, and he promptly had Berenice and the other eIder sisters beheaded. In 51 B.C. Ptolemy died, leaving four remaining children as heirs. As was the tradition in Egypt, the eldest son, Ptolemy XIII (only ten at the time), married the eIder sister, Cleopatra (now eighteen), and the couple took the throne together as king and queen. None of the four children feIt satisfied with this; everyone, including Cleopatra, wanted more power. A struggle emerged between Cleopatra and Ptolemy, each trying to push the other to the side. In 48 B.C., with the help of a government faction that feared Cleopa­tra's ambitions, Ptolemy was able to force his sister to flee the country, leaving hirnself as sole ruler. In exile, Cleopatra schemed. She wanted to rule alone and to restore Egypt to its past glory, a goal she feIt none of her other siblings could achieve; yet as long as they were alive, she could not realizeher dream. And the example of Berenice had made it clear that no one would serve a queen who was seen murdering her own kind. Even Ptolemy XIII had not dared murder Cleopatra, although he knew she would plot against hirn from abroad. Within a year after Cleopatra's banishment, the Roman dictator Julius Caesar arrived in Egypt, determined to make the country a Roman colony, Cleopatra saw her chance: Reentering Egypt in disguise, she traveled hun­dreds of miles to reach Caesar in Alexandria. Legend has it that she had"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"herself smuggled into his presence rolled up inside a carpet, which was gracefully unfurled at his feet, revealing the young queen. Cleopatra imme­diately went to work on the Roman. She appealed to his love of spectacle and his interest in Egyptian history, and poured on her feminine charms. Caesar so on succumbed and restored Cleopatra to the throne. Cleopatra's siblings seethed-she had outmaneuvered them. Ptolemy XIII would not wait to see what happened next: From his palace in Alexandria, he summoned a great army to march on the city and attack Caesar. In response, Caesar immediately put Ptolemy and the rest of the family under house arrest. But Cleopatra's younger sister Arsinoe escaped from the palace and placed herself at the head of the approaching Egyptian troops, proclaiming herself queen of Egypt. Now Cleopatra finally saw her chance: She convinced Caesar to release Ptolemy from house arrest, under the agreement that he would broker a truce. Of course she knew he would do the opposite-that he would fight Arsinoe for control of the Egyptian army. But this was to Cleopatra's benefit, for it would divide the royal fam­ily. Better still, it would give Caesar the chance to defeat and kill her sib­lings in battle. Reinforced by troops from Rome, Caesar swiftly defeated the rebels. In the Egyptians' retreat, Ptolemy drowned in the Nile. Caesar captured Arsinoe and had her sent to Rome as a prisoner. He also executed the nu­merous enemies who had conspired against Cleopatra, and imprisoned others who had opposed her. To reinforce her position as uncontested queen, Cleopatra now married the only sibling left, Ptolemy XIV -only eleven at the time, and the weakest of the lot. Four years later Ptolemy mysteriously died, of poison. In 41 B.C., Cleopatra employed on a second Roman leader, Marc Antony, the same tactics she had used so weIl on Julius Caesar. After se­ducing hirn, she hin ted to hirn that her sister Arsinoe, still a prisoner in Rome, had conspired to destroy hirn. Marc Antony believed her and promptly had Arsinoe executed, thereby getting rid of the last of the sib­lings who had posed such a threat to Cleopatra. Interpretation Legend has it that Cleopatra succeeded through her seductive charms, but in reality her power came from an ability to get people to do her bidding without realizing they were being manipulated. Caesar and Antony not only rid her of her most dangerous siblings-Ptolemy XIII and Arsinoe­they decimated alt of her enemies, in both the govemment and the mili­tary. The two men became her cat's-paws. They entered the fire for her, did the ugly b� necessary work, while shielding her from appearing as the destroyer of her\\iblings and fellow Egyptians. And in the end, both men acquiesced to her desire to rule Egypt not as a Roman colony but as an in­dependent allied kingdom. And they did all this for her without realizing how she had manipulated them. This was persuasion of the subtlest and most powerful kind. and crammed it in his jaw.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 11 In the late 1920s, civil war broke out in China as the Nationalist and Com­munist parties battled for control of the country. In 1927 Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist leader, vowed to kill every last Communist, and over the next few years he nearly accomplished his task, pushing his enemies hard until, in 1934-1935, he forced them into the Long March, a six-thousand­mile retreat from the southeast to the remote northwest, through harsh ter­rain, in which most of their ranks were decimated. In late 1936 Chiang planned one last offensive to wipe them out, but he was caught in a mutiny: His own soldiers captured hirn and turned hirn over to the Communists. Now he could only expect the worst Meanwhile, however, the Japanese began an invasion of China, and much to Chiang's surprise, instead of killing hirn the Communist leader, Mao Ts e-tung, proposed a deal: The Communists would let hirn go, and would recognize hirn as commander of their forces as weIl as his, if he would agree to fight alongside them against their common enemy. Chiang had expected torture and execution; now he could not believe his luck. How soft these Reds had become. Without having to fight a rearguard ac­tion against the Communists, he knew he could beat the Japanese, and then a few years down the line he would turn around and destroy the Reds with ease. He had nothing to lose and everything to gain by agreeing to their terms. The Communists proceeded to fight the J apanese in their usual fash­ion, with hit-and-run guerrilla tactics, while the Nationalists f<>ught a more conventional war, To gether, after several years, they succeeded in evicting the Japanese. Now, however, Chiang finally understood what Mao had re­ally planned. His own army had met the brunt of the Japanese artillery, was greatly weakened, and would take a few years to recover. The Com­munists, meanwhile, had not only avoided any direct hits fr om the Japa­nese, they had used the time to recoup their strength, and to spread out"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"and gain pockets of influence all over China. As so on as the war against the Japanese ended, the civil war started again-but this time the Communists enveloped the weakened Nationalists and slowly beat them into submis­sion. The Japanese had served as Mao's cat's-paw, inadvertently ploughing the fields for the Communists and making possible their victory over Chi­ang Kai-shek. Interpretation Most leaders who had taken as powerful an enemy as Chiang Kai-shek prisoner would have made sure to kill hirn. But in doing so they would have lost the chance Mao exploited. Without the experienced Chiang as leader of the Nationalists, the fight to drive the Japanese out might have lasted much longer, with devastating results. Mao was far too clever to let anger spoil the chance to kill two birds with one stone. In essence, Mao used two cat's-paws to help hirn attain total victory. First, he cleverly baited Chiang into taking charge of the war against the Japanese. Mao knew the Nationalists led by Chiang would do most of the hard fighting and would succeed in pushing the Japanese out of China, if they did not have to con­cern themselves with fighting the Communists at the same time. The Na­tionalists, then, were the first cat's-paw, used to evict the Japanese. But Mao also knew that in the process of leading the war against the invaders, the Japanese artillery and air support would decimate the conventional forces of the Nationalists, doing damage it could take the Communists decades to inflict. Why waste time and lives if the J apanese could do the job quickly? It was this wise policy of using one cat's-paw after another that allowed the Communists to prevail. There are two uses of the cat's-paw: to save appearances, as Cleopatra did, and to save energy and effort. The latter case in particular demands that you plan several moves in advance, realizing that a temporary move backward (letting Chiang go, say) can lead to a giant leap forward. If you are temporarily weakened and need time to recover, it will often serve you weIl to use those around you both as a screen to hide your intentions and as a cat's-paw to do your work for you. Look for a powerful third party who shares an enemy with you (if for different reasons), then take advantage of their superior power to deal blows which would have cost you much more energy, since you are weaker. You can even gently guide them into ho stili­ties. Always search out the overly aggressive as potential cat's-paws-they are often more than willing to get into a fight, and you can choose just the right fight for your purposes.

But although Soemon had managed to bail out his relative, he had simply displaced the burden onto hirnself. Daizen knew Soemon well-he neither cared nor understood much ab out money, and could easily get into trouble through slowness in repaying the loan, which had been made by a wealthy merchant called Kawachiya Sanemon. Yet if Daizen offered to help Soemon pay back the loan, he would refuse, out of pride, and might even be offended. One day Daizen visited his friend, and after touring the garden and looking at Soemon's prized peonies, they retired to his reception room. Here Daizen saw a painting by the master Kano Te nnyu. ''Ah,'' Daizen ex­claimed, \"a splendid piece of painting .... I don't know when I have seen anything I like better.\" Mter several more bouts of praise, Soemon had no choice: \"Well,\" he said, \"since you like it so much, I hope you will do me the favor of accepting it.\" At first Daizen refused, but when Soemon insisted he gave in. The next day Soemon in turn received a package fr om Daizen. Inside it was a beautiful and delicate vase, which Daizen, in an accompanying note, asked his friend to accept as a token of his appreciation for the painting that Soe­mon had so graciously given hirn the day before. He explained that the vase had been made by Sen no Rikyu hirnself, and bore an inscription from Emperor Hideyoshi. If Soemon did not care for the vase, Daizen sug­gested, he might make a gift of it to an adherent of Cha-no-yu-perhaps the merchant Kawachiya Sanemon, who had often expressed a desire to possess it. \"I hear,\" Daizen continued, \"he has a fine piece of fancy paper [the 300-ryo 1.0.U.] which you would much like. It is possible you might arrange an exchange.\" Realizing what his gracious friend was up to, Soemon took the vase to the wealthy lender. \"However did you get this,\" exclaimed Sanemon, when Soemon showed hirn the vase. \"I have often heard of it, but this is the first time I have ever seen it. It is such a treasure that it is never allowed outside the gate!\" He instantly offered to exchange the debt note for the flower vase, and to give Soemon 300 ryo more on top of it. But Soemon, who did not care for money, only wanted the debt note back, and Sanemon gladly gave it to hirn. Then Soemon immediately hurried to Daizen's house to thank hirn for his clever support. Interpretation Kuriyama Daizen understood that the granting of a favor is never simple: If it is done with' fuss and obviousness, its receiver feels burdened by an obligation. This may give the doer a certain power, but it is apower that will eventually self-destruct, for it will stir up resentrnent and resistance. A favor done indirectly and elegantly has ten times more power. Daizen knew a direct approach would only have offended Soemon. By letting his friend give hirn the painting, however, he made Soemon feel that he too had pleased his friend with a gift.

The courtier uses his gloved hand to soften any blows against hirn, disguise his scars, and make the act of rescue more elegant and clean. By helping others, the courtier eventually helps hirnself.

The truly powernd, on the other hand, seem never to be in a hurry or overburdened. While others work their fingers to the bone, they take their leisure. They know how to find the right people to put in the effort while they save their energy and keep their hands out of the fire. Similarly, you may believe that by taking on the dirty work yourself, involving yourself directly in unpleasant actions, you im­pose your power and instill fear. In fact you make yourself look ugly, and abusive of your high position. Tr uly powernd people keep their hands clean. Only good things surround them, and the only announcements they make are of glorious achievements.

On the eve of an important river battle, the great third-century Chi­nese strategist Chuko Liang fo und hirnself falsely accused of secretly work­ing for the other side. As proof of his loyalty, his commander ordered hirn to produce 100,000 arrows for the army within three days, or be put to death. Instead of trying to manufacture the arrows, an impossible task, Liang took a dozen boats and had bundles of straw lashed to their sides. In the late afternoon, when mist always blanketed the river, he floated the boats toward the enemy camp.

As Liang' s boats inched closer, they redoubled the rain of arrows, which stuck in the thick straw. After several hours, the men hiding on board sailed the vessels quickly downstream, where Chuko Liang met them and collected his 100,000 arrows. Chuko Liang would never do work that others could do for hirn-he was always thinking up tricks like this one. The key to planning such a strategy is the ability to think far ahead, to imagine ways in which other people can be baited into doing the job for you. An essential element in making this strategy work is to disguise your goal, shrouding it in mystery, like the strange enemy boats appearing dimly in the mist. When your rivals cannot be sure what you are after, they will react in ways that often work against them in the long ron. In fact they will become your cat's-paws. If you disguise your intentions, it is much eas­ier to guide them into moves that accomplish exactly what you want done, but prefer not to do yourself. This may require planning several moves in advance, like a billiard ball that bounces off the sides a few times before heading into the right pocket. The early-twentieth-century American con artist Yellow Kid Weil knew that no matter how skillfully he homed in on the perfect wealthy sucker, if he, a stranger, approached this man directly, the sucker might be­come suspicious. So Weil would find someone the sucker already knew to serve as a cat's-paw-someone lower on the totem pole who was himself an unlikely target, and would therefore be less suspicious. Weil would in­terest this man in a scheme promising incredible wealth. Convinced the scheme was for real, the cat's-paw would often suggest, without prompting, that his boss or wealthy friend should get involved: Having more cash to invest, this man would increase the size of the pot, making bigger bucks for an concemed. The cat's-paw would then involve the wealthy sucker who had been Weil's target an along, but who would not suspect a trap, since it was his trosty subordinate who had roped him in. Devices like this are often the best way to approach a person of power: Use an associate or sub­ordinate to hook you up with your primary target. The cat's-paw estab­lishes your credibility and shields you from the unsavory appearance of being too pushy in your courtship. The easiest and most effective way to use a cat's-paw is often to plant information with him that he will then spread to your primary target. False or plan ted information is a powerful tool, especially if spread by a dupe whom no one suspects. You will find it very easy to play innocent and dis­guise yourself as the source. The strategic therapist Dr. Milton H. Erickson would often encounter among his patients a married couple in which the wife wanted the therapy but the husband absolutely refused it. Rather than wasting energy trying to deal with the man directly, Dr. Erickson would see the wife al one, and as she talked he would interject interpretations of the husband's behavior that he knew would rile the husband up if he heard them. Sure enough, the wife would tell her husband what the doctor had said. After a few weeks the"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"husband would be so furious he would insist on joining his wife in the ses­sions so he could set the doctor straight. Finally, you may well find cases in which deliberately offering yourself as the cat's-paw will ultimately gain you great power. This is the ruse of the perfect courtier. Its symbol is Sir Walter Raleigh, who once placed his own cloak on the muddy ground so that Queen Elizabeth would not sully her shoes. As the instrument that protects a master or peer from unpleasant­ness or danger, you gain immense respect, which sooner or later will pay dividends. And remember: If you can make your assistance subtle and gra­cious rather than boastful and burdensome, your recompense will be that much the more satisfying and powerful. Image: The Cat's-Paw. It has long claws to grab things. It is soft and padded. Take hold of the cat and use its paw to pluck things out of the fire, to claw your enemy, to play with the mouse before devouring it. Sometimes you hurt the cat, but most often it doesn't fe el a thing. Authority: Do everything pie asant yourself, everything unpleas­ant through third parties. By adopting the first course you win favor, by taking the second you deflect ill will. Important affairs often require rewards and punishments.

They are like screens that hide your own involvement in dirty work from the public; if at any moment the screen is lifted and you are seen as the manipulator, the puppet master, the whole dynamic turns around-your hand will be seen everywhere, and you will be blamed for misfortunes you may have had nothing to do with. Once the truth is re­vealed, events will snowball beyond your control. In 1572, Queen Catherine de' Medicis of France conspired to do away with Gaspard de Coligny, an admiral in the French navy and a leading member of the Huguenot (French Protestant) community. Coligny was elose to Catherine's son, Charles IX, and she fe ared his growing influence on the young king. So she arranged for a member of the Guise family, one of the most powernd royal elans in France, to assassinate hirn. Secretly, however, Catherine had another plan: She wanted the Hu­guenots to blame the Guises for killing one of their leaders, and to take re­venge. With one blow, she would erase or injure two threatening rivals, Coligny and the Guise family. Ye t both plans went awry. The assassin missed his target, only wounding Coligny; knowing Catherine as his enemy, he strongly suspected it was she who had set up the attack on hirn, and he told the king so. Eventually the failed assassination and the argu­ments that ensued from it set off a chain of events that led to a bloody civil war between Catholics and Protestants, culminating in the harrifying Mas­sacre of St. Bartholomew's Eve, in which thousands of Protestants were killed. If you have to use a cat's-paw or a scapegoat in an action of great con­sequence, be very careful: To o much can go wrong. It is often wiser to use such dupes in more innocent endeavors, where mistakes or miscalculations will cause no serious harm. Finally, there are moments when it is advantageous to not disguise your involvement or responsibility, but rather to take the blame yourself fa r some mistake. If you have power and are secure in it, you should some­times play the penitent: With a sorrowful look, you ask for forgiveness from those weaker than you. It is the ploy of the king who makes a show of his own sacrifices far the good of the people. Similarly, upon occasion you may want to appear as the agent of punishment in order to instill fe ar and trembling in your subordinates. Instead of the cat's-paw you show your own mighty hand as a threatening gesture. Play such a card sparingly. If you play it too often, fe ar will turn into resentrnent and hatred.

Having a large following opens up all sorts of possibilities for deception; not only will your followers worship you, they will defend you from your enemies and will voluntarily take on the work of enticing others to join your fledgling cult. This kind of power will lift you to another realm: You will no longer have to struggle or use subterfuge to en­force your wilL You are adored and can do no wrong. You might think it a gargantuan task to create such a following, but in fact it is fairly simple. As humans, we have a desperate need to believe in something, anything. This makes us eminently gullible: We simply cannot endure long periods of doubt, or of the emptiness that comes from a lack of something to believe in. Dangle in front of us some new cause, elixir, get­rich-quick scherne, or the latest technological trend or art movement and we leap from the water as one to take the bait. Look at history: The chroni­des of the new trends and cults that have made a mass following for them­selves could fill a library. After a few centuries, a few decades, a few years, a few months, they generally look ridiculous, but at the time they seem so attractive, so transcendental, so divine. Always in a rush to believe in something, we will manufacture saints and faiths out of nothing. Do not let this gullibility go to waste: Make your­self the object of worship. Make people fo rm a cult around you. The great European charlatans of the sixteenth and seventeenth cen­turies mastered the art of cultmaking. They lived, as we do now, in a time of transformation: Organized religion was on the wane, seience on the rise. People were desperate to rally around a new cause or faith. The charlatans had begun by peddling health elixirs and alchemie shortcuts to wealth. Moving quickly from town to town, they originally fo cused on small groups-until, by accident, they stumbled on a truth of human nature: The larger the group they gathered around themselves, the easier it was to deceive. The charlatan would station hirnself on a high wooden platform (hence the term \"mountebank\") and crowds would swarm around hirn. In a group setting, people were more emotional, less able to reason. Had the charlatan spoken to them individually, they might have found hirn ridiculous, but lost in a crowd they got caught up in a communal mood of rapt attention. It be­came impossible for them to find the distance to be skepticaL Any defieien­eies in the charlatan's ideas were hidden by the zeal of the mass. Passion and enthusiasm swept through the crowd like a contagion, and they reacted violently to anyone who dared to spread a seed of doubt. Both consciously studying this dynamic over decades of experiment and spontaneously adapting to these situations as they happened, the charlatans perfected the seience of attracting and holding a crowd, molding the crowd into followers and the followers into a cult."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"The gimmicks of the charlatans may seem quaint today, but there are thousands of charlatans among us still, using the same tried-and-true meth­ods their predecessors refined centuries ago, only changing the names of their elixirs and modernizing the look of their cults. We find these latter­day charlatans in all arenas of life-business, fashion, politics, art. Many of them, perhaps, are following in the charlatan tradition without having any knowledge of its history, but you can be more systematic and deliberate. Simply follow the five steps of cultmaking that oUf charlatan ancestors per­fected over the years. Step 1: Keep It Vague; Keep It Simple. To create a cult you must first attract attention. This you should do not through actions, which are too clear and readable, but through words, which are hazy and deceptive. Your initial speeches, conversations, and interviews must include two elements: on the one hand the promise of something great and transformative, and on the other a total vagueness. This combination will stimulate all kinds of hazy dreams in your listeners, who will make their own connections and see what they want to see. To make your vagueness attractive, use words of great resonance but cloudy meaning, words full of heat and enthusiasm. Fancy titles for simple things are helpful, as are the use of numbers and the creation of new words for vague concepts. All of these create the impression of specialized knowl­edge, giving you aveneer of profundity. By the same token, try to make the subject of YOUf cult new and fresh, so that few will understand it. Done right, the combination of vague promises, cloudy but alluring concepts, and fiery enthusiasm will stir people's souls and a group will form around you. Talk too vaguely and you have no credibility. But it is more dangerous to be specific. If you explain in detail the benefits people will gain by fol­Iowing your cult, you will be expected to satisfy them. As a corollary to its vagueness your appeal should also be simple. Most people's problems have complex causes: deep-rooted neurosis, inter­connected social factors, roots that go way back in time and are exceed­ingly hard to unravel. Few, however, have the patience to deal with this; most people want to hear that a simple solution will cure their problems. The ability to offer this kind of solution will give you great power and build you a following. Instead of the complicated explanations of real life, return to the primitive solutions of our ancestors, to good old country remedies, to mysterious panaceas. Step 2: Emphasize the Visual and the Sensual over the Intellectual. Once people have begun to gather around you, two dangers will present themselves: boredom and skepticism. Boredom will make people go else­where; skepticism will allow them the distance to think rationally about whatever it is you are offering, blowing away the mist you have artfully cre­ated and revealing your ideas for what they are. You need to amuse the bored, then, and ward off the cynics. eneountered scienee and edueation at some time, though briefly and unsuecessfully ...

THE POWER OF THE CHARLATAN, GRETE DE FRANCESCO, 1939 THE O\"'L 11 '110 WAS CO!) Onee upon a starless midnight there was an owl who sat on the braneh of an oak tree.

Then they sent a messen ger to the owl and asked him to be their leader. When the owl appeared among the animals it was high noon and the sun was shining brightly. He walked very slowly, which gave him an appearance of great dignity, ami he peered ab out him with large, staring eye,\\; which gave him an air 218 LAW 27 The best way to do this is through theater, or other devices of its kind, Surround YOUfselfwith luxury, dazzle YOUf fo llowers with visual splendor, fill their eyes with spectacle. Not only will this keep them from seeing the ridiculousness of YOUf ideas, the holes in YOUf belief system, it will also at­tract more attention, more fo llowers. Appeal to all the senses: Use incense for scent, soothing music for hearing, colorful charts and graphs for the eye. Yo u might even tickle the mind, perhaps by using new technological gadgets to give YOUf cult a pseudo-scientific veneer-as long as you do not make anyone really think. Use the exotic-distant cultures, strange cus­toms-to create theatrical effects, and to make the most banal and ordinary affairs seem signs of something extraordinary. Step 3: Borrow the Forms of Organized Religion to Structure the Group. YOUf cultlike following is growing; it is time to organize it. Find a way both elevating and comforting. Organized religions have long held un­questioned authority for large numbers of people, and continue to do so in OUf supposedly secular age. And even if the religion itself has faded some, its fo rms still resonate with power. The lofty and holy associations of orga­nized religion can be endlessly exploited. Create rituals for YOUf followers; organize them into a hierarchy, ranking them in grades of sanctity, and giv­ing them names and titles that resound with religious overtones; ask them for sacrifices that will fill YOUf coffers and increase your power. To empha­size YOUf gathering's quasi-religious nature, ta1k and act like a prophet. Yo u are not a dictator, after all; you are a priest, a guru, a sage, a shaman, or any other word that hides YOUf real power in the mist of religion. Step 4: Disguise Yo ur Source of Income. YO Uf group has grown, and you have structured it in a chUfchHke form. YoUf coffers are beginning to fill with your followers' money. Ye t you must never be seen as hungry for money and the power it brings. It is at this moment that you must disguise the SOUfce of your income. Your followers want to believe that if they fo llow you all sorts of good things will fall into their lap. By surrounding YOUfself with luxury you be­come living proof of the soundness of YOUf belief system. Never reveal that your wealth actually comes from your followers' pockets; instead, make it seem to come from the truth of YOUf methods. Followers will copy YOUf each and every move in the belief that it will bring them the same results, and their imitative enthusiasm will blind them to the charlatan nature of YOUf wealth. Step 5: Set Up an Us-Versus-Them Dynamic. The group is now large and thriving, a magnet attracting more and more particles. If you are not careful, though, inertia will set in, and time and boredom will demagnetize the group. To keep YOUf followers united, you must now do what all reli­gions and belief systems have done: create an us-versus-them dynamic. First, make sure YOUf followers believe they are part of an exclusive"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"club, unified by a bond of common goals. Then, to strengthen this bond, manufacture the notion of a devious enemy out to ruin you. There is a force of nonbelievers that will do anything to stop you. Any outsider who tries to reveal the charlatan nature of your belief system can now be de­scribed as a member of this devious force. If you have no enemies, invent one. Given a straw man to react against, your followers will tighten and cohere. They have your cause to believe in and infidels to destroy. OBSERVANCES OF THE LAW Observance I In the year 1653, a twenty-seven-year-old Milan man named Francesco Giuseppe Borri claimed to have had a vision. He went around town telling one and all that the archangel Michael had appeared to hirn and an­nounced that he had been chosen to be the capitano generale of the Army of the New Pope, an army that would seize and revitalize the world. The archangel had further revealed that Borri now had the power to see people's souls, and that he would so on discover the philosopher's stone-a long-sought-after substance that could change base metals into gold. Fr iends and acquaintances who heard Borri explain the vision, and who witnessed the change that had come over hirn, were impressed, for Borri had previously devoted hirnself to a life of wine, women, and gambling. Now he gave all that up, plunging hirnself into the study of alchemy and talking only of mysticism and the occult. The transformation was so sudden and miraculous, and Borri's words were so filled with enthusiasm, that he began to create a following. Unfor­tunately the Italian Inquisition began to notice hirn as well-they pro se­cuted anyone who delved into the occult-so he left Italy and began to wander Europe, from Austria to Holland, telling one and all that \"to those who fo llow me all joy shall be grahted.\" Wherever Borri stayed he at­tracted followers. His method was simple: He spoke of his vision, which had grown more and more elaborate, and offered to \"look into\" the soul of anyone who believed hirn (and they were many). Seemingly in a trance, he would stare at this new follower for several minutes, then claim to have seen the person's soul, degree of enlightenment, and potential for spiritual greatness. If what he saw showed promise, he would add the person to his growing order of disciples, an honor indeed. The cult had six degrees, into which the disciples were assigned ac­cording to what Borri had glimpsed in their souls. With work and total de­votion to the cult they could graduate to a higher degree. Borri-whom they called \"His Excellency,\" and \"Universal Doctor\"-demanded from them the strictest vows of poverty. All the goods and moneys they pos­sessed had to be tumed over to hirn. But they did not mind handing over their property, for Borri had told them, \"I shall soon bring my chemical o.f tremenduus impo.r­tance. \"He's Gadl\" screamed a Pl ymuuth Ruck hen. And the uthers tuuk up the cry \"He's Godl\" So. they fu llowed him wherever he went and when he began ta bump into things they began to. bump info things, too.

Renting the most splendid apartment in the city into which he had tem­porarily settled, he would furnish it with fabulous furniture and accessories, which he had begun to collect. He would drive through the city in a coach studded with jewels, with six magnificent black horses at its head. He never stayed too long in one place, and when he disappeared, saying he had more souls to gather into his flock, his reputation only grew in his absence. He became famous, although in fact he had never done a single concrete thing. From all over Europe, the blind, the crippled, and the desperate came to visit Borri, for word had spread that he had healing powers. He asked no fe e for his services, which only made hirn seem more marvelous, and in­deed some claimed that in this or that city he had performed a miracle eure. By only hinting at his accomplishments, he encouraged people's imaginations to blow them up to fantastic proportions. His wealth, for ex­ample, actually came fr om the vast sums he was collecting from his in­creasingly select group of rich disciples; yet it was presumed that he had in fact perfected the philosopher's stone. The Church continued to pursue hirn, denouncing hirn for heresy and witchcraft, and Borri's response to these charges was a dignified silence; this only enhanced his reputation and made his followers more passionate. Only the great are persecuted, after all; how many understood Jesus Christ in his own time? Borri did not have to say a word-his followers now called the Pope the Antichrist. And so Borri's power grew and grew, until one day he left the city of Amsterdam (where he had settled for a while), absconding with huge sums of bOITowed money and diamonds that had been entrusted to hirn. (He claimed to be able to remove the flaws from diamonds through the power of his gifted mind.) Now he was on the run. The Inquisition eventually caught up with him, and fo r the last twenty years of his life he was impris­oned in Rome. But so great was the belief in his occult powers that to his dying day he was visited by wealthy believers, including Queen Christina of Sweden. Supplying hirn with money and materials, these visitors al­lowed hirn to continue his search for the elusive philosopher's stone. Interpretation Before he formed his cult, Borri seems to have stumbled on a critical dis­covery. Tiring of his life of debauchery, he had decided to give it up and to devote hirnself to the occult, a genuine interest of his. He must have no­ticed, however, that when he alluded to a mystical experience (rather than physical exhaustion) as the source of his conversion, people of all classes wanted to hear more. Realizing the power he could gain by ascribing the change to something external and mysterious, he went further with his manufactured visions. The grander the vision, and the more sacrifices he asked for, the more appealing and believable his story seemed to become. Remember: People are not interested in the truth about change.

Soon well-to-do people from all over the Continent, their ailments both serious and mild, were making the trek to the alpine village of Lang­nau, where Schüppach lived and worked. Tr udging through the mountains, these visitors witnessed the most dramatic naturallandscapes that Europe has to offe r. By the time they reached Langnau, they were already feeling transformed and on their way to health. Schüppach, who had become known as simply the \"Mountain Doc­tor,\" had a small pharmacy in town. This place became quite a scene: Crowds of people from many different countries would cram the small roorn, its walls lined with colorful bottles filled with herbal eures. Where most doctors of the time prescribed foul-tasting concoctions that bore in­cornprehensible Latin titles (as medicines often do still), Schüppach's eures had names such as \"The Oil of Joy,\" \"Little Flower's Heart,\" or ''Against the Monster,\" and they tasted sweet and pleasing. Visitors to Langnau would have to wait patiently for a visit with the Mountain Doctor, because every day some eighty messengers would arrive at the pharmacy bearing flasks of urine from all over Europe. Schüppach claimed he could diagnose what ailed you simply by looking at a sampie of your urine and reading a written description of your ailment. (Naturally he read the description very carefully before prescribing a eure.) When he fi­nally had a spare minute (the urine sampies took up much of his time), he would call the visitor into his office in the pharmacy. He would then exam­ine this person's urine sampie, explaining that its appearance would tell hirn everything he needed to know. Country people had a sense for these things, he would say-their wisdom came from living a simple, godly life with none of the complications of urban living. This personal consultation would also include a discussion as to how one might bring one's soul more into harmony with nature. Schüppach had devised many forms of treatment, each profoundly un­like the usual medical practices of the time. He was a believer, for instance, in electric shock therapy. To those who wondered whether this was in keeping with his belief in the healing power of nature, he would explain that electricity is a natural phenomenon; he was merely imitating the the fa bulous establish­ment he opened in London for the sale of his elixirs .... In the chief room. where he received patients, stood \"the largest air pump in the world\" 10 assist him in his \"philosophi­cal investigations\" into disease, ami also a \"stupendous metallic conductor, \" a richly gilded pedestal surrounded with retorts and vials of \"etherial and other essences. \" ...

One of his patients claimed to be inhabited by seven devils. The doctor cured hirn with electrical shocks, and as he administered these he exclaimed that he could see the devils flying out of the man's body, one by one. Another man claimed to have swallowed a hay wagon and its driver, whieh were causing hirn massive pains in the ehest. The Mountain Doctor listened patiently, claimed to be able to hear the crack of a whip in the man's belly, promised to eure hirn, and gave hirn a sedative and a purgative. The man fell asleep on a ehair outside the pharmacy. As so on as he awoke he vomited, and as he vomited a hay wagon sped past hirn (the Mountain Doctor had hired it for the occasion), the crack of its whip making hirn feel that somehow he had indeed expelled it under the doctor's care. Over the years, the Mountain Doctor's farne grew. He was consulted by the powerful-even the writer Goethe made the trek to his village-and he becarne the center of a cult of nature in whieh everything natural was considered worthy of worship. Sehüppaeh was careful to create effects that would entertain and inspire his patients. A professor who visited hirn once wrote, \"One stands or sits in company, one plays cards, sometimes with a young woman; now a concert is given, now a luneh or supper, and now a little ballet is presented. With a very happy effect, the freedom of nature is everywhere united with the pleasures of the beau monde, and if the doctor is not able to heal any diseases, he can at least eure hypoehondria and the vapors.\" Interpretation Schüppach had begun his career as an ordinary village doctor. He would sometimes use in his practice some of the village remedies he had grown up with, and apparently he noticed some results, for soon these herbal tinc­tures and natural forms ofhealing became his specialty. And in fact his nat­ural fo rm of healing did have profound psyehological effects on his patients. Where the normal drugs of the time created fe ar and pain, Schüp­pach's treatments were comfortable and soothing. The resulting improve­ment in the patient's mood was a critical element in the eures he brought about. His patients believed so deeply in his skills that they willed them­selves into health. Instead of scoffing at their irrational explanations for their ailments, Schüppach used their hypochondria to make it seem that he had effected a great eure. The caseof the Mountain Doctor teaches us valuable lessons in the creation of a cultlike following. First, you must find a way to engage peo­ple's will, to make their belief in your powers strong enough that they imagine all sorts of benefits. Their belief will have a self-fulfilling quality, but you must make sure that it is you, rather than their own will, who is seen as the agent of transformation. Find the belief, cause, or fantasy that will make them believe with a passion and they will imagine the rest, wor­shipping you as healer, prophet, genius, whatever you like. Second, Schüppach teaches us the everlasting power of belief in na­ture, and in simplicity. Nature, in reality, is full of much that is terrifying­poisonous plants, fierce animals, sudden disasters, plagues. Belief in the"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"healing, comforting quality of nature is really a constructed myth, a roman­ticism. But the appeal to nature can bring you great power, especially in cornplicated and stressful times. This appeal, however, must be handled right. Devise a kind of theater of nature in which you, as the director, pick and choose the qualities that fit the romanticism of the times. The Mountain Doctor played the part to per­fection, playing up his homespun wisdom and wit, and staging his eures as drarnatic pieces. He did not make hirnself one with nature; instead he molded nature into a cult, an artificial construction. To create a \"natural\" effect you actually have to work hard, making nature theatrical and de­lightfully pagan. Otherwise no one will notice. Nature too must follow trends and be progressive. Observance 111 In 1788, at the age of fifty-five, the doctor and scientist Franz Mesmer was at a crossroads. He was a pioneer in the study of animal magnetism-the belief that animals contain magnetic matter, and that a doctor or specialist can effect miraculous eures by working on this charged substance-but in Vienna, where he lived, his theories had met with scom and ridicule from the medical establishment. In treating women for convulsions, Mesmer clairned to have worked a number of eures, his proudest achievement being the restoration of sight to a blind girl. But another doctor who exam­ined the young girl said she was as blind as ever, an assessment with which she herself agreed. Mesmer countered that his enemies were out to slander hirn by winning her over to their side. This claim only elicited more ridicule. Clearly the sober-minded Viennese were the wrong audience for his theories, and so he decided to move to Paris and start again. Renting a splendid apartment in his new city, Mesmer decorated it ap­propriately. Stained glass in most of the windows created a religious feel­ing, and mirrors on all the walls produced an hypnotic effect. The doctor advertised that in his apartment he would give demonstrations of the pow­ers of animal magnetism, inviting the diseased and melancholie to fee! its powers. Soon Parisians of all classes (but mostly women, who seemed more attracted to the idea than men did) were paying for entry to witness the miracles that Mesmer promised. Inside the apartment, the scents of orange blossom and exotic incense wafted through special vents. As the initiates filtered into the salon where the demonstrations took place, they heard harp music and the lulling sounds of a female vocalist coming from another room. In the center of the salon was a long oval container filled with water that Mesmer claimed had been magnetized. From holes in the container's metallid protruded long movable iron rods. The visitors were instructed to sit around the container, place these magnetized rods on the body part that gave them pains or problems, and then hold hands with their neighbors, sitting as close as pos­sible to one another to help the magnetic force pass between their bodies. Sometimes, too, they were attached to each other by cords. Mesmer would leave the room, and \"assistant magnetizers\"-all hand-T//L I'()\\\\ /,:11 <H ,\\ I.W In the town of Ta rnopollived a man by Ihe name of Reb Fe ivel.

And after a few minutes a kind of delirium would overcome the women. Some would sob, some would shriek and tear their hair, others would laugh hysterically_ At the height of the delirium Mesmer would reenter the salon, dressed in a flowing silk robe embroidered with golden flowers and carrying a white magnetic rod. Moving around the container, he would stroke and soothe the patients until calm was restored. Many women would later attribute the strange power he had on them to his piercing look, which, they thought, was exciting or quieting the magnetic fluids in their bodies. Within months of his arrival in Paris, Mesmer became the rage. His supporters included Marie-Antoinette herself, the queen of France, wife of Louis XVL As in Vienna, he was condemned by the official faculty of med­icine, but it did not matter. His growing following of pupils and patients paid hirn handsomely_ Mesmer expanded his theories to proclaim that all humanity could be brought into harmony through the power of magnetism, a concept with much appeal during the French Revolution. A cult of Mesmerism spread across the country; in many towns, \"Societies of Harmony\" sprang up to experiment with magnetism. These societies eventually became notorious: They tended to be led by libertines who would turn their sessions into a kind of group orgy. At the height of Mesmer's popularity, a French commission published a report based on years of testing the theory of animal magnetism. The conclusion: Magnetism's effects on the body actually came from a kind of group hysteria and autosuggestion. The report was well documented, and ruined Mesmer's reputation in France. He left the country and went into retirement. Only a few years later, however, imitators sprang up all over Europe and the cult of Mesmerism spread once again, its believers more numerous than ever. Interpretation Mesmer's career can be broken into two parts. When still in Vienna, he clearly believed in the validity of his theory, and did all he could to prove it. But his growing frustration and the disapproval of his colleagues made hirn adopt another strategy. First he moved to Paris, where no one knew him, and where his extravagant theories found a more fruitful soH. Then he appealed to the French love of theater and spectacle, making his apartment into a kind of magical world in which a sensory overload of smells, sights, and sounds entranced his customers. Most irnportant, from now on he practiced his magnetism only on a group_ The group provided the setting in which the magnetism would have its proper effect, one believer infecting the other, overwhelming any individual doubter.

This is the lesson that Mesmer teaches us: Our tendency to doubt, the distance that allows us to reason, is broken down when we join a group. The warmth and infectiousness of the group overwhelm the skeptical indi­vidual. This is the power you gain by creating a cult. Also, by playing on people's repressed sexuality, you lead them into mistaking their excited feelings for signs of your mystical strength.

Once you understand this, you will find it essential to overcome your nat­ural timidity and practice the art of audacity. The following are among the most pronounced psychological effects of boldness and timidity. The Bolder the Lie the Better. We all have weaknesses, and our efforts are never perfeet. But entering action with boldness has the magical effect of hiding our deficiencies. Con artists know that the bolder the He, the more convincing it becomes. The sheer audacity of the story makes it more credible, distracting attention from its inconsistencies. Wh en putting to­gether a con or entering any kind of negotiation, go further than you planned. Ask for the mo on and you will be surprised how often you get it. Lions Circle the Hesitant Prey. People have a sixth sense for the weak­nesses of others. If, in a first encounter, you demonstrate your willingness to compromise, back down, and retreat, you bring out the Hon even in peo­pIe who are not necessarily bloodthirsty. Everything depends on percep­tion, and once you are seen as the kind of person who quickly goes on the defensive, who is willing to negotiate and be amenable, you will be pushed around without mercy. Boldness Strikes Fear; Fear Creates Authority. The bald move makes you seem larger and more powerful than you are. If it comes suddenly, with the stealth and swiftness of a snake, it inspires that much more fear. By intimidating with a bald move, you estabHsh a precedent: in every sub se­quent encounter, people will be on the defensive, in terror of your next strike. Going Halfway with Half a Heart Digs the Deeper Grave. If you enter an action with less than total confidence, you set up obstacles in your own path. Wh en a problem arises you will grow confused, seeing options where there are none and inadvertently creating more problems still. Re­treating from the hunter, the timid hare scurries more easily into his snares. Hesitation Creates Gaps, Boldness Obliterates Them. When you take time to think, to hem and haw, you create a gap that allows others time to think as weH. Your timidity infects people with awkward energy, elicits em­barrassment.

OBSERVANCES OF THE LAW Observance I In May of 1925, five of the most successful dealers in the French scrap­metal business fo und themselves invited to an \"official\" but \"highly confi­dential\" meeting with the deputy director general of the Ministry of Post and Te legraphs at the Hotel Crillon, then the most luxurious hotel in Paris. When the businessmen arrived, it was the director general himself, a Mon­sieur Lustig, who met them in a swank suite on the top floor. The businessmen had no idea why they had been summoned to this meeting, and they were bursting with curiosity. Mter drinks, the director explained. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"this is an urgent matter that requires complete secrecy. The government is going to have to tear down the Eiffel To wer.\" The dealers listened in stunned silence as the director explained that the tower, as recently reported in the news, desperately needed re­pairs. It had originally been meant as a temporary structure (for the Expo­sition of 1889), its maintenance costs had soared over the years, and now, in a time of a fiscal crisis, the government would have to spend millions to fix it. Many Parisians considered the Eiffel To wer an eyesore and would be delighted to see it go. Over time, even the tourists would fo rget about it-it would live on in photographs and postcards. \"Gentlemen,\" Lustig said, \"you are all invited to make the government an offer for the Eiffel To wer.\" He gave the businessmen sheets of government stationery filled with figures, such as the tonnage of the tower's metal. Their eyes popped as they calculated how much they could make from the scrap. Then Lustig led them to a waiting limo, which brought them to the Eiffel To wer. Flashing an official badge, he guided them through the area, spicing his tour with am using anecdotes. At the end of the visit he thanked them and asked them to have their offers delivered to his suite within four days. Several days after the offers were submitted, one of the five, a Mon­sieur P., received notice that his bid was the winner, and that to secure the sale he should come to the suite at the hotel within two days, bearing a cer­tified check for more than 250,000 francs (the equivalent today of about $1,OOO,OOO)-a quarter of the total price. On delivery of the check, he would receive the documents confirming his ownership of the Eiffel To wer. Monsieur P. was excited-he would go down in history as the man who had bought and tom down the infamous landmark. But by the time he ar­rived at the suite, check in hand, he was beginning to have doubts about the whole affair. Why meet in a hotel instead of a government building? Why hadn't he heard fr om other officials? Was this a hoax, a scam? As he listened to Lustig discuss the arrangements for the scrapping of the tower, he hesitated, and contemplated backing out. be the dwarf figure of an elephant. fit only to be placed on the top of a stick; and then what honor would there be in such an adventure? \"There is, \" said he. \"some deeeption in this writing.

I shall therefore leave you and your elephant.\" The reasoner then departed; but the adventurous man rushed with his eyes closed across the water; neither depth nor violence prevented hirn, and according to the inscription he saw the elephant lying on the opposite bank. He took it and carried it to the top of the hili, where he saw a town. A shriek from the elephant alarmed the people ofthe city, who rose in arms; but the adventurer, nothing daunted. was deter­mined to die a hero.

Instead of talking about the tower, he was complaining about his low salary, about his wife's desire fo r a fur coat, about how galling it was to work hard and be unappreciated. It dawned on Monsieur P. that this high government official was asking for abribe. The effect on hirn, though, was not outrage but relief. Now he was sure that Lustig was for real, since in all of his previous encounters with French bureaucrats, they had inevitably asked for a litde greasing of the palm. His confidence restored, Monsieur P. slipped the director several thousand francs in bills, then handed hirn the certified check. In return he received the documentation, including an im­pressive-Iooking bill of sale. He left the hotel, dreaming of the profits and farne to come. Over the next few days, however, as Monsieur P. waited for corre­spondence fr om the government, he began to realize that something was amiss. A few telephone calls made it clear that there was no deputy direc­tor general Lustig, and there were no plans to destroy the Eiffel To wer: He had been bilked of over 250,000 francs! Monsieur P. never went to the police. He knew what kind of reputa­tion he would get if word got out that he had fallen for one of the most ab­surdly audacious cons in history. Besides the public humiliation, it would have been business suicide. Interpretation Had Count Victor Lustig, con artist extraordinaire, tried to sell the Arc de Tr iomphe, a bridge over the Seine, a statue of Balzac, no one would have believed him. But the Eiffe l To wer was just too large, to� improbable to be part of a con job. In fact it was so improbable that Lustig was able to return to Paris six months later and \"resell\" the Eiffel To wer to a different scrap­iron dealer, and for a higher price-a sum in francs equivalent today to over $1,500,000! Largeness of scale deceives the human eye. It distracts and awes us, and is so self-evident that we cannot imagine there is any illusion or decep­tion afoot. Arm yourself with bigness and boldness-stretch your decep­tions as far as they will go and then go further. If you sense that the sucker has suspicions, do as the intrepid Lustig did: Instead of backing down, or lowering his price, he simply raised his price higher, by asking for and get­ting abribe. Asking for more puts the other person on the defensive, cuts out the nibbling effect of compromise and doubt, and overwhelms with its boldness.

The Shuisky princes seized control of the govem­ment and threw Obolensky in prison, where he starved to death. At the age of eight, Ivan was now a despised orphan, and any boyar or family mem­ber who took an interest in hirn was immediately banished or killed. And so Ivan roamed the palace, hungry, ill clothed, and often in hid­ing from the Shuiskys, who treated hirn roughly when they saw hirn. On some days they would search hirn out, clothe hirn in royal robes, hand him a scepter, and set hirn on the throne-a kind of mock ritual in which they lampooned his royal pretensions. Then they would shoo hirn away. One evening several of them chased the Metropolitan-the head of the Russian church-through the palace, and he sought refuge in Ivan's room; the boy watched in horror as the Shuiskys entered, hurled insults, and beat the Metropolitan mercilessly. Ivan had one friend in the palace, a boyar named Vo rontsov who con­soled and advised hirn. One day, however, as he, Vo rontsov, and the newest Metropolitan conferred in the palace refectory, several Shuiskys burst in, beat up Vo rontsov, and insulted the Metropolitan by tearing and treading on his robes. Then they banished Vo rontsov fr om Moscow. Throughout all this Ivan maintained a strict silence. To the boyars it seemed that their plan had worked: The young man had tumed into a ter­rified and obedient idiot. They could ignore hirn now, even leave hirn alone. But on the evening of December 29, 1543, Ivan, now thirteen, asked Prince Andrei Shuisky to come to his room. When the prince arrived, the room was filled with palace guards. Yo ung Ivan then pointed his finger at Andrei and ordered the guards to arrest hirn, have hirn killed, and throw his body to the bloodhounds in the royal kennel. Over the next few days Ivan had all of Andrei's close associates arrested and banished. Caught off­guard by his sudden boldness, the boyars now stood in mortal terror of this youth, the future Ivan the Te rrible, who had planned and waited for five years to execute this one swift and bold act that would secure his power for decades to come. Interpretation The world is full of boyars-men who despise you, fe ar your ambition, and jealously guard their shrinking realms of power. Yo u need to establish your authority and gain respect, but the moment the boyars sense your growing boldness, they will act to thwart you. This is how Ivan met such a situation: He lay low, showing neither ambition nor discontent. He waited, and when the time came he brought the palace guards over to his side. The guards had come to hate the cruel Shuiskys. Once they agreed to Ivan's plan, he struck with the swiftness of a snake, pointing his finger at Shuisky and giv­ing hirn no time to react. Negotiate with a boyar and you create opportunities for hirn. A small city, he stopped a pass­ing gentleman. \"Hello, my friend! Who is the richest man in town?\" \"Poor countryman!

He had ambitions of greatness as a writer, to enflame the world with his name, but how could a mere lackey hope to realize such dreams? That year Pope Leo X received from the king of Portugal an embassy that included many gifts, most prominent among them a great elephant, the first in Rome since imperial times. The pontiff adored this elephant and showered it with attention and gifts. But despite his love and care, the ele­phant, which was called Hanno, became deathly ill. The pope summoned doctors, who administered a five-hundred-pound purgative to the ele­phant, but all to no avail. The animal died and the pope went into moum­ing, To console hirnself he summoned the great painter Raphael and ordered hirn to create a life-sized painting of Hanno above the animal's tomb, bearing the inscription, \"What nature took away, Raphael has with his art restored.\" Over the next few days, a pamphlet circulated throughout Rome that caused great merriment and laughter. Entitled \"The Last Will and Te sta­ment of the Elephant Hanno,\" it read, in part, \"To my heir the Cardinal Santa Croce, I give my knees, so that he can imitate my genuflections ... , To my heir Cardinal Santi Quattro, I give my jaws, so that he can more readily devour all of Christ's revenues .... To my heir Cardinal Medici, I give my ears, so that he can hear everyone's doings ... ,\" To Cardinal Grassi, who had areputation for lechery, the elephant bequeathed the ap­propriate, oversized part of his own anatomy. On and on the anonymous pamphlet went, sparing none of the great in Rome, not even the pope. With each one it took aim at their best-known weakness. The pamphlet ended with verse, \"See to it that Aretino is your fr iend / For he is a bad enemy to have. / His words alone could ruin the high pope / So God guard everyone from his tongue.\" Interpretation With one short pamphlet, Aretino, son of a poor shoemaker and a servant hirnself, hurled hirns elf to farne. Everyone in Rome rushed to find out who this daring young man was. Even the pope, amused by his audacity, sought hirn out and ended up giving hirn a job in the papal service. Over the years he came to be known as the \"Scourge of Princes,\" and his biting tongue earned him the respect and fe ar of the great, from the king of France to the Hapsburg emperor.

KEYS TO POWER Most of us are timid. We want to avoid tension and conflict and we want to be liked by all. We may contemplate a bold action but we rarely bring it to life. We are terrified of the consequences, of what others might think of us, of the hostility we will stir up if we dare go beyond OUf usual place. Although we may disguise OUf timidity as a concern for others, a de­sire not to hurt or offend them, in fact it is the opposite-we are really self­absorbed, worried about oUfselves and how others perceive uso Boldness, on the other hand, is outer-directed, and often makes people feel more at ease, since it is less self-conscious and less repressed. This can be seen most clearly in seduction. All great seducers succeed through effrontery. Casanova's boldness was not revealed in a daring ap­proach to the woman he desired, or in intrepid words to flatter her; it con­sisted in his ability to surrender himself to her completely and to make her believe he would do anything for her, even risk his life, which in fact he sometimes did. The woman on whom he lavished this attention under­stood that he held nothing back fr om her. This was infinitely more flatter­ing than compliments. At no point during the seduction would he show hesitation or doubt, simply because he never feIt it. Part of the charm of being seduced is that it makes us feel engulfed, temporarily outside of oUfselves and the usual doubts that permeate our Jives. The moment the seducer hesitates, the charm is broken, because we become aware of the process, of their deliberate effort to seduce us, of their self-consciousness. Boldness directs attention outward and keeps the illusion alive. It never induces awkwardness or embarrassment. And so we admire the bold, and prefer to be around them, because their self­confidence infects us and draws us outside OUf own realm of inwardness and reflection. Few are born bold. Even Napoleon had to cultivate the habit on the battlefield, where he knew it was a matter of life and death. In social set­tings he was awkward and timid, but he overcame this and practiced bold­ness in every part of his life because he saw its tremendous power, how it could literally enlarge a man (even one who, like Napoleon, was in fact conspicuously small). We also see this change in Ivan the Te rrible: A harm­less boy suddenly transforms himself into a powerful young man who com­mands authority, simply by pointing a finger and taking bold action. You must practice and develop YOUf boldness. Yo u will often find uses for it. The best place to begin is often the delicate world of negotiation, par-THE BOY Ar\\D THE :-.IETTLE A boy playing in the fields got stung by a nettle.

How often we put ourselves down by asking for too little. When Christo­pher Columbus proposed that the Spanish court finance his voyage to the Americas, he also made the insanely bold demand that he be called \"Grand Admiral of the Ocean.\" The court agreed. The price he set was the price he received-he demanded to be treated with respect, and so he was. Henry Kissinger too knew that in negotiation, bold demands work better than starting off with piecemeal concessions and trying to meet the other person halfway. Set your value high, and then, as Count Lustig did, set it higher. Understand: If boldness is not natural, neither is timidity. It is an ac­quired habit, picked up out of a desire to avoid conflict. If timidity has taken hold of you, then, root it out. Yo ur fe ars of the consequences of a bold action are way out of proportion to reality, and in fact the conse­quences of timidity are worse. Yo ur value is lowered and you create a self­fulfilling cyde of doubt and disaster. Remember: The problems created by an audacious move can be disguised, even remedied, by more and greater audacity. Image : The Lion and the Hare. The lion creates no gaps in his way-his movements are too swift, his jaws too quick and powerful. The timid hare will do any­thing to escape danger, but in its haste to retreat and flee, it backs into traps, hops smack into its enemies' jaws. Authority: I certainly think that it is better to be impetuous than cautious, for fortune is a woman, and it is necessary, if you wish to master her, to conquer her by force; and it can be seen that she lets herself be overcome by the bold rather than by those who proceed coldly. And therefore, like a woman, she is always a fr iend to the young, because they are less cautious, fiercer, and master her with greater audacity.

It is a tac­tical instrument, to be used at the right moment. Plan and think ahead, and make the final element the bold move that will bring you success.

Yo u would offend too many people, as is proven by those who cannot control their boldness. One such person was Lola Montez; her audacity brought her triumphs and led to her seduction of the king of Bavaria. But since she could never rein in her boldness, it also led to her downfall-in Bavaria, in England, wherever she tumed. It crossed the border between boldness and the appearance of cruelty, even insanity. Ivan the Te rrible suffered the same fate: When the power of bold­ness brought hirn success, he stuck to it, to the point where it became a life­long pattern of violence and sadism. He lost the ability to tell when boldness was appropriate and when it was not. Timidity has no place in the realm of power; you will often benefit, however, by being able to fe ign it.

Several miles out of port, a stowaway climbed out of a provision ehest: Vasco Nufiez de Balboa, a noble Spaniard who had come to the New World in search of gold but had fallen into debt and had es­eaped his creditors by hiding in the ehest. Balboa had been obsessed with gold ever since Columbus had re­turned to Spain from his voyages with tales of a fabulous but as yet undis­eovered kingdom called EI Dorado. Balboa was one of the first adventurers to come in search of Columbus's land of gold, and he had de­eided fr om the beginning that he would be the one to find it, through sheer audacity and single-mindedness. Now that he was free of his credi­tors, nothing would stop hirn. Unfortunately the ship's owner, a wealthy jurist named Francisco Fer­nändez de Enciso, was furious when told of the stowaway, and he ordered that Balboa be left on the first island they came across. Before they found any island, however, Enciso received news that the colony he was to res­eue had been abandoned. This was Balboa's chance. He told the sailors of his previous voyages to Panama, and of the rumors he had heard of gold in the area. The excited sailors convinced Enciso to spare Balboa's life, and to establish a colony in Panama. Weeks later they named their new settlement \"Darien.\" Darien's first governor was Enciso, but Balboa was not a man to let others steal the initiative. He campaigned against Enciso among the sailors, who eventually made it clear that they preferred hirn as governor. Enciso fled to Spain, fe aring for his life. Months later, when a representa­tive of the Spanish crown arrived to establish hirnself as the new, official governor of Darien, he was turned away. On his return voyage to Spain, this man drowned; the drowning was accidental, but under Spanish law, Balboa had murdered the governor and usurped his position. Balboa's bravado had got hirn out of scrapes before, but now his hopes of wealth and glory seemed doomed. To lay claim to EI Dorado, should he discover it, he would need the approval of the Spanish king­which, as an outlaw, he would never receive. There was only one solution. Panamanian Indians had told Balboa of a vast ocean on the other side of the Central American isthmus, and had said that by traveling south upon this western coast, he would reach a fabulous land of gold, called by a name that to his ears sounded like \"Biru.\" Balboa decided he would cross the treacherous jungles of Panama and become the first European to bathe his fe et in this new ocean. From there he would march on EI Dorado. If he did this on Spain's behalf, he would obtain the eternal gratitude of the king, and would seeure his own reprieve-only he had to act before Span­ish authorities came to arrest hirn. In 1513, then, Balboa set out, with 190 soldiers.

Finally, from a mountaintop, Balboa became the first European to lay eyes on the Pacific Ocean. Days later he marched in his armor into its waters, bearing the banner of Castile and claiming all its seas, lands, and islands in the name of the Spanish throne. Indians from the area greeted Balboa with gold, jewels, and precious pearls, the like of which he had never seen. When he asked where these had come from, the Indians pointed south, to the land of the Incas. But Balboa had only a few soldiers left. For the moment, he decided, he should return to Darien, send the jewels and gold to Spain as a token of good will, and ask for a large army to aid hirn in the conquest of EI Dorado, When news reached Spain of Balboa's bold crossing of the isthmus, his discovery of the western ocean, and his planned conquest of EI Do­rado, the former criminal became a hero, He was instantly proclaimed governor of the new land. But before the king and queen received word of his discovery, they had already sent a dozen ships, under the command of a man named Pedro Arias Davila, \"Pedrarias,\" with orders to arrest Bal­boa for murder and to take command of the colony. By the time Pedrarias arrived in Panama, he had learned that Balboa had been pardoned, and that he was to share the governorship with the former outlaw. All the same, Balboa felt uneasy, Gold was his dream, EI Dorado his only desire. In pursuit of this goal he had nearly died many times over, and to share the wealth and glory with a newcomer would be intolerable, He also soon discovered that Pedrarias was a jealous, bitter man, and equally unhappy with the situation. Once again, the only solution for Bal­boa was to seize the initiative by proposing to cross the jungle with a larger army, carrying ship-building materials and tools. Once on the Pa­cific coast, he would create an armada with which to conquer the Incas. Surprisingly enough, Pedrarias agreed to the plan-perhaps sensing it would never work. Hundreds died in this second march through the jun­gle, and the timber they carried rotted in the torrential rains. Balboa, as usual, was undaunted-no power in the world could thwart his plan-and on arriving at the Pacific he began to cut down trees for new lumb er. But the men remaining to hirn were to� few and too weak to mount an inva­sion, and once again Balboa had to return to Darien, Pedrarias had in any case invited Balboa back to discuss a new plan, and on the outskirts of the settlement, the explorer was met by Francisco Pizarro, an old friend who had accompanied him on his first crossing of the isthmus. But this was a trap: Leading one hundred soldiers, Pizarro surrounded his former friend, arrested hirn, and returned hirn to Pe­drarias, who tried him on charges of rebellion. A few days later Balboa's head fell into a basket, along with those of his most trusted followers, Years later Pizarro hirnself reached Peru, and Balboa's deeds were for­gotten."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Interpretation Most men are ruled by the heart, not the head. Their plans are vague, and when they meet obstacles they improvise. But improvisation will only bring you as far as the next crisis, and is never a substitute for thinking several steps ahead and planning to the end. Balboa had a dream of glory and wealth, and a vague plan to reach it. Ye t his bold deeds, and his discovery of the Pacific, are largely forgotten, for he committed what in the world of power is the ultimate sin: He went part way, leaving the door open for others to take over. A real man of power would have had the prudence to see the dangers in the distance­the rivals who would want to share in the conquests, the vultures that would hover once they heard the word \"gold.\" Balboa should have kept his knowledge of the Incas secret until after he had conquered Peru. Only then would his wealth, and his head, have been secure. Once Pedrarias ar­rived on the scene, a man of power and prudence would have schemed to kill or imprison hirn, and to take over the army he had brought for the conquest of Peru.

Never lose your head over a vague, open­ended dream-plan to the end. OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW In 1863 the Prussian premier Otto von Bismarck surveyed the chessboard of European power as it then stood. The main players were England, France, and Austria. Prussia itself was one of several states in the loosely allied German Federation. Austria, dominant member of the Federation, made sure that the other German states remained weak, divided and sub­missive. Bismarck believed that Prussia was destined for something far greater than servant boy to Austria. This is how Bismarck played the game. His first move was to start a war with lowly Denmark, in order to recover the former Prussian lands of Schieswig-Hoistein. He knew that these rumblings of Prussian indepen­dence might worry France and England, so he enlisted Austria in the war, claiming that he was recovering Schleswig-Hoistein for their benefit. In a few months, after the war was decided, Bismarck demanded that the newly conquered lands be made part of Prussia. The Austrians of course were furious, but they compromised: First they agreed to give the Prus­sians Schleswig, and a year later they sold them Holstein. The world began to see that Austria was weakening and that Prussia was on the rise. Bismarck's next move was his boldest: In 1866 he convinced King Wi lliam of Prussia to withdraw from the German Federation, and in doing so to go to war with Austria itself. King William's wife, his son the crown prince, and the princes of the other German kingdoms vehemently op­posed such a war. But Bismarck, undaunted, succeeded in forcing the con­flict, and Prussia's superior army defeated the Austrians in the brutally unaware of the fa ct that we should think weil before doing anything. But we are daily guilty ofnot remembering, and the eonsequenees are evil.

When the time came to let some ofthe king's blood, a silver basin was placed to catch the blood. Suddenly the surgeon became aware of the words engraved upon it: \"Never begin anything until you have rejteeted what will be the end of it. \" It was only then that he real­ized that if the plotter became king he eould have the surgeon killed instantly, and would not need to fulfill his bargain. The king, seeing that the surgeon was now trembling, asked him what was wrimg with him. And so he eonfessed the truth, at that very moment.

But Bismarck stopped them-now he presented himself as on the side of peace. The result was that he was able to conclude a treaty with Austria that granted Prussia and the other German states total autonomy. Bis­marck could now position Prussia as the dominant power in Germany and the head of a newly formed North German Confederation. The French and the English began to compare Bismarck to Attila the Hun, and to fe ar that he had designs on all of Europe. Once he had started on the path to conquest, there was no telling where he would stop. And, indeed, three years later Bismarck provoked a war with France. First he appeared to give his permission to France's annexation of Belgium, then at the last moment he changed his mind. Playing a cat-and-mouse garne, he infuriated the French emperor, Napoleon III, and stirred up his own king against the French. To no one's surprise, war broke out in 1870. The newly formed German fe deration enthusiastically joined in the war on France, and once again the Prussian military machine and its allies destroyed the enemy army in a matter of months. Although Bismarck opposed taking any French land, the generals convinced him that Alsace­Lorraine would become part of the fe deration. Now all of Europe fe ared the next move of the Prussian monster, led by Bismarck, the \"lron Chancellor.\" And in fact a year later Bismarck founded the German Empire, with the Prussian king as the newly crowned emperor and Bismarck himself a prince. But then something strange happened: Bismarck instigated no more wars. And while the other European powers grabbed up land for colonies in other continents, he se­verely limited Germany's colonial acquisitions. He did not want more land for Germany, but more security. For the rest ofhis life he struggled to maintain peace in Europe and to prevent further wars. Everybody as­sumed he had changed, mellowing with the years. They had failed to un­derstand: This was the final move of his original plan. Interpretation There is a simple reason why most men never know when to come off the attack: They form no concrete idea of their goal. Once they achieve vic­tory they only hunger for more. To stop-to aim for a goal and then keep to it-seems almost inhuman, in fact; yet nothing is more critical to the maintenance of power. The person who goes too far in his triumphs cre­ates a reaction that inevitably leads to a decline. The only solution is to plan for the long run. Foresee the future with as much clarity as the gods on Mount Olympus, who look through the clouds and see the ends of all things. From the beginning of his career in politics, Bismarck had one goal: to form an independent German state led by Prussia. He instigated the war with Denmark not to conquer territory but to stir up Prussian nation­alism and unite the country. He incited the war with Austria only to gain"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Prussian independence. (This was why he refused to grab Austrian terri­tory.) And he fo mented the war with France to unite the German king­doms against a common enemy, and thus to prepare for the formation of a united Germany. Once this was achieved, Bismarck stopped. He never let triumph go to his head, was never tempted by the siren call of more. He held the reins tightly, and whenever the generals, or the king, or the Prussian people de­manded new conquests, he held them back. Nothing would spoil the beauty of his creation, certainly not a false euphoria that pushed those around hirn to attempt to go past the end that he had so carefully planned. Expenence shows that, if one fore sees from far away the designs to be undertaken, one can act with speed when the moment comes to execute them. Cardinal Richelieu, 1585-1642 KEYS TO POWER According to the cosmology of the ancient Greeks, the gods were thought to have complete vision into the future. They saw everything to come, right down to the intricate details. Men, on the other hand, were seen as victims of fate, trapped in the moment and their emotions, unable to see beyond immediate dangers. Those heroes, such as Odysseus, who were able to look beyond the present and plan several steps ahead, seemed to defy fate, to approximate the gods in their ability to determine the future. The comparison is still valid-those among us who think further ahead and patiently bring their plans to fruition seem to have a godlike power. Because most people are too imprisoned in the moment to plan with this kind of foresight, the ability to ignore immediate dangers and plea­sures translates into power. It is the power of being able to overcome the natural human tendency to react to things as they happen, and instead to train oneself to step back, imagining the larger things taking shape beyond one's immediate vision. Most people believe that they are in fact aware of the future, that they are planning and thinking ahead. They are usually de­lu ded: What they are really doing is succumbing to their desires, to what they want the future to be. Their plans are vague, based on their imagina­tions rather than their reality. They may believe they are thinking all the way to the end, but they are really only focusing on the happy ending, and deluding themselves by the strength of their desire. In 415 B.C., the ancient Athenians attacked Sicily, believing their ex­pedition would bring them riches, power, and a glorious ending to the six­teen-year Peloponnesian War. They did not consider the dangers of an invasion so far from horne; they did not fo resee that the Sicilians would fight all the harder since the battles were in their own homeland, or that all of Athens's enemies would band together against them, or that war would break out on several fronts, stretching their forces way too thin. The Sicilian expedition was a complete dis aster, leading to the destruction LAW 29 241"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"242 LAW 29 of one of the greatest civilizations of all time. The Athenians were led into this disaster by their hearts, not their minds. They saw only the chance of glory, not the dangers that loomed in the distance. Cardinal de Retz, the seventeenth-century Frenchman who prided himself on his insights into human schemes and why they mostly fail, ana­lyzed this phenomenon. In the course of arebellion he spearheaded against the French monarchy in 1651, the young king, Louis XIV, and his court had suddenly left Paris and established themselves in a palace out­side the capital. The presence of the king so dose to the heart of the revo­lution had been a tremendous burden on the revolutionaries, and they breathed a sigh of relief. This later proved their downfall, however, since the court's absence fr om Paris gave it much more room to maneuver. \"The most ordinary cause of people's mistakes,\" Cardinal de Retz later wrote, \"is their being too much frightened at the present danger, and not enough so at that which is remote.\" The dangers that are remote, that 100m in the distance-if we can see them as they take shape, how many mistakes we avoid. How many plans we would instantly abort if we realized we were avoiding a small danger only to step into a larger one. So much of power is not what you do but what you do not do-the rash and foolish actions that you refrain fr om be­fore they get you into tr ouble. Plan in detail be fore you act-do not let vague plans lead you into trouble. Will this have unintended conse­quences? Will I stir up new enemies? Will someone else take advantage of my labors? Unhappy endings are much more common than happy ones-do not be swayed by the happy ending in your mind. The French elections of 1848 came down to a struggle between Louis­Adolphe Thiers, the man of order, and General Louis Eugene Cavaignac, the rabble-rouser of the right. When Thiers realized he was hopelessly be­hind in this high-stakes race, he searched desperately for a solution. His eye fell on Louis Bonaparte, grand-nephew ofthe great general Napoleon, and a lowly deputy in the parliament. This Bonaparte seemed a bit of an imbecile, but his name alone could get him elected in a country yearning for a strong ruler. He would be Thiers's puppet and eventually would be pushed offstage. The first part of the plan worked to perfection, and Napoleon was elected by a large margin. The problem was that Thiers had not foreseen one simple fact: This \"imbecile\" was in fact a man of enormous ambition. Three years later he dissolved parliament, dedared himself emperor, and ruled France for another eighteen years, much to the horror of Thiers and his party. The ending is everything. It is the end of the action that determines who gets the glory, the money, the prize. Your condusion must be crystal clear, and you must keep it constantly in mind. You must also figure out how to ward off the vultures circling overhead, trying to live off the car­cass of your creation.

Al­though not from a noble family, Rikyu rose to great power, becoming the preferred tea master of the Emperor Hideyoshi, and an important adviser on aesthetic and even political matters. For Rikyu, the secret of success consisted in appearing natural, concealing the effort behind one's work. One day Rikyu and his son went to an acquaintance's house for a tea ceremony. On the way in, the son remarked that the lovely antique-Iook­ing gate at their host's house gave it an evocatively lonely appearance. \"I don't think so,\" replied his father, \"it looks as though it had been brought from some mountain temple a long way off, and as if the labor required to import it must have cost a lot of money.\" If the owner of the house had put this much effort into one gate, it would show in his tea ceremony-and in­deed Sen no Rikyu had to leave the ceremony early, unable to endure the affeetation and effort it inadvertently revealed. On another evening, while having tea at a friend's house, Rikyu saw his host go outside, hold up a lantern in the darkness, cut a lernon off a tree, and bring it in. This charmed Rikyu-the host needed a relish for the dish he was serving, and had spontaneously gone outside to get one. But when the man offered the lemon with some Osaka rice cake, Rikyu realized that he had planned the cutting of the lemon all along, to go with this expensive delicacy. The ge sture no longer seemed spontaneous-it was a way for the host to prove his cleverness. He had accidentally revealed how hard he was trying. Having seen enough, Rikyu politely declined the cake, excused hirnself, and left. Emperor Hideyoshi once planned to visit Rikyu for a tea ceremony. On the night before he was to come, snow began to fall. Thinking quickly, Rikyu laid round cushions that fit exactly on each of the stepping-stones that led through the garden to his house. Just before dawn, he rose, saw that it had stopped snowing, and carefully removed the cushions. When Hideyoshi arrived, he marveled at the simple beauty of the sight-the per­fectly round stepping stones, unencumbered by snow-and noticed how it called no attention to the manner in which Rikyu had accomplished it, but only to the polite gesture itself. After Sen no Rikyu died, his ideas had a profound influence on the practice of the tea ceremony. The To kugawa shogun Yorinobu, son of the great Emperor Ieyasu, was a student of Rikyu's teachings. In his garden he had a stone lantern made by a famous master, and Lord Sakai Tadakatsu asked if he could come by one day to see it. Yo rinobu replied that he would be honored, and commanded his gardeners to put everything in order for the visit. These gardeners, unfamiliar with the precepts of Cha-no-yu, thought the stone lantern misshapen, its windows being too small for the present taste. They had a local workman enlarge the windows. A few days before Lord Sakai's visit, Yo rinobu toured the garden. When he saw the al-"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"tered windows he exploded with rage, ready to impale on his sword the fo ol who had ruined the lantem, upsetting its natural grace and destroying the whole purpose of Lord Sakai's visit. When Yo rinobu calmed down, however, he remembered that he had originally bought two of the lantems, and that the second was in his garden on the island of Kishu. At great expense, he hired a whale boat and the finest rowers he could find, ordering them to bring the lantem to hirn within two days-a difficult fe at at best. But the sailors rowed day and night, and with the luck of a good wind they arrived just in time. To Yo ri­nobu's delight, this stone lantem was more magnificent than the first, for it had stood untouched for twenty years in a bamboo thicket, acquiring a brilliant antique appearance and a delicate covering of moss. When Lord Sakai arrived, later that same day, he was awed by the lantem, which was more magnificent than he had imagined-so graceful and at one with the elements. Fortunately he had no idea what time and effort it had cost Yo ri­nobu to create this sublime effect. Interpretation To Sen no Rikyu, the sudden appearance of something naturally, almost accidentally graceful was the height of beauty. This beauty came without warning and seemed effortless. Nature created such things by its own laws and processes, but men had to create their effects through labor and con­trivance. And when they showed the effort of producing the effect, the ef­fe et was spoiled. The gate came fr om too far away, the cutting of the lemon looked contrived. You will often have to use tricks and ingenuity to create your effects­the cushions in the snow, the men rowing all night-but your audience must never suspect the work or the thinking that has gone into them. Na­ture does not reveal its tricks, and what imitates nature by appearing effort­less approximates nature's power. OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II The great escape artist Harry Houdini once advertised his aet as \"The Im­possible Possible.\" And indeed those who witnessed his dramatic escapes fe It that what he did onstage contradicted commonsense ideas of human capacity. One evening in 1904, an audience of 4,000 Londoners filled a theater to watch Houdini accept a chalienge: to escape from a pair of manacles billed as the strongest ever invented. They contained six sets of locks and nine tumbiers in each cuff; a Birmingham maker had spent five years con­structing them. Experts who examined them said they had never seen any­thing so intricate, and this intricacy was thought to make them impossible to escape. The crowd watched the experts secure the manacles on Houdini's wrists. Then the escape artist entered a black cabinet on stage. The minutes swallows over willow trees. When Masamune saw the finished work he was as overjoyed at the artist's skill as he had previously been annoyed at the appar­ent mess he was making of the screens. CHA-NO-YlJ: THE JAPANESE TEA CEREMONY A. L. SADLER, 1962 TI Ii': \\\\ HISI'LI:\\C M,\\STEH There was once a wrestling master who was versal in 360 fe ints and holds. He took a special liking tu one of his pupils, to whom he taught 359 of them over aperiod of time. Some­how he never got around tu the tast trick. As months went by the young man became so profiäent in the art that he bested everyone who dared to face him in the ring. He was so proud of his prowess that one day he boasted berore the sultan that he could readily whip his master, were it not out of respect for his age and gratitude for his tutetage. The sultan became incensed at this irre ver­ence and ordered an immediate match wäh the royal court in attendance. At the gong fhe youth barged fo rward with a tusty yell, only to be confronted with the unfamiliar 360th feint.

Then he related the lamentation of a master of archery, who taught everything he knew. \"No one has learned archery fram me, \" the poor fellow complained, \"who has not tried to use me as a butt in the end. \" A STORY OF SAADI, AS TOLD IN THE CRAFT OF POWER, R.G. H. SlU, 1979 248 LAW 30 went by; the more time passed, the more certain it seemed that these man­aeles would be the first to defeat him. At one point he emerged from the cabinet, and asked that the cuffs be temporarily removed so that he could take off his coat-it was hot inside. The challengers refused, suspecting his request was a trick to find out how the locks worked. Undeterred, and with­out using his hands, Houdini managed to lift the coat over his shoulders, turn it inside out, remove a penknife fr om his vest pocket with his teeth, and, by moving his head, cut the coat off his arms. Freed from the coat, he stepped back into the cabinet, the audience roaring with approval at his grace and dexterity. Finally, having kept the audience waiting long enough, Houdini emerged from the cabinet a second time, now with his hands free, the man­aeles raised high in triumph. To this day no one knows how he managed the escape. Although he had taken elose to an hour to fr ee himself, he had never looked concerned, had shown no sign of doubt. Indeed it seemed by the end that he had drawn out the escape as a way to heighten the drama, to make the audience worry-for there was no other sign that the perfor­mance had been anything but easy. The complaint ab out the heat was equally part of the act. The spectators of this and other Houdini perfor­mances must have fe it he was toying with them: These manaeles are noth­ing, he seemed to say, I could have freed myself a lot sooner, and from a lot worse. Over the years, Houdini escaped from the chained carcass of an em­balmed \"sea monster\" (a half octopus, half whalelike beast that had beached near Boston); he had himself sealed inside an enormous envelope from which he emerged without breaking the paper; he passed through brick walls; he wriggled free from strailjackets while dangling high in the air; he leaped from bridges into icy waters, his hands manaeled and his legs in chains; he had himself submerged in glass cases full of water, hands pad­locked, while the audience watched in amazement as he worked himself fr ee, struggling for elose to an hour apparently without breathing. Each time he seemed to court certain death yet survived with superhuman aplomb. Meanwhile, he said nothing about his methods, gave no elues as to how he accomplished any of his tricks-he left his audiences and critics speculating, his power and reputation enhanced by their struggles with the inexplicable, Perhaps the most baffling trick of all was making a ten-thou­sand-pound elephant disappear before an audience's eyes, a feat he re­peated on stage for over nineteen weeks. No one has ever really explained how he did this, for in the auditorium where he performed the trick, there was simply nowhere for an elephant to hide. The effortlessness of Houdini's escapes led some to think he used oc­cuIt forces, his superior psychic abilities giving him special control over his body. But a German escape artist named Kleppini elaimed to know Hou­dini's secret: He simply used elaborate gadgets, Kleppini also elaimed to have defeated Houdini in a handcuff challenge in Holland. Houdini did not mind all kinds of speculation floating around ab out"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"his methods, but he would not tolerate an outright lie, and in 1902 he ehal­lenged Kleppini to a handeuff duel. Kleppini aeeepted. Through a spy, he found out the seeret word to unloek a pair of Freneh eombination-loek cuffs that Houdini liked to use. His plan was to ehoose these euffs to eseape from onstage. This would definitively debunk Houdini-his \"genius\" sim­ply lay in his use of meehanieal gadgets. On the night of the ehallenge, just as Kleppini had planned, Houdini offered hirn a ehoice of euffs and he seleeted the ones with the eombination lock. He was even able to disappear with them behind a sereen to make a quick test, and reemerged seeonds later, eonfident of vietory. Aeting as if he sensed fraud, Houdini refused to loek Kleppini in the cuffs. The two men argued and began to fight, even wrestling with each other onstage. Mter a few minutes of this, an apparently angry, frustrated Houdini gave up and loeked Kleppini in the euffs. For the next few minutes Kleppini strained to get free. Something was wrong-minutes earlier he had opened the euffs behind the sereen; now the same eode no longer worked. He sweated, raeking his brains. Hours went by, the audienee left, and finally an exhausted and humiliated Kleppini gave up and asked to be released. The euffs that Kleppini hirnself had opened behind the sereen with the word \"C-L-E-F-S\" (Freneh for \"keys\") now clieked open only with the word \"F-R-A-U-D. \"Kleppini never figured out how Houdini had aecom­plished this uneanny feat. Interpretation Although we do not know for eertain how Houdini aeeomplished many of his most ingenious eseapes, one thing is clear: It was not the oeeult, or any kind of magie, that gave him his powers, but hard work and endless prae­tice, all of whieh he earefully eoneealed from the world. Houdini never left anything to ehanee-day and night he studied the workings of locks, re­searehed eenturies-old sleight-of-hand tricks, pored over books on meehan­ics, whatever he eould use. Every moment not spent researehing he spent working his body, keeping hirnself exeeptionally limber, and learning how to eontrol his muscles and his breathing. Early on in Houdini's eareer, an old Japanese performer whom he toured with taught hirn an ancient trick: how to swallow an ivory ball, then bring it baek up. He practieed this endlessly with a small peeled potato tied to a string-up and down he would manipulate the potato with his throat muscles, until they were strong enough to move it without the string. The organizers of the London handeuff challenge had searehed Houdini's body thoroughly beforehand, but no one eould cheek the inside of his throat, where he eould have eoneealed small tools to help hirn eseape. Even so, Kleppini was fundamentally wrong: It was not Houdini's tools but his prae­tiee, work, and research that made his eseapes possible. Kleppini, in fact, was eompletely outwitted by Houdini, who set the whole thing up. He let his opponent learn the eode to the Freneh euffs, Keep the extent 01 your abilities unknown. The wise man does not allow his knowledge and abilWes to be sounded to the bottom, il he desires to be honored by all. He allows you to know them but not to comprehend them. No one must know the extent 01 his abilities, lest he be disappointed. No one ever has an opportunity ollathom­ing him entirely.

Then, during the two men's tussle, the dexterous Houdini was able to change the code to ''F-R­A-U-D.\" He had spent weeks practicing this trick, but the audience saw none of the sweat and toil behind the scenes. Nor was Houdini ever ner­vous; he induced nervousness in others. (He deliberately dragged out the time it would take to escape, as a way of heightening the drama, and mak­ing the audience squirm.) His escapes from death, always graceful and easy, made hirn look like a superman. As a person of power, you must research and practice endlessly before appearing in public, onstage or anywhere else. Never expose the sweat and labor behind your poise. Some think such exposure will demonstrate their diligence and honesty, but it actually just makes them look weaker-as if anyone who practiced and worked at it could do what they had done, or as if they weren't really up to the job.

A line [01 poetryj will take us hours maybe; Yet if it does not seem a moment 's thought, Dur stitching and unstitching has been naught. Adam's eurse, William Butler Yeats, 1865-1939 KEYS TO POWER Humanity's first notions of power came fr om primitive encounters with na­ture-the flash of lightning in the sky, a sudden flood, the speed and fe roc­ity of a wild animal. These forces required no thinking, no planning-they awed us by their sudden appearance, their gracefulness, and their power over life and death. And this remains the kind of power we have always wanted to imitate. Through science and technology we have re-created the speed and sublime power of nature, but something is missing: Our ma­chines are noisy and jerky, they reveal their effort. Even the very best cre­ations of technology cannot root out our admiration for things that move easily and effortlessly. The power of children to bend us to their will comes from a kind of seductive charm that we fe el in the presence of a creature less reflective and more graceful than we are. We cannot return to such a state, but if we can create the appearance of this kind of ease, we elicit in others the kind of primitive awe that nature has always evoked in hu­·mankind. One of the first European writers to expound on this principle came from that most unnatural of environments, the Renaissance court. In 17ze Book of the Co urtier, published in 1528, Baldassare Castiglione describes the highly elaborate and codified manners of the perfect court citizen. And yet, Castiglione explains, the courtier must execute these gestures with what he calls sp re;zatura, the capacity to make the difficult seem easy. He urges the courtier to \"practice in all things a certain nonchalance which conceals all"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"artistry and makes whatever one says or does seem uncontrived and effort­less.\" We all admire the achievement of some unusual feat, but if it is ac­complished naturally and gracefully, our admiration increases tenfold­\"whereas . . . to labor at what one is doing and . . . to make bones over it, shows an extreme lack of grace and causes everything, whatever its worth, to be discounted.\" Much of the idea of sp rezzatura came from the world of art. All the great Renaissance artists carefully kept their works under wraps. Only the finished masterpiece could be shown to the public. Michelangelo forbade even popes to view his work in process. A Renaissance artist was always careful to keep his studios shut to patrons and public alike, not out of fear of imitation, but because to see the making of the works would mar the magic of their effect, and their studied atrnosphere of ease and natural beauty. The Renaissance painter Vasari, also the first great art critic, ridiculed the work of Paolo Uccello, who was obsessed with the laws of perspective. The effort Uccello spent on improving the appearance of perspective was too obvious in his work-it made his paintings ugly and labored, over­whelmed by the effort of their effects. We have the same response when we watch performers who put too much effort into their act: Seeing them try­ing so hard breaks the illusion. 1t also makes us uncomfortable. Calm, graceful performers, on the other hand, set us at ease, creating the illusion that they are not acting but being natural and themselves, even when everything they are doing involves labor and practice. The idea of sp rezzatura is relevant to all forms of power, for power depends vitallyon appearances and the illusions you create. Your public actions are like artworks: They must have visual appeal, must create antici­pation, even entertain. When you reveal the inner workings of your cre­ation, you become just one more morta1 among others. What is understandable is not awe-inspiring-we tell ourselves we could do as well if we had the money and time. Avoid the temptation of showing how clever you are-it is far more clever to conceal the mechanisms of your cleverness. Talleyrand's application of this concept to his daily life greatly en­hanced the aura of power that surrounded him. He never liked to work too hard, so he made others do the work for him-the spying, the research, the detailed analyses. With all this labor at his disposal, he hirnself never seemed to strain. When his spies revealed that a certain event was about to take place, he would talk in social conversation as if he sensed its immi­nence. The result was that people thought he was clairvoyant. His short pithy statements and witticisms always seemed to summarize a situation perfectly, but they were based on much research and thought. To those in government, including Napoleon hirnself, Talleyrand gave the impression of immense power-an effect entirely dependent on the apparent ease with which he accomplished his feats.

As long as the partial disclosure of tricks and techniques is carefully planned, rather than the result of an uncontrollable need to blab, it is the ultimate in cleverness.

The greatest limit to his author­ity came from the boyars, the Russian princely dass that dominated the country and terrorized the peasantry. In 1553, at the age of twenty-three, Ivan fell ill. Lying in bed, nearing death, he asked the boyars to swear allegiance to his son as the new czar. Some hesitated, some even refused. Then and there Ivan saw he had no power over the boyars. He recovered from his illness, but he never forgot the lesson: The boyars were out to destroy hirn. And indeed in the years to corne, many of the most powerful of them defected to Russia's main ene­mies, Poland and Lithuania, where they plotted their return and the over­throw of the czar. Even one of Ivan's dosest friends, Prince Andrey Kurbski, suddenly turned against hirn, defecting to Lithuania in 1564, and becoming the strongest of Ivan's enemies. When Kurbski began raising troops for an invasion, the royal dynasty seerned suddenly more precarious than ever. With emigre nobles foment­ing invasion from the west, Tartars bearing down from the east, and the bo­yars stirring up trouble within the country, Russia's vast size made it a nightmare to defend. In whatever direction Ivan struck, he would leave hirnself vulnerable on the other side. Only if he had ab solute power could he deal with this many-headed Hydra. And he had no such power. Ivan brooded until the morning of December 3, 1564, when the citi­zens of Moscow awoke to a strange sight. Hundreds of sleds filled the square before the Kremlin, loaded with the czar's treasures and with provi­sions for the entire court. They watched in disbelief as the czar and his court boarded the sleds and left town. Without explaining why, he estab­lished hirnself in a village south of Moscow. For an entire month a kind of terror gripped the capital, for the Muscovites fe ared that Ivan had aban­doned them to the bloodthirsty boyars. Shops closed up and riotous mobs gathered daily. Finally, on January 3 of 1565, a letter arrived from the czar, explaining that he could no longer bear the boyars' betrayals and had de­cided to abdicate once and for all. Read aloud in public, the letter had a startling effect: Merchants and commoners blamed the boyars for Ivan's decision, and took to the streets, terrifying the nobility with their fury. Soon a group of delegates represent­ing the church, the princes, and the people made the joumey to Ivan's vil­lage, and begged the czar, in the name of the holy land of Russia, to return to the throne. Ivan listened but would not change his mind. After days of hearing their pleas, however, he offered his subjects a choice: Either they grant hirn absolute powers to govern as he pleased, with no interference fr orn the boyars, or they find a new leader. Faced with a choice between civil war and the acceptance of despotie power, almost every sector of Russian society \"opted\" for a strong czar, calling for Ivan's return to Moscow and the restoration of law and order. In The German Chancel­lor Bismarck. enraged at the constant criti­cisms from Rudolf Virchow (the German pathologist ami liberal politician), had his seconds call upon the scientist to chal/enge him to a duel. \"As the challenged party, I have the choice of weapons,\" said Virchow, \"and I choose these.\" He held aloft two large and apparently identical sausages. \"One of these,\" he went on, \"is infected with deadly germs; the other is perfectly sound. Let His Excellency decide which one he wishes to eat. and I will eat the other.\" Almost immedi­ately the message came back that the chancel­lor had decided to cancel the duel.

The Russians could no longer complain if he behaved dictatorially-they had given hirn this power themselves. Interpretation Ivan the Te rrible faced a terrible dilemma: To give in to the boyars would lead to certain destruction, but civil war would bring a different kind of ruin. Even if Ivall came out of such a war on top, the country would be dev­astated and its divisions would be stronger than ever. His weapon of choice in the past had been to make a bold, offensive move. Now, however, that kind of move would turn against him-the more boldly he confronted his enemies, the worse the reactions he would spark The main weakness of a show of force is that it stirs up resentment and eventually leads to a response that eats at your authority_ Ivan, immensely creative in the use of power, saw clearly that the only path to the kind of victory he wanted was a false withdrawal. He would not force the country over to his position, he would give it \"options\": either his abdication, and certain anarchy, or his accession to ab solute power. To back up his move, he made it clear that he preferred to abdicate: \"Call my bluff,\" he said, \"and watch what happens.\" No one called his bluff. By withdrawing for just a month, he showed the country a glimpse of the nightmares that would follow his abdication-Tartar invasions, civil war, ruin. (All of these did eventually come to pass after Ivan's death, in the infamous \"Time of the Tr oubles.\") Withdrawal and disappearance are classic ways of controlling the op­tions. Yo u give people a sense ofhow things will fall apart without you, and you offer them a \"choice\": I stay away and you suffer the consequences, or I return under circumstances that I dictate. In this method of controlling people's options, they choose the option that gives you power because the alternative is just too unpleasant. Yo u force their hand, but indirectly: They seem to have a choice. Whenever people feel they have a choice, they walk into your trap that much more easily. OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 11 As a seventeenth-century French courtesan, Ninon de Lenclos found that her life had certain pleasures. Her lovers came from royalty and aristoc­racy, and they paid her well, entertained her with their wit and intellect, satisfied her rather demanding sensual needs, and treated her almost as an equal. Such a life was infinitely preferable to marriage. In 1643, however, Ninon's mother died suddenly, leaving her, at the age of twenty-three, to­tally alone in the world-no family, no dowry, nothing to fall back upon. A kind of panic overtook her and she entered a convent, turning her back on her illustrious lovers. A year later she left the convent and moved to Lyons. When she finally reappeared in Paris, in 1648, lovers and suitors flocked to her dOOf in greater numbers than ever before, for she was the wittiest and"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"most spirited courtesan of the time and her presence had been greatly missed. Ninon's foHowers quickly discovered, however, that she had changed her old way of doing things, and had set up a new system of options. The dukes, seigneurs, and princes who wanted to pay for her services could continue to do so, but they were no longer in control-she would sleep with them when she wanted, according to her whim. All their money bought them was a possibility. If it was her pleasure to sleep with them only onee a month, so be it. Those who did not want to be what Ninon called a payeur could join the large and growing group of men she caHed her martyr.f-men who vis­ited her apartment principally for her friendship, her biting wit, her lute­playing, and the company of the most vibrant minds of the period, including Moliere, La Rochefoucauld, and Saint-Evremond. The martyrs, too, however, entertained a possibility: She would regularly select from them a fa vori, a man who would become her lover without having to pay, and to whom she would aban don herself completely for as long as she so desired-a week, a few months, rarely longer. A payeur could not become a fovori, but a martyr had no guarantee of becoming one, and indeed could remain disappointed for an entire lifetime. The poet Charleval, for exam­pIe, never enjoyed Ninon's favors, but never stopped coming to visit-he did not want to do without her company. As word of this system reached polite French society, Ninon became the object of intense hostility. Her reversal of the position of the courtesan scandalized the queen mother and her court. Much to their horror, how­ever, it did not dis courage her male suitors-indeed it only increased their numbers and intensified their desire. It became an honor to be a payeur, helping Ninon to maintain her lifestyle and her glittering salon, accompa­nying her sometimes to the theater, and sleeping with her when she chose. Even more distinguished were the martyrs, enjoying her company without paying for it and maintaining the hope, however remote, of some day be­coming her fa vori. That possibility spurred on many a young nobleman, as word spread that none among the courtesans eould surpass Ninon in the art of love. And so the married and the single, the old and the young, en­tered her web and chose one of the two options presented to them, both of which amply satisfied her. Interpretation The life of the courtesan entailed the possibility of apower that was denied a married woman, but it also had obvious perils. The man who paid for the courtesan's services in essence owned her, determining when he could pos­sess her and when, later on, he would abandon her. As she grew older, her options narrowed, as fewer men chose her. To avoid a life of poverty she had to amass her fortune while she was young. The courtesan's legendary greed, then, reflected a practical necessity, yet also lessened her aHure, sinee the illusion of being desired is important to men, who are often alien-dered. \"Surely you remember? You owe me a pot ofgold, and 1 have come to collect it. \" \"You are aperfeet har, sir!\" exclaimed the king. \"1 owe you no money!\" \"A perfe ct liar, am I?\" said the poor man. \"Then give me the golden apple!\" The king, realizing that the man was trying to trick him, started to hedge. \"No, not Yo u are not a liarf\" \"Then give me the pot of gold you owe me, sire, \" said the man.

Eil., 1985 258 LAW 31 ated if their partner is too interested in their money. As the courtesan aged, then, she faced a most difficult fate. Ninon de Lenclos had a horror of any kind of dependence. She early on tasted a kind of equality with her lovers, and she would not settle into a system that left her such distasteful options. Strangely enough, the system she devised in its place seemed to satisfy her suitors as much as it did her. The payeurs may have had to pay, but the fact that Ninon would only sleep with them when she wanted to gave them a thrill unavailable with every other courtesan: She was yielding out of her own desire. The martyrs' avoidance of the taint of having to pay gave them a sense of superiority; as members of Ninon's fraternity of admirers, they also might some day expe­rience the ultimate pleasure of being her favori. Finally, Ninon did not force her suitors into either category. They could \"choose\" which side they preferred-a freedom that left them a vestige of masculine pride. Such is the power of giving people a choice, or rather the illusion of one, for they are playing with cards you have dealt them. Where the alter­natives set up by Ivan the Te rrible involved a certain risk-one option would have led to his losing his power-Ninon created a situation in which every option redounded to her favor. From the payeurs she received the money she needed to run her salon. And fr om the martyrs she gained the ultimate in power: She could surround herself with a bevy of admirers, a harem from which to choose her lovers. The system, though, depended on one critical factor: the possibility, however remote, that a martyr could become a favori. The illusion that riches, glory, or sensual satisfaction may someday fall into your victim's lap is an irresistible carrot to include in your list of choices. That hope, how­ever slim, will make men accept the most ridiculous situations, because it leaves them the all-important option of a dream. The illusion of choice, married to the possibility of future good fo rtune, will lure the most stub­born sucker into your glittering web. KEYS TO POWER Words like \"freedom,\" \"options,\" and \"choice\" evoke apower of possibility far beyond the reality of the benefits they entail. When examined closely, the choices we have-in the marketplace, in elections, in our jobs-tend to have noticeable limitations: They are often a matter of a choice simply be­tween A and B, with the rest of the alphabet out of the pieture. Ye t as long as the faintest mirage of choice flickers on, we rarely focus on the missing options. We \"choose\" to believe that the game is fair, and that we have our freedom. We prefer not to think too much about the depth of our liberty to choose. This unwillingness to probe the smallness of our choices sterns from the fact that too much freedom creates a kind of anxiety. The phrase \"un­limited options\" sounds infinitely promising, but unlimited options would actually paralyze us and cloud our ability to choose. Our limited range of choices comforts uso"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"This supplies the clever and cunning with enormous opportunities for deception. For people who are choosing between alternatives find it hard to believe they are being manipulated or deceived; they cannot see that you are allowing them a small amount of free will in exchange for a much more powerful imposition of your own will. Setting up a narrow range of ch oices, then, should always be a part of your deceptions. There is a say­ing: If you can get the bird to walk into the cage on its own, it will sing that much more prettily. The following are among the most common forms of \"controlling the options\": Color the Choices. This was a favored technique of Henry Kissinger. As President Richard Nixon's secretary of state, Kissinger considered hirnself better informed than his boss, and believed that in most situations he could make the best decision on his own. But if he tried to determine policy, he would offend or perhaps enrage a notoriously insecure man. So Kissinger would propose three or four choices of action for each situation, and would present them in such a way that the one he preferred always seemed the best solution compared to the others. Time after time, Nixon fe ll for the bait, never suspecting that he was moving where Kissinger pushed hirn. This is an excellent device to use on the insecure master. Force the Resister. One of the main problems faced by Dr. Milton H. Er­ickson, a pioneer of hypnosis therapy in the 1950s, was the relapse. His pa­tients might seem to be recovering rapidly, but their apparent susceptibility to the therapy masked a deep resistance: They would soon relapse into old habits, blame the doctor, and stop coming to see hirn. To avoid this, Erick­son began ordering some patients to have a relapse, to make themselves feel as bad as when they first came in-to go back to square one. Faced with this option, the patients would usually \"choose\" to avoid the relapse­which, of course, was what Erickson really wanted. This is a good technique to use on children and other willful people who enjoy doing the opposite of what you ask them to: Push them to \"choose\" what you want them to do by appearing to advocate the opposite. Alter the Playing Field. In the 1860s, John D. Rockefeller set out to cre­ate an oil monopoly. If he tried to buy up the smaller oil companies they would figure out what he was doing and fight back. Instead, he began se­cretly buying up the railway companies that transported the oil. When he then attempted to take over a particular company, and met with resistance, he reminded them of their dependence on the rails. Refusing them ship­ping, or simply raising their fees, could ruin their business. Rockefeller al­tered the playing field so that the only options the small oil producers had were the ones he gave them. In this tactic your opponents know their hand is being forced, but it doesn't matter. The technique is effective against those who resist at all costs. LAW 31 259"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"260 LAW 31 The Shrinking Options. The late-nineteenth-century art dealer Am­broise Vo llard perfected this technique. Customers would come to Vo llard's shop to see some Cezannes. He would show three paintings, neglect to mention a price, and pretend to doze off. The visitors would have to leave without deciding. They would usually come back the next day to see the paintings again, but this time Vo llard would pull out less interesting works, pretending he thought they were the same ones. The baffled customers would look at the new offer­ings, leave to think them over, and return yet again. Once again the same thing would happen: Vo llard would show paintings of lesser quality still. Fi­nally the buyers would realize they had better grab what he was showing them, because tomorrow they would have to settle far something worse, perhaps at even higher prices. A variation on this technique is to raise the price every time the buyer hesitates and another day goes by. This is an excellent negotiating ploy to use on the chronically indecisive, who will fall for the idea that they are get­ting a better deal today than if they wait till tomorrow. The Weak Man on the Precipice. The weak are the easiest to maneuver by controlling their options. Cardinal de Retz, the great seventeenth-cen­tury provocateur, served as an unofficial assistant to the Duke of Orleans, who was notoriously indecisive. It was a constant struggle to convince the duke to take action-he would hem and haw, weigh the options, and wait till the last moment, giving everyone around hirn an ulcer. But Retz discov­ered a way to handle hirn: He would describe all sorts of dangers, exagger­ating them as much as possible, until the duke saw a yawning abyss in every direction except one: the one Retz was pushing hirn to take. This tactic is similar to \"Color the Choices,\" but with the weak you have to be more aggressive. Work on their emotions-use fear and terror to propel them into action. Tr y reason and they will always find a way to procrastinate. Brothers in Crime. This is a classic con-artist technique: Yo u attract YOUf victims to same criminal scheme, creating a bond of blood and guilt be­tween you. They participate in your deception, commit a crime (or think they do-see the story of Sam Geezil in Law 3), and are easily manipu­lated. Serge Stavisky, the great French con artist of the 1920s, so entangled the government in his scams and swindles that the state did not dare to prosecute hirn, and \"chose\" to leave hirn alone. It is often wise to implicate in your deceptions the very person who can do you the most harm if you fail. Their involvement can be subtle--even a hint of their involvement will narrow their options and buy their silence. The Horns of a Dilemma. This idea was demonstrated by General William Sherman's infamous march through Georgia during the American Civil War. Although the Confederates knew what direction Sherman was"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"heading in, they never knew if he would attack from the left or the right, for he divided his army into two wings---and if the rebels retreated from one wing they found themselves facing the other. This is a classic trial lawyer's technique: The lawyer leads the witnesses to decide between two possible explanations of an event, both of which poke a hole in their story. They have to answer the lawyer's questions, but whatever they say they hurt themselves. The key to this move is to strike quickly: Deny the victim the time to think of an escape. As they wriggle between the horns of the dilemma, they dig their own grave. Understand: In your struggles with your rivals, it will often be necessary for you to hurt them. And if you are clearly the agent of their punishment, expect a counterattack-expect revenge. If, however, they seem to them­selves to be the agents of their own misfortune, they will submit quietly. When Ivan left Moscow for his rural village, the citizens asking hirn to re­turn agreed to his demand for absolute power. Over the years to come, they resented hirn less for the terror he unleashed on the country, because, after all, they had granted hirn his power themselves. This is why it is al­ways good to allow your victims their choice of poison, and to cloak your involvement in providing it to them as far as possible. Image: The Horns of the Bull.

The tactic works best, then, for those whose power is fragile, and who cannot operate too openly without incur­ring suspicion, resentment, and anger. Even as a general rule, however, it is rarely wise to be seen as exerting power directly and forcefully, no matter how secure or strong you are. 1t is usually more elegant and more effective to give people the illusion of choice. On the other hand, by limiting other people's options you sometimes limit your OWll. There are situations in which it is to your advantage to allow your rivals a large degree of freedom: As you watch them operate, you give yourself rich opportunities to spy, gather information, and plan your deceptions. The nineteenth-century banker James Rothschild liked this method: He feIt that if he tried to control his opponents' movements, he lost the chance to observe their strategy and plan a more effe ctive course.

In the Middle Ages and High Re­naissance, its virtual monopoly on trade to the east made it the wealthiest city in Europe. Under a beneficent republican government, Venetians en­joyed liberties that few other Italians had ever known. Yet in the sixteenth century their fortunes suddenly changed. The opening of the New World transferred power to the Atlantic side of Europe-to the Spanish and Por­tuguese, and later the Dutch and English. Venice could not compete eco­nomically and its empire gradually dwindled. The final blow was the devastating loss of a prized Mediterranean possession, the island of Cyprus, captured fr om Venice by the Turks in 1570. Now noble families went broke in Venice, and banks began to fold. A kind of gloom and depression settled over the citizens. They had known a glittering past-had either lived through it or heard stories about it frorn their elders. The closeness of the glory years was humiliating. The Vene­tians half believed that the goddess Fortune was only playing a joke on them, and that the old days would soon return. For the time being, though, what could they do? In 1589 rumors began to swirl around Venice of the arrival not far away of a mysterious man called \"11 Bragadino,\" a master of alchemy, a man who had won incredible wealth through his ability, it was said, to mul­tiply gold through the use of a secret substance. The rumor spread quickly because a few years earlier, a Venetian nobleman passing through Poland had heard a leamed man prophesy that Venice would recover her past glory and power if she could find a man who understood the alchemic art of manufacturing gold. And so, as word reached Venice of the gold this Bragadino possessed-he clinked gold coins continuously in his hands, and golden objects filled his palace-some began to dream: Through hirn, their city would prosper again. Members of Venice's most important noble families accordingly went together to Brescia, where Bragadino lived. They toured his palace and watched in awe as he demonstrated his gold-making abilities, taking a pinch of seemingly worthless minerals and transforming it into several ounces of gold dust. The Venetian senate prepared to debate the idea of ex­tending an official invitation to Bragadino to stay in Venice at the city's ex­pense, when word suddenly reached them that they were competing with the Duke of Mantua for bis services. They heard of a magnificent party in Bragadino's palace for the duke, featuring garments with golden buttons, gold watches, gold plates, and on and on. Worried they might lose Bra­gadino to Mantua, the senate voted almost unanimously to invite hirn to Venice, promising him the mountain of money he would need to continue living in his luxurious style-but only if he came right away. Late that year the mysterious Bragadino arrived in Venice. With his piercing dark eyes under thick brows, and the two enormous black mastiffs that accompanied him everywhere, he was forbidding and impressive. He took up residence in a sumptuous palace on the island of the Giudecca,"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"with the republic funding his banquets, his expensive clothes, and all his other whims. A kind of alchemy fever spread through Venice. On street corners, hawkers would sell coal, distilling apparatus, bellows, how-to books on the subject. Everyone began to practice alchemy-everyone ex­cept Bragadino. The alchemist seemed to be in no hurry to begin manufacturing the gold that would save Venice from ruin. Strangely enough this only in­creased his popularity and following; people thronged from all over Eu­rope, even Asia, to meet this remarkable man. Months went by, with gifts pouring in to Bragadino from all sides. Still he gave no sign of the miracle that the Venetians confidently expected hirn to produce. Eventually the cit­izens began to grow impatient, wondering if he would wait forever. At first the senators warned them not to hurry hirn-he was a capricious devil, who needed to be cajoled. Finally, though, the nobility began to wonder too, and the senate came under pressure to showareturn on the city's bal­looning investment. Bragadino had only scorn for the doubters, but he responded to them. He had, he said, already deposited in the city's mint the mysterious sub­stance with which he multiplied gold. He could use this substance up all at once, and produce double the gold, but the more slowly the process took place, the more it would yield. If left alone for seven years, sealed in a cas­ket, the substance would multiply the gold in the mint thirty times over. Most of the senators agreed to wait to reap the gold mine Bragadino promised. Others, however, were angry: seven more years of this man liv­ing royally at the public trough! And many of the common citizens of Venice echoed these sentiments. Finally the alchemist's enemies demanded he produce a proof of his skills: a substantial amount of gold, and soon. Lofty, apparently devoted to his art, Bragadino responded that Venice, in its impatience, had betrayed hirn, and would therefore lose his services. He left town, going first to nearby Padua, then, in 1590, to Munich, at the invitation of the Duke of Bavaria, who, like the entire city of Venice, had known great wealth but had fallen into bankruptcy through his own profli­gacy, and hoped to regain his fortune through the famous alchemist's ser­vices. And so Bragadino resumed the comfortable arrangement he had known in Venice, and the same pattern repeated itself. Interpretation The young Cypriot Mamugna had lived in Venice for several years before reincarnating hirnself as the alchemist Bragadino. He saw how gloom had settled on the city, how everyone was hoping for a redemption from some indefinite source. While other charlatans mastered everyday cons based on sleight of hand, Mamugna mastered human nature. With Venice as his tar­get from the start, he traveled abroad, made some money through his alchemy scams, and then returned to Italy, setting up shop in Brescia. There he created areputation that he knew would spread to Venice. From a distance, in fact, his aura of power would be all the more impressive. At first Mamugna did not use vulgar demonstrations to convince peo-fo rmerly strangled his wife and son. A courtier thought fit to inform the bereaved monarch, and even affirmed that he had seen the stag laugh.

And these established the cyde that kept him going: His ob­vious wealth confirmed his reputation as an alchemist, so that patrons like the Duke of Mantua gave him money, which allowed him to live in wealth, which reinforced his reputation as an alchemist, and so on. Only once this reputation was established, and dukes and senators were fighting over hirn, did he resort to the trifling necessity of a demonstration. By then, however, people were easy to deceive: They wanted to believe. The Ve netian sena­tors who watched him multiply gold wanted to believe so badly that they failed to notice the glass pipe up his sleeve, fr om which he slipped gold dust into his pinches of minerals. Brilliant and capricious, he was the al­chemist of their fantasies-and once he had created an aura like this, no one noticed his simple deceptions. Such is the power of the fantasies that take root in us, especially in times of scarcity and dedine. Pe ople rarely believe that their problems arise fr om their own misdeeds and stupidity. Someone or something out there is to blarne-the other, the world, the gods-and so salvation comes fr om the outside as weH. Had Bragadino arrived in Ve nice armed with a detailed analysis of the reasons behind the city's economic dedine, and of the hard-nosed steps that it could take to turn things around, he would have been scomed. The reality was too ugly and the solution too painful­mostly the kind of hard work that the citizens' ancestors had mustered to create an empire. Fantasy, on the other hand-in this case the romance of alchemy-was easy to understand and infinitely more palatable. To gain power, you must be a source of pleasure for those around you-and pleasure comes from playing to people's fantasies. Never promise a gradual improvement through hard work; rather, promise the mo on, the great and sudden transformation, the pot of gold. No man need despair of gaining converts to the most extravagant hypothesis who has art enough to represent it in favorable colors, DavidHume, 1711-1776 KEYS TO POWER Fantasy can never operate alone. It requires the backdrop of the humdrum and the mundane. It is the oppressiveness of reality that allows fantasy to take root and bloom. In sixteenth-century Ve nice, the reality was one of de­dine and loss of prestige. The corresponding fantasy described a sudden recovery of past glories through the miracle of alchemy. While the reality only got worse, the Ve netians inhabited a happy dream world in which their city restored its fabulous wealth and power ovemight, tuming dust into gold.

Never be distracted by people's glamorous portraits of themselves and their lives; search and dig far what really imprisons them. Once you find that, you have the magical key that will put great power in your hands. Although times and people change, let us examine a few of the oppres­sive realities that endure, and the opportunities for power they provide: TM Reality: Ch ange is slow and gradual. It requires hard work, a bit o[ luck, a [a ir amount o[ selfsacrifice, and a lot p[patience. The Fa ntasy: A sudden transformation will bring a total ch ange in one's fortunes, bypassing work, luck, selfsacrifice, and time in one [a ntastic stroke. This is of course the fantasy par excellence of the charlatans who prowl among us to this day, and was the key to Bragadino's success. Promise a great and total change-from poor to rich, sickness to health, misery to ecstasy-and you will have followers. How did the great sixteenth-century German quack Leonhard Thumeisser become the court physician for the Elector of Brandenburg without ever studying medicine? Instead of offering amputations, leeches, and foul-tasting purgatives (the medicaments of the time), Thumeisser of­fered sweet-tasting elixirs and promised instant recovery. Fashionable courtiers especially wanted his solution of \"drinkable gold,\" which cost a fortune. If so me inexplicable illness assailed you, Thumeisser would con­sult a horoscope and prescribe a talisman. Who could resist such a fantasy-health and well-being without sacrifice and pain! The Reality: The social realm has hard-set codes and boundaries. We understand these limits and know that we have to move within the same [a miliar circles, day in and day out. The Fa ntasy: We can enter a totally new world with different codes and the promise o[ adventure. In the early 1700s, all London was abuzz with talk of a mysterious stranger, a young man named George Psalmanazar. He had arrived from what was to most Englishmen a fantastical land: the island of Formosa (now Taiwan), off the coast of China. Oxford University engaged Psalmanazar to teach the island's language; a few years later he translated the Bible into Formosan, then wrote a book-an immediate best-seIler-on Formosa's history and geography. English royalty wined and dined the young man, and everywhere he went he entertained his hosts with won­drous stories of his homeland, and its bizarre customs. After Psalmanazar died, however, his will revealed that he was in fact merely a Frenchman with a rich imagination. Everything he had said about Formosa-its alphabet, its language, its literature, its entire culture-he had invented. He had built on the English public's ignorance of the place to concoct an elaborate story that fulfilled their desire for the exotic and LAW 32 267"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"268 LAW 32 strange. British culture's rigid control of people's dangerous dreams gave hirn the perfect opportunity to exploit their fantasy. The fantasy of the exotic, of course, can also skirt the sexual. It must not come too elose, though, for the physical hinders the power of fantasy; it can be seen, grasped, and then tired of-the fate of most courtesans. The bodily charms of the mistress only whet the master's appetite for more and different pleasures, a new beauty to adore. To bring power, fantasy must re­main to some degree unrealized, literally unreal. The dancer Mata Hari, for instance, who rose to public prominence in Paris before World War I, had quite ordinary looks. Her power came from the fantasy she created of being strange 'and exotic, unknowable and indedpherable, The taboo she worked with was less sex itself than the breaking of sodal codes. Another form of the fantasy of the exotic is simply the hope for relief from boredom. Con artists love to play on the oppressiveness of the work­ing world, its lack of adventure. Their cons might involve, say, the recov­ery of lost Spanish treasure, with the possible partidpation of an alluring Mexican seiiorita and a connection to the president of a South American country-anything offering release from the humdrum. Th e Reality: Society is frag;mented and foll of conflict. The Fa ntasy: Pe op le can come together in a mystical union of souls. In the 1920s the con man Oscar Hartzell made a quick fortune out of the age-old Sir Frands Drake swindle-basically promising any sucker who happened to be surnamed \"Drake\" a substantial share of the long-lost \"Drake treasure,\" to which Hartzell had access. Thousands across the Mid­west fell for the scam, which Hartzell eleverly turned into a crusade against the government and everyone else who was trying to keep the Drake fo r­tune out of the rightful hands of its heirs. There developed a mystical union of the oppressed Drakes, with emotional rallies and meetings. Promise such a union and you can gain much power, but it is a dangerous power that can easily turn against you. This is a fantasy for demagogues to play on. The Reality: Death. The dead ca nnot be brought back, the past ca nnot be ch anged. The Fa ntasy: A sudden reversal of this intolerable fa ct. This con has many variations, but requires great skill and subtlety. The beauty and importance of the art of Ve rmeer have long been rec­ognized, but his paintings are small in number, and are extremely rare. In the 1930s, though, Ve rmeers began to appear on the art market. Experts were called on to verify them, and pronounced them real. Po s session of these new Ve rmeers would crown a collector's career. It was like the resur­rection of Lazarus: In a strange way, Ve rmeer had been brought back to life. The past had been changed. Only later did it come out that the new Ve rmeers were the work of a middle-aged Dutch fo rger named Han van Meegeren. And he had chosen"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Ve rmeer for his scam because he understood fantasy: The paintings would seem real precisely because the public, and the experts as weIl, so desper­ately wanted to believe they were. Remember: The key to fantasy is distance. The distant has allure and promise, seems simple and problem free. What you are offering, then, should be ungraspable. Never let it become oppressively familiar; it is the mirage in the distance, withdrawing as the sucker approaches. Never be too direct in describing the fantasy-keep it vague. As a forger of fantasies, let your victim come elose enough to see and be tempted, but keep hirn far away enough that he stays dreaming and desiring. Image: The Moon. Unattainable, always changing shape, disappearing and reappear­ing. We look at it, imagine, wonder, and pine-never fa­miliar, continuous provoker of dreams. Do not offe r the obvious .

Tr uth is cold, sober fact, not so comfortable to absorb. A lie is more palatable. The most detested person in the world is the one who always teIls the truth, who never romances. . . .

Fantasy usually contains an element of play-the public half real­izes it is being duped, but it keeps the dream alive anyway, relishing the en­tertainment and the temporary diversion from the everyday that you are providing. So keep it light-never come too elose to the place where you are actually expected to produce results. That place may prove extremely hazardous. After Bragadino established hirnself in Munieh, he found that the sober-minded Bavarians had far less faith in alchemy than the tempera­mental Venetians. Only the duke really believed in it, for he needed it des­perately to rescue him from the hopeless mess he was in. As Bragadino played his familiar waiting game, accepting gifts and expecting patience, the public grew angry. Money was being spent and was yielding no results. In 1592 the Bavarians demanded justice, and eventually Bragadino found hirnself swinging from the gallows. As before, he had promised and had not delivered, but this time he had misjudged the forbearance of his hosts, and his inability to fulfill their fantasy proved fatal. One last thing: Never make the mistake of imagining that fantasy is al­ways fantastical. It certainly contrasts with reality, but reality itself is some­times so theatrical and stylized that fantasy be comes adesire for simple things. The image Abraham Lincoln created of hirnself, for example, as a homespun country lawyer with a beard, made him the common man's president. P. T. Barnum created a successful act with Tom Thumb, a dwarf who dressed up as famous leaders of the past, such as Napoleon, and lam­pooned them wickedly. The show delighted everyone, right up to Queen Victoria, by appealing to the fantasy of the time: Enough of the vain­glorious rulers of history, the common man knows best. Tom Thumb re­versed the familiar pattern of fantasy in which the strange and unknown be comes the ideal. But the act still obeyed the Law, for underlying it was the fantasy that the simple man is without problems, and is happier than the powerful and the rich. Both Lincoln and Tom Thumb played the commoner but carefully maintained their distance. Should you play with such a fantasy, you too must carefully cultivate distance and not allow your \"common\" persona to become too familiar or it will not project as fantasy."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"LAW 33 DISCOVER EACH MAN'S THUMBSCREW JUDGMENT Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall.

We would like no thing more than to be left to do things our own way. Con­stantly butting up against these resistances will cost you a lot of energy. One of the most important things to realize about people, though, is that they all have a weakness, some part of their psychological arrnor that will not resist, that will bend to your will if you find it and push on it. Some peo­pIe wear their weaknesses openly, others disguise them. Those who dis­guise them are often the ones most effectively undone through that one chink in their arrnor. In planning YOUf assault, keep these principles in mi nd: Pay Attention to Gestures and Unconscious Signals. As Sigmund Freud remarked, \"No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent, he chat­ters with his fingertips; betrayal oozes out of hirn at every pore.\" This is a critical concept in the search for a person's weakness-it is revealed by seemingly unimportant ge stures and passing words. The key is not only what you look for but where and how you look. Everyday conversation supplies the richest mine of weaknesses, so train yourself to listen. Start by always seeming interested-the appearance of a sympathetic ear will SpUf anyone to talk. A clever trick, often used by the nineteenth-century French statesman Talleyrand, is to appear to open up to the other person, to share a secret with them. It can be completely made up, or it can be real but of no great importance to you-the important thing is that it should seern to come from the heart. This will usually elicit a response that is not only as frank as Y0ufS but more genuine--a response that reveals a weakness. If you suspect that someone has a particular soft spot, probe for it indi­rectly. If, for instance, you sense that a man has a need to be loved, openly flatter him. If he laps up Y0uf compliments, no matter how obvious, you are on the right track. Train Y0uf eye for details-how someone tips a waiter, what delights aperson, the hidden messages in clothes. Find peo­ple's idols, the things they worship and will do anything to get-perhaps you can be the supplier of their fantasies. Remember: Since we all try to hide Ouf weaknesses, there is little to be learned from Ouf conscious behav­ior. What oozes out in the little things outside Ouf conscious control is what you want to know. Find the Helpless Child. Most weaknesses begin in childhood, before the self builds up compensatory defenses. Perhaps the child was pampered or indulged in a particular area, or perhaps a certain emotional need went unfulfilled; as he or she grows older, the indulgence or the deficiency may be buried but never disappears. Knowing about a childhood need gives you a powerful key to a person's weakness. One sign of this weakness is that when you touch on it the person will often act like a child, Be on the lookout, then, for any behavior that should"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"have been outgrown. If your victims or rivals went without something im­portant, such as parental support, when they were children, supply it, or its facsimile. If they reveal a secret taste, a hidden indulgence, indulge it. In ei­ther case they will be unable to resist you. Look for Contrasts. An overt trait often conceals its opposite. People wh o thump their chests are often big cowards; a prudish exterior may hide a lascivious soul; the uptight are often screaming for adventure; the shy are dying for attention. By probing beyond appearances, you will often find people's weaknesses in the opposite of the qualities they reveal to you. Find the Weak Link. Sometimes in your search for weaknesses it is not wh at but who that matters. In today's versions of the court, there is often someone behind the scenes who has a great deal of power, a tremendous influence over the person superficially on top. These behind-the-scenes powerbrokers are the group's weak link: Win their favor and you indirectly influence the king. Altematively, even in a group of people acting with the appearance of one will-as when a group und er attack closes ranks to resist an outsider-there is always a weak link in the chain. Find the one person who will bend under pressure. Fill the Void. The two main emotional voids to fill are insecurity and un­happiness. The insecure are suckers for any kind of social validation; as for the chronically unhappy, look for the roots of their unhappiness. The inse-­eure and the unhappy are the people least able to disguise their weak­nesses. The ability to fill their emotional voids is a great source of power, and an indefinitely prolongable one. Feed on Uncontrollable Emotions. The uncontrollable emotion can be a paranoid fear-a fear disproportionate to the situation-or any base mo­tive such as lust, greed, vanity, or hatred. People in the grip of these emo­tions often cannot control themselves, and you can do the controlling for them. OBSERVANCES OF THE LAW Observance I In 1615 the thirty-year-old bishop ofLU/;:on, later known as Cardinal Riche­Heu, gave a speech before representatives of the three estates of France­clergy, nobility, and commoners. Richelieu had been chosen to serve as the mouthpiece for the clergy-an immense responsibility for a man still young and not particularly well known. On all of the important issues of the day, the speech followed the Church line. But near the end of it Riche­Heu did something that had nothing to do with the Church and everything to do with his career. He tumed to the throne of the fifteen-year-old King Louis XIII, and to the Qu een Mother Marie de' Medicis, who sat beside Then what did his dear friend do?

GARSON KANIN. 1974 274 LAW 33 Louis, as the regent ruling France until her son reached his ma jority, Every­one expected Richelieu to say the usual kind words to the young king. In­stead, however, he looked directly at and only at the queen mother. Indeed his speech ended in long and fulsome praise of her, praise so glowing that it actually offended some in the Church. But the smile on the queen's face as she lapped up Richelieu's compliments was unforgettable. A year later the queen mother appointed Richelieu secretary of state for foreign affairs, an incredible coup for the young bishop. He had now entered the inner cirele of power, and he studied the workings of the court as if it were the machinery of a watch. An Italian, Concino Concini, was the queen mother's favorite, or rather her lover, a role that made hirn per­haps the most powerful man in France. Concini was vain and foppish, and Richelieu played him perfectly-attending to him as if he were the king. Within months Richelieu had become one of Concini's favorites. But something happened in 1617 that turned everything upside down: the young king, who up until then had shown every sign of being an idiot, had Concini murdered and his most important associates imprisoned, In so doing Louis took command of the country with one blow, sweeping the queen mother aside. Had Richelieu played it wrong? He had been elose to both Concini and Marie de Medicis, whose advisers and ministers were now all out of favor, some even arrested. The queen mother herself was shut up in the Louvre, a virtual prisoner. Richelieu wasted no time. If everyone was de­serting Marie de Medicis, he would stand by her. He knew Louis could not get rid of her, for the king was still very young, and had in any case always been inordinately attached to her. As Marie's only remaining powerful friend, Richelieu filled the valuable function of liaison between the king and his mother. In return he received her protection, and was able to sur­vive the palace coup, even to thrive. Over the next few years the queen mother grew still more dependent on hirn, and in 1622 she repaid hirn for his loyalty: Through the intercession of her allies in Rome, Richelieu was elevated to the powerful rank of cardinal. By 1623 King Louis was in trouble. He had no one he could trust to advise hirn, and although he was now a young man instead of a boy, he re­mained childish in spirit, and affairs of state came hard to hirn. Now that he had taken the throne, Marie was no longer the regent and theoretically had no power, but she still had her son's ear, and she kept telling him that Richelieu was his only possible savior. At first Louis would have none of it-he hated the cardinal with a passion, only tolerating him out of love for Marie. In the end, however, isolated in the court and crippled by his own indecisiveness, he yielded to his mother and made Richelieu first his chief councilor and later prime minister. Now Richelieu no longer needed Marie de Medicis. He stopped visit­ing and courting her, stopped listening to her opinions, even argued with her and opposed her wishes. Instead he concentrated on the king, making himself indispensable to his new master. All the previous premiers, under­standing the king's childishness, had tried to keep him out of trouble; the"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"shrewd Richelieu played hirn differently, deliberately pushing hirn into one ambitious project after another, such as a crusade against the Huguenots and finally an extended war with Spain. The immensity of these projects only made the king more dependent on his powerful pre­mier, the only man able to keep order in the realm. And so, for the next eighteen years, Richelieu, exploiting the king's weaknesses, govemed and molded France according to his own vision, unifying the country and mak­ing it a strong European power for centuries to come. Interpretation Richelieu saw everything as a military campaign, and no strategie move was more important to hirn than discovering his enemy's weaknesses and applying pressure to them. As early as his speech in 1615, he was looking for the weak link in the chain of power, and he saw that it was the queen mother. Not that Marie was obviously weak-she govemed both France and her son; but Richelieu saw that she was really an insecure woman who needed constant masculine attention. He showered her with affection and respect, even toadying up to her favorite, Concini. He knew the day would come when the king would take over, but he also recognized that Louis loved his mother dearly and would always remain a child in relation to her. The way to control Louis, then, was not by gaining his favor, which could change ovemight, but by gaining sway over his mother, for whom his af­fection would never change. Once Richelieu had the position he desired-prime minister-he dis­carded the queen mother, moving on to the next weak link in the chain: the king's own character. There was apart of hirn that would always be a helpless child in need of higher authority. 1t was on the foundation of the king's weakness that Richelieu established his own power and farne. Remember: When entering the court, find the weak link. The person in control is often not the king or queen; it is someone behind the scenes­the favorite, the husband or wife, even the court fool. This person may have more weaknesses than the king hirnself, because his power depends on all kinds of capricious factors outside his control. Finally, when dealing with helpless children who cannot make deci­sions, play on their weakness and push them into bold ventures. They will have to depend on you even more, for you will become the adult figure whom they rely on to get them out of scrapes and to safety. Observance II In December of 1925, guests at the swankiest hotel in Palm Beach, Florida, watched with interest as a mysterious man arrived in a Rolls-Royce driven by a J apanese chauffeur. Over the next few days they studied this hand­same man, who walked with an elegant cane, received telegrams at all hours, and only engaged in the briefest of conversations.

Lustig gave the notes to LaUer, who immediately took the bills to a local bank-which accepted them as genuine. Now the businessman fever­ishly begged Lustig to sell hirn a machine. The count explained that there was only one in existence, so Loller made hirn a high offer: $25,000, then a considerable amount (more than $400,000 in today's terms). Even so, Lustig seemed reluctant: He did not feel right about making his friend pay so much. Yet finally he agreed to the sale. After all, he said, \"I suppose it matters little what you pay me. You are, after all, going to recover the amount within a few days by duplicating your own bills.\" Making LoUer swear never to reveal the machine's existence to other people, Lustig ac­cepted the money. Later the same day he checked out of the hotel. A year later, after many futile attempts at duplicating bills, LaUer finaUy went to the police with the story of how Count Lustig had conned hirn with a pair of doUar bills, some chemicals, and a worthless mahogany box. Interpretation Count Lustig had an eagle eye for other people's weaknesses. He saw them in the smallest gesture. LaUer, for instance, overtipped waiters, seemed nervous in conversation with the concierge, talked loudly about his busi­ness. His weakness, Lustig knew, was his need for social validation and for the respect that he thought his wealth had earned hirn. He was also chroni­cally insecure. Lustig had come to the hotel to hunt for prey. In LaUer he homed in on the perfect sucker-a man hungering for someone to fill his psychic voids. In offering LoUer his friendship, then, Lustig knew he was offering him the immediate respect of the other guests. As a count, Lustig was also offer-"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"ing the newly rich businessman access to the glittering world of old wealth. And for the coup de gräce, he apparently owned a machine that would res­eue Laller from his worries. It would even put hirn on a par with Lustig hirnself, who had also used the machine to maintain his status. No wonder Loller took the bait. Remember: When searching for suckers, always look for the dissatis­lied, the unhappy, the insecure. Such people are riddled with weaknesses and have needs that you can fill. Their neediness is the groove in which you place your thumbnail and turn them at will. Observance III In the year 1559, the French king Henri II died in a jousting exhibition. His son assumed the throne, becoming Francis II, but in the background stood Henri's wife and queen, Catherine de' Medicis, a woman who had long ago proven her skill in affairs of state. When Francis died the next year, Catherine took control of the country as regent to her next son in line of sueeession, the future Charles IX, a mere ten years old at the time. The main threats to the queen's power were Antoine de Bourbon, king of Navarre, and his brother, Louis, the powerful prince of Cande, both of whom could elaim the right to serve as regent instead of Catherine, who, after all, was Italian-a foreigner. Catherine quickly appointed Antoine lieutenant general of the kingdom, a title that seemed to satisfy his ambi­tion. It also meant that he had to remain in court, where Catherine could keep an eye on hirn. Her next move proved smarter still: Antoine had a notorious weakness for young women, so she assigned one of her most at­traetive maids of honor, Louise de Rouet, to seduce hirn. Now Antoine's intimate, Louise reported all of his actions to Catherine. The move worked so brilliantly that Catherine assigned another of her maids to Prince Conde, and thus was formed her escadron volant\\-\"flying squadron\"-of young girls whom she used to keep the unsuspecting males in the court under her control. In 1572 Catherine married off her daughter, Marguerite de Valois, to Henri, the son of Antoine and the new king of Navarre. To put a family that had always struggled against her so elose to power was a dangerous move, so to make sure of Henri's loyalty she unleashed on hirn the loveliest mem­ber of her \"flying squadron,\" Charlotte de Beaune Semblan�ay, baroness of Sauves. Catherine did this even though Henri was married to her daugh­ter. Within weeks, Marguerite de Valois wrote in her memoirs, \"Mme. de Sauves so completely ensnared my husband that we no longer slept to­gether, nor even conversed.\" The baroness was an excellent spy and helped to keep Henri under Catherine's thumb. When the queen's youngest son, the Duke of Alen�on, grew so elose to Henri that she feared the two might plot against her, she assigned the baroness to hirn as weIl. This most infamous member of the flying squadron quickly seduced Alen�on, and soon the two young men fought over her and their friendship quickly ended, along with any danger of a conspiracy. And while I am on the subject, there is another fact that deserves mention. I t is this. A man shows his charae­ter just in the way in which he deals with trifles-for then he is off his guard. This will often affo rd a good opportunity of ohserv­ing ehe boundless egoism of a man's nature, and his total lack of consideration for others; and if these defcets show them­selves in small things, or merely in his general demeanour, you will find that they also underhe his action in matters of importancc, although he may disguise the fa ct. This ü an opportl/nity whieh should not he missed. If in the liule affairs of every day-the trifIes of life ... -a man is ineonsiderate and seeks only what is advanta­geous or convenient to himselJ. to the preju­dice of others' rights; if he appropriates to hirnself that which helongs to a/l alike, you may he sure there is no justiee in his heart, ami that he would be a seoundrel on a whole­sale scale, only that law and compulsion hind his hands.

For thus 278 LAW 33 Interpretation Catherine had seen very early on the sway that a mistress has over a man of power: Her own husband, Henri 11, had kept one of the most infamous mistresses of them all, Diane de Poitiers_ What Catherine learned from the experience was that a man like her husband wanted to feel he could win a woman over without having to rely on his status, which he had inherited rather than earned_ And such a need contained a huge blind spot: As long as the woman began the affair by acting as if she had been conquered, the man would fail to notice that as time passed the mistress had come to hold power over hirn, as Diane de Poitiers did over Henri_ It was Catherine's strategy to turn this weakness to her advantage, using it as a way to conquer and control men. All she had to do was unleash the loveliest women in the court, her \"flying squadron,\" on men whom she knew shared her hus­band's vulnerability. Remember: Always look for passions and ob sessions that cannot be controlled. The stronger the passion, the more vulnerable the person. This may seem surprising, for passionate people look strong. In fact, however, they are simply filling the stage with their theatricality, distracting people from how weak and helpless they really are. A man's need to conquer women actually reveals a tremendous helplessness that has made suckers out of them for thousands of years. Look at the part of a person that is most visible-their greed, their lust, their intense fear. These are the emotions they cannot conceal, and over which they have the least control. And what people cannot control, you can control for them. Observance IV Arabella Huntington, wife of the great late-nineteenth-century railroad magnate Collis P. Huntington, came from humble origins and always struggled for social recognition among her wealthy peers. When she gave a party in her San Francisco mansion, few of the social elite would show Upj most of them took her for a gold digger, not their kind. Because of her hus­band's fabulous wealth, art dealers courted her, but with such condescen­sion they obviously saw her as an upstart. Only one man of consequence treated her differently: the dealer Joseph Duveen. For the first few years of Duveen's relationship with Arabella, he made no ef fort to seIl expensive art to her. Instead he accompanied her to fine stores, chatted endlessly about queens and princesses he knew, on and on. At last, she thought, a man who treated her as an equal, even a superior, in high society. Meanwhile, ifDuveen did not try to seIl art to her, he did sub­tly educate her in his aesthetic ideas-namely, that the best art was the most expensive art. And after Arabella had soaked up his way of seeing things, Duveen would act as if she always had exquisite taste, even though before she met hirn her aesthetics had been abysmal. When Collis Huntington died, in 1900, Arabella came into a fortune. She suddenly started to buy expensive paintings, by Rembrandt and Veläzquez, for example-and only from Duveen. Years later Duveen sold her Gainsborough's Blue Boy for the highest price ever paid for a work of"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"art at the time, an astounding purchase for a family that previously had shown little interest in collecting. Interpretation Joseph Duveen instantly understood Arabella Huntington and what made her tick: She wanted to feel important, at horne in society. Intensely inse­eure about her lower-class background, she needed confirmation of her new social status. Duveen waited. Instead of rushing into trying to per­suade her to collect art, he subtly went to work on her weaknesses. He made her feel that she deserved his attention not because she was the wife of one of the wealthiest men in the world but because of her own special eharacter-and this completely melted her. Duveen never condescended to ArabeIla; rather than lecturing to her, he instilled his ideas in her indi­reetly. The result was one of his best and most devoted clients, and also the sale of The Blue Boy. People's need far validation and recognition, their need to feel impor­tant, is the best kind of weakness to exploit. First, it is almost universal; sec­ond, exploiting it is so very easy. All you have to do is find ways to make people feel better about their taste, their sodal standing, their intelligence. Once the fish are hooked, you can reel them in again and again, for years-you are filling a positive role, giving them what they cannot get on their own. They may never suspect that you are turning them like a thumb­serew, and if they do they may not care, because you are making them feel better about themselves, and that is worth any price. Observance V In 1862 King William of Prussia named Otto von Bismarck premier and minister for foreign affairs. Bismarck was known for his boldness, his ambi­tion-and his interest in strengthening the military. Since William was sur­rounded by liberals in his govemment and cabinet, politidans who already wanted to limit his powers, it was quite dangerous for hirn to put Bismarck in this sensitive position. His wife, Queen Augusta, had tried to dis suade hirn, but although she usually got her way with hirn, this time William stuck to his guns. Only a week after becoming prime minister, Bismarck made an im­promptu speech to a few dozen ministers to convince them of the need to enlarge the army. He ended by saying, \"The great questions of the time will be dedded, not by speeches and resolutions of majorities, but by iron and blood.\" His speech was immediately disseminated throughout Ger­many. The queen screamed at her husband that Bismarck was a barbaric militarist who was out to usurp control of Prussia, and that William had to lire hirn. The liberals in the govemment agreed with her. The outcry was so vehement that WiIliam began to be afraid he would end up on a scaf­fold, like Louis XVI of France, if he kept Bismarck on as prime minister. Bismarck knew he had to get to the king befare it was too late. He also knew he had blundered, and should have tempered his fiery words. Yet as he contemplated his strategy, he decided not to apologize but to do the exact opposite. Bismarck knew the king weIl. Caesar had instructed them, in hopes that young gentlemen, who had not known much of baltles and wounds, but came wearing their hair long, in ehe jlower of their age and height of their beauty, would be more apprehensive ofsuch blows, and not care for hazarding both a danger at present and a blemish fo r the future. And so it proved, for they were so far from bearing the stroke of the javelim; that they eould not stand the sight ofthem, but turned about, ami eovered their faces to see ure them. Onee in disorder, presently they turned about to jly; and so most shamefu lly ruined alf.

Pompey, who eommanded the other wing ofthe army, when he saw his cavalry thus broken and flying, was no longer himself; nor did he now remember that he was Pompey the Great, but, like one whom some god had deprived of his senses, retired to his tent with­out speaking a word, and there sat to ex pect the event, till the whole army was routed.

I should die fighting for the cause of my king and master. Your Majesty would die sealing with your own blood your royal rights granted by God's grace. Whether upon the scaffold or upon the battlefield makes no difference to the glorious staking of body and life on behalf of rights granted by God's grace!\" On he went, appealing to William's sense of honor and the majesty of his position as head of the army. How could the king allow people to push hirn around? Wasn't the honor of Germany more important than quibbling over words? Not only did the prime minister convince the king to stand up to both his wife and his parliament, he persuaded hirn to build up the army-Bis­marck's goal all along. Interpretation Bismarck knew the king feIt buHied by those around hirn. He knew that William had a military background and a deep sense of honor, and that he feit ashamed at his cravenness before his wife and his government. William secretly yearned to be a great and mighty king, but he dared not express this ambition because he was afraid of ending up like Louis XVI. Where a show of courage often conceals a man's timidity, William's timidity con­cealed his need to show courage and thump his chest. Bismarck sensed the longing for glory beneath William's pacifist fr ont, so he played to the king's insecurity about his manhood, finaHy pushing hirn into three wars and the creation of a German empire.

A commission of the highest authorities in the land gathered to choose a successor, and the man they picked was Louis­Philippe, the Duke of Orleans. From the beginning it was clear that Louis-Philippe would be a differ­ent kind of king, and not just because he came from a different branch of the royal family, or because he had not inherited the crown but had been given it, by a commission, putting his legitimacy in question. Rather it was that he disliked ceremony and the trappings of royalty; he had more friends among the bankers than among the nobility; and his style was not to create a new kind of royal rule, as Napoleon had done, but to downplay his status, the better to mix with the businessmen and middle-class folk who had called hirn to lead. Thus the symbols that came to be associated with Louis-Philippe were neither the scepter nor the crown, but the gray hat and umbrella with which he would proudly walk the streets of Paris, as ifhe were a bourgeois out for a stroll. When Louis-Philippe invitedJames Rothschild, the most important banker in France, to his palace, he treated him as an equal. And unlike any king before hirn, not only did he talk busi­ness with Monsieur Rothschild but that was literally all he talked, for he loved money and had amassed a huge fortune. As the reign of the \"bourgeois king\" plodded on, people came to de­spise hirn. The aristocracy could not endure the sight of an unkingly king, and within a few years they tumed on hirn. Meanwhile the growing class of the poor, including the radicals who had chased out Charles X, found no satisfaction in a ruler who neither acted as a king nor govemed as a man of the people. The bankers to whom Louis-Philippe was the most beholden soon realized that it was they who controlled the country, not he, and they treated hirn with growing contempt. One day, at the start of a train trip or­ganized for the royal family, James Rothschild actually berated him-and in public-for being late. Once the king had made news by treating the banker as an equal; now the banker treated the king as an inferior. Eventually the workers' insurrections that had brought down Louis­Philippe's predecessor began to reemerge, and the king put them down with force. But what was he defending so brutally? Not the institution ofthe monarchy, which he disdained, nor a democratic republic, which his rule prevented. What he was really defending, it seemed, was his own fortune, and the fortunes of the bankers-not a way to inspire loyalty among the citizenry. In early 1848, Frenchmen of all classes began to demonstrate for elec­toral reforms that would make the country truly democratic. By February the demonstrations had tumed violent. To assuage the populace, Louis­Philippe fired his prime minister and appointed a liberal as areplacement. But this created the opposite of the desired effect: The people sensed they could push the king around. The demonstrations tumed into a full-fledged revolution, with gunfire and barricades in the streets. Never lose your self-respect, nor be too fa miliar with yourself . when you are ahme.

With a suddenness that caught everyone by surprise, Louis­Philippe abdicated that very evening and fled to England. He left no suc­cessor, nor even the suggestion of one--his whole government folded up and dissolved like a traveling circus leaving town. Interpretation Louis-Philippe consciously dissolved the aura that naturally pertains to kings and leaders. Scoffing at the symbolism of grandeur, he believed a new world was dawning, where rulers should act and be like ordinary citi­zens. He was right: A new world, without kings and queens, was certainly on its way. He was profoundly wrong, however, in predicting a change in the dynamics of power. The bourgeois king's hat and umbrella amused the French at first, but soon grew irritating. People knew that Louis-Philippe was not really like them at all-that the hat and umbrella were essentially a kind of trick to en­courage them in the fantasy that the country had suddenly grown more equal. Actually, though, the divisions of wealth had never been greater. The French expected their ruler to be a bit of a showman, to have some presence. Even a radicallike Robespierre, who had briefly come to power during the French Revolution fifty years earlier, had understood this, and certainly Napoleon, who had turned the revolutionary republic into an im­perial regime, had known it in his bones. Indeed as soon as Louis-Philippe fled the stage, the French revealed their true desire: They elected Napoleon's grand-nephew president. He was a virtual unknown, but they hoped he would re-create the great general's powerful aura, erasing the awkward memory of the \"bourgeois king.\" Powerful people may be tempted to affect a common-man aura, trying to create the illusion that they and their subjects or underlings are basically the same. But the people whom this false ge sture is intended to impress will quickly see through it. They understand that they are not being given more power-that it only appears as if they shared in the powerful person's fate. The only kind of common touch that works is the kind affected by Franklin Roosevelt, a style that said the president shared values and goals with the common people even while he remained a patrician at heart. He never pretended to erase his distance from the crowd. Leaders who try to dissolve that distance through a false chumminess gradually lose the ability to inspire loyalty, fear, or love. Instead they elicit contempt. Like Louis-Philippe, they are too uninspiring even to be worth the guillotine--the best they can do is simply vanish in the night, as if they were never there. OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW When Christopher Columbus was trying to find funding for his legendary voyages, many around hirn believed he came from the ltalian aristocracy. This view was passed into history through a biography written after the ex­plorer's death by his son, which describes hirn as a descendant of a Count"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Colombo of the Castle of Cuccaro in Montferrat. Colombo in turn was said to be descended from the legendary Roman general Colonius, and two of his first cousins were supposedly direct descendants of an emperor of Con­stantinople. An ilIustrious background indeed. But it was nothing more than ilIustrious fantasy, for Columbus was actually the son of Domenico Colombo, a humble weaver who had opened a wine shop when Christo­pher was a young man, and who then made his living by seIling cheese. Columbus hirnself had created the myth of his noble background, be­cause from early on he feit that destiny had singled hirn out for great things, and that he had a kind of royalty in his blood. Accordingly he acted as if he were indeed descended from noble stock. After an uneventful ca­reer as a merchant on a commercial vessel, Columbus, originally from Genoa, settled in Lisbon. Using the fabricated story of his noble back­ground, he married into an established Lisbon family that had exceIIent connections with Portuguese royalty. Through his in-Iaws, Columbus finagled a meeting with the king of Portugal, Joäo 11, whom he petitioned to finance a westward voyage aimed at discovering a shorter route to Asia. In return for announcing that any discoveries he achieved would be made in the king's name, Columbus Iiowanted a series of rights: the title Grand Admiral of the Oceanic Sea; the office of viceroy over any lands he found; and 10 percent of the future commerce with such lands. All of these rights were to be hereditary and for aIl time. Columbus made these demands even though he had previously been a mere merchant, he knew almost nothing about navigation, he could not work a quadrant, and he had never led a group of men. In short he had absolutely no qualifications for the journey he proposed. Furthermore, his petition incIuded no details as to how he would accomplish his plans, just vague promises. When Columbus finished his pitch, Joäo 11 smiled: He politely de­cIined the offer, but left the door open for the future. Here Columbus mu�t have noticed something he would never forget: Even as the king turned down the sailor's demands, he treated them as legitimate. He neither laughed at Columbus nor questioned his background and credentials. In fact the king was impressed by the boldness of Columbus's requests, and cIearly feit comfortable in the company of a man who acted so confidently. The meeting must have convinced Columbus that his instincts were cor­rect: By asking for the mo on, he had instantly raised his own status, for the king assumed that unless a man who set such a high price on hirnself were mad, which Columbus did not appear to be, he must somehow be worth it. A few years later Columbus moved to Spain. Using his Portuguese connections, he moved in elevated circles at the Spanish court, receiving subsidies from ilIustrious financiers and sharing tables with dukes and princes. To all these men he repeated his request for financing for a voyage to the west-and also for the rights he had demanded fromJoäo 11. Some, such as the powerful duke of Medina, wanted to help, but could not, since they lacked the power to grant hirn the titles and rights he wanted. But Columbus would not back down.

In 1492 the Spanish finally expelled the Moorish invaders who cen­turies earlier had seized parts of the country. With the wartime burden on her treasury lifted, Isabella feit she could finally respond to the demands of her explorer friend, and she decided to pay for three ships, equipment, the salaries of the crews, and a modest stipend for Columbus. More important, she had a contract drawn up that granted Columbus the titles and rights on which he had insisted. The only one she denied-and only in the contract's fine print-was the 10 percent of all revenues from any lands discovered: an absurd demand, since he wanted no time limit on it. (Had the clause been left in, it would eventually have made Columbus and his heirs the wealthiest family on the planet. Columbus never read the fine print.) Satisfied that his demands had been met, Columbus set sail that same year in search of the passage to Asia. (Before he left he was careful to hire the best navigator he could find to help hirn get there.) The mission failed to find such a passage, yet when Columbus petitioned the queen to finance an even more ambitious voyage the following year, she agreed. By then she had come to see Columbus as destined for great things, Interpretation As an explorer Columbus was mediocre at best. He knew less about the sea than did the average sailor on his ships, could never determine the lati­tude and longitude of his discoveries, mistook islands for vast continents, and treated his crew badly. But in one area he was a genius: He knew how to seIl hirnself. How else to explain how the son of a cheese vendor, a low­level sea merchant, managed to ingratiate hirnself with the highest royal and aristocratic farnilies? Columbus had an amazing power to charm the nobility, and it all came from the way he carried hirnself. He projected a sense of confidence that was completely out of proportion to his means.

With Columbus, then, they felt an instant affinity, for he carried hirnself just the way they did-elevated above the crowd, destined for greatness.

Friedrich Nietzsehe, 1844-1900 KEYS TO POWER As children, we start OUf lives with great exuberance, expecting and de­manding everything from the world. This generally carries over into OUf first forays into society, as we begin OUf careers. But as we grow older the rebuffs and failUfes we experience set up boundaries that only get firmer with time. Coming to expect less from the world, we accept limitations that are really self-imposed. We start to bow and scrape and apologize for even the simplest of requests. The solution to such a shrinking of horizons is to deliberately force ourselves in the opposite direction-to downplay the failures and ignore the limitations, to make oUfselves demand and expect as much as the child. To accomplish this, we must use a particular strategy upon oUfselves. Call it the Strategy of the Crown. The Strategy of the Crown is based on a simple chain of cause and ef­fect: If we believe we are destined for great things, OUf belief will radiate outward, just as a crown creates an aura around a king. This outward radi­ance will infect the people around us, who will think we must have reasons to feel so confident. People who wear crowns seem to feel no inner sense of the limits to what they can ask for or what they can accomplish. This too radiates outward. Limits and boundaries disappear. Use the Strategy of the Crown and you will be surprised how often it bears fruit. Take as an exam­pIe those happy children who ask for whatever they want, and get it. Their high expectations are their charm. Adults enjoy granting their wishes-just as Isabella enjoyed granting the wishes of Columbus. Throughout history, people of undistinguished birth-the Theodoras of � Byzantium, the Columbuses, the Beethovens, the Disraelis-have managed to work the Strategy of the Crown, believing so firmly in their own greatness that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The trick is simple: Be overcome by yoUf self-belief. Even while you know you are practicing a kind of de­ception on YOUfself, act like a king. You are likely to be treated as one. The crown may separate you from other people, but it is up to you to make that separation real: You have to act differently, demollStrating your distance from those around you. One way to emphasize YOUf difference is to always act with dignity, no matter the circumstance. Louis-Philippe gave no sense of being different from other people-he was the banker king. And the moment his subjects threatened him, he caved in. Everyone sensed this and pounced. Lacking regal dignity and firmness of purpose, Louis-Philippe seemed an impostor, and the crown was easily toppled from his head. Regal bearing should not be confused with arrogance. Arrogance may seem the king's entitlement, but in fact it betrays insecurity. It is the very opposite of a royal demeanor. Hippoc!eides, c/imbing on to it, danced first .\\'Onle Laconian dances, next some Attic ones, and ended by standing on his head and beat­ing time with his legs in the air. The Laconian and Altic dan ces were bad enough; but Cleisthenes, thol/gh he already loathed the thought o[ having a son-in-law like that, nevertheless restrained himself and managed to avoid an outburst; but when he saw Hippocleides beating time with his legs, he could bear it no Ion ger. \"Son of Tisander, \" he cried, \"you have danced away your marriage.\" TIIE HISTORIFS.

He came from a noble family, but there was no real chance of hirn coming to power, for he was far down the line of succession from the king then on the throne, Menelik 11. Neverthe­less, from an early age he exhibited a self-confidence and a royal bearing that surprised everyone around hirn. At the age of fourteen, Tafari went to live at the court, where he imme­diately impressed Menelik and became his favorite. Tafari's grace under fire, his patience, and his calm self-assurance fascinated the king. The other young nobles, arrogant, blustery, and envious, would push this slight, bookish teenager around. But he never got angry-that would have been a sign of insecurity, to which he would not stoop. There were already people around hirn who feIt he would someday rise to the top, for he acted as ifhe were already there. Years later, in 1936, when the ltalian Fascists had taken over Ethiopia and Tafari, now called Haile Selassie, was in exile, he addressed the League of Nations to plead his country's case. The Italians in the audience heckled hirn with vulgar abuse, but he maintained his dignified pose, as if corn­. pletely unaffected. This elevated hirn while making his opponents look even uglier. Dignity, in fact, is invariably the mask to assurne under difficult circumstances: It is as if nothing can affect you, and you have all the time in the world to respond. This is an extremely powerful pose. A royal demeanor has other uses. Con artists have long known the value of an aristocratic front; it either dis arms people and makes them less suspicious, or else it intimidates them and puts them on the defensiv�and as Count Victor Lustig knew, once you put a sucker on the defensive he is doomed. The con man Yellow Kid Weil, too, would often assurne the trap­pings of a man of wealth, along with the nonchalance that goes with thern. Alluding to some magical method of making money, he would stand aloof, like a king, exuding confidence as if he really were fabulously rich. The suckers would beg to be in on the con, to have a chance at the wealth that he so clearly displayed. Finally, to reinforce the inner psychological tricks involved in project­ing a royal demeanor, there are outward strategies to help you create the effect. First, the Columbus Strategy: Always make a bold demand. Set your price high and do not waver. Second, in a dignified way, go after the high­est person in the building. This immediately puts you on the same plane as the chief executive you are attacking. It is the David and Goliath Strategy: By choosing a great opponent, you create the appearance of greatness. Third, give a gift of some sort to those above you. This is the strategy of those who have a patron: By giving your patron a gift, you are essentially saying that the two of you are equal. It is the old con game of giving so that you can take. When the Renaissance writer Pietro Aretino wanted the Duke of Mantua as his next patron, he knew that if he was slavish and sycophantic, the duke would think hirn unworthy; so he approached the duke with gifts, in this case paintings by the writer's good friend Titian."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Accepting the gifts created a kind of equality between duke and writer: The duke was put at ease by the feeling that he was dealing with a man of his own aristocratie stamp. He funded Aretino generously. The gift strategy is subtle and brilliant beeause you do not beg: You ask for help in a dignified way that implies equality between two people, one of whom just happens to have more money. Remember: It is up to you to set your own priee. Ask for less and that is just what you will get. Ask for more, however, and you send a signal that you are worth a king's ransom. Even those who turn you down respeet you for your eonfidenee, and that respeet will eventually pay off in ways you cannot imagine. Image: The Crown. Plaee it upon your head and you assume a different pose-tranquil yet radiating assuranee. Never show doubt, never lose your dignity beneath the erown, or it will not fit. It will seem to be destined for one more worthy. Do not wait for a eoronation; the great­est emperors crown themselves. Authority: Everyone should be royal after his own fashion. Let all your actions, even though they are not those of a king, be, in their own sphere, worthy of one. Be sublime in your deeds, lofty in your thoughts; and in all your doings show that you deserve to be a king even though you are not one in reality.

Never make the mistake of thinking that you elevate yourself by humiliat­ing people. Also, it is never a good idea to 100m too high above the crowd-you make an easy target. And there are times when an aristocratic pose is eminently dangerous. Charles I, king of England during the 1640s, faced a profound public disenchantment with the institution of monarchy. Revolts erupted through­out the country, led by Oliver Cromwell. Had Charles reacted to the times with insight, supporting reforms and making a show of sacrificing some of his power, history might have been different. Instead he reverted to an even more regal pose, seeming outraged by the assault on his power and on the divine institution of monarchy. His stiff kingliness offended people and spurred on their revolts. And eventually Charles lost his head, literally. Understand: You are radiating confidence, not arrogance or disdain. Finally, it is true that you can sometimes find some power through af­fecting a kind of earthy vulgarity, which will prove amusing by its extreme­ness.

Yet he never completely committed himself to the church, never took his vows as a priest-he had bigger plans. Patiently waiting for his chance, he kept his options open. And when the French Revolution broke out, in 1789, Fouche waited no longer: He got rid of his cassock, grew his hair long, and became a revolutionary. For this was the spirit of the times. To miss the boat at this critical moment could have spelt disaster. Fouche did not miss the boat: Befriending the revolutionary leader Robespierre, he quickly rose in the rebel ranks. In 1792 the town of Nantes elected Fouche to be its representative to the National Convention (created that year to frame a new constitution for a French republic). When Fouche arrived in Paris to take his seat at the convention, a vio­lent rift had broken out between the moderates and the radical Jacobins. Fouche sensed that in the long run neither side would emerge victorious. Power rarely ends up in the hands of those who start a revolution, or even of those who further it; power sticks to those who bring it to a conclusion. That was the side Fouche wanted to be on. His sense of timing was uncanny. He started as a moderate, for moder­ates were in the majority. When the time came to decide on whether or not to execute Louis XVI, however, he saw that the people were clamoring for the king's head, so he cast the deciding vote--for the guillotine. Now he had become a radical. Yet as tensions came to the boll in Paris, he foresaw the danger of being too closely associated with any one faction, so he ac­cepted a position in the provinces, where he could lie low for a while. A few months later he was assigned to the post of proconsul in Lyons, where he oversaw the execution of dozens of aristocrats. At a certain moment, however, he called a halt to the killings, sensing that the mood of the coun­try was turning-and despite the blood already on his hands, the citizens of Lyons hailed him as a savior from what had become known as the Terror. So far Fouche had played his cards brilliantly, but in 1794 his old fr iend Robespierre recalled him to Paris to account for his actions in Lyons. Robespierre had been the driving force behind the Terror. He had sent heads on both the right and the left rolling, and Fouche, whom he no longer trusted, seemed destined to provide the next head. Over the next few weeks, a tense struggle ensued: While Robespierre railed openly against Fouche, accusing of him dangerous ambitions and calling for his ar­rest, the crafty Fouche worked more indirectly, quietly gaining support among those who were beginning to tire of Robespierre's dictatorial con­trol. Fouche was playing for time. He knew that the longer he survived, the more disaffected citizens he could rally against Robespierre. He had to have broad support before he moved against the powernd leader. He ral­lied support among both the moderates and the Jacobins, playing on the widespread fear of Robespierre--everyone was afraid of being the next to go to the guillotine. It all came to fruition on July 27: The convention"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"tumed against Robespierre, shouting down his usual lengthy speech. He was quickly arrested, and a few days later it was Robespierre's head, not Fouche's, that fell into the basket. When Fouche returned to the convention after Robespierre's death, he played his most unexpected move: Having led the conspiracy against Robespierre, he was expected to sit with the moderates, but 10 and behold, he once again changed sides, joining the radical Jacobins. For perhaps the first time in his life he aligned hirnself with the minority. Clearly he sensed areaction stirring: He knew that the moderate faction that had executed Robespierre, and was now about to take power, would initiate a new round of the Te rror, this time against the radicals. In siding with the Jacobins, then, Fouche was sitting with the martyrs of the days to come---the people who would be considered blameless in the troubles that were on their way. Taking sides with what was about to become the losing team was a risky gambit, of course, but Fouche must have calculated he could keep his head long enough to quietly stir up the populace against the moderates and watch them fall from power. And indeed, although the moderates did call for his arrest in December of 1795, and would have sent hirn to the guillo­tine, too much time had passed. The executions had be co me unpopular with the people, and Fouche survived the swing of the pendulum one more time. A new government took over, the Directoire. It was not, however, a Jacobin government, but a moderate one---more moderate than the gov­emment that had reimposed the Terror. Fouche, the radical, had kept his head, but now he had to keep a low profile. He waited patiently on the sidelines for several years, allowing time to soften any bitter feelings against hirn, then he approached the Directoire and convinced them he had a new passion: intelligence-gathering. He became a paid spy for the govemment, excelled at the job, and in 1799 was rewarded by being made minister of police. Now he was not just empowered but required to extend his spying to every corner of France---a responsibility that would greatly reinforce his natural ability to sniff out where the wind was blowing. One of the first social trends he detected, in fact, came in the person of Napoleon, a brash young general whose destiny he right away saw was en­twined with the future of France. When Napoleon unleashed a coup d'etat, on November 9, 1799, Fouche pretended to be asleep. Indeed he slept the whole day. For this indirect assistance---it might have been thought his job, after all, to prevent a military coup-Napoleon kept hirn on as minister of police in the new regime. Over the next few years, Napoleon came to rely on Fouche more and more. He even gave this former revolutionary a title, duke of Otranto, and rewarded hirn with great wealth. By 1808, however, Fouche, always at­tuned to the times, sensed that Napoleon was on the downswing. His futile war with Spain, a country that posed no threat to France, was a sign that he was losing a sense of proportion. Never one to be caught on a sinking ship, Fouche conspired with Talleyrand to bring about Napoleon's downfall.

Ey 1814 Napoleon's power had crumbled and allied forces finally conquered hirn. The next government was arestoration of the monarchy, in the form of King Louis XVIII, brother of Louis XVI. Fouche, his nose always sniff­ing the air for the next social shift, knew Louis would not last long-he had none of Napoleon's flair. Fouche once again played his waiting game, lying low, staying away fr om the spotlight. Sure enough, in February of 1815, Napoleon escaped from the island of Elba, where he had been imprisoned. Louis XVIII panicked: His policies had alienated the citizenry, who were clamoring for Napoleon's return. So Louis turned to the one man who could maybe have saved his hide, Fouche, the former radical who had sent his brother, Louis XVI, to the guillotine, but was now one of the most pop­ular and widely admired politicians in France. Fouche, however, would not side with a loser: He refused Louis's request for help by pretending that bis help was unnecessary-by swearing that Napoleon would never return to power (although he knew otherwise). A short time later, of course, Napoleon and his new citizen army were closing in on Paris. Seeing his reign about to collapse, fe eling that Fouche had betrayed hirn, and certain that he did not want this powerful and able man on Napoleon's team, King Louis ordered the minister's arrest and execution. On March 16, 1815, policemen surrounded Fouche's coach on a Paris boulevard. Was this finally his end? Perhaps, but not immediately: Fouche told the police that an ex-member of government could not be arrested on the street. They fe ll for the story and allowed hirn to return horne. Later that day, though, they came to his house and once again declared hirn under arrest. Fouche nodded-but would the officers be so kind as allow a gentleman to wash and to change his clothes before leaving his house for the last time? They gave their permission, Fouche left the room, and the minutes went by. Fouche did not return. Finally the policemen went into the next room-where they saw a ladder against an open window, leading down to the garden below. That day and the next the police combed Paris for Fouche, but by then Napoleon's cannons were audible in the distance and the king and all the king's men had to flee the city. As soon as Napoleon entered Paris, Fouche came out of hiding. He had cheated the executioner once again. Napoleon greeted his former minister of police and gladly restored hirn to his old post. During the 100 days that Napoleon remained in power, until Wa ter-100, it was essentially Fouche who governed France. After Napoleon fe ll, Louis XVIII returned to the throne, and like a cat with nine lives, Fauche stayed on to serve in yet another government-by then his power and in­fluence had grown so great that not even the king dared challenge hirn. Interpretation In aperiod of unprecedented turmoil, Joseph Fouche thrived through his mastery of the art of timing. He teaches us a number of key lessons."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"First, it is critical to recognize the spirit of the times. Fo uche always looked two steps ahead, found the wave that would carry hirn to power, and rode it. Yo u must always work with the times, anticipate twists and turns, and never miss the boat. Sometimes the spirit of the times is obscure: Recognize it not by what is loudest and most obvious in it, but by what lies hidden and dormant. Look forward to the Napoleons of the future rather than holding on to the ruins of the past. Second, recognizing the prevailing winds does not necessarily mean running with them. Any potent social movement creates a powerful reac­tion, and it is wise to anticipate what that reaction will be, as Fo uche did after the execution of Robespierre. Rather than ride the cresting wave of the moment, wait for the tide's ebb to carry you back to power. Upon occa­sion bet on the re action that is brewing, and place yourself in the vanguard of it. Finally, Fouche had remarkable patience. Without patience as your sword and shield, your timing will fail and you will inevitably find yourself a loser. When the times were against Fouche, he did not struggle, get emo­tional, or strike out rashly. He kept his cool and maintained a low profile, patiently building support among the citizenry, the bulwark in his next rise to power. Whenever he found hirnself in the weaker position, he played for time, which he knew would always be his ally if he was patient. Recognize the moment, then, to hide in the grass or slither under a rock, as weIl as the moment to bare your fangs and attack. KEYS TO POWER Space we can recover, time never. Napoleon Bonaparte, 1769-1821 Time is an artificial concept that we ourselves have created to make the limitlessness of eternity and the universe more bearable, more human. Since we have constructed the concept of time, we are also able to mold it to some degree, to play tricks with it. The time of a child is long and slow, with vast expanses; the time of an adult whizzes by frighteningly fast. Time, then, depends on perception, which, we know, can be willfully al­tered. This is the first thing to understand in mastering the art of timing. If the inner turmoil caused by our emotions tends to make time move faster, it fo llows that once we control our emotional responses to events, time will move much more slowly. This altered way of dealing with things tends to lengthen our perception of future time, opens up possibilities that fe ar and anger dose off, and allows us the patience that is the principal requirement in the art of timing. There are three kinds of time for us to deal with; each presents prob­lems that can be solved with skill and practice. First there is lo ng time: the drawn-out, years-Iong kind of time that must be managed with patience and gentle guidance. Our handling of long time should be mostly defen­sive-this is the art of not reacting impulsively, of waiting for opportunity. we shall be in trouble. \" So he had the fellow's feet cut off Both fami­lies did exaetly the same thing, but one timed it right, the other wrong.

The famous seventeenth-century Ming painter Chou Yung relates a story that altered his behavior forever. Late one winter aftemoon he set out to visit a town that lay across the river from his own town. He was bringing some important books and papers with hirn and had commis­sioned a young boy to help hirn carry them. As the ferry neared the other side ofthe river, Chou Yung asked the boatman ifthey would have time to get to the town before its gates closed, since it was a mHe away and night was approaching. The boatman glanced at the boy, and at the bundle of loosely tied papers and books-\"Yes,\" he replied, \"if you do not walk too fast.\" As they started out, however, the sun was setting. Afraid of being locked out of the town at night, prey to local bandits, Chou and the boy walked faster and faster, finally breaking into a run. Suddenly the string around the papers broke and the documents scattered on the ground. It took them many minutes to put the packet together again, and by the time they had reached the city gates, it was too late. When you force the pace out of fear and impatience, you create a nest of problems that require fixing, and you end up taking much longer than if you had taken YOUf time. Hurriers may occasionally get there quicker, but papers fly everywhere, new dangers arise, and they find themselves in con­stant crisis mode, fixing the problems that they themselves have created. Sometimes not acting in the face of danger is YOUf best move-you wait, you deliberately slow down. As time passes it will eventually present op­portunities you had not imagined. Waiting involves controlling not only YOUf own emotions but those of YOUf colleagues, who, rnistaking action for power, may try to push you into making rash moves. In YOUf rivals, on the other hand, you can encourage this same mistake: If you let them rush headlong into trouble while you stand back and wait, you will soon find ripe moments to intervene and pick up the pieces. This wise policy was the principal strategy of the great early­seventeenth-century emperor Tokugawa Ieyasu of Japan. When his prede­cessor, the headstrong Hideyoshi, whom he served as a general, staged a rash invasion of Korea, Ieyasu did not involve hirnself. He knew the inva­sion would be a dis aster and would lead to Hideyoshi's downfall. Better to stand patiently on the sidelines, even Jor many years, and then be in position to seize power when the time is right-exactly what Ieyasu did, with great artistry. You do not deliberately slow time down to live longer, or to take more pleasUfe in the moment, but the better to play the game of power.

Third, you will have more room to be flexible. Opportuni­ties will inevitably arise that you had not expected and would have missed had you fo rced the pace. Fourth, you will not move from one deal to the next without completing the first one. To build your power's foundation can take years; make sure that foundation is secure. Do not be a flash in the pan-success that is built up slowly and surely is the only kind that lasts. Finally, slowing time down will give you a perspective on the times you live in, letting you take a certain distance and putting you in a less emotionally charged position to see the shapes of things to come. Hurriers will often mistake surface phenomena for a real trend, seeing only what they want to see. How much better to see what is really happening, even if it is unpleasant or makes your task harder. Forced Time. The trick in fo rcing time is to upset the timing of others-to make them hurry, to make them wait, to make them abandon their own pace, to distort their perception of time. Ey upsetting the timing of your op­ponent while you stay patient, you open up time for yourself, which is half the game. In 1473 the great Tu rkish sultan Mehmed the Conqueror invited nego­tiations with Hungary to end the off-and-on war the two countries had waged for years. When the Hungarian emissary arrived in Tu rkey to start the talks, Tu rkish officials humbly apologized-Mehmed had just left Istan­bul, the capital, to battle his longtime fo e, Uzun Hasan. Eut he urgently wanted peace with Hungary, and had asked that the emissary join hirn at the fr ont. When the emissary arrived at the site of the fighting, Mehmed had al­ready left it, moving eastward in pursuit of his swift fo e. This happened several times. Wherever the emissary stopped, the Tu rks lavished gifts and banquets on hirn, in pleasurable but time-consuming ceremonies. Finally Mehmed defeated Uzun and met with the emissary. Ye t his terms for peace with Hungary were excessively harsh. Mter a few days, the negotiations ended, and the usual stalemate remained in place. Eut this was fine with Mehmed. In fact he had planned it that way all along: Plotting his cam­paign against Uzun, he had seen that diverting his armies to the east would leave his western flank vulnerable. To prevent Hungary from taking advan­tage of his weakness and his preoccupation elsewhere, he first dangled the lure of peace before his enemy, then made them wait-all on his own terms. Making people wait is a powerful way of forcing time, as long as they do not figure out what you are up to. Yo u control the dock, they linger in limbo-and rapidly come unglued, opening up opportunities for you to strike. The opposite effect is equally powerful: Yo u make your opponents hurry. Start off your dealings with them slowly, then suddenly apply pres­sure, making them feel that everything is happening at once. Pe ople who lack the time to think will make mistakes-so set their deadlines for them.

Rockefeller a deadline-the painting had to leave the country, another tycoon was int erested in it-the dient would buy just in time. Freud noticed that patients who had spent years in psychoanalysis without improvement would miraculously recover just in time if he fixed a definite date for the end of the therapy. Jacques Lacan, the farnaus French psychoanalyst, used a variation on this tactic-he would sometimes end the customary hour session of therapy after only ten minutes, without waming. After this happened several times, the patient would realize that he had better make maximum use of the time, rather than wasting much of the hour with a lot of talk that meant nothing. The deadline, then, is a pow­erful tool. Close off the vistas of indecision and force people to make up their damn minds or get to the point-never let them make you play on their excruciating terms. Never give them time. Magicians and showmen are experts in forcing time. Houdini could often wriggle free of handcuffs in minutes, but he would draw the escape out to an hour, making the audience sweat, as time came to an apparent standstill. Magicians have always known that the best way to alter our per­ception of time is often to slow down the pace. Creating suspense brings time to a terrifying pause: The slower the magician's hands move, the eas­ier it is to create the illusion of speed, making people think the rabbit has appeared instantaneously. The great nineteenth-century magicianJean-Eu­gene Robert-Houdin took explicit notice of this effect: \"The more slowly a story is told,\" he said, \"the shorter it seems.\" Going slower also makes what you are doing more interesting-the audience yields to your pace, becomes entranced.

His ex­ploits fascinated Americans-he seemed a man from another era, part Robin Hood, part Don Juan. After a few years of bitter fighting, however, General Carranza emerged as the victor in the Revolution; the defeated Villa and his troops went back horne, to the northem state of Chihuahua. His army dwindled and he tumed to banditry again, damaging his popu­larity. Finally, perhaps out of desperation, he began to rail against the United States, the gringos, whom he blamed for his troubles. In March of 1916, Pancho Villa raided Columbus, New Mexico. Ram­paging through the town, he and his gang killed seventeen American sol­diers and civilians. President Wo odrow Wilson, like many Americans, had ad mired Villa; now, however, the bandit needed to be punished. Wilson's advisers urged hirn to send troops into Mexico to capture Villa. For a power as large as the United States, they argued, not to strike back at an army that had invaded its territory would send the worst kind of signal. Furthermore, they continued, many Americans saw Wilson as a pacifist, a principle the public doubted as a response to violence; he needed to prove his mettle and manliness by ordering the use of force. The pressure on Wilson was strong, and before the month was out, with the approval of the Carranza govemment, he sent an army of ten thousand soldiers to capture Pancbo Villa. The venture was called the Punitive Expedition, and its leader was the dashing General John J. Persh­ing, who had defeated guerrillas in the Philippines and Native Americans in the American Southwest. Certainly Pershing could find and overpower Pancho Villa. The Punitive Expedition became a sensational story, and carloads of U.S. reporters followed Pershing into action. The campaign, they wrote, would be a test of American power. The soldiers carried the latest in weaponry, communicated by radio, and were supported by reconnais­sance from the air. In the first few months, the troops split up into small units to comb the wilds of northem Mexico. The Americans offered a $50,000 reward for in­formation leading to Villa's capture. But the Mexican people, who had been disillusioned with Villa when he had retumed to banditry, now idol­ized hirn for facing this mighty American army. They began to give Persh­ing false leads: Villa had been seen in this village, or in that mountain hideaway, airplanes would be dispatcbed, troops would scurry after them, and no one would ever see hirn. The wily bandit seemed to be always one step ahead of the American military. By the summer of that year, the expedition had swelled to 123,000 men.

At one point Pancho Villa hid in a mountain cave to recover from a gunshot wound he received in a skirmish with the Mexican army; looking down from his aerie, he could watch Pershing lead the exhausted American troops back and forth across the mountains, never getting any closer to their goal. All the way into winter, Villa played his cat-and-mouse game, Ameri­cans came to see the affair as a kind of slapstick farce-in fact they began to admire Villa again, respecting his resourcefulness in eluding a superior force_ In January of 1917, Wilson finally ordered Pershing's withdrawal. As the troops made their way back to American territory, rebel forces pursued them, forcing the US. Army to use airplanes to protect its rear flanks. The Punitive Expedition was being punished itself-it had turned into a retreat of the most humiliating sort. Interpretation Woodrow Wilson organized the Punitive Expedition as a show of force: He would teach Pancho Villa a lesson and in the process show the world that no one, large or small, could attack the mighty United States and get away with it. The expedition would be over in a few weeks, and Villa would be forgotten. That was not how it played out. The longer the expedition took, the more it focused attention on the Americans' incompetence and on Villa's cleverness_ Soon what was forgotten was not Villa but the raid that had started it all. As a minor annoyance became an international embarrass­ment, and the enraged Americans dispatched more troops, the imbalance between the size of the pursuer and the size of the pursued-who still man­aged to stay free-made the affair a joke. And in the end this white eIe­phant of an army had to lumber out of Mexico, humiliated. The Punitive Expedition did the opposite of what it set out to do: It left Villa not only free but more popular than ever. What could Wilson have done differently? He could have pressured the Carranza government to catch Villa for him_ Alternatively, since many Mexicans had tired of Villa before the Punitive Expedition began, he could have worked quietly with them and won their support for a much smaller raid to capture the bandit. He could have organized a trap on the Ameri­can side of the border, anticipating the next raid. Or he could have ignored the matter altogether for the time being, waiting for the Mexicans them­selves to do away with Villa of their own accord.

That is the powerful move. What you do not react to cannot drag you down in a futile engagement. Your pride is not involved.

Pancho Villa, 1878-1923 OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW In the year 1527, King Henry VIII of England decided he had to find a way to get rid of his wife, Catherine of Aragon. Catherine had failed to pro­duce a son, a male heir who would ensure the continuance of his dynasty, and Henry thought he knew why: He had read in the Bible the passage, \"And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.\" Before marry­ing Henry, Catherine had married his older brother Arthur, but Arthur had died five months later. Henry had waited an appropriate time, then had married his brother's widow. Catherine was the daughter of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain, and by marrying her Henry had kept alive a valuable alliance. Now, however, Catherine had to assure hirn that her brief marriage with Arthur had never been consummated. Otherwise Henry would view their rela­tionship as incestuous and their marriage as null and void. Catherine in­sisted that she had remained a virgin through her marriage to Arthur, and Pope Clement VII supported her by giving his blessing to the union, which he could not have done had he considered it incestuous. Yet after years of marriage to Henry, Catherine had failed to produce a son, and in the early 1520s she had entered menopause. To the king this could only mean one thing: She had lied about her virginity, their union was incestuous, and God had punished them. There was another reason why Henry wanted to get rid of Catherine: He had fallen in love with a younger woman, Anne Boleyn. Not only was he in love with her, but if he married her he could still hope to sire a legiti­mate son. The marriage to Catherine had to be annulled. For this, how­ever, Henry had to apply to the Vatican. But Pope Clement would never annul the marriage. By the summer of 1527, rumors spread throughout Europe that Henry was about to attempt the impossible-to annul his marriage against Clement's wishes. Catherine would never abdicate, let alone voluntarily enter a nunnery, as Henry had urged her. But Henry had his own strategy: He stopped sleeping in the same bed with Catherine, since he considered her his sister-in-Iaw, not his lawful wife. He insisted on calling her Princess the dais where the chief was seated and lay there, chewing its cud. Everyone was sure that this was some grave portent. and urged that the ox be sent to a yin­yang diviner.

It does not make sense to deprive an underpaid official of the wretched ox he needs in order to attend court.\" He returned the ox to its owner and changed the maUing on which it had lain.

The pope or­dered rum to return her to court, on pain of excommunication, the most severe penalty a Catholic could suffer. Henry not only ignored this threat, he insisted that his marriage to Catherine had been dissolved, and in 1533 he married Anne Boleyn. Clement refused to recognize the marriage, but Henry did not care. He no longer recognized the pope's authority, and proceeded to break with the Roman Catholic Church, establishing the Church of England in its stead, with the king as the head of the new church. And so, not surpris­ingly, the newly formed Church of England proclaimed Anne Boleyn Eng­land's rightful queen. The pope tried every threat in the book, but nothing worked. Henry simply ignored him. Clement fumed-no one had ever treated him so con­temptuously. Henry had humiliated hirn and he had no power of recourse. Even excommunication (which he constantly threatened but never carried out) would no longer matter. Catherine too feit the devastating sting of Henry's disdain. She tried to fight back, but in appealing to Henry her words fell on deaf ears, and soon they fell on no one's. Isolated from the court, ignored by the king, mad with anger and frustration, Catherine slowly deteriorated, and finally died in January of 1536, from a cancerous tumor ofthe heart. Interpretation When you pay attention to aperson, the two of you become partners of sorts, each moving in step to the actions and reactions of the other. In the process you lose your initiative. It is a dynamic of all interactions: By ac­knowledging other people, even if only to fight with them, you open your­self to their influence. Had Henry locked horns with Catherine, he would have found hirnself mired in endless arguments that would have weakened his resolve and eventually worn rum down.

Had he set out to convince Clement to change rus verdict on the marriage's validity, or tried to compromise and negotiate with hirn, he would have gotten bogged down in Clement's favorite tactic: playing for time, promising flexibility, but actually getting what popes always got­their way. Henry would have none of this. He played a devastating power game-total disdain. By ignoring people you cancel them out. This unset­tles and infuriates them-but since they have no dealings with you, there is no thing they can do. This is the offensive aspect of the law.

Idries Shah, Caravan of Dreams, 1968 KEYS TO POWER Desire often creates paradoxical effects: The more you want something, the more you chase after it, the more it eludes you. The more interest you show, the more you repel the object of your desire. This is because your in­terest is too strong-it makes people awkward, even fearful. Uncontrol­lable desire makes you seem weak, unworthy, pathetic. Yo u need to turn YOUf back on what you want, show your contempt and disdain. This is the kind of powerful response that will drive your tar­gets crazy. They will respond with a desire of their own, which is simply to have an effect on you-perhaps to possess you, perhaps to hurt you. If they want to possess you, you have successfully completed the first step of se­duction. If they want to hurt you, you have unsettled them and made them play by your rules (see Laws 8 and 39 on baiting people into action). Contempt is the prerogative of the king. Where his eyes turn, what he decides to see, is what has reality; what he ignores and turns his back on is as good as dead. That was the weapon of King Louis XIV -if he did not like you, he acted as if you were not there, maintaining his superiority by cutting off the dynamic of interaction. This is the power you have when you play the card of contempt, periodically showing people that you can do without them. If choosing to ignore enhances your power, it follows that the opposite approach-commitment and engagement-often weakens you. By paying undue attention to a puny enemy, you look puny, and the longer it takes you to crush such an enemy, the larger the enemy seems.

Finally defeating Athens, it made itself famous for centuries to corne. In recent times, President John F.

This was the unit that later broke into Democratic Party offices in the Watergate Hotel, setting off the chain of events that led to Nixon's downfall. In reality the publication of the Penta­gon Papers was not a serious threat to the administration, but Kissinger's reaction made it a big deal. In trying to fix one problem, he created an­other: a paranoia for security that in the end was much more destructive to the government Had he ignored the Pentagon Papers, the scandal they had created would eventually have blown over, Instead of inadvertently focusing attention on a problem, making it seem worse by publicizing how much concern and anxiety it is causing you, it is often far wiser to play the contemptuous aristocrat, not deigning to ackn owledge the problem's existence, There are several ways to execute this strategy. First there is the sour-grapes approach. If there is something you want but that you realize you cannot have, the worst thing you can do is draw at­tention to your disappointrnent by complaining about it An infinitely more powerful tactic is to act as if it never really interested you in the first place. When the writer George Sand's supporters nominated her to be the first female member of the Academie Fran(,:aise, in 1861, Sand quickly saw that the academy would never admit her. Instead of whining, though, she claimed she had no interest in belonging to this group of worn-out, over­rated, out-of-touch windbags. Her disdain was the perfect response: Had she shown her anger at her exclusion, she would have revealed how much it meant to her. Instead she branded the academy a club of old men-and why should she be angry or disappointed at not having to spend her time with them? Crying \"sour grapes\" is sometimes seen as a reflection of the weak; it is actually the tactic of the powerful. Second, when you are attacked by an inferior, deflect people's atten­tion by making it clear that the attack has not even registered. Look away, or answer sweetly, showing how little the attack concerns you. Similarly, when you yourself have committed ablunder, the best response is often to make less of your mistake by treating it lightly. The Japanese emperor Go-Saiin, a great disciple of the tea ceremony,"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"owned a priceless antique tea bowl that all the courtiers envied. One day a guest, Dainagon Tsunehiro, asked if he could carry the tea bowl into the light, to examine it more closely. The bowl rarely left the table, but the em­peror was in good spirits and he consented. As Dainagon carried the bowl to the railing of the verandah, however, and held it up to the light, it slipped from his hands and fell on a rock in the garden below, smashing into tiny fragments. The emperor of course was furious. \"It was indeed most clumsy of me to let it drop in this way,\" said Dainagon, with a deep bow, \"but really there is not much harm done. This Ido tea-bowl is a very old one and it is impossible to say how much longer it would have lasted, but anyhow it is not a thing of any public use, so I think it rather fortunate that it has broken thus.\" This surprising response had an immediate effect: The emperor calmed down. Dainagon neither sniveled nor overapologized, but signaled his own worth and power by treating his mistake with a touch of disdain. The emperor had to respond with a similar aristocratic indifference; his anger had made hirn seem low and petty-an image Dainagon was able to manipulate. Among equals this tactic might backfire: Your indifference could make you seem callous. Eut with a master, if you act quickly and without great fuss, it can work to great effect: You bypass his angry response, save hirn the time and energy he would waste by brooding over it, and allow hirn the opportunity to display his own lack of pettiness publicly. If we make excuses and denials when we are caught in amistake or a deception, we stir the waters and make the situation worse. It is often wiser to play things the opposite way. The Renaissance writer Pietro Aretino often boasted of his aristocratic lineage, which was, of course, a fiction, since he was actually the son of a shoemaker. When an enemy of his finally revealed the embarrassing truth, word quickly spread, and soon all of Venice (where he lived at the time) was aghast at Aretino's lies. Had he tried to defend hirnself, he would have only dragged hirnself down. His re­sponse was masterful: He announced that he was indeed the son of a shoe­maker, but this only proved his greatness, since he had risen from the lowest stratum of society to its very pinnacle. From then on he never men­tioned his previous lie, trumpeting instead his new position on the matter of his ancestry. Remember: The powerful responses to niggling, petty annoyances and irritations are contempt and disdain.

He performed his miracles in an enormous converted beer hall, outside which Berliners began to notice ever longer lines of people-the blind, the lame, anyone with an illness in­curable by normal medicine. When it leaked out that the doctor worked by exposing the patient to the rays of the mo on, he soon became dubbed The Moon Doctor of Berlin. Sometime in 1783, it was reported that Dr. Weisleder had cured a well­to-do woman of a terrible ailment. He suddenly became a celebrity. Previ­ously only the poorest Berliners had been seen waiting outside the beer hall in their rags; now magnificent carriages were parked outside, and gen­tlemen in frock coats, and ladies with enormous coiffures, lined the street as sunset drew near. Even folk with the mildest of ailments came, out of sheer curiosity. As they waited in line, the poorer clients would explain to the gentlemen and ladies that the doctor only practiced when the moon was in its increscent phase. Many would add that they themselves had al­ready been exposed to the healing powers he called forth from the rays of the moon. Even those who feIt cured kept coming back, drawn by this powerful experience. Inside the beer hall, astrange and stirring spectacle greeted the visitor: Packed into the entrance hall was a crowd of all classes and ethnic back­grounds, a veritable Tower of Babel. Through tall windows on the northern side of the hall, silvery moonlight poured in at odd angles. The doctor and his wife, who, it seemed, was also able to effect the cure, practiced on the second floor, which was reached by a stairway, at the end of the hall. As the line edged closer to the stairs, the sick would hear shouts and cries from above, and word would spread of, perhaps, a blind gentleman suddenly able to see. Once upstairs, the line would fork in two directions, toward a north­em room for the doctor, a southem one for his wife, who worked only on the ladies. Finally, after hours of anticipation and waiting in line, the gen­tlemen patients would be led before the amazing doctor hirnself, an el­derly man with a few stalks of wild gray hair and an air of nervous energy. He would take the patient (let us say a young boy, brought in by his fa­ther), uncover the afflicted body part, and lift the boy up to the window, which faced the light of the moon. He would rub the site of the injury or illness, mumble something unintelligible, look knowingly at the mo on, and then, after collecting his fee, send the boy and his father on their way. Meanwhile, in the south-facing room, his wife would be doing the same with the ladies-which was odd, really, since the moon cannot appear in two places at once; it cannot have been visible, in other words, from both windows. Apparently the mere thought, idea, and symbol of the moon were enough, for the ladies did not complain, and would later remark confidently that the wife of the Moon Doctor had the same healing powers as he."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"Interpretation Dr. Weisleder may have known nothing about medicine, but he under­stood human nature.

OBSERVANCE OF TRE LAW 11 In 1536 the future king Renri 11 of France took his first mistress, Diane de Poitiers. Diane was thirty-seven at the time, and was the widow of the grand seneschal of Normandy. Renri, meanwhile, was a sprightly lad of seventeen, who was just beginning to sow his wild oats. At first their union seemed merely platonic, with Renri showing an intensely spiritual devo­tion to Diane. But it so on became clear that he loved her in every way, pre­fe rring her bed to that of his young wife, Catherine de' Medicis. In 1547 King Francis died and Renri ascended to the throne. This new situation posed perils for Diane de Poitiers. She had just tumed forty-eight, and despite her notorious cold baths and rumored youth potions, she was beginning to show her age; now that Renri was king, perhaps he would re­turn to the queen's bed, and do as other kings had done--choose mis­tresses from the bevy of beauties who made the French court the envy of Europe. Re was, after all, only twenty-eight, and cut a dashing figure. But Diane did not give up so easily. She would continue to enthrall her lover, as she had enthralled hirn for the past eleven years. Diane's secret weapons were symbols and images, to which she had al­ways paid great attention. Early on in her relationship with Renri, she had created a motif by intertwining her initials with his, to symbolize their union. The idea worked like a charm: Renri put this insignia everywhere-­on his royal robes, on monuments, on churches, on the facade of the where Antony awaited the queen enthroned on his tribunal, unti! at last he was left sitting quite alone. And the word spread on every side that Aphrodite had come to revel with Dionysus for the happiness of Asia. Antony then sent a message inviting Cleopatra to dine with him. But she thought it more appropriate that he should come to her, and so, as he wished to show his courtesy and goodwill, he accepted and went. He found the preparations made to receive him magnificent bey(md words, but what astonished him most of all was the extraordinary number of lights. 50 many of these, it is said, were let down from the roof and displayed on all sides at once, and they were arranged and grouped in such inge­nious patterns in rela­tion to each other, some in squares and some in eire/es, that they created as brilliant a spectae/e as can ever have been devised to delight the eye.

Diane's favorite colors were black and white, which she wore exclusively, and wherever it was possible the in­signia appeared in these colors. Everyone recognized the symbol and its meaning. Soon after Renri took the throne, however, Diane went still fur­ther: She decided to identify herself with the Roman goddess Diana, her namesake. Diana was the goddess of the hunt, the traditional royal pastime and the particular passion of Renri. Equally important, in Renaissance art she symbolized chastity and purity. For a woman like Diane to identify her­self with this goddess would instantly call up those images in the court, giv­ing her an air of respectability. Symbolizing her \"chaste\" relationship with Renri, it would also set her apart from the adulterous liaisons of royal mis­tresses past. To effect this association, Diane began by completely transforming her castle at Anet. She razed the building's structure and in its place erected a magnificent Doric-columned edifice modeled after a Roman temple. It was made in white Normandy stone flecked with black silex, reproducing Diane's trademark colors of black and white. The insignia of her and Renri's initials appeared on the columns, the doors, the windows, the car­pet. Meanwhile, symbols of Diana-crescent moons, stags, and hounds­adorned the gates and fa cade. Inside, enormous tapestries depicting episodes in the life of the goddess lay on the floors and hung on the walls. In the garden stood the famous Goujon sculpture Diane Chasseresse, which is now in the Louvre, and which had an uncanny resemblance to Diane de Poitiers. Paintings and other depictions of Diana appeared in every corner of the castle. Anet overwhelmed Renri, who soon was trumpeting the image of Diane de Poitiers as a Roman goddess. In 1548, when the couple appeared together in Lyons for a royal celebration, the townspeople welcomed them with a tableau vivant depicting a scene with Diana the huntress. France's greatest poet of the period, Pierre de Ronsard, began to write verses in honor of Diana-indeed a kind of cult of Diana sprang up, all inspired by the king's mistress. It seemed to Renri that Diane had given herself a kind of divine aura, and as if he were destined to worship her for the rest of his life. And until his death, in 1559, he did remain fa ithful to her-making her a duchess, giving her untold wealth, and displaying an almost religious de­votion to his first and only mistress. Interpretation Diane de Poitiers, a woman fr om a modest bourgeois background, man­aged to captivate Renri for over twenty years. By the time he died she was weH into her sixties, yet his passion for her only increased with the years. She knew the king well. Re was not an inteHectual but a lover of the out­doors-he particularly loved jousting tournaments, with their bright pen­nants, brilliantly caparisoned horses, and beautifully dressed women. Renri's love of visual splendor seemed childlike to Diane, and she played on this weakness of his at every opportunity."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"Most astute of all was Diane's appropriation of the goddess Diana. Here she took the game beyond physical imagery into the realm of the psy­chic symbol. It was quite a feat to transform a king's mistress into an em­blem of power and purity, but she managed it. Without the resonance of the goddess, Diane was merely an aging courtesan. With the imagery and symbolism of Diana on her shoulders, she seemed a mythic force, destined for greatness. You too can play with images like these, weaving visual clues into an encompassing gestalt, as Diane did with her colors and her insignia. Estab­lish a trademark like these to set yourself apart. Then take the game fur­ther: Find an image or symbol from the past that will neatly fit your situation, and put it on your shoulders like a cape. It will make you seem larger than life.

Louis XlV, the Sun King, 1638-1715 KEYS TO POWER Using words to plead your case is risky business: Words are dangerous in­struments, and often go astray. The words people use to persuade us virtu­ally invite us to reflect on them with words of our OWO; we mull them over, and often end up believing the opposite of what they say. (That is part of our perverse nature.) It also happens that words offend us, stirring up asso­ciations unintended by the speaker. The visual, on the other hand, short-circuits the labyrinth of words. It strikes with an emotional power and immediacy that leave no gaps for re­flection and doubt. Like music, it leaps right over rational, reasonable thoughts. Imagine the Moon Doctor trying to make a case for his medical practice, trying to convince the unconverted by telling them about the healing powers of the moon, and about his owo special connection to a dis­tant object in the sky. Fortunately for hirn, he was able to create a com­pelling spectacle that made words unnecessary. The moment his patients entered the beer hall, the image of the moon spoke eloquently enough. Understand: Words put you on the defensive. If you have to explain yourself your power is already in question. The image, on the other hand, imposes itself as a given. It discourages questions, creates forcehll associa­tions, resists unintended interpretations, communicates instantly, and forges bonds that transcend social differences. Words stir up arguments and divisions; images bring people together. They are the quintessential in­struments of power. The symbol has the same force, whether it is visual (the statue of There was a man named Sakamotoya Hechigwan who lived in upper Kyoto .... When [Emperor] Hideyoshi gave his great Cha-no-yu [tea ceremony] meeting at Kitano in the tenth month of 1588, Hechig­wan set up a great red umbrella nine feet across mounted on a stick seven feet high. The circumference of the handle he surraunded for about two feet by a reed fence in such a way that the rays of the sun were refiected fram it and diffused the colour of the umbrella all around. This device pleased Hideyoshi so much that he remitted Hechigwan's taxes as a reward. CHA-NO-YU: THE JAPANESE TEA CEREMONY, A. L. SADLER, 1962 LAW 37 313"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"314 LAW 37 Diana) or a verbal description of something visual (the words \"the Sun King\"). The symbolic object stands for something else, something abstract (such as the image \"Diana\" standing for chastity). The abstract concept­purity, patriotism, courage, love-is full of emotional and powerful associa­tions. The symbol is a shortcut of expression, containing dozens of meanings in one simple phrase or object. The symbol of the Sun King, as explained by Louis XIV, can be read on many layers, but the beauty of it is that its associations required no explanation, spoke immediately to his sub­jects, distinguished him fr om allother kings, and conjured up a kind of majesty that went far beyond the words themselves. The symbol contains untold power. The first step in using symbols and images is to understand the pri­macy of sight among the senses. Before the Renaissance, it has been ar­gued, sight and the other senses-taste, touch, and so on-operated on a relatively equal plane. Since then, however, the visual has come to domi­nate the others, and is the sense we most depend on and trust. As Graciän said, \"The truth is generally seen, rarely heard.\" When the Renaissance painter Fra Filippo Lippi was a captured slave among the Moors, he won his fr eedom by sketching a drawing of his master on a white wall with a piece of charcoal; when the owner saw the drawing, he instantly under­stood the power of a man who could make such images, and let Fra Lippi go. That one image was far more powerful than any argument the artist could have made with words. Never neglect the way you arrange things visually. Factors like color, for example, have enormous symbolic resonance. When the con artist Yel­low Kid Weil created a newsletter touting the phony stocks he was ped­dling, he called it the \"Red Letter Newsletter\" and had it printed, at considerable expense, in red ink. The color created a sense of urgency, power, and good fortune. Weil recognized details like these as keys to de­ception-as do modem advertisers and mass-marketers. If you use \"gold\" in the title of anything you are trying to sell, for example, print it in gold. . Since the eye predominates, people will respond more to the color than to theword. The visual contains great emotional power. The Roman emperor Con­stantine worshipped the sun as a god for most of his life; one day, though, he looked up at the sun, and saw a cross superimposed on it. The vision of the cross over the sun proved to hirn the ascendancy of the new religion, and he converted not just hirnself but the whole Roman Empire to Chris­tianity soon thereafter. All the preaching and proselytizing in the world could not have been as powerful. Find and associate yourself with the im­ages and symbols that will communicate in this immediate way today, and you will have untold power. Most effective of all is a new combination-a fusion of images and sym­bols that have not been seen together before, but that through their associ­ation clearly demonstrate your new idea, message, religion. The creation of new images and symbols out of old ones in this way has a poetic effect­viewers' associations run rampant, giving them a sense of participation."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"Visual images often appear in a sequence, and the order in which they ap pear creates a symbol. The first to appear, for instance, symbolizes power; the image at the center seems to have central importance. Near the end of World War 11, orders came down fr om General Eisen­hower that American troops were to lead the way into Paris after its liber­ation fr om the Nazis. The French general Charles de Gaulle, however, realized that this sequence would imply that the Americans now com­manded the fate of France. Through much manipulation, de Gaulle made certain that he and the French Second Armored Division would appear at the head of the liberating fo rce. The strategy worked: After he had success­fuHy pulled off this stunt, the Allies started treating hirn as the new leader of an independent France. De Gaulle knew that a leader has to locate him­self literally at the head of his troops. This visual association is crucial to the emotional response that he needs to elicit. Things change in the game of symbols: It is probably no longer possi­ble to pose as a \"sun king,\" or to wrap the mantIe of Diana around you. Yet you can associate yourself with such symbols more indirectIy. And, of course, you can make your own mythology out of figures fr om more re­cent history, people who are comfortably dead but still powerfully associa­tive in the public eye. The idea is to give yourself an aura, astature that your normal banal appearance simply will not create. By herself Diane de Poitiers had no such radiant powers; she was as human and ordinary as most of uso But the symbol elevated her above the human lot, and made her seem divine. Using symbols also has a courtier-like effe ct, since they are often gen­tIer than brutish words. The psychotherapist Dr. Milton H. Erickson al­ways tried to find symbols and images that would communicate to the patient in ways that words could not. When dealing with a severely trou­bied patient, he would not question hirn directIy but would talk about something irrelevant, such as driving through the desert in Arizona, where he practiced in the 1950s. In describing this he would eventually come to an appropriate symbol for what he suspected was the man's problem. Ifhe feIt the patient was isolated, say, Dr. Erickson would talk of a single iron­wood tree, and how its isolation left it battered by the winds. Making an emotional connection with the tree as a symbol, the patient would open up more readily to the doctor's probing. Use the power of symbols as a way to rally, animate, and unite your troops or team. During the rebellion against the French crown in 1648, those loyal to the king disparaged the rebels by comparing them to the slingshots (in French,frondes) that littIe boys use to frighten big boys. Cardi­nal de Retz decided to turn this disparaging term into the rebels' symbol: The uprising was now known as the Fronde, and the rebels as frondeurs. They began to wear sashes in their hats that symbolized the slingshot, and the word became their rallying cry. Without it the rebellion might weIl have petered out.

BALTASAR GRACIÄN, 16() 1�1658 818 LAW 38 TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW Around the year 478 B.C., the city of Sparta sent an expedition to Persia led by the young Spartan nobleman Pausanias. The city-states of Greece had recently fought off a mighty invasion from Persia, and now Pausanias, along with allied ships fr om Athens, had orders to punish the invaders and win back the islands and coastal towns that the Persians had occupied. Both the Athenians and the Spartans had great respect for Pausanias-he had proven hirnself as a fearless warrior, with a flair for the dramatic. With amazing speed, Pausanias and his troops took Cyprus, then moved on to the mainland of Asia Minor known as the Hellespont and captured Byzantium (modem-day Istanbul). Now master of part of the Per­sian empire, Pausanias began to show signs of behavior that went beyond his normal flamboyance. He appeared in public wearing pomades in his hair and flowing Persian robes, and accompanied by a bodyguard of Egyp­tians. He held lavish banquets in which he sat in the Persian manner and demanded to be entertained. He stopped seeing his old fr iends, entered into communication with the Persian King Xerxes, and all in all affected the style and manner of a Persian dictator. Clearly power and success had gone to Pausanias's head. His army­Athenians and Spartans alike-at first thought this a passing fancy: He had always been a bit exaggerated in his gestures. But when he flaunted his dis­dain for the Greeks' simple way of life, and insulted the common Greek soldier, they began to feel he had gone too far. Although there was no con­crete evidence for this, rumors spread that he had gone over to the other side, and that he dreamed of becoming a kind of Greek Xerxes. To quell the possibility of mutiny, the Spartans relieved Pausanias of his command and called hirn horne. Pausanias, however, continued to dress in the Persian style, even in Sparta. After a few months he independently hired a trireme and retumed to the Hellespont, telling his compatriots he was going to continue the fight against the Persians. Actually, however, he had different plans-to make hirnself ruler of all Greece, with the aid of Xerxes hirnself. The Spartans dedared hirn a public enemy and sent a ship to capture hirn. Pausanias sur­rendered, certain that he could dear hirnself of the charges of treason. It did come out during the trial that during his reign as commander he had offended his fellow Greeks time and again, erecting monuments, for in­stance, in his own name, rather than in those of the cities whose troops had fought alongside hirn, as was the custom. Yet Pausanias proved right: De­spite the evidence of his numerous contacts with the enemy, the Spartans refused to imprison a man of such noble birth, and let hirn go. Now thinking hirnself untouchable, Pausanias hired a messenger to take a letter to Xerxes, but the messenger instead took the letter to the Spartan authorities. These men wanted to find out more, so they had the messenger arrange to meet Pausanias in atempIe where they could hide and listen behind a partition. What Pausanias said shocked them-they had never heard such contempt for their ways spoken so brazenly by one of their own-and they made arrangements for his immediate arrest."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"On his way horne fr om the temple, Pausanias got word of what had happened. He ran to another temple to hide, but the authorities followed him there and placed sentries all around. Pausanias refused to surrender. Unwilling to fo rcibly remove hirn fr om the sacred temple, the authorities kept hirn trapped inside, until he eventually died of starvation. Interpretation At first glance it might seem that Pausanias simply fe ll in love with another culture, a phenomenon as old as time. Never comfortable with the asceti­cism of the Spartans, he found hirnself enthralled by the Persian love of luxury and sensual pleasure. He put on Persian robes and perfumes with a sense of deliverance fr om Greek discipline and simplicity. This is how it appears when people adopt a culture in which they were not raised. Often, however, there is also something else at play: People who flaunt their infatuation with a diffe rent culture are expressing a dis­dain and contempt for their own. They are using the outward appearance of the exotic to separate themselves from the common folk who unques­tioningly follow the local customs and laws, and to express their sense of superiority. Otherwise they would act with more dignity, showing respect for those who do not share their desires. Indeed their need to show their difference so dramatically often makes them disliked by the people whose beliefs they challenge, indirectly and subtly, perhaps, but offensively nonetheless. As Thucydides wrote of Pausanias, \"By his contempt for the laws and his imitation of foreign ways he had made hirnself very widely suspected of being unwilling to abide by normal standards.\" Cultures have norms that reflect centuries of shared beliefs and ideals. Do not expect to scoff at such things with impunity. You will be punished somehow, even if just through isolation-a position of real powerlessness. Many of us, like Pausanias, fe el the siren call of the exotic, the fo reign. Measure and moderate this desire. Flaunting your pleasure in alien ways of thinking and acting will reveal a different motive--to demonstrate your su­periority over your fe llows.

The Counter-Reformation, as it was called, included its own version of the Inquisition to root out all deviations fr om the Catholic Church.

A follower of the materialist doctrine of the Roman philosopher Epi­cums, Campanella did not believe in miracles, or in heaven and hell.

When he tried to talk to them, he real­ized that they thought that he was mad, and they showed hostility or compassion, not under­standing. At first he drank none of the new water, but went back to his concealment, to draw on his supplies, every day. Finally, however, he took the decision to drink the new water because he could not bear the loneliness of living, behaving and thinking in a different way fram everyone else. He drank the new water, and became like the rest.

TALES OF THE DERVISHES, IDRIES SHAH, 1967 320 LAW 38 into prison for his heretical beliefs. Six years later, as a form of partial re­lease, he was confined to a monastery in Naples. Southem Italy was controlled by Spain at the time, and in Naples Campanella became involved in a plot to fight and throw out these in­vaders. His hope was to establish an independent republic based on his own ideas of utopia. The leaders of the Italian Inquisition, working with their Spanish counterparts, had hirn imprisoned again. This time they also tortured hirn, to discover the true nature ofhis impious beliefs : He was sub­jected to the infamous la veglia, a torture in which he was suspended by his arms in a squatting position a few inches above a seat studded with spikes. The posture was impossible to sustain, and in time the victim would end up sitting on the spikes, which would tear his flesh at the slightest contact. During these years, however, Campanella leamed something about power. Facing the prospect of execution for heresy, he changed his strat­egy: He would not renounce his beliefs, yet he knew he had to disguise their outward appearance. To save his life, Campanella fe igned madness. He let his inquisitors imagine that his beliefs stemmed fr om an incontrollable unsoundness of mind. For a while the tortures continued, to see if his insanity was faked, but in 1603 his sentence was commuted to life in prison. The first four years of this he spent chained to a wall in an underground dungeon. De­spite such conditions, he continued to write--although no longer would he be so foolish as to express his ideas directly. One book of Campanella's, The Hispanic Monarchy, promoted the idea that Spain had a divine mission to expand its powers around the world, and offered the Spanish king practical, Machiavelli-type advice for achiev­ing this. Despite his own interest in Machiavelli, the book in general pre­sented ideas completely the opposite to his own. The Hispanic Monarchy was in fact a ploy, an attempt to show his conversion to orthodoxy in the bold­est manner possible. It worked: In 1626, six years after its publication, the pope finally let Campanella out of prison. Shortly after gaining his fr eedom, Campanella wrote Atheism Co n­quered, a book attacking 'free-thinkers, Machiavellians, Calvinists, and heretics of all stripes. The book is written in the form of debates in which heretics express their beliefs and are countered by arguments for the supe­riority of Catholicism. Campanella had obviously reformed-his book made that dear. Or did it? The arguments in the mouths of the heretics had never before been expressed with such verve and freshness. Pretending to present their side only to knock it down, Campanella actually summarized the case against Catholicism with striking passion. When he argued the other side, suppos­edly his side, on the other hand, he resorted to stale dicbes and convoluted rationales. Brief and eloquent, the heretics' arguments seemed bold and sincere. The lengthy arguments for Catholicism seemed tiresome and un­convincing. Catholics who read the book found it disturbing and ambiguous, but"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"they could not claim it was heretical, or that Campanella should be re­tumed to prison. His defense of Catholicism, after all, used arguments they had used themselves. Ye t in the years to come, Atheism Conqueredbecame a bible for atheists, Machiavellians and libertines who used the arguments Campanella had put in their mouths to defend their dangerous ideas. Com­bining an outward display of conformity with an expression of his true be­liefs in a way that his sympathizers would understand, Campanella showed that he had learned his lesson. Interpretation In the face of awesome persecution, Campanella devised three strate­gie moves that saved his hide, freed hirn from prison, and allowed hirn to continue to express his beliefs. First he feigned madness--the medieval equivalent of disavowing responsibility for one's actions, like blaming one's parents today. Next he wrote a book that expressed the exact oppo­site of his own beliefs. Finally, and most brilliantly of all, he disguised his ideas while insinuating them at the same time. It is an old but powerful triek: You pretend to disagree with dangerous ideas, but in the course of your disagreement you give those ideas expression and exposure. Yo u seem to conform to the prevailing orthodoxy, but those who know will un­derstand the irony involved. You are protected. It is inevitable in society that certain values and customs lose contact with their original motives and become oppressive. And there will always be those who rebel against such oppression, harboring ideas far ahead of their time. As Campanella was forced to realize, however, there is no point in making a display of your dangerous ideas if they only bring you suffer­ing and persecution. Martyrdom serves no purpose--better to live on in an oppressive world, even to thrive in it. Meanwhile find a way to express your ideas subtly for those who understand you. Laying your pearls before swine will only bring you trouble.

VOLTAIRE, 1694-1778 322 LAW 38 ority of their values and beliefs. In the end, though, their arguments con­vince only a few and offend a great deal more. The reason arguments do not work is that most people hold their ideas and values without thinking about them. There is a strong emotional content in their beliefs : They re­ally do not want to have to rework their habits of thinking, and when you challenge them, whether directly through your arguments or indirectly through your behavior, they are hostile. Wise and clever people learn early on that they can display conven­tional behavior and mouth conventional ideas without having to believe in them. The power these people gain fr om blending in is that of being left alone to have the thoughts they want to have, and to express them to the people they want to express them to, without suffering isolation or os­tracism. Once they have established themselves in a position of power, they can try to convince a wider circle of the correctness of their ideas-­perhaps working indirectly, using Campanella's strategies of irony and in­sinuation. In the late fourteenth century, the Spanish began a massive persecu­tion of the Jews, murdering thousands and driving others out of the coun­try. Those who remained in Spain were forced to convert. Yet over the next three hundred years, the Spanish noticed a phenomenon that disturbed them: Many of the converts lived their outward lives as Catholics, yet somehow managed to retain their Jewish beliefs, practicing the religion in private. Many of these so-called Marranos (originally a derogatory term, being the Spanish for \"pig\") attained high levels of govemment office, mar­ried into the nobility, and gave every appearance of Christian piety, only to be discovered late in life as practicing Jews. (The Spanish Inquisition was specifically commissioned to fe rret them out.) Over the years they mastered the art of dissimulation, displaying crucifixes liberally, giving generous gifts to churches, even occasionally making anti-Semitic remarks-and all the while maintaining their inner fr eedom and beliefs. In society, the Marranos knew, outward appearances are what matter. This remains true today. The strategy is simple: As Campanella did in writ­ing Atheism Conquered, make a show of bIen ding in, even going so far as to be the most zealous advocate of the prevailing orthodoxy. If you stick to conventional appearances in public few will believe you think differently in private. Do not be so foolish as to imagine that in our own time the old ortho­doxies are gone. Jonas Salk, for instance, thought science had gotten past politics and protocol. And so, in his search for a polio vaccine, he broke all the rules-going public with a discovery before showing it to the scientific community, taking credit for the vaccine without acknowledging the scien­tists who had paved the way, making hirnself a star. The public may have loved hirn but scientists shunned hirn. His disrespect for his community's orthodoxies left hirn isolated, and he wasted years trying to heal the breach, and struggling for funding and cooperation. Bertolt Brecht underwent a modem form of Inquisition-the House"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Un-American Activities Committee-and approached it with considerable canniness. Having worked off and on in the American film industry during World War 11, in 1947 Brecht was summoned to appear before the commit­tee to answer questions on his suspected Communist sympathies. Other writers called before the committee made a point of attacking its members, and of acting as belligerently as possible in order to gain sympathy for themselves. Brecht, on the other hand, who had actually worked stead-. fastly for the Communist cause, played the opposite game: He answered questions with ambiguous generalities that defied easy interpretation. Call it the Campanella strategy. Brecht even wore a suit-a rare event for him­and made a point of smoking a cigar during the proceedings, knowing that a key committee member had a passion for cigars. In the end he charmed the committee members, who let hirn go scot-free. Brecht then moved to East Germany, where he encountered a differ­ent kind of Inquisition. Here the Communists were in power, and they crit­icized his plays as decadent and pessimistic. He did not argue with them, but made small changes in the performance scripts to shut them up. Mean­while he managed to preserve the published texts as written. His outward conformity in both cases gave hirn the freedom to work unhindered, with­out having to change his thinking. In the end, he made his way safely through dangerous times in different countries through the use of little dances of orthodoxy, and proved he was more powerful than the forces of repression. Not only do people of power avoid the offenses of Pausanias and Salk, they also leam to play the clever fox and feign the common touch. This has been the ploy of con artists and politicians throughout the centuries. Lead­ers like Julius Caesar and Franklin D. Roosevelt have overcome their nat­ural aristocratic stance to cultivate a familiarity with the common man. They have expressed this familiarity in little gestures, often symbolic, to show the people that their leaders share popular values, despite their differ­ent status. The logical extension of this practice is the invaluable ability to be all things to all people. When you go into society, leave behind your own ideas and values, and put on the mask that is most appropriate for the group in which you find yourself. Bismarck played this game successfully for years-there were people who vaguely understood what he was up to, but not clearly enough that it mattered. People will swallow the bait be­cause it flatters them to believe that you share their ideas. They will not take you as a hypocrite if you are careful-for how can they accuse you of hypocrisy ifyou do not let them know exactly what you stand for? Nor will they see you as lacking in values. Of course you have values-the values you share with them, while in their company.

His spies and confidants had confirmed a rumor that his fo reign minister Ta lleyrand had conspired against hirn with Fouche, the minister of police. Immediatelyon arriving in the capital the shocked emperor summoned his ministers to the palace. Following them into the meeting right after their arrival, he began pacing up and down, and started rambling vaguely about plotters working against hirn, specula­tors bringing down the stock market, legislators delaying his policies-and his own ministers undermining hirn, As Napoleon talked, Ta lleyrand leaned on the mantelpiece, looking completely indifferent. Facing Ta lleyrand directly, Napoleon announced, \"For these ministers, treason has begun when they permit themselves to doubt.\" At the word \"treason\" the ruler expected his minister to be afraid, But Ta lleyrand only smiled, calm and bored. The sight of a subordinate apparently serene in the fa ce of charges that could get hirn hanged pushed Napoleon to the edge. There were ministers, he said, who wanted hirn dead, and he took a step doser to Ta lleyrand­who stared back at hirn unfazed. Finally Napoleon exploded. \"You are a coward,\" he screamed in Ta lleyrand's face, \"a man of no faith. Nothing is sacred to you. You would sell your own father. 1 have showered you with riches and yet there is nothing you would not do to hurt me.\" The other ministers looked at each other in disbelief-they had never seen this fe ar­less general, the conqueror of most of Europe, so unhinged. \"You deserve to be broken like glass,\" Napoleon continued, stamping, \"I have the power to do it, but 1 have too much contempt for you to bother. Why didn't 1 have you hanged fr om the gates of the Tu ileries? But there is still time for that.\" Ye lling, almost out of breath, his face red, his eyes bulging, he went on, \"You, by the way, are nothing but shit in a silk stock­ing .. , .

A page had been tumed: For the first time people had seen the great emperor lose his cool under fire. A fe eling spread that he was on the way down. As Ta lleyrand later said, \"This is the beginning of the end.\""},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Interpretation This was indeed the beginning of the end. Waterloo was still six years ahead, but Napoleon was on a slow descent to defeat, crystallizing in 1812 with his disastrous invasion of Russia. Talleyrand was the first to see the signs of his decline, especially in the irrational war with Spain. Sometime in 1808, the minister decided that fo r the future peace of Europe, Napoleon had to go. And so he conspired with Fouche. It is possible that the conspiracy was never anything more than a ploy-a device to push Napoleon over the edge. For it is hard to believe that two of the most practical men in history would only go halfway in their plotting. They may have been only stirring the waters, trying to goad Napoleon into a misstep. And indeed, what they got was the tantrum that laid out his loss of control for all to see. In fa ct, Napoleon's soon-famous blowup that afternoon had a profoundly negative effect on his public image. This is the problem with the angry response. At first it may strike fe ar and terror, but only in some, and as the days pass and the storm clears, other responses emerge-embarrassment and uneasiness about the shouter's capacity for going out of control, and resentrnent of what has been said. Losing your temper, you always make unfair and exaggerated accusations. A fe w such tirades and people are counting the days until you are gone. In the fa ce of a conspiracy against hirn, a conspiracy between his two most important ministers, Napoleon certainly had a right to feel angry and anxious. Eut by responding so angrily, and so publicly, he only demon­strated his frustration. To show your frustration is to show that you have lost your power to shape events; it is the helpless action of the child who re­sorts to a hysterical fit to get his way. The powerful never reveal this kind of weakness. There were a number of things Napoleon could have done in this situ­ation. He could have thought about the fact that two eminently sensible men had had reason to turn against hirn, and could have listened and learned from them. He could have tried to win them back to hirn. He could even have gotten rid of them, making their imprisonment or death an omi­nous display of his power. No tirades, no childish fits, no embarrassing after-effects-just a quiet and definitive severing of ties. Remember: Tantrums neither intimidate nor inspire loyalty. They only create doubts and uneasiness about your power. Exposing your weak­ness, these stormy eruptions often herald a fall.

Selassie knew the royal couple hated hirn and wanted to get rid of hirn, so to cut short their plotting he made Gugsa the governor of the northern province of Begemeder, fo rcing hirn to leave the capital, where the empress lived. For several years Gugsa played the loyal administrator_ But Selassie did not trust hirn: He knew that Gugsa and the empress were plotting re­venge_ As time passed and Gugsa made no move, the chances of a plot only increased. Selassie knew what he had to do: draw Gugsa out, get under his skin, and push hirn into action before he was ready. For several years, a northern tribe, the Azebu Gallas, had been in vir­tual rebellion against the throne, robbing and pillaging local villages and refusing to pay taxes. Selassie had done nothing to stop them, letting them grow stronger. Finally, in 1929, he ordered Ras Gugsa to lead an army against these disobedient tribesmen. Gugsa agreed, but inwardly he seethed-he had no grudge against the Azebu Gallas, and the demand that he fight them hurt his pride. He could not disobey the order, but as he worked to put together an army, he began to spread an ugly rumor-that Selas sie was in cahoots with the pope, and planned to convert the country to Roman Catholicism and make it a colony of Italy_ Gugsa's army swelled, and some of the tribes fr om which its soldiers came secretly agreed to fight Selas sie. In March of 1930 an enormous force of 35,000 men began to march, not on the Azebu Gallas but south, toward the capital of Addis Ababa. Made confident by his growing strength, Gugsa now openly led a holy war to depose Selas sie and put the country back in the hands of true Christians. He did not see the trap that had been laid for hirn. Before Selassie had ordered Gugsa to fight the Azebu Gallas, he had secured the support of the Ethiopian church. And before the revolt got underway, he had bribed sev­eral of Gugsa's key allies not to show up for battle. As the rebel army marched south, airplanes flew overhead dropping leaflets announcing that the highest church officials had recognized Selassie as the true Christian leader of Ethiopia, and that they had excommunicated Gugsa for foment­ing a civil war. These leaflets severely blunted the emotions behind the holy crusade. And as battle loomed and the support that Gugsa's allies had promised hirn failed to show up, soldiers began to flee or defect. When the battle came, the rebel army quicky collapsed. Refusing to surrender, Ras Gugsa was killed in the fighting. The empress, distraught over her husband's death, died a few days later. On April 30, Selassie is­sued a formal proclarnation announcing his new title: Emperor of Ethiopia. Interpretation Haile Selassie always saw several moves ahead. He knew that if he let Ras Gugsa decide the time and place of the revolt, the danger would be much greater than ifhe forced Gugsa to act on Selassie's terms.

KEYS TO POWER Angry people usually end up looking ridiculous, for their response seems out of proportion to what occasioned it. They have taken things too seri­ously, exaggerating the hurt or insult that has been done to them. They are so sensitive to slight that it becomes comical how much they take person­ally. More comical still is their belief that their outbursts signify power. The truth is the opposite: Petulance is not power, it is a sign of helplessness. People may temporarily be cowed by your tantrums, hut in the end they lose respect for you. They also realize they can easily undermine a person with so little self-control. The answer, however, is not to repress our angry or emotional re­sponses. For repression drains us of energy and pushes us into strange be­havior. Instead we have to change our perspective: We have to realize that nothing in the sodal realm, and in the game of power, is personal. Everyone is caught up in a chain of events that long predates the pre­sent moment. Our anger often sterns from problems in our childhood, from the problems of our parents which stern from their own childhood, on and on. Our anger also has roots in the many interactions with others, the accumulated disappointments and heartaches that we have suffered. An in­dividual will often appear as the instigator of our anger but it is much more complicated, goes far beyond what that individual did to uso If a person ex­plodes with anger at you (and it seems out of proportion to what you did to them), you must remind yourself that it is not exclusively directed at you­do not be so vain.

This shift of perspective will let you play the game of power with more clarity and energy.

During an important batde in the War of the Three Kingdoms, in the third century A.D., advisers to the commander Ts'ao Ts'ao discovered docu­ments showing that certain of his generals had conspired with the enemy, and urged hirn to arrest and execute them. Instead he ordered the docu­ments bumed and the matter fo rgotten. At this critical moment in the bat­de, to get upset or demand justice would have reverberated against hirn: An angry action would have called attention to the generals' disloyalty, which would have harmed the troops' morale. Justice could wait-he would deal with the generals in time. Ts'ao Ts'ao kept his head and made the right decision. Compare this to Napoleon's response to Talleyrand: Instead of taking the conspiracy personally, the emperor should have played the game like Ts'ao Ts'ao, carefully weighing the consequences of any action he took. The more powerful response in the end would have been to ignore Tal­leyrand, or to bring the minister gradually back to his side and punish him later. Anger only cuts off our options, and the powerful cannot thrive with­out options. Once you train yourself not to take matters personally, and to control your emotional responses, you will have placed yourself in a posi­tion of tremendous power: Now you can play with the emotional responses of other people. Stir the insecure into action by impugning their manhood, and by dangling the prospect of an easy victory before their faces. Do as Houdini did when challenged by the less successful escape artist Kleppini: Reveal an apparent weakness (Houdini let Kleppini steal the combination for a pair of cuffs ) to lure your opponent into action. Then you can beat hirn with ease. With the arrogant too you can appear weaker than you are, taunting them into a rash action. Sun Pin, commander of the armies of Ch'i and loyal disciple of Sun­tzu, once led his troops against the armies of Wei, which outnumbered hirn two to one. \"Let us light a hundred thousand fires when our army enters Wei,\" suggested Sun Pin, \"fifty thousand on the next day, and only thirty thousand on the third.\" On the third day the Wei general exclaimed, \"I knew the men of Ch'i were cowards, and after only three days more than half of them have deserted!\" So, leaving behind his slow-moving heavy in­fa ntry, the general decided to seize the moment and move swiftly on the Ch'i camp with a lighdy armed force. Sun Pin's troops retreated, luring Wei's army into a narrow pass, where they ambushed and destroyed them. With the Wei general dead and his forces decimated, Sun Pin now easily defeated the rest of his army. In the face of a hot-headed enemy, finally, an excellent response is no response. Follow the Talleyrand tactic: Nothing is as infuriating as a man who keeps his cool while others are losing theirs. If it will work to your ad­vantage to unsettle people, affect the aristocratic, bored pose, neither mocking nor triumphant but simply indifferent. This will light their fuse."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"When they embarrass themselves with a temper tantrum, you will have gained several victories, one of these being that in the face of their childish­ness you have maintained your dignity and composure. Image: The Pond of Fish. The waters are clear and calm, and the fish are weIl below the surface. Stir the waters and they emerge. Stir it so me more and they get angry, rising to the surface, biting whatever comes near­including a fr eshly baited hook. Authority: If your opponent is of a hot temper, try to irritate hirn. If he is arrogant, try to encourage his egotism. . . . One who is skilled at making the enemy move does so by creating a situation according to which the enemy will act; he entices the enemy with something he is certain to take. He keeps the enemy on the move by holding out bait and then attacks hirn with picked troops. (Sun-tzu, fo urth century B.C.) REVERSAL When playing with people's emotions you have to be careful. Study the enemy beforehand: Some fish are best left at the bottom of the pond. The leaders of the city of Ty re, capital of ancient Phoenicia, fe It confi­dent they could withstand Alexander the Great, who had conquered the Orient but had not attacked their city, which stood weIl protected on the water. They sent ambassadors to Alexander saying that although they would recognize hirn as emperor they would not allow hirn or his forces to enter Ty re. This of course enraged hirn, and he immediately mounted a siege. For fo ur months the city withstood hirn, and finally he decided that the struggle was not worth it, and that he would come to tenns with the Ty rians.

Yo u can bait the powerful and get them to commit and divide their fo rces as Sun Pin did, but test the waters first. Find the gap in their strength. If there is no gap-if they are impossibly strong-you have nothing to gain and everything to lose by provoking them. Choose carefully whom you bait, and never stir up the sharks. Finally there are times when a well-timed burst of anger can do you good, but your anger must be manufactured and under your control. Then you can determine exactly how and on whom it will fall.

What is offered for fr ee or at bargain rates often comes with a psychological price tag-complicated feelings of obligation, com­promises with quality, the insecurity those compromises bring, on and on. The powerfullearn early to protect their most valuable resources: indepen­dence and room to maneuver. By paying the full price, they keep them­selves free of dangerous entanglements and worries. Being open and flexible with money also teaches the value of strategie generosity, a variation on the old trick of \"giving when you are about to take.\" By giving the appropriate gift, you put the recipient under obliga­tion. Generosity softens people up--to be deceived. By gaining a reputa­tion for liberality, you win people's admiration while distracting them from your power plays. By strategically spreading your wealth, you charm the other courtiers, creating pleasure and making valuable allies. Look at the masters of power-the Caesars, the Qu een Elizabeths, the Michelangelos, the Medicis: Not a miser among them. Even the great con artists spend freely to swindle. Tight purse strings are unattractive--when engaged in seduction, Casanova would give completely not only of himself but of his wallet. The powerful understand that money is psychologically charged, and that it is also avessei of politeness and sociability. They make the human side of money a weapon in their armory. For everyone able to play with money, thousands more are locked in a self-destructive refusal to use money creatively and strategically. These types represent the opposite pole to the powerful, and you must leam to recognize them-either to avoid their poisonous natures or to turn their in­flexibility to your advantage: The Greedy Fish. The greedy fish take the human side out of money. Cold and ruthless, they see only the lifeless balance sheet; viewing others solely as either pawns or obstructions in th eir pursuit of wealth, they tram­ple on people's sentiments and alienate valuable allies. No one wants to work with the greedy fish, and over the years they end up isolated, which often proves their undoing. Greedy fish are the con artist's bread and butter: Lured by the bait of easy money, they swallow the ruse hook, line, and sinker. They are easy to deceive, for they spend so much time dealing with numbers (not with peo­pIe) that they become blind to psychology, including their own. Either avoid them before they exploit you or play on their greed to your gain. The Bargain Demon. Powerful people judge everything by what it costs, not just in money but in time, dignity, and peace of mind. And this is ex­actly what Bargain Demons cannot do. Wasting valuable time digging for bargains, they worry endlessly about what they could have gotten else­where for a little less. On top of that, the bargain item they do buy is often shabby; perhaps it needs costly repairs, or will have to be replaced twice as"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"fast as a high-quality item. The costs of these pursuits-not always in money (though the price of a bargain is often deceptive) but in time and peace of mind-discourage normal people from undertaking them, but for the Bargain Demon the bargain is an end in itself. These types might seem to harm only themselves, but their attitudes are contagious: Unless you resist them they will infect you with the inse­eure fe eling that you should have looked harder to find a cheaper price. Don't argue with them or try to change them. Just mentally add up the eost, in time and inner peace if not in hidden financial expense, of the irra­tional pursuit of a bargain. The Sadist. Financial sadists play vicious power games with money as a way of asserting their power. They might, for example, make you wait for money that is owed you, promising you that the check is in the mail. Or if they hire you to work for them, they meddle in every aspect of the job, haggling and giving you ulcers. Sadists seem to think that paying for some­thing gives them the right to torture and abuse the seIler. They have no sense of the courtier element in money. If you are unlucky enough to get involved with this type, accepting a financialloss may be better in the long run than getting entangled in their destructive power games. The Indiscriminate Giver. Generosity has a definite function in power: It attracts people, softens them up, makes allies out of them. But it has to be used strategically, with a definite end in mind. Indiscriminate Givers, on the other hand, are generous because they want to be loved and admired by all. And their generosity is so indiscriminate and needy that it may not have the desired effect: If they give to one and all, why should the recipient fe el special? Attractive as it may seem to make an Indiscriminate Giver your mark, in any involvement with this type you will often feel burdened by their insatiable emotional needs. TRANSGRESSIONS OF THE LAW Tr an sgression I Mter Francisco Pizarro conquered Peru, in 1532, gold from the Incan Em­pire began to pour into Spain, and Spaniards of all classes started dreaming of the instant riches to be had in the New World. The story so on spread of an Indian chief to the east of Peru who once each year would ritually cover himself in gold dust and dive into a lake. Soon word of mouth transformed EI Dorado, the \"Golden Man,\" into an empire called EI Dorado, wealthier than the Incan, where the streets were paved and the buildings inlaid with gold. This elaboration of the story did not seem implausible, for surely a chief who could afford to waste gold dust in a lake must rule a golden em­pire. Soon Spaniards were searching for EI Dorado all over northem South America. from their inability to make a living and their laziness in this respect. They should not occupy themselves with absurdities and untrue stories. THE MUOADDIMAH, IBN KHALDÜN, 1332-1406 TllE MISER A miser, to make sure of his property, sold all that he had and converted it into a great lump of gold, which he hid in a hole in the ground, and went continually to visit and inspect it. This roused the curiosity of one of his workmen, who, suspecting that there was a treasure. when his master's back was turned, went to the spot, and stole it away. When the miser returned and found the place empty, he wept and tore his hair. But a neighbor who saw him in this extravagant griej, and learned the cause of it, said: \"Fret thyselfno longer, but take a stone and put it in the same place, and thin k that it is your lump of gold; for, as you never meant to use it, the one will do you as much good as the other.\" The worth of money is not in its possession, but in its use.

Resplendent in their ar­mors and colorful silks, 340 Spaniards headed east, along with 4,000 Indi­ans to carry supplies and serve as scouts, 4,000 swine, dozens of llamas, and elose to 1,000 dogs. Eut the expedition was so on hit by torrential rain, which rotted its gear and spoiled its food. Meanwhile, as Gonzalo Pizarro questioned the Indians they met along the way, those who seemed to be withholding information, or who had not even heard of the fabulous king­dom, he would torture and fe ed to the dogs. Word of the Spaniards' mur­derousness spread quickly among the Indians, who realized that the only way to avoid Gonzalo's wrath was to make up stories about EI Dorado and send hirn as far away as possible. As Gonzalo and his men followed the leads the Indians gave them, then, they were only led farther into deep jungle. The explorers' spirits sagged. Their uniforms had long since shredded; their armor rusted and they threw it away; their shoes were tom to pieces, forcing them to walk barefoot; the Indian slaves they had set out with had either died or deserted them; they had eaten not only the swine but the hunting dogs and llamas. They lived on roots and fruit. Realizing that they could not continue this way, Pizarro decided to risk river travel, and a barge was built out of rotting wood. Eut the journey down the treacherous Napo River proved no easier. Setting up camp on the river's edge, Gonzalo sent scouts ahead on the barge to find Indian settlements with food. He waited and waited for the scouts to return, only to find out they had de­cided to desert the expedition and continue down the river on their own. The rain continued without end. Gonzalo's men forgot about EI Do­rado; they wanted only to return to Quito. Finally, in August of 1542, a lit­tle over a hundred men, fr om an expedition originally numbering in the thousands, managed to find their way back. To the residents of Quito they seemed to have emerged from hell itself, wrapped in tatters and skins, their bodies covered in sores, and so emaciated as to be unrecognizable. For over a year and a half they had marched in an enormous cirele, two thou­sand miles by foot. The vast sums of money invested in the expedition had yielded nothing-no sign of EI Dorado and no sign of gold. Interpretation Even after Gonzalo Pizarro's disaster, the Spaniards launched expedition after expedition in search of EI Dorado. And like Pizarro the conquistadors would bum and loot villages, torture Indians, endure unimaginable hard­ships, and get no eloser to gold. The money they spent on such expeditions cannot be calculated; yet despite the futility of the search, the lure of the fantasyendured. Not only did the search for EI Dorado cost millions of lives-both In­dian and Spanish-it helped bring the ruin of the Spanish empire. Gold be­came Spain's obsession. The gold that did find its way back to Spain-and a lot did-was reinvested in more expeditions, or in the purehase of luxu­ries, rather than in agriculture or any other productive endeavor.

Transgression 11 In the early eighteenth century, no one stood higher in English society than the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough. The duke, having led suc­cessful campaigns against the French, was considered Europe's premier general and strategist. And his wife, the duchess, after much maneuvering, had established herself as the favorite of Queen Anne, who became ruler of England in 1702. In 1704 the duke's triumph at the Battle of Blenheim made hirn the toast of England, and to honor hirn the queen awarded hirn a large plot of land in the town of Woodstock, and the funds to create a great palace there. Calling his planned horne the Palace of Blenheim, the duke chose as his architect the young John Vanbrugh, a kind of Renais­sance man who wrote plays as weIl as designed buildings. And so con­struction began, in the summer of 1705, with much fanfare and great hopes. Vanbrugh had a dramatist's sense of architecture. His palace was to be a monument to Marlborough's brilliance and power, and was to include artificial lakes, enormous bridges, elaborate gardens, and other fantastical touches. From day one, however, the duchess could not be pleased: She thought Vanbrugh was wasting money on yet another stand of trees; she wanted the palace finished as so on as possible. The duchess tortured Van­brugh and his workmen on every detail. She was consumed with petty maUers; although the government was paying for Blenheim, she counted every penny. Eventually her grumbling, about Blenheim and other things too, created an irreparable rift between her and Queen Anne, who, in 1711, dismissed her fr om the court, ordering her to vacate her ap artments at the royal palace. When the duchess left (fuming over the loss of her position, and also of her royal salary), she emptied the apartment of every fixture down to the brass doorknobs. Over the next ten years, work on Blenheim would stop and start, as the funds became harder to procure from the government. The duchess suspicion of robbing the disciple of his soul.

She quibbled over every carload of stone and bushel of lime, counted every extra yard of iron railing or foot of wainscot, hurling abuse at the wasteful workmen, contractors, and survey­ors. Marlborough, old and weary, wanted nothing more than to settle into the palace in his last years, but the project became bogged down in a swamp of litigation, the workmen suing the duchess for wages, the duchess suing the architect right back. In the midst of this interminable wrangling, the duke died. He had never spent a night in his beloved Blenheim. After Marlborough's death, it becarne clear that he had a vast estate, worth over .E2 million-more than enough to pay for finishing the palace. But the duchess would not relent: She held back Vanbrugh's wages as weIl as the workmen's, and finally had the architect dismissed. The man who took his place finished Blenheim in a few years, following Va nbrugh's de­signs to the letter. Vanbrugh died in 1726, locked out of the palace by the duchess, unable to set fo ot in his greatest creation. Foreshadowing the ro­mantic movement, Blenheim had started a whole new trend in architec­ture, but had given its creator a twenty-year nightmare. Interpretation For the Duchess of Marlborough, money was a way to play sadistic power games. She saw the loss of money as a symbolic loss of power. With Van­brugh her contortions went deeper still: He was a great artist, and she en­vied his power to create, to attain a farne outside her reach. She may not have had his gifts, but she did have the money to torture and abuse hirn over the pettiest details-to ruin his life. This kind of sadism, however, be ars an awful price. It made construc­tion that should have lasted ten years take twenty. It poisoned many a rela­tionship, alienated the duchess from the court, deeply pained the duke (who wanted only to live peacefully in Blenheim), created endless lawsuits, and took years off Vanbrugh's life . Finally, too, posterity had the last word: Vanbrugh is recognized as a genius while the duchess is forever remem­bered for her consummate cheapness. The powerful must have grandeur of spirit-they can never reveal any pettiness. And money is the most visible arena in which to display either grandeur or pettiness. Best spend freely, then, and create a reputation for generosity, which in the end will pay great dividends. Never let financial details blind you to the bigger picture of how people perceive you. Their resentment will cost you in the long run. And if you want to meddle in the work of creative people under your hire, at least pay them weIl. Yo ur money will buy their submission better than your displays of power.

But like every Renaissance artist, he needed to find a patron who would give hirn a comfortable lifestyle while not inter-"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"fe ring with his work. In 1528 Aretino decided to attempt a new strategy in the patronage game. Leaving Rome, he established hirnself in Venice, where few had heard of hirn. He had a fair amount of money he had man­aged to save, but little else. Soon after he moved into his new horne, how­ever, he threw open its doors to rich and poor, regaling them with banquets and amusements. He befriended each and every gondolier, tip­ping them royally. In the streets, he spread his money liberally, giving it away to beggars, orphans, washerwomen. Among the city's commoners, word quickly spread that Aretino was more than just a great writer, he was a man of power-a kind of lord. Artists and men of influence so on began to fr equent Aretino's house. Within a few years he made hirnself a celebrity; no visiting dignitary would think of leaving Venice without paying hirn a call. His generosity had cost hirn most of his savings, but had bought hirn influence and a good name­a cornerstone in the fo undation of power. Since in Renaissance Italy as elsewhere the ability to spend freely was the privilege of the rich, the aris­tocracy thought Aretino had to be a man of influence, since he spent money like one. And since the influence of a man of influence is worth buying, Aretino became the recipient of all sorts of gifts and moneys. Dukes and duchesses, wealthy merchants, and popes and princes com­peted to gain his favor, and showered hirn with all kinds of presents. Aretino's spending habits, of course, were strategie, and the strategy worked like a charm. But for real money and comfort he needed a great patron's bottomless pockets. Having surveyed the possibilities, he eventu­ally set his sights on the extremely wealthy Marquis of Mantua, and wrote an epic poem that he dedicated to the marquis. This was a common prac­tice of writers looking for patronage: In exchange for a dedication they would get a small stipend, enough to write yet another poem, so that they spent their lives in a kind of constant servility. Aretino, however, wanted power, not a measly wage. He might dedicate a poem to the marquis, but he would offer it to hirn as a gift, implying by doing so that he was not a hired hack looking for a stipend but that he and the marquis were equals. Aretino's gift-giving did not stop there: As a elose friend of two of Ve nice's greatest artists, the sculptor Jacopo Sansovino and the painter Titian, he convinced these men to participate in his gift-giving scheme. Aretino had studied the marquis before going to work on hirn, and knew his taste inside and out; he was able to advise Sansovino and Titian what subject matter would please the marquis most. When he then sent a Sanso­vino sculpture and a Titian painting to the marquis as gifts fr om all three of them, the man was beside hirnself with joy. Over the next few months, Aretino sent other gifts-swords, saddles, the glass that was a Venetian specialty, things he knew the marquis prized. Soon he, Titian, and Sansovino began to receive gifts from the marquis in return. And the strategy went further: When the son-in-Iaw of a fr iend of Aretino's found hirnself in jail in Mantua, Aretino was able to get the mar­quis to arrange his release. Aretino's fr iend, a wealthy merchant, was a man of great influence in Venice; by turning the goodwill he had built up years passed hy after this promise, and Pharaoh, doomed to ruin, continued to live in all his magnificence. Moses was impatient for God to destroy Pharaoh quickly, and he could not endure to wait any langer. So he fasted fo r forty days and went to Mount Sinai, and in his communing with god he said, \"0 Lord, Thou didst promise that Thou wouldst destroy Pharaoh, and still he has fo rsaken none of his blasphemies and pretensions. So when wilt Thou destroy hirn?\" A voice came from The Truth saying, \"0 Moses, you want Me to destroy Pharaoh as quickly as possihle, but a thousand times a thousand of My servants want Me never to do so, because they partake of his bounty and enjoy tranquillity under his rule. Sy My power I swear that as lang as he provides abundant food and comfort for My erea-tu res, I shall not destroy hirn.\" Moses said, \"Then when will Thy promise be fulfilled?\" God said, \"My promise will be fulfilled when he with­holds his provision from My creatures. If ever he begins to lessen his bounty, know that his hour is drawing near. It chanced that one day Pharaoh said to Haman, \"Moses has gathered the Sons of Israel about hirn and is causing us disquiet.

Moses then knew that the promise ofThe Truth was near to fulfillment, for exces­sive economy is a sign of decline and a bad omen. The masters of tradition say that on the day when Pharaoh was drowned only two ewes had been killed in his küchen. Nothing is better than generosity .... 1f a man is rich and desires, without a royal charter, to act like a lord; if he wants men to humble themselves befo re him, to revere him and call him lord and prince, then tell him every day to spread a table with victuals. All those who have acquired renown in the world, have gained it mainly through hospitality, while the miserly and avaricious are despised in both worlds.

The circle of influ­ence was growing wider. Time and again, Aretino was able to cash in on the immense political power of the marquis, who also helped him in his many court romances. Eventually, however, the relationship became strained, as Aretino came to feel that the marquis should have requited his generosity better. But he would not lower hirnself to begging or whining: Since the exchange of gifts between the two men had made them equals, it would not seem right to bring up money. He simply withdrew from the marquis's circle and hunted for other wealthy prey, settling first on the French king Francis, then the Medicis, the Duke of Urbino, Emperor Charles V, and more. In the end, having many patrons meant he did not have to bow to any of them, and his power seemed comparable to that of a great lord. Interpretation Aretino understood two fundamental properties of money: First, that it has to circulate to bring power. What money should buy is not lifeless objects but power over people. By keeping money in constant circulation, Aretino bought an ever-expanding circle of influence that in the end more than compensated hirn for his expenses. Second, Aretino understood the key property of the gift. To give a gift is to imply that you and the recipient are equals at the very least, or that you are the recipient's superior. A gift also involves an indebtedness or obligation; when friends, for instance, offer you something for free, you can be sure they expect something in return, and that to get it they are making you feel indebted. (The mechanism may or may not be entirely conscious on their part, but this is how it works.) Aretino avoided such encumbrances on his freedom. Instead of acting like a menial who expects the powerful to pay his way in life, he turned the whole dynamic around; instead of being indebted to the powerful, he made the powerful indebted to hirn. This was the point of his gift-giving, a ladder that carried hirn to the highest sociallevels. By the end of his life he had become the most famous writer in Europe. Understand: Money may determine power relationships, but those re­lationships need not depend on the amount of money you have; they also depend on the way you use it. Powerful people give freely, buying influ­ence rather than things. If you accept the inferior position because you have no fortune yet, you may find yourself in it forever. Play the trick that Aretino played on Italy's aristocracy: Imagine yourself an equal. Play the lord, give freely, open your doors, circulate your money, and create the fa­cade of power through an alchemy that transforms money into influence. Observance II Soon after Baron James Rothschild made his fortune in Paris in the early 1820s, he faced his most intractable problem: How could aJew and a Ger­man, a total outsider to French society, win the respect of the xenophobie French upper classes? Rothschild was a man who understood power-he"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"knew that his fortune would bring hirn status, but that if he remained so­cially alienated neither his status nor his fortune would last. So he looked at the society of the time and asked what would win their hearts. Charity? The French couldn't care less. Political influence? He already had that, and if anything it only made people more suspicious of hirn. The one weak spot, he decided, was boredom. In the period of the restoration of the monarchy, the French upper classes were bored. So Rothschild began to spend astounding sums of money on entertaining them. He hired the best architects in France to design his gardens and ballroom; he hired Marie-Antoine Careme, the most celebrated French chef, to prepare the most lavish parties Paris had ever witnessed; no Frenchman could resist, even if the parties were given by a German Jew. Rothschild's weekly soirees began to attract bigger and bigger numbers. Over the next few years he won the only thing that would seeure an outsider's power: social acceptance. Interpretation Strategie generosity is always a great weapon in building a support base, particularly for the outsider. But the Baron de Rothschild was cleverer still: He knew it was his money that had created the barrier between hirn and the French, making hirn look ugly and untrustworthy. The best way to overcome this was literally to waste huge sums, a gesture to show he valued French culture and society over money. What Rothschild did resembled the famous potlatch feasts of the American Northwest: By periodically de­stroying its wealth in a giant orgy of festivals and bonfires, an Indian tribe would symbolize its power over other tribes. The base of its power was not money but its ability to spend, and its confidence in a superiority that would restore to it all that the potlatch had destroyed. In the end, the baron's soirees reflected his desire to mingle not just in France's business world but in its society. By wasting money on his pot­Iatches, he hoped to demonstrate that his power went beyond money into the more precious realm of culture. Rothschild may have won social accep­tance by spending money, but the support base he gained was one that money alone could not buy. To secure his fortune he had to \"waste\" it. That is strategie generosity in a nutshell-the ability to be flexible with your wealth, putting it to work, not to buy objects, but to win people's hearts. Observance III The Medicis of Renaissance Florence had built their immense power on the fortune they had made in banking. But in Florence, centuries-old re­public that it was, the idea that money bought power went against all the city's proud democratic values. Cosimo de' Medici, the first of the family to gain great fame, worked around this by keeping a low profile. He never flaunted his wealth. But by the time his grandson Lorenzo came of age, in the 1470s, the family's wealth was too large, and their influence too notice­able, to be disguised any longer. Lorenzo solved the problem in his own way by developing the strat­egy of distraction that has served people of wealth ever since: He became THE FLAME-COLOREIl CLOAK During the campaign of Cambyses in Egypt, a great many Creeks visited that country fo r one reason or another: same, as was to be expected, fo r trade, same to serve in the army, others, no doubt, out of mere curiosity, to see what they could see. Amongst the sightseers was Aeaces's san Sylo­san, the exiled brother of Polycrates of Samos. While he was in Egypt, Syloson had an extra­ordinary strake of luck: he was hanging about the streets of Memphis dressed in a flame­colored cloak, when Darius, who at that time was a member of Cambyses's guard and not yet of any particu­lar importance, happened to catch sight of him and, seized with a sudden longing to possess the cloak, came up to Syloson and made him an offe r fo r it. His extreme anxiety to get it was obvious enough to Syloson, who was inspired to say: \"1 am not selling this fo r any money, but if you must have it, 1 will give it to you fo r free.\" Darius thereupon thanked him warmly and took it. Syloson at the moment merely thought he had lost it by his foolish good nature; then came the death of Cambyses and the revolt of the seven against the Magus, and Darius ascended the throne. Syloson now LAW 40 341"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"had the news that the man whose request for the jiame-colored cloak he had fo rmerly grati-fied in Egypt had become king of Persia. He hurried to Susa, sat down at the entrance of the royal palace, and claimed to be included in the officiallist of the king's benefa ctors. The sentry on guard reported his claim to Darius, who asked in surprise who the man might be. \"For surely, \" he said, \"as I have so recently come to the throne, there cannot be any Greek to whom I am indebted for a service. Hardly any of them have been here yet, and J certainly cannot remember owing anything to a Greek. But bring hirn in all the same, that J may know what he means by this claim. \" The guard escorted Syloson into the royal presence, and when the interpreters asked hirn who he was and what he had done to justify the statement that he was the king\\· benefac-tor, he reminded Darills of the story of the cloak, and said that he was the man who had given it hirn. \"Sir, \" exclaimed Darius, \"you are the most generous of men; fo r while J was still a person of no power or consequence you gave me a present-small indeed, but deserving then as much gratitude from me as would the most splendid of gifts today. J will give you in return more si/ver and gold than you can count, that you may 342 LAW 40 the most illustrious patron of the arts that history has ever known. Not only did he spend lavishly on paintings, he ereated Italy's finest apprentiee sehools for young artists. It was in one of these schools that the young Miehelangelo first eaught the attention of Lorenzo, who invited the artist to eome and live in his house. He did the same with Leonardo da Vinei. Onee under his wing, Michelangelo and Leonardo requited his generosity by be­eoming loyal artists in his stable. Whenever Lorenzo fa eed an enemy, he would wield the weapon of patronage. When Pisa, F1orenee's traditional enemy, threatened to rebel against it in 1472, Lorenzo plaeated its people by pouring money into its university, whieh had onee been its pride and joy but had long ago lost its luster. The Pisans had no defense against this insidious maneuver, which si­multaneously fe d their love of culture and blunted their desire for battle. Interpretation Lorenzo undoubtedly loved the arts, but his patronage of artists had a prae­tieal funetion as weH, of whieh he was keenly aware. In F10renee at the time, banking was perhaps the least admired way of making money, and was eertainly not arespected souree of power. The arts were at the other pole, the pole of quasi-religious transeendenee. By spending on the arts, Lorenzo diluted people's opinions of the ugly souree of his wealth, disguis­ing hirnself in nobility. There is no better use of strategie generosity than that of distraeting attention from an unsavory reality and wrapping oneself in the mantle of art or religion. Observance IV Louis XIV had an eagle eye for the strategie power of money. When he eame to the throne, the powerful nobility had reeently proven a thorn in the monarehy's side, and seethed with rebeHiousness. So he impoverished these aristoerats by making them spend enormous sums on maintaining their position in the eourt. Making them dependent on royal largesse for their livelihood, he had them in his claws. Next Louis brought the nobles to their knees with strategie generosity. It would work like this: Whenever he notieed a stubborn eourtier whose in­fluenee he needed to gain, or whose troublemaking he needed to squelch, he would use his vast wealth to soften the soil. First he would ignore his vie­tim, making the man anxious. Then the man would suddenly find that his son had been given a weH-paid post, or that funds had been spent liberally in his horne region, or that he had been given a painting he had long cov­eted. Presents would flow from Louis's hands. Finally, weeks or months later, Louis would ask for the favor he had needed all along. A man who had onee vowed to do anything to stop the king would find he had lost the desire to fight. A straightforward bribe would have made him rebeHious; this was far more insidious. Facing hardened earth in whieh nothing eould take root, Louis loosened the soil before he planted his seeds. Interpretation Louis understood that there is a deep-rooted emotional element in our atti­tude to money, an element going baek to ehildhood. When we are ehil-"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"dren, all kinds of complicated fe elings about oUf parents center around gifts; we see the giving of a gift as a sign of love and approval. And that emotional element never goes away. The recipients of gifts, financial or otherwise, are suddenly as vulnerable as children, especially when the gift comes fr om someone in authority. They cannot help opening up; their will is loosened, as Louis loosened the soil. To succeed best, the gift should come out of the blue. It should be re­markable for the fact that a gift like it has never been given before, or for being preceded by a cold shoulder from the giver. The more often you give to particular people, the blunter this weapon becomes. If they don't take your gifts for granted, becoming monsters of ingratitude, they will resent what appears to be charity. The sudden, unexpected, one-time gift will not spoil YOUf children; it will keep them under YOUf thumb. Observance V The antique dealer Fushimiya, who lived in the city of Edo (former name for Tokyo) in the seventeenth century, once made a stop at a village tea­house. After enjoying a cup of tea, he spent several minutes scrutinizing the cup, which he eventually paid for and took away with hirn. A local artisan, watehing this, waited until Fushimiya left the shop, then approached the old woman who owned the teahouse and asked her who this man was. She told hirn it was Japan's most famous connoisseur, antique dealer to the lord of Izumo. The artisan ran out of the shop, caught up with Fushimiya, and begged hirn to seIl hirn the cup, which must clearly be valuable if Fushimiya judged it so. Fushimiya laughed heartily: \"It's just an ordinary cup of Bizen ware,\" he explained, \"and it is not valuable at all. The reason I was looking at it was that the steam seemed to hang about it strangely and I wondered if there wasn't a leak somewhere.\" (Devotees of the Tea Ceremony were in­terested in any odd or accidental beauty in nature.) Since the artisan still seemed so excited about it, Fushirniya gave hirn the cup for fr ee. The artisan took the cup around, trying to find an expert who would appraise it at a high price, but since all of them recognized it as an ordinary teacup he got nowhere. Soon he was neglecting his own business, thinking only of the cup and the fortune it could bring. Finally he went to Edo to talk to Fushimiya at his shop. There the dealer, realizing that he had inad­vertently caused this man pain by making hirn believe the cup had great worth, paid hirn 100 ryo (gold pieces) for the cup as a kindness. The cup was indeed mediocre, but he wanted to rid the artisan of his obsession, while also allowing hirn to fe el that his effort had not been wasted. The ar­tisan thanked hirn and went on his way. Soon word spread of Fushimiya's pUfchase of the teacup. Every dealer in Japan clamored for hirn to seIl it, since a cup he had bought for 100 ryo must be worth much more. He tried to explain the circumstances in which he had bought the cup, but the dealers could not be dissuaded. Fushimiya finally relented and put the cup up for sale. During the auction, two buyers simultaneously bid 200 ryo for the te acup, and then began to fight over who had bid first. Their fighting never regret that yuu unce did a fa vur to Darius the son of Hystaspes.\" \"My lord, \" replied Syloson, \"do not give me gold or silver, but recover Samos fur me, my native island, which now since Oroetes killed my brother Poly­crates is in the hands of one of our servants. Let Samos be your gift to me-but let no man in the island be killed or enslaved.\" Darius consented to Syloson's request, and dispatched a force under the command of Otanes, one of the seven, with orders to do everything that Syloson had asked.

The auction was clearly over. Fushimiya glued and mended the cup, then stored it away, thinking the affair finished. Years later, however, the great tea master Matsudaira Fumai visited the store, and asked to see the cup, which by then had become legendary. Fumai examined it. \"As a piece,\" he said, \"it is not up to much, but a Tea Master prizes sentiment and association more than intrinsic value.\" He bought the cup for a high sumo A glued-together work of less than ordinary craftsmanship had become one of the most famous objects in Japan. Interpretation The story shows, first, an essential aspect of money: That it is humans who have created it and humans who instill it with meaning and value. Second, with objects as with money, what the courtier most values are the senti­ments and emotions embedded in them-these are what make them worth having. The lesson is simple: The more your gifts and your acts of generos­ity play with sentiment, the more powernd they are. The object or concept that plays with a charged emotion or hits a chord of sentiment has more power than the money you squander on an expensive yet lifeless present. Observance VI Akimoto Suzutomo, a wealthy adherent of the tea ceremony, once gave his page 100 ryo (gold pieces) and instructed him to purchase a tea bowl of­fered by a particular dealer. When the page saw the bowl, he doubted it was worth that much, and after much bargaining got the price reduced to 95 ryo. Days later, after Suzutomo had put the bowl to use, the page proudly told hirn what he had done. \"What an ignoramus you are!\" replied Suzutomo. \"A tea bowl that anyone asks 100 pieces of gold for can only be a fa mily heirloom, and a thing like that is only sold when the family is pressed for money. And in that case they will be hoping to find someone who will give even 150 pie ces for it. So what sort of fe llow is it who does not consider their feel­ings? Quite apart from that, a curio that you give 100 ryo for is something worth having, but one that has only cost 95 gives a mean impression. So never let me see that tea bowl again!\" And he had the bowllocked away, and never took it out. Interpretation When you insist on paying less, you may save your five ryo, but the insult you cause and the cheap impression you create will cost you in reputation, which is the thing the powerful prize above all. Leam to pay the full price-it will save you a lot in the end. Observance VI I Sometime near the beginning of the seventeenth century in Japan, a group of generals whiled away the time before a big battle by staging an incense­smelling competition.

Interpretation Masamune understood the following: Money gives its possessor the ability to give pleasure to others. The more you can do this, the more you attract admiration.

A paCKET MIRRaR FOR HEROES, BALTASAR GRACIAN, TRANSLATED BY CHRISTOPHER MAURER, 1996 348 LAW 41 TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW When Louis XIV died, in 1715, after a glorious fifty-five-year reign, all eyes focused on his great-grandson and chosen successor, the future Louis Xv. Would the boy, only five at the time, prove as great aleader as the Sun King? Louis XIV had transformed a country on the verge of civil war into the preeminent power in Europe. The last years of his reign had been diffi­cuIt-he had been old and tired-but it was hoped that the child would de­velop into the kind of strong mler who would reinvigorate the land and add to the firm foundation that Louis XIV had laid. To this end the child was given the best minds of France as his tutors, men who would instruct hirn in the arts of statecraft, in the methods that the Sun King had perfected. Nothing was neglected in his education. But when Louis XV came to the throne, in 1726, a sudden change came over hirn: He no longer had to study or please others or prove hirnself. He stood alone at the top of a great country, with wealth and power at his command. He could do as he wished. In the first years of his reign, Louis gave hirns elf over to pleasure, leav­ing the government in the hands of a trusted minister, Andre-Hercule de Fleury. This caused little concern, for he was a young man who needed to sow his wild oats, and de Fleury was a good minister. But it slowly became clear that this was more than a passing phase. Louis had no interest in gov­erning. His main worry was not France's finances, or a possible war with Spain, but boredom. He could not stand being bored, and when he was not hunting deer, or chasing young girls, he whiled away bis time at the gam­bling tables, losing huge sums in a single night. The court, as usual, reflected the tastes of the mler. Gambling and lav­ish parties became the obsession. The courtiers had no concern with the fu­ture of France-they poured their energies into charming the king, angling for tides that would bring them life pensions, and for cabinet positions de­manding litde work but paying huge salaries. Parasites flocked to the court, and the state's debts swelled. In 1745 Louis fe ll in love with Madame de Pompadour, a woman of middle-class origin who had managed to rise through her charms, her intel­ligence, and a good marriage. Madame de Pompadour became the official royal mistress; she also became France's arbiter of taste and fa shion. But the Madame had political ambitions as weIl, and she eventually emerged as the country's unofficial prime minister-it was she, not Louis, who wielded hiring-and-firing power over France's most important ministers. As he grew older Louis only needed more diversion. On the grounds of Versailles he built a brothel, Parc aux Cerfs, which housed some of the prettiest young girls of France. Underground passages and hidden stair­cases gave Louis access at all hours. Mter Madame de Pompadour died, in 1764, she was succeeded as royal mistress by Madame du Barry, who soon came to dominate the court, and who, like de Pompadour before her, began to meddle in affairs of state. If a minister did not please her he would find himselffired. All ofEurope was aghast when du Barry, the daughter of a baker, managed to arrange the firing of Etienne de Choiseul, the fo reign"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"minister and France's most able diplomat. He had shown her too litde re­spect. As time went by, swindlers and charlatans made their nests in Ver­sailles, and enticed Louis's interest in astrology, the occult, and fraudulent business deals. The young and pampered teenager who had taken over France years before had only grown worse with age. The motto that became attached to Louis's reign was ''Apres moi, le deluge'!.-\"After me the flood,\" or, Let France rot after I am gone. And in­deed when Louis did go, in 1774, worn out by debauchery, his country and his own finances were in horrible disarray. His grandson Louis XVI inher­ited arealm in desperate need of reform and a strong leader. But Louis XVI was even weaker than his grandfather, and could only watch as the country descended into revolution. In 1792 the republic introduced by the French Revolution declared the end of the monarchy, and gave the king a new name, \"Louis the Last.\" A few months later he kneeled on the guillo­tine, his about-to-be-severed head stripped of all the radiance and power that the Sun King had invested in the crown. Interpretation From a country that had descended into civil war in the late 1640s, Louis XIV forged the mightiest realm in Europe. Great generals would tremble in his presence. A cook once made a mistake in preparing a dish and com­mitted suicide rather than face the king's wrath. Louis XIV had many mis­tresses, but their power ended in the bedroom. He filled his court with the most brilliant minds of the age. The symbol of his power was Ve rsailles: Refusing to accept the palace of his forefathers, the Louvre, he built his own palace in what was then the middle of nowhere, symbolizing that this was a new order he had founded, one without precedent. He made Ve r­sailles the centerpiece of his reign, a place that all the powernd of Europe envied and visited with a sense of awe. In essence, Louis took a great void-the decaying monarchy of France-and filled it with his own sym­bols and radiant power. Louis XV, on the other hand, symbolizes the fate of all those who in­herit something large or who follow in a great man's footsteps. It would seem easy for a son or successor to build on the grand foundation left for them, but in the realm of power the opposite is true. The pampered, in­dulged son almost always squanders the inheritance, for he does not start with the father's need to fill a void. As Machiavelli states, necessity is what impels men to take action, and once the necessity is gone, only rot and decay are left. Having no need to increase his store of power, Louis XV in­evitably succumbed to inertia. Under him, Versailles, the symbol of the Sun King's authority, became a pleasure palace of incomparable banality, a kind of Las Vegas of the Bourbon monarchy. It came to represent all that the oppressed peasantry of France hated about their king, and during the Revolution they looted it with glee. Louis XV had only one way out of the trap awaiting the son or succes­sor of a man like the Sun King: to psychologically begin from nothing, to LIFE OF PERICLES As a young man Peri­eies was ineiined to shrink from facing the people. One reason fo r this was that he was considered to bear a distinct resemblance to the tyrant Pisistratus, and when men who were weil on in years remarked on the charm of Perieies' voice and the smoothness and fluency of his speech, they were astonished at the resemblance between the two.

However, the time came when Aristides was dead, Themistoeies in exile, and Cimon frequently absent on distant campaigns.

Assuming you have the choice, it would be better to avoid the situation altogether, to place yourself where there is a vacuum of power, where you can be the one to bring order out of chaos without having to compete with another star in the sky. Power depends on appearing larger than other people, and when you are lost in the shadow of the father, the king, the great predecessor, you cannot possibly project such apresence. But when they began to make sovereignty hereditary, the children quickly degenerated from their fathers; and, so far Jrom trying to equal their father's virtues, they considered that a prince had nothing else to do than to excel alt the rest in idleness, indulgence, and every other variety of pleasure. Niccolo Machiavelli, J469�1527 OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW Alexander the Great had a dominant passion as a young man-an intense dislike for his father, King Philip of Macedonia. He hated Philip's cunning, cautious style of ruling, his bombastic speeches, his drinking and whoring, and his love of wrestling and of other wastes of time. Alexander knew he had to make hirnself the very opposite of his domineering father: He would fo rce hirnself to be bold and reckless, he would control his tongue and be a man of few words, and he would not lose precious time in pursuit of plea­sures that brought no glory. Alexander also resented the fact that Philip had conquered most of Greece: \"My father will go on conquering till there is nothing extraordinary left for me to do,\" he once complained. While other sons of powerful men were content to inherit wealth and live a life of leisure, Alexander wanted only to outdo his father, to obliterate Philip's name from history by surpassing his accomplishments. Alexander itched to show others how superior he was to his father. A Thessalian horse-dealer once brought a prize horse named Bucephalus to seIl to Philip. None of the king's grooms could get near the horse--it was far too savage-and Philip berated the merchant for bringing him such a useless be ast. Watching the whole affair, Alexander scowled and COffi­mented, \"What a horse they are losing for want of skill and spirit to man­age hirn!\" When he had said this several times, Philip had finally had enough, and challenged hirn to take on the horse. He called the merchant back, secretly hoping his son would have a nasty fall and leam a bitter les­son. But Alexander was the one to teach the lesson: Not only did he mount Bucephalus, he managed to ride hirn at full gallop, taming the horse that would later carry hirn all the way to India. The courtiers applauded wildly, but Philip seethed inside, seeing not a son but a riyal to his power. Alexander's defiance of his father grew bolder. One day the two men had a heated argument before the entire court, and Philip drew his sword as if to strike his son; having drunk too much wine, however, the king stumbled. Alexander pointed at his father and jeered, \"Men of Macedonia,"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"see there the man who is preparing to pass from Europe to Asia. He cannot pass from one table to another without falling.\" When Alexander was eighteen, a disgruntled courtier murdered Philip. As word of the regicide spread through Greece, city after city rose up in rebellion against their Macedonian rulers. Philip's advisers counseled Alexander, now the king, to proceed cautiously, to do as Philip had done and conquer through cunning. But Alexander would do things his way: He marched to the furthest reaches of the kingdom, suppressed the rebellious towns, and reunited the empire with brutal efficiency. As a young rebel grows older, his struggle against the father often wanes, and he gradually comes to resemble the very man he had wanted to defy. But Alexander' s loathing of his father did not end with Philip' s death. Once he had consolidated Greece, he set his eyes on Persia, the prize that had eluded his father, who had dreamed of conquering Asia. If he defeated the Persians, Alexander would finally surpass Philip in glory and fame. Alexander crossed into Asia with an army of 35,000 to face a Persian force numbering over a million. Before engaging the Persians in battle he passed through the town of Gordium. Here, in the town's main temple, there stood an ancient chariot tied with cords made of the rind of the cor­nel tree. Legend had it that any man who could undo these cords--the Gordian knot-would rule the world. Many had tried to untie the enor­mous and intricate knot, but none had succeeded. Alexander, seeing he could not possibly untie the knot with his bare hands, took out his sword and with one slash cut it in half. This symbolic ge sture showed the world that he would not do as others, but would blaze his own path. Against astounding odds, Alexander conquered the Persians. Most ex­pected hirn to stop there-it was a great triumph, enough to secure his farne for etemity. But Alexander had the same relationship to his own deeds as he had to his father: His conquest of Persia represented the past, and he wanted never to rest on past triumphs, or to allow the past to out­shine the present. He moved on to India, extending his empire beyond all known limits. Only his disgruntled and weary soldiers prevented hirn from going farther. Interpretation Alexander represents an extremely uncommon type in history: the son of a famous and successful man who manages to surpass the father in glory and power. The reason this type is uncommon is simple: The father most often manages to amass his fortune, his kingdom, because he begins with little or nothing. A desperate urge impels hirn to succeed-he has nothing to lose by cunning and impetuousness, and has no famous father of his own to compete against. This kind of man has reason to believe in himself-to believe that his way of doing things is the best, because, after all, it worked for hirn. When a man like this has a son, he becomes domineering and oppres­sive, imposing his lessons on the son, who is starting off life in circum­stances totally different from those in which the father hirns elf began. the study ofhis profes­sion.

The son will never step out of his father's shadow unless he adopts the ruthless strategy of Alexander: disparage the past, create YOUf own king­dom, put the father in the shadows instead of letting hirn do the same to you. If you cannot materially start from ground zero-it would be foolish to renounce an inheritance-you can at least begin from ground zero psy­chologically, by throwing off the weight of the past and charting a new di­rection. Alexander instinctively recognized that privileges of birth are impediments to power.

This was done partly as a ritual of renewal, but also to prevent hirn fr om growing too powerful-for the king would generally try to establish a permanent order, at the expense of other families and of his own sons. Instead of protecting the tribe and leading it in times of war, he would attempt to dominate it. And so he would be beaten to death, or executed in an elaborate ritual. Now that he was no longer around for his honors to go to his head, he could be worshipped as a god_ Meanwhile the field had been cleared for a new and youthful order to establish itself. The ambivalent, hostile attitude towards the king or fa ther figure also finds expression in legends of heroes who do not know their father. Moses, the archetyp al man of power, was fo und abandoned among the bulrushes and never knew his parents; without a father to compete with hirn or limit hirn, he could attain the heights of power. Hercules had no earthly father­he was the son of the god Zeus. Later in his life Alexander the Great spread the story that the god Jupiter Ammon had sired hirn, not Philip of Mace­don_ Legends and rituals like these eliminate the human father because he symbolizes the destructive power of the past The past prevents the young hero from creating his own world-he must do as his fa ther did, even after that father is dead or powerless. The hero must bow and scrape before his predecessor and yield to tradition and precedent What had success in the past must be carried over to the present, even though circumstances have greatly changed. The past also weighs the hero down with an inheritance that he is terrified of losing, making hirn timid and cautious. Power depends on the ability to fill a void, to occupy a field that has"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"been cleared of the dead weight of the past. Only after the father figure has been properly done away with will you have the necessary space to create and establish a new order. There are several strategies you can adopt to ac­complish this-variations on the execution of the king that disguise the vio­lence of the impulse by channeling it in socially acceptable forms. Perhaps the simplest way to escape the shadow of the past is simply to belittle it, playing on the timeless antagonism between the generations, stir­ring up the young against the old. For this you need a convenient older fig­ure to pillory. Mao Tse-tung, confronting a culture that fiercely resisted change, played on the suppressed resentment against the overbearing pres­ence of the venerable Confucius in Chinese culture. John F. Kennedy knew the dangers of getting lost in the past; he radically distinguished his presidency from that of his predecessor, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and also from the preceding decade, the 1950s, which Eisenhower personified. Kennedy, for instance, would not play the dull and fatherly game of golf­asymbol of retirement and privilege, and Eisenhower's passion. Instead he played football on the White House lawn. In every aspect his administra­tion represented vigor and youth, as opposed to the stodgy Eisenhower. Kennedy had discovered an old truth: The young are easily set against the old, since they yearn to make their own place in the world and resent the shadow of their fathers. The distance you establish from your predecessor often demands some symbolism, a way of advertising itself publicly. Louis XIV, for exam­pIe, created such symbolism when he rejected the traditional palace of the French kings and built his own palace of Versailles. King Philip 11 of Spain did the same when he created his center of power, the palace of EI Esco­rial, in what was then the middle of nowhere. But Louis carried the game further: He would not be a king like his father or earlier ancestors, he would not wear a crown or carry a scepter or sit on a throne, he would es­tablish a new kind of imposing authority with symbols and rituals of its own. Louis made his ancestors' rituals into laughable relics of the past. Fol­low his example: Never let yourself be seen as following your predeces­sor's path. If you do you will never surpass him. You must physically demonstrate your difference, by establishing a style and symbolism that sets you apart. The Roman emperor Augustus, successor to Julius Caesar, understood this thoroughly. Caesar had been a great general, a theatrical figure whose spectacles kept the Romans entertained, an international emissary seduced by the charms of Cleopatra-a larger-than-life figure. So Augustus, despite bis own theatrical tendencies, competed with Caesar not by trying to outdo bim but by differentiating hirnself from hirn: He based his power on a re­turn to Roman simplicity, an austerity of both style and substance. Against the memory of Caesar's sweeping presence Augustus posed a quiet and manly dignity. The problem with the overbearing predecessor is that he fills the vistas before you with symbols of the past. You have no room to create your own name. To deal with this situation you need to hunt out the vacuums-those cant that [nineteenth­century chess cham­pion Paul} Morphy's soaring odyssey ;nto the higher realms of chess began just a year after the unexpectedly sudden death of his fa ther, which had been a great shock to hirn, and we may surm;se that his brilliant effo rt ofsublimation was, like Shakespeare's Harnlet and Freud's The Inter­pretation of Drearns, a reaction to this critical event .... Something should now be said aboutthe recep­tion Morphy's successes met with, for they were of such a kind as to raise the question whether his subsequent collapse may not have been influenced through his perhaps belonging to the type that Freud has described under the name of Die arn Erfolge scheitern (\"Those wrecked by success\") ....

To castrate the fa ther in a dream is a very diffe r­ent matter from do;ng it in reality. The real situation provokes the unconscious guilt in its full force, and the penalty may be mental collapse. THE PROBLEM OF PAUL MORPHY, ERNEST JONES, 1951 LAW 41 353"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"354 LAW 41 areas in culture that have been left vacant and in which you can become the first and principal figure to shine. When Pericles of Athens was about to launch a career as a statesman, he looked for the one thing that was missing in Athenian politics. Most of the great politicians of his time had allied themselves with the aristocracy; indeed Pericles himself had aristocratic tendencies. Yet he decided to throw in his hat with the city's democratic elements. The choice had nothing to do with his personal beliefs, but it launched him on a brilliant career. Out of necessity he became a man of the people. Instead of competing in an arena filled with great leaders both past and present, he would make a name for himself where no shadows could obscure his presence. When the painter Diego de Ve läzquez began his career, he knew he could not compete in refinement and technique with the great Renaissance painters who had come before him. Instead he chose to work in a style that by the standards of the time seemed coarse and rough, in a way that had never been seen before. And in this style he excelled. There were mem­bers of the Spanish court who wanted to demonstrate their own break with the past; the newness of Ve läzquez's style thrilled them. Most people are afraid to break so boldly with tradition, but they secretly admire those who can break up the old forms and reinvigorate the culture. This is why there is so much power to be gained from entering vacuums and voids. There is a kind of stubbom stupidity that recurs throughout history, and is a strong impediment to power: The superstitious belief that if the person before you succeeded by doing A, B, and C, you can re-create their success by doing the same thing. This cookie-cutter approach will seduce the uncreative, for it is easy, and appeals to their timidity and their laziness. But circumstances never repeat themselves exactly. When General Douglas MacArthur assumed command of American forces in the Philippines during World War II, an assistant handed him a book containing the various precedents established by the commanders before hirn, the methods that had been successful for them. MacArthur asked the assistant how many copies there were of this book. Six, the assis­tant answered. \"WeIl,\" the general replied, \"you get all those six copies to­gether and bum them-every one of them. I'll not be . bound by precedents. Any time a problem comes up, I'll make the decision at once-immediately.\" Adopt this ruthless strategy toward the past: Bum all the books, and train yourself to react to circumstances as they happen. You may believe that you have separated yourself from the predeces­sor or father figure, but as you grow older you must be etemally vigilant lest you become the father you had rebelIed against. As a young man, Mao Tse-tung disliked his father and in the struggle against hirn found his own identity and a new set of values. But as he aged, his father's ways crept back in. Mao's father had valued manual work over intellect; Mao had scoffed at this as a young man, but as he grew older he unconsciously retumed to his father's views and echoed such outdated ideas by forcing a whole genera­tion of Chinese intellectuals into manual labor, a nightrnarish mistake that"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"cost his regime dearly. Remember: You are your own fa ther. Do not let yourself spend years creating yourself only to let your guard down and allow the ghost of the past-father, habit, history-to sneak back in. Finally, as noted in the story of Louis XV, plenitude and prosperity tend to make us lazy and inactive: When our power is secure we have no need to act. This is a serious danger, especially for those who achieve suc­cess and power at an early age. The playwright Tennessee Williarns, for in­stance, found hirnself skyrocketed fr om obscurity to farne by the success of The Glass Menagerie. \"The sort of life which I had had previous to this popu­lar success,\" he later wrote, \"was one that required endurance, a life of clawing and scratching, but it was a good life because it was the sort of life for which the human organism is created. I was not aware of how much vital energy had gone into this struggle until the struggle was removed. This was security at last. I sat down and looked about me and was suddenly very depressed.\" Williarns had a nervous breakdown, which may in fact have been necessary for hirn: Pushed to the psychological edge, he could start writing with the old vitality again, and he produced A Streetcar Named Desire. Fyodor Dostoyevsky, similarly, whenever he wrote a successful novel, would feel that the financial security he had gained made the act of creation unnecessary. He would take his entire savings to the casino and would not leave until he had garnbled away his last penny. Once reduced to poverty he could write again. It is not necessary to go to such extremes, but you must be prepared to return to square one psychologically rather than growing fat and lazy with prosperity. Pablo Picasso could deal with success, but only by constantly changing the style of his painting, often breaking completely with what had made hirn successful before. How often our early triumphs turn us into a kind of caricature of ourselves. Powerful people recognize these traps; like Alexander the Great, they struggle constantly to re-create them­se lves. The fa ther must not be allowed to return; he must be slain at every step of the way. Image: The Father.

(Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) The shadow of a great predecessor could be used to advantage if it is cho­sen as a trick, a tactic that can be discarded once it has brought you power. Napoleon III used the name and legend of his illustrious grand-unde Napoleon Bonaparte to help hirn become first president and then emperor of France. Once on the throne, however, he did not stay tied to the past; he quickly showed how different his reign would be, and was careful to keep the public from expecting hirn to attain the heights that Bonaparte had at­tained. The past often has elements worth appropriating, qualities that would be foolish to reject out of a need to distinguish yourself. Even Alexander the Great recognized and was influenced by his father's skill in organizing an army. Making a display of doing things differently from your predeces­sor can make you seem childish and in fact out of control, unless your ac­tions have a logic of their OWll. Joseph 11, son of the Austrian empress Maria Theresa, made a show of doing the exact opposite of his mother-dressing like an ordinary citizen, staying in inns instead of palaces, appearing as the \"people's emperor.\" Maria Theresa, on the other hand, had been regal and aristocratic.

Just as you try to rid yourself of your father, they will soon play the same trick on you, denigrating everything you have accomplished. Just as you rise by rebelling against the past, keep an eye on those rising from below, and never give them the chance to do the same to you.

His strategy with Borromini he made a lifelong practice: Fearing that the great sculptor Alessandro Algardi, for example, would eelipse hirn in farne, he arranged it so that Algardi could only find work as his assistant.

It es­tablished instead a democracy that was to last over a century, a democ­racy that became the source of its power and its proudest achievement. But as the democracy evolved, so did a problem the Athenians had never fa ced: How to deal with those who did not concern themselves with the cohesion of a small city surrounded by enemies, who did not work for its greater glory, but thought of only themselves and their own ambitions and petty intrigues? The Athenians understood that these people, if left alone, would sow dissension, divide the city into factions, and stir up anxieties, all of which could lead to the ruin of their democracy. Violent punishment no longer suited the new, civilized order that Athens had created. Instead the citizens found another, more satisfying, and less brutal way to deal with the chronically selfish: Every year they would gather in the marketplace and write on a piece of earthenware, an ostrakon, the name of an individual they wanted to see banished fr om the city for ten years. If a particular name appeared on six thousand ballots, that person would instantly be exiled. If no one received six thousand votes, the person with the most ostraka recording his name would suffer the ten-year \"ostracism.\" This ritual expulsion became a kind of fe stival­what a joy to be able to banish those irritating, anxiety-inducing individu­als who wanted to rise above the group they should have served. In 490 B.C., Aristides, one of the great generals of Athenian history, helped defeat the Persians at the battle of Marathon. Meanwhile, off the battlefield, his fairness as a judge had eamed hirn the nickname \"The Just.\" But as the years went by the Athenians came to dislike hirn. He made such a show of his righteousness, and this, they believed, disguised his fe elings of superiority and scorn for the common folk. His omnipres­ence in Athenian politics became obnoxious; the citizens grew tired of hearing hirn called \"The Just.\" They fe ared that this was just the type of man-judgmental, haughty-who would eventually stir up fierce divi­sions among them. In 482 B.C., despite Aristides' invaluable expertise in the continuing war with the Persians, they collected the ostraka and had hirn banished. After Aristides' ostracism, the great general Themistoeles emerged as the city's premier leader. But his many honors and victories went to his head, and he too became arrogant and overbearing, constantly reminding the Athenians of his triumphs in battle, the temples he had built, the dan­gers he had fe nded off. He seemed to be saying that without hirn the city would come to ruin. And so, in 472 B.C., Themistoeles' name was filled in on the ostraka and the city was rid of his poisonous presence. The greatest political figure in fifth-century Athens was undoubtedly Perieles. Although several times threatened with ostracism, he avoided that fate by maintaining elose ties with the people.

It was Damon who had trained Pericles in the arts of ruling. But he, too, suffered ostracism, for his superior airs and his insulting manner toward the commoners stirred up too much resentment. Toward the end of the century there lived a man named Hyperbolus. Most writers of the time describe hirn as the city's most worthless citizen: He did not care what anyone thought of hirn, and slandered whomever he disliked. He amused some, but irritated many more. In 417 B.C., Hyperbo­lus saw an opportunity to stir up anger against the two leading politicians of the time, Alcibiades and Nicias. He hoped that one of the two would be ostracized and that he would rise in that man's place. His campaign seemed likely to succeed: The Athenians disliked Alcibiades' flamboyant and carefree lifestyle, and were wary of Nicias' wealth and aloofness. They seemed certain to ostracize one or the other. But Alcibiades and Nicias, aIthough they were otherwise enemies, pooled their resources and managed to turn the ostracism on Hyperbolus instead. His obnoxious­ness, they argued, could only be terminated by banishment. Earlier sufferers of ostracism had been formidable, powernIl men. Hyperbolus, however, was a low buffo on, and with his banishment the Athenians feit that ostracism had been degraded. And so they ended the practice that for nearly a hundred years had been one of the keys to keep­ing the peace within Athens. Interpretation The ancient Athenians had social instincts unknown today-the passage of centuries has blunted them. Citizens in the true sense of the word, the Athenians sensed the dangers posed by asocial behavior, and saw how such behavior often disguises itself in other forms: the holier-than-thou at­titude that silently seeks to impose its standards on others; overweening ambition at the expense of the common good; the flaunting of superiority; quiet scheming; terminal obnoxiousness. Some of these behaviors would eat away at the city's cohesion by creating factions and sowing dissension, others would ruin the democratic spirit by making the common citizen feel inferior and envious. The Athenians did not try to reeducate people who acted in these ways, or to absorb them somehow into the group, or to impose a violent punishment that would only create other problems. The solution was quick and effective: Get rid of them. Within any group, trouble can most often be traced to a single source, the unhappy, chronically dissatisfied one who will always stir up dissen­sion and infect the group with his or her ill ease. Before you know what hit you the dissatisfaction spreads. Act before it becomes impossible to disen­tangle one strand of misery from another, or to see how the whole thing started. First, recognize troublemakers by their overbearing presence, or by their complaining nature. Once you spot them do not try to reform them or appease them-that will only make things worse. Do not attack them, whether directly or indirectly, for they are poisonous in nature and"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"will work underground to destroy you. Do as the Athenians did: Banish them before it is too late. Separate them from the group before they be­come the eye of a whirlpool. Do not give them time to stir up anxieties and sow discontent; do not give them room to move. Let one person suf­fer so that the rest can live in peace. When the tree falls, the monkeys scatter. Chinese saying OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II In 1296 the cardinals of the Catholic Church met in Rome to select a new pope. They chose Cardinal Gaetani, for he was incomparably shrewd; such a man would make the Vatican a great power. Taking the name Boni­face VIII, Gaetani so on proved he deserved the cardinals' high opinion of hirn: He plotted his moves carefully in advance, and stopped at nothing to get his way. Once in power, Boniface quickly crushed his rivals and uni­fied the Papal States. The European powers began to fear hirn, and sent delegates to negotiate with hirn. The German King Albrecht of Austria even yielded some territory to Boniface. All was proceeding according to the pope's plan. One piece did not fall into place, however, and that was Tuscany, the richest part of Italy. If Boniface could conquer Florence, Tuscany's most powerful city, the region would be his. But Florence was a proud republic, and would be hard to defeat. The pope had to play his cards skillfully. Florence was divided by two riyal factions, the Blacks and the Whites. The Whites were the merchant families that had recently and quickly risen to power and wealth; the Blacks were the older money. Because of their popularity with the people, the Whites retained control of the city, to the Blacks' increasing resentment. The feud between the two grew steadily more bitter. Here Boniface saw his chance: He would plot to help the Blacks take over the city, and Florence would be in his pocket. And as he studied the situation he began to focus on one man, Dante Alighieri, the celebrated writer, poet, and ardent supporter of the Whites. Dante had always been interested in politics. He believed passionately in the republic, and often chastised his fellow citizens for their lack of spine. He also happened to be the city's most eloquent public speaker. In 1300, the year Boniface began plotting to take over Tuscany, Dante's fellow citizens had voted him in to Florence's highest elected position, making hirn one of the city's six pri­ors. During his six-month term in the post, he had stood firmly against the Blacks and against all of the pope's attempts to sow disorder. By 1301, however, Boniface had a new plan: He called in Charles de Valois, powerful brother of the king of France, to help bring order to Tus­cany. As Charles marched through northern Italy, and Florence seethed with anxiety and fear, Dante quickly emerged as the man who could rally THE WOLVES ,\\ \"D THE SHEEP On ce upon a time, the wolves sent an embassy to the sheep, desiring that there might be peace between them for the time to come. \"Why, \" said they, \"should we be for ever waging this deadly strife ?

By hook or by crook, Boniface had to neutralize Dante. And so, even as on the one hand he threatened Florence with Charles de Valois, on the other he held out the olive branch, the possibil­ity of negotiations, hoping Dante would take the bait. And indeed the Flo­rentines decided to send a delegation to Rome and try to negotiate a peace. To head the mission, predictably, they chose Dante. So me wamed the poet that the wily pope was setting up a trap to lure hirn away, but Dante went to Rome anyway, arriving as the French army stood before the gates of Florence. He feIt sure that his eloquence and rea­son would win the pope over and save the city. Yet when the pope met the poet and the Florentine delegates, he instantly intimidated them, as he did so many. \"Fall on your knees before me!\" he bellowed at their first meet­ing. \"Submit to met I tell you that in all truth I have nothing in my heart but to promote your peace.\" Succumbing to his powerful presence, the Florentines listened as the pope promised to look after their interests. He then advised them to return horne, leaving one of their members behind to continue the talks. Boniface signaled that the man to stay was to be Dante. He spoke with the utmost politeness, but in essence it was an order. And so Dante remained in Rome. And while he and the pope contin­ued their dialogue, Florence fell apart. With no one to rally the Whites, and with Charles de Valois using the pope's money to bribe and sow dis­sension, the Whites disintegrated, some arguing for negotiations, others switching sides. Facing an enemy now divided and unsure of itself, the Blacks easily destroyed them within weeks, exacting violent revenge on them. And once the Blacks stood firmly in power, the pope finally dis­missed Dante from Rome. The Blacks ordered Dante to return horne to face accusations and stand trial. When the poet refused, the Blacks condemned hirn to be burned to death if he ever set foot in Florence again. And so Dante began a miserable life of exile, wandering through Italy, disgraced in the city that he loved, never to return to Florence, even after his death. Interpretation Boniface knew that if he only had apretext to lure Dante away, Florence would crumble. He played the oldest card in the book-threatening with one hand while holding out the olive branch with the other-and Dante fell for it. Once the poet was in Rome, the pope kept hirn there for as long as it took. For Boniface understood one of the principal precepts in the game of power: One resolute person, one disobedient spirit, can turn a flock of sheep into a den of lions. So he isolated the troublemaker. With­out the backbone of the city to keep them together, the sheep quickly scattered.

Whatever it costs you, lure this person away, for once he is ab­sent his powers will lose their effect. His isolation can be physical (banish­ment or absence from the court), political (narrowing his base of support), or psychological (alienating hirn from the group through slander and in­sinuation). Cancer begins with a single cell; excise it before it spreads be­yond cure. KEYS TO POWER In the past, an entire nation would be ruled by a king and his handful of ministers. Only the elite had any power to play with. Over the centuries, power has gradually become more and more diffused and democratized. This has created, however, a common misperception that groups no longer have centers of power-that power is spread out and scattered among many people. Actually, however, power has changed in its num­bers but not in its essence. There may be fewer mighty tyrants command­ing the power of life and death over millions, but there remain thousands of petty tyrants ruling smaller realms, and enforcing their will through in­direct power games, charisma, and so on. In every group, power is con­centrated in the hands of one or two people, for this is one area in which human nature will never change: People will congregate around a single strong personality like planets orbiting a sun. To labor under the illusion that this kind of power center no longer exists is to make endless mistakes, waste energy and time, and never hit the target. Powerful people never waste time. Outwardly they may play along with the game-pretending that power is shared among many-but inwardly they keep their eyes on the inevitable few in the group who hold the cards. These are the ones they work on. When troubles arise, they look for the underlying cause, the single strong character who started the stirring and whose isolation or banishment will settle the waters again. In his family-therapy practice, Dr. Milton H. Erickson found that if the family dynamic was unsetded and dysfunctional there was inevitably one person who was the stirrer, the troublemaker. In his sessions he would symbolically isolate this rotten apple by seating hirn or her apart from the others, if only by a few feet. Slowly the other family members would see the physically separate person as the source of their difficulty. Once you recognize who the stirrer is, pointing it out to other people will accomplish a great deal. Understanding who controls the group dynamic is a critical realization. Remember: Stirrers thrive by hiding in the group, disguising their actions among the reactions of others. Render their actions visible and they lose their power to upset. A key element in ga mes of strategy is isolating the enemy's power. In chess you try to corner the king. In the Chinese game of go you try to iso­late the enemy's forces in small pockets, rendering them immobile and in­effectual. It is often better to isolate your enemies than to destroy LAW 42 363"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"364 LAW 42 them-you seem less brutal. The result, though, is the same, for in the game of power, isolation spells death. The most effective form of isolation is somehow to separate your vic­tims from their power base. When Mao Tse-tung wanted to eliminate an enemy in the ruling elite, he did not confront the person directly; he silently and stealthily worked to isolate the man, divide his allies and turn them away from hirn, shrink his support. Soon the man would vanish on his own. Presence and appearance have great import in the game of power. To seduce, particularly in the beginning stages, you need to be constantly present, or create the feeling that you are; if you are often out of sight, the charm will wear off. Qu een Elizabeth's prime minister, Robert Cecil, had two main rivals: the queen's favorite, the Earl of Essex, and her for­mer favorite, Sir Walter Raleigh. He contrived to send them both on a mission against Spain; with them away from the court he managed to wrap his tentacles around the queen, seeure his position as her top ad­viser and weaken her affection for Raleigh and the earl. The lesson here is twofold: First, your absence from the court spells danger for you, and you should never leave the scene in a time of turmoil, for your absence can both symbolize and induce a loss of power; second, and on the other hand, luring your enemies away from the court at critical moments is a great ploy. Isolation has other strategie uses. When trying to seduce people, it is often wise to isolate them from their usual social context. Once isolated they are vulnerable to you, and your presence becomes magnified. Simi­larly, con artists often look for ways to isolate their marks from their nor­mal social milieux, steering them into new environments in which they are no longer comfortable. Here they feel weak, and succumb to decep­tion more easily. Isolation, then, can prove a powernd way of bringing people under your spell to seduce or swindle them. You will often find powerful people who have alienated themselves from the group. Perhaps their power has gone to their heads, and they consider themselves superior; perhaps they have lost the knack of com­municating with ordinary folk. Remember: This makes them vulnerable. Powernd though they be, people like this can be tumed to use. The monk Rasputin gained his power over Czar Nicholas and Czar­ina Alexandra of Russia through their tremendous isolation from the peo­pIe. Alexandra in particular was a foreigner, and especially alienated from everyday Russians; Rasputin used his peasant origins to insinuate hirnself into her good graces, for she desperately wanted to communicate with her subjects. Once in the court's inner circle, Rasputin made hirnself indispensable and attained great power. Heading straight for the center, he aimed for the one figure in Russia who commanded power (the czarina dominated her husband), and found he had no need to isolate her for the work was already done. The Rasputin strategy can bring you great power: Always search out people who hold high positions yet who find them-"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"selves isolated on the board. They are like apples falling into your lap, easily seduced, and able to catapult you into power yourself. Finally, the reason you strike at the shepherd is because such an ac­tion will dishearten the sheep beyond any rational measure. When Her­nando Cortes and Francisco Pizarro led their tiny forces against the Aztec and Incan empires, they did not make the mistake of fighting on several fronts, nor were they intimidated by the numbers arrayed against them; they captured the kings, Moctezuma and Atahualpa. Vast empires fell into their hands. With the leader gone the center of gravity is gone; there is nothing to revolve around and everything falls apart. Aim at the lead­ers, bring them down, and look for the endless opportunities in the confu­sion that will ensue. Image: A Flock of Fatted Sheep. Do not waste precious time trying to steal a sheep or two; do not risk life and limb by setting upon the dogs that guard the flock. Aim at the shepherd. Lure hirn away and the dogs will follow. Strike hirn down and the flock will scatter-you can pick them off one by one. Authority: If you draw a bow, draw the strongest. If you use an arrow, use the long­est. To shoot a rider, first shoot his horse. To catch a gang of bandits, first capture its leader. Just as a country has its border, so the killing of men has its limits.

The young bride, Marie-Antoinette, was beautiful and fuH of life. She instantly changed the mood of the court, which was rank with Louis XV's de­baucheries; even the common people, who had yet to see her, talked excit­edly of Marie-Antoinette. The French had grown disgusted with the series of mistresses who had dominated Louis XV, and they looked forward to serving their new queen. In 1773, when Marie-Antoinette publicly rode through the streets of Paris for the first time, applauding crowds swarmed around her carriage. \"How fortunate,\" she wrote her mother, \"to be in a position in which one can gain widespread affection at so little cost.\" In 1774 Louis XV died and Louis XVI took the throne. As soon as Marie-Antoinette became queen she abandoned herself to the pleasures she loved the most--ordering and wearing the most expensive gowns and jewelry in the realm; sporting the most elaborate hair in history, her sculpted coiffures rising as much as three feet above her head; and throwing a constant succession of masked balls and fetes. All of these whims she paid for on credit, never concerning herself with the cost or who paid the bills. Marie-Antoinette's greatest pleasure was the creation and designing of a private Garden of Eden at the Petit Trianon, a chateau on the grounds of VersaiHes with its own woods. The gardens at the Petit Trianon were to be as \"natural\" as possible, including moss applied by hand to the trees and rocks. To heighten the pastoral effect, the queen employed peasant milk­maids to milk the finest-Iooking cows in the realm; launderers and cheese­makers in special peasant outfits she helped design; shepherds to tend sheep with silk ribbons around their necks. When she inspected the barns, she would watch her milkmaids squeezing milk into porcelain vases made at the royal ceramic works. To pass the time, Marie-Antoinette would gather flowers in the woods around the Petit Trianon, or watch her \"good pe asants\" doing their \"chores.\" The place became aseparate world, its community limited to her chosen favorites. With each new whim, the cost of maintaining the Petit Trianon soared. Meanwhile, France itself was deteriorating: There was famine and wide­spread discontent. Even socially insulated courtiers seethed with resent­ment-the queen treated them like children. Only her favorites mattered, and these were becoming fe wer and fewer. But Marie-Antoinette did not concern herself with this. Not once throughout her reign did she read a minister's report. Not once did she tour the provinces and rally the people to her side. Not once did she mingle among the Parisians, or receive a del­egation fr om them. She did none of these things because as queen she fe it the people owed her their affection, and she was not required to love them in return. In 1784 the queen became embroiled in a scandal. As part of an elabo­rate swindle, the most expensive diamond necklace in Europe had been"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"purchased under her name, ang during the swindlers' trial her lavish lifestyle became public: People heard about the money she spent on jewels and dresses and masked dances. They gave her the nickname \"Madame Deficit,\" and from then on she became the focus of the people's growing resentment. When she appeared in her box at the opera the audience greeted her with hisses. Even the court turned against her. For while she had been running up her huge expenditures, the country was headed for ruin. Five years later, in 1789, an unprecedented event took place: the be­ginning of the French Revolution. The queen did not worry-Iet the peo­pIe have their little rebellion, she seemed to think; it would soon quiet down and she would be able to resurne her life of pleasure. That year the people marched on Versailles, forcing the royal family to quit the palace and take residence in Paris. This was a triumph for the rebels, but it offered the queen an opportunity to heal the wounds she had opened and establish contact with the people. The queen, however, had not learned her lesson: Not once would she leave the palace during her stay in Paris. Her subjects could rot in heU for all she cared. In 1792 the royal couple was moved from the palace to a prison, as the revolution officially declared the end of the monarchy. The following year Louis XVI was tried, found guilty, and guillotined. As Marie-Antoinette awaited the same fate, hardly a soul came to her defense--not one of her former friends in the court, not one of Europe's other monarchs (who, as members of their own countries' royal farnilies, had all the reason in the world to show that revolution did not pay), not even her own family in Austria, including her brother, who now sat on the throne. She had be­come the world's pariah. In October of 1793, she finally knelt at the guillo­tine, unrepentant and defiant to the bitter end. Interpretation From early on, Marie-Antoinette acquired the most dangerous of attitudes: As a young princess in Austria she was endlessly flattered and cajoled. As the future queen of the French court she was the center of everyone's atten­tion. She never learned to charm or please other people, to become at­tuned to their individual psychologies. She never had to work to get her way, to use calculation or cunning or the arts of persuasion. And like every­one who is indulged from an early age, she evolved into a monster of in­sensitivity. Marie-Antoinette became the focus of an entire country's dissatisfac­tion because it is so infuriating to meet with a person who makes no effort to seduce you or attempt to persuade you, even if only for the purpose of deception. And do not imagine that she represents a bygone era, or that she is even rare. Her type is today more common than ever. Such types live in their own bubble--they seem to feel they are born kings and queens, and that attention is owed them. They do not consider anyone else's na­ture, but bulldoze over people with the self-righteous arrogance of a Marie­Antoinette.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW In A.D. 225, Chuko Liang, master strategist and chief minister to the mler of Shu in ancient China, confronted a dangerous situation. The kingdom of Wei had mounted an all-out attack on Shu from the north. More dangerous still, Wei had formed an alliance with the barbarous states to the south of Shu, led by King Menghuo. Chuko Liang had to deal with this second menace fr om the south before he could hope to fend off Wei in the north. As Chuko Liang prepared to march south against the barbarians, a wise man in his camp offered hirn advice. It would be impossible, this man said, to pacify the region by force. Liang would probably beat Menghuo, but as soon as he headed north again to deal with Wei, Menghuo would reinvade. \"It is better to win hearts,\" said the wise man, \"than cities; better to battle with hearts than with weapons. I hope you will succeed in winning the hearts of these people.\" \"You read my thoughts,\" responded Chuko Liang. As Liang expected, Menghuo launched a powernd attack. But Liang laid a trap and managed to capture a large part ofMenghuo's army, includ­ing the king hirnself. Instead of punishing or executing his prisoners, how­ever, he separated the soldiers from their king, had their shackles removed, regaled them with food and wine, and then addressed them. \"You are all upright men,\" he said. \"I believe you all have parents, wives, and children waiting for you at horne. They are doubtless shedding bitter tears at your fate. I am going to release you, so that you can return horne to YOUf loved ones and comfort them.\" The men thanked Liang with tears in their eyes; then he sent for Menghuo. \"If I release you,\" asked Liang, \"what will you do?\" \"I will pull my army together again,\" answered the king, \"and lead it against you to a decisive battle. But if you capture me a second time, I will bow to your superiority.\" Not only did Liang order Menghuo released, he gave hirn a gift of a horse and saddle. When angry lieutenants wondered why he did this, Liang told them, \"I can capture that man as easily as I can take something out of my pocket. I am trying to win his heart. When I do, peace will come of itself here in the south.\" As Menghuo had said he would, he attacked again. But his own offi­cers, whom Liang had treated so weIl, rebelIed against hirn, captured hirn, and turned hirn over to Liang, who asked hirn again the same question as"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"before. Menghuo replied that he had not been beaten fa irly, but merely be­trayed by his own officers; he would fight again, but if captured a third time he would bow to Liang's superiority. Over the following months Liang outwitted Menghuo again and again, capturing hirn a third, a fourth, and a fifth time. On each occasion Meng­huo's troops grew more dissatisfied. Liang had treated them with respect; they had lost their heart for fighting. But every time Chuko Liang asked Menghuo to yield, the great king would come up with another excuse: You tricked me, 1 lost through bad luck, on and on. If you capture me again, he would promise, 1 swear 1 will not betray you. And so Liang would let himgo. When he captured Menghuo for the sixth time, he asked the king the same question again. \"If you capture me a seventh time,\" the king replied, \"I shall give you my loyalty and never rebel again.\" \"Very weIl,\" said Liang. \"But if I capture you again, 1 will not release you.\" Now Menghuo and his soldiers fled to a far corner of their kingdom, the region of Wuge. Defeated so many times, Menghuo had only one hope left: He would ask the help of King Wutugu of Wuge, who had an immense and fe rocious army. Wutugu's warriors wore an armor of tightly woven vines soaked in oil, then dried to an impenetrable hardness. With Menghuo at his side, Wutugu marched this mighty army against Liang, and this time the great strategist seemed frightened, leading his men in a hur­ried retreat. But he was merely leading Wutugu into a trap: He cornered the king's men in a narrow valley, then lit fires set all around them. When the fires reached the soldiers Wutugu's whole army burst into flame-the oil in their armor, of course, being highly flammable. All of them perished. Liang had managed to separate Menghuo and his entourage from the carnage in the valley, and the king found hirnself a captive for the seventh time. After this slaughter Liang could not bear to face his prisoner again. He sent a messenger to the captured king: \"He has commissioned me to re­lease you. Mobilize another army against hirn, if you can, and try once more to defeat hirn.\" Sobbing, the king fell to the ground, crawled to Liang on his hands and knees, and prostrated hirnself at his feet. \"Oh great minis­ter,\" cried Menghuo, \"yours is the majesty of Heaven. We men of the south will never again offer resistance to your rule.\" \"Do you now yield?\" asked Liang. \"I, my sons, and my grandsons are deeply moved by Your Honor's boundless, life-giving mercy. How could we not yield?\" Liang honored Menghuo with a great banquet, reestablished hirn on the throne, restored his conquered lands to his rule, then returned north with his army, leaving no occupying force.

Their resentment turns to hatred; such ani­mosity keeps you on edge-you spend your energy protecting what you have gained, growing paranoid and defensive. The second option, though more difficult, not only brings you peace of mind, it converts a potential enemy into a pillar of support. In all your encounters, take a step back-take the time to calculate and attune yourself to your targets' emotional makeup and psychological weak­nesses. Force will only strengthen their resistance. With most people the heart is the key: They are like children, ruled by their emotions. To soften them up, alternate harshness with mercy. Play on their basic fears, and also their loves-freedom, family, etc. Once you break them down, you will have a lifelong friend and fiercely loyal ally. Governments saw men only in mass; but our men, being irregulars, were not formations, but individuals .... Our kingdoms lay in each man 's mind. Seven Pillars of Wisdom, T E. Lawrence, 1888-1935 KEYS TO POWER In the game of power, you are surrounded by people who have absolutely no reason to help you unless it is in their interest to do so. And if you have nothing to offer their self-interest, you are likely to make them hostile, for they will see in you just one more competitor, one more waster of their time. Those that overcome this prevailing coldness are the ones who find the key that unlocks the stranger's heart and mind, seducing hirn into their corner, if necessary softening hirn up for a punch. But most people never leam this side of the game. When they meet someone new, rather than stepping back and probing to see what makes this person unique, they talk about themselves, eager to irnpose their own willpower and prejudices. They argue, boast, and make a show of their power. They may not know it but they are secretly creating an enemy, aresister, because there is no more infuriating feeling than having your individuality ignored, your own psychology unacknowledged. It makes you feellifeless and resentful. Remember: The key to persuasion is softening people up and break­ing them down, gently. Seduce them with a two-pronged approach: Work on their emotions and play on their intellectual weaknesses. Be alert to both what separates them from everyone else (their individual psychology) and what they share with everyone else (their basic emotional responses). Aim at the primary emotions-Iove, hate, jealousy. Once you move their emotions you have reduced their control, making them more vulnerable to persuasion. When Chuko Liang wanted to dissuade an important general of a rival kingdom from entering into an alliance with Ts'ao Ts'ao, Liang's dreaded enemy, he did not detail Ts'ao Ts'ao's cruelty, or attack him on moral grounds. Instead Liang suggested that Ts'ao Ts'ao was really after the gen-"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"eral's beautiful young wife. This hit the general in the gut, and won hirn over. Mao Ts e-tung similarly always appealed to popular emotions, and spoke in the simplest terms. Educated and well-read hirnself, in his speeches he used visceral metaphors, voicing the public's deepest anxieties and encouraging them to vent their frustrations in public meetings. Rather than arguing the practical aspects of a particular program, he would de­scribe how it would affect them on the most primitive, down-to-earth level. Do not believe that this approach works only with the illiterate and un­schooled-it works on one and all. All of us are mortal and face the same dreadful fate, and all of us share the desire for attachment and belonging. Stir up these emotions and you captivate our hearts. The best way to do this is with a dramatic jolt, of the kind that Chuko Liang created when he fe d and released prisoners who expected only the worst fr om him. Shaking them to the core, he softened their hearts. Play on contrasts like this: Push people to despair, then give them relief. If they ex­pect pain and you give them pleasure, you win their hearts. Creating plea­sure of any kind, in fact, will usually bring you success, as will allaying fe ars and providing or promising security. Symbolic gestures are often enough to win sympathy and goodwill. A gesture of self-sacrifice, for example-a show that you suffer as th ose around you do-will make people identify with you, even if your suffering is symbolic or minor and theirs is real. When you enter a group, make a gesture of goodwill; soften the group up for the harsher actions that will fol­low later. When T. E. Lawrence was fighting the Tu rks in the deserts of the Mid­dIe East during World War I, he had an epiphany: It seemed to hirn that conventional warfare had lost its value. The old-fashioned soldier was lost in the enormous armies of the time, in which he was ordered about like a lifeless pawn. Lawrence wanted to turn this around. For hirn, every sol­dier's mind was a kingdom he had to conquer. A committed, psychologi­cally motivated soldier would fight harder and more creatively than a puppet. Lawrence's perception is still more true in the world today, where so many of us fe el alienated, anonymous, and suspicious of authority, all of which makes overt power plays and fo rce even more counterproductive and dangerous. Instead of manipulating lifeless pawns, make those on your side convinced and excited by the cause you have enlisted them in; this will not only make your work easier but it will also give you more leeway to deceive them later on. And to accomplish this you need to deal with their individual psychologies. Never clumsily assurne that the tactic that worked on one person will necessarily work on another. To find the key that will motivate them, first get them to open up. The more they talk, the more they reveal about their likes and dislikes--the handles and levers to move them with. The quickest way to secure people's minds is by demonstrating, as simply as possible, how an action will benefit them.

Self-interest is the solider foundation. The causes that work best use a noble veneer to cover a blatant appeal to self-interest; the cause se­duces but the self-interest secures the deal. The people who are best at appealing to people's minds are often artists, intellectuals, and those of a more poetic nature. This is because ideas are most easily communicated through metaphors and imagery. It is always good policy, then, to have in your pocket at least one artist or intel­lectual who can appeal concretely to people's minds. Kings have always kept a stable of writers in their bam: Frederick the Great had his Voltaire (until they quarreled and separated), Napoleon won over Goethe. Con­versely, Napoleon III's alienation ofwriters such as Victor Hugo, whom he exiled from France, contributed to his growing unpopularity and eventual downfall. It is dangerous, then, to alienate those who have powers of ex­pression, and useful to pacify and exploit them. Finally, leam to play the numbers game.

The Mir­ror Effect mocks and humiliates them, making them over­react. By holding up a mirror to their psyche s, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their values; by holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a lesson. Few can resist the power of the Mirror Effect."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"MIRRO R EFFECTS: Preliminary Ty pology Mirrors have the power to disturb uso Gazing at our reflection in the mir­ror, we most often see what we want to see-the image of ourselves with which we are most comfortable. We tend not to look too closely, ignoring the wrinkles and blemishes. But if we do look hard at the reflected image, we sometimes fe el that we are seeing ourselves as others see us, as a person among other people, an object rather than a subject. That fe eling makes us shudder-we see ourselves, but from the outside, minus the thoughts, spirit, and soul that fill our consciousness. We are a thing. In using Mirror Effects we symbolically re-create this disturbing power by mirroring the actions of other people, mimicking their movements to unsettle and infuriate them. Made to fe el mocked, cloned, objectlike, an image without a soul, they get angry. Or do the same thing slightly differ­ently and they might fe el disarmed-you have perfectly reflected their wi shes and desires. This is the narcissistic power of mirrors. In either case, the Mirror Effect unsettles your targets, whether angering or entrancing them, and in that instant you have the power to manipulate or seduce them. The Effect contains great power because it operates on the most primitive emotions. There are four main Mirror Effects in the realm of power: The Neutralizing Effect. In ancient Greek mythology, the Gorgon Medusa had serpents for hair, protruding tongue, massive teeth, and a face so ugly that anyone who gazed at her was turned into stone, out of fr ight. But the hero Perseus managed to slay Medusa by polishing his bronze shield into a mirror, then using the reflection in the mirror to guide hirn as he crept up and cut off her head without looking at her directly. If the shield in this instance was a mirror, the mirror also was a kind of shield: Medusa could not see Perseus, she saw only her own reflected actions, and behind this screen the hero stole up and destroyed her. This is the essence of the Neutralizing Effect: Do what your enemies do, fo llowing their actions as best you can, and they cannot see what you are up to-they are blinded by your mirror. Their strategy for dealing with you depends on your reacting to them in a way characteristic of you; neu­tralize it by playing a game of mimicry with them. The tactic has a mock­ing, even infuriating effect. Most of us remember the childhood experience of someone teasing us by repeating our words exactly-after a while, usu­ally not long, we wanted to punch them in the fa ce. Working more subtly as an adult, you can still unsettle your opponents this way; shielding your own strategy with the mirror, you lay invisible traps, or push your oppo­nents into the trap they planned for you. This powerful technique has been used in military strategy since the days of Sun-tzu; in our own time it often appears in political campaigning. It is also useful for disguising those situations in which you have no particu­lar strategy yourself. This is the Warrior's Mirror. A reverse version of the Neutralizing Effect is the Shadow: Yo u TlIE MERCII ,\\r-,'1 ill\\D HIS FHIE'ID A certain merchant once had a great desire to make a long journey. Now in regard that he was not very wealthy, \"It is requisite.\" said he to hirnself, \"that before my departure I should leave some part ofmy estate in the city. to the end that if I meet with ili luck in my travel;� I may have wherewithal to keep me at my return\" To this purpose he delivered a great number of bars of iron, which were a principal part of his wealth, in trust to one of his friends, desiring hirn to keep them during his absence; and then, ta king his leave, away he went. Some time after, having had but ill luck in his traveis, he returned horne; and the first thing he did was to go to his friend, and demand his iron: but his friend, who owed several sums of money, having sold the iron to pay his own debts, made hirn this ans wer,' \"Truly, friend, \" said he, \"I put your iron into a room that was close locked, imagining it would have been there as secure as my own gold; but an accident has happened which no one could have suspected, for there was a rat in the room which ate it all up. \" The merchant, pretending ignorance, replied, \"It is a terrible misfortune to me indeed; but I know of LAW 44 377"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"old that rats love iron extremely; I have suffered by them many tim es before in the same manner, amI therefore can the better bear my present ajfliction. \" This answer extremely pleased the friend, who was glad to hear the merchant so weil inclined to believe that a rat had eaten his iron; and to rem(JVe all suspicions, desired him to dine with him the next day.

Use the Shadow to gather information that will neutralize their strategy later on, when you will be able to thwart their every move. The Shadow is effective because to follow the movements of others is to gain valuable insights into their habits and routines. The Shadow is the preeminent device for detec­tives and spies. The Narcissus Effect. Gazing at an image in the waters of apond, the Greek youth Narcissus fell in love with it. And when he found out that the image was his own reflection, and that he therefore could not consummate his love, he despaired and drowned hirnself. All of us have a similar prob­lem: We are profoundly in love with ourselves, but since this love excludes a love object outside ourselves, it remains continuously unsatisfied and un­fulfilled. The Narcissus Effect plays on this universal narcissism: You look deep into the souls of other people; fathom their inmost desires, their val­ues, their tastes, their spirit; and you reflect it back to them, making your­self into a kind of mirror image. Your ability to reflect their psyche gives you great power over them; they may even feel a tinge oflove. This is simply the ability to mimic another person not physically, but psychologically, and it is immensely powerful because it plays upon the unsatisfied self-Iove of a child. Normally, people bombard us with their ex­periences, their tastes. They hardly ever make the effort to see things through our eyes. This is annoying, but it also creates great opportunity: If you can show you understand another person by reflecting their inmost feelings, they will be entranced and disarmed, all the more so because it happens so rarely. No one can resist this feeling of being harmoniously re­flected in the outside world, even though you might weH be manufacturing it for their benefit, and for deceptive purposes of your own. The Narcissus Effect works wonders in both sociallife and business; it gives us both the Seducer's and the Courtier's Mirror. The Moral Effect. The power of verbal argument is extremely limited, and often accomplishes the opposite of what is intended. As Graciän re­marks, \"The truth is generally seen, rarely heard.\" The Moral Effect is a perfect way to demonstrate your ideas through action. Quite simply, you teach others a lesson by giving them a taste of their own medicine. In the Moral Effect, you mirror what other people have done to you, and do so in a way that makes them realize you are doing to them exactly what they did to you. You make them feeZ that their behavior has been un­pleasant, as opposed to hearing you complain and whine about it, which only gets their defenses up. And as they feel the result of their actions rnir­rored back at them, they realize in the profoundest sense how they hurt or punish others with their unsocial behavior. You objectify the qualities you want them to feel ashamed of and create a mirror in which they can gaze at their follies and leam a lesson about themselves. This technique is often used by educators, psychologists, and anyone who has to deal with un-"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"pleasant and unconscious behavior. This is the Teacher's Mirror. Whether or not there is actually anything wrong with the way people have treated you, however, it can often be to your advantage to reflect it back to them in a way that makes them feel guilty about it. The Hallucinatory Effect. Mirrors are tremendously deceptive, for they create a sense that you are looking at the real world. Actually, though, you are only staring at a piece of glass, which, as everyone knows, cannot show the world exactly as it is: Everything in a mirror is reversed. When Alice goes through the looking glass in Lewis Carroll's book, she enters a world that is back-to-front, and more than just visually. The Hallucinatory Effect comes from creating a perfect copy of an ob­ject, a place, aperson. This copy acts as a kind of dummy-people take it for the real thing, because it has the physical appearance of the real thing. This is the preeminent technique of con artists, who strategically mimic the real world to deceive you. It also has applications in any arena that re­quires camouflage. This is the Deceiver's Mirror. OBSERVANCES OF MIRROR EFFECTS Observance I In February of 1815, the emperor Napoleon escaped from the island of Elba, where he had been imprisoned by the allied forces of Europe, and re­turned to Paris in a march that stirred the French nation, rallying troops and citizens of all classes to his side and chasing his successor, King Louis XVIII, off the throne. By March, however, having reestablished hirnself in power, he had to face the fact that France's situation had gravely changed. The country was devastated, he had no allies among the other European nations, and his most loyal and important ministers had deserted hirn or left the country. Only one man remained from the old regime-Joseph Fouche, his former minister of police. Napoleon had relied on Fouche to do his dirty work throughout his previous reign, but he had never been able to figure his minister out. He kept a corps of agents to spy on all of his ministers, so that he would always have an edge on them, but no one had gotten anything on Fouche. If sus­pected of some rnisdeed, the minister would not get angry or take the accu­sation personally-he would submit, nod, srnile, and change colors charneleonlike, adapting to the requirements of the moment. At first this had seemed somewhat pleasant and charming, but after a while it frus­trated Napoleon, who feit outdone by this slippery man. At one time or an­other he had fired all of his most important ministers, including Talleyrand, hut he never touched Fouche. And so, in 1815, back in power and in need of help, he feit he had no choice but to re appoint Fouche as his minister of police. Several weeks into his new reign, Napoleon's spies told him they be-most not above two or three pounds, can he carry a boy that weighs above fi fty? \" \"Why, \" replied the merchant, \"do you make such a wonder at that? As if in a country where one rat can eat a hundred tons' weight o[ iron, it were such a wonder for an owl to carry a ehild that weighs not overfifty pounds in aW\" The friend, upon this, found that the mercharll was no such fo ol as he took him to be, begged his pardon for the cheat whieh he designed to have put upon him, restored him the value of his iron, and so had his son again.

Mraid that his most valuable minister was betraying hirn to his enemies, Napoleon had to find out the truth before it was too late. He could not confront Fouche directly-in person the man was as slippery as an eel. He needed hard proof. This seemed to come in April, when the emperor's private police cap­tured a Viennese gentleman who had come to Paris to pass information on to Fouche. Ordering the man brought before hirn, Napoleon threatened to shoot hirn then and there unless he confessed; the man broke down and admitted he had given Fouche a letter from Metternich, written in invisible ink, arranging for a secret meeting of special agents in Basel. Napoleon ac­cordingly ordered one of his own agents to infiltrate this meeting. If Fouche was indeed planning to betray hirn, he would finally be caught red-handed and would hang. Napoleon waited impatiently for the agent's return, but to bis bewil­derment the agent showed up days later reporting that he had heard noth­ing that would implicate Fouche in a conspiracy. In fact it seemed that the other agents present suspected Fouche of double-crossing thern, as if he were working for Napoleon all along. Napoleon did not believe this for an instant-Fouche had somehow outwitted hirn again. The fo llowing morning Fouche visited Napoleon, and remarked, \"By the way, sire, I never told you that I had a letter from Metternich a few days ago; my mind was so full of things of greater moment. Besides, his emissary omitted to give me the powder needed to make the writing legi­ble .... Here at length is the letter.\" Sure that Fouche was toying with hirn, Napoleon exploded, \"You are a traitor, Fouche! I ought to have you hanged.\" He continued to harangue Fouche, but could not fire hirn without proof. Fouche only expressed amazement at the emperor's words, but in­wardly he smiled, for all along he had been playing a mirroring game. Interpretation Fouche had known for years that Napoleon kept on top of those around hirn by spying on them day and night. The minister had survived this game by having his own spies spy on Napoleon's spies, thus neutralizing any ac­tion Napoleon might take against hirn. In the case of the meeting in Basel, he even turned the tables: Knowing about Napoleon's double agent, he set it up so that it would appear as if Fouche were a loyal double agent too. Fouche gained power and flourished in aperiod of great tumult by mirroring those around hirn. During the French Revolution he was a radi­cal Jacobin; after the Te rror he became a moderate republican; and under Napoleon he became a committed imperialist whom Napoleon ennobled and made the duke of Otranto. If Napoleon took up the weapon of digging up dirt on people, Fouche made sure he had the dirt on Napoleon, as weIl as on everyone else. This also allowed hirn to predict the emperor's plans and desires, so that he could echo his boss's sentiments before he had even uttered them. Shielding his actions with a mirror strategy, Fouche could also plot offensive moves without being caught in the act. This is the power of mirroring those around you. First, you give people"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"the feeling that you share their thoughts and goals. Second, if they suspect you have ulterior motives, the mirror shields you from them, preventing them from figuring out your strategy. Eventually this will infuriate and un­settle them. By playing the double, you steal their thunder, suck away their initiative, make them feel helpless. You also gain the ability to choose when and how to unsettle them-another avenue to power. And the mirror saves you mental energy: simply echoing the moves of others gives you the space you need to develop a strategy of your own. Observance 11 Early on in his career, the ambitious statesman and general Alcibiades of Athens (450-404 B.C.) fashioned a formidable weapon that became the source of his power. In every encounter with others, he would sense their moods and tastes, then carefully tailor his words and actions to mirror their inmost desires. He would seduce them with the idea that their values were superior to everyone else's, and that his goal was to model hirnself on them or help them realize their dreams. Few could resist his charm. The first man to fall under his speIl was the philosopher Socrates. Al­cibiades represented the opposite of the Socratic ideal of simplicity and up­rightness: He lived lavishly and was completely unprincipled. Whenever he met Socrates, however, he mirrored the older man's sobriety, eating simply, accompanying Socrates on long walks, and talking only of philoso­phy and virtue. Socrates was not completely fooled-he was not unaware of Alcibiades' other life. But that only made hirn vulnerable to a logic that flattered hirn: Only in my presence, he feIt, does this man submit to a virtu­ous influence; only I have such power over hirn. This feeling intoxicated Socrates, who became Alcibiades' fervent admirer and supporter, one day. even risking his own life to rescue the young man in battle. The Athenians considered Alcibiades their greatest orator, for he had an uncanny ability to tune in to his audience's aspirations, and mirror their desires. He made his greatest speeches in support of the invasion of Sicily, which he thought would bring great wealth to Athens and limitless glory to hirnself. The speeches gave expression to young Athenians' thirst to con­quer lands for themselves, rather than living off the victories of their ances­tors. But he also tailored his words to reflect older men's nostalgia for the glory years when Athens led the Greeks against Persia, and then went on to create an empire. All Athens now dreamed of conquering Sicily; Alcibi­ades' plan was approved, and he was made the expedition's commander. While Alcibiades was leading the invasion of Sicily, however, certain Athenians fabricated charges against hirn of profaning sacred statues. He knew his enemies would have hirn executed if he retumed horne, so at the last minute he deserted the Athenian fleet and defected to Athens's bitter enemy, Sparta. The Spartans welcomed this great man to their side, but they knew his reputation and were wary of hirn. Alcibiades loved luxury; the Spartans were a warrior people who worshipped austerity, and they were afraid he would corrupt their youth.

This time Alcibiades defected to Persia, where he suddenly went from Spartan simplicity to embracing the lavish Pe rsian lifestyle down to the last detail. It was of course immensely flattering to the Persians to see a Greek of Alcibiades' stature prefer their culture over his own, and they showered hirn with honors, land, and power. Once seduced by the mirror, they failed to notice that behind this shield Alcibiades was playing a double game, se­cretly helping the Athenians in their war with Sparta and thus reingratiat­ing hirnself with the city to which he desperately wanted to return, and which welcomed hirn back with open arms in 408 B.C. Interpretation Early in his political career, Alcibiades made a discovery that changed his whole approach to power: He had a colorful and forceful personality, but when he argued his ideas strongly with other people he would win over a few while at the same time alienating many more. The secret to gaining as­cendancy over large numbers, he came to believe, was not to impose his colors but to absorb the colors of those around hirn, like a chameleon. Once people fe ll for the trick, the deceptions he went on to practice would be invisible to them. Understand: Everyone is wrapped up in their own narcissistic shell. When you try to impose your own ego on them, a wall goes up, resistance is increased. By mirroring them, however, you seduce them into a kind of narcissistic rapture: They are gazing at a double of their own soul. This double is actually manufactured in its entirety by you. Once you have used the mirror to seduce them, you have great power over them. It is worth noting, however, the dangers in the promiscuous use of the mirror. In Alcibiades' presence people fe It larger, as if their egos had been doubled. But once he left, they fe It empty and diminished, and when they saw hirn mirroring completely different people as totally as he had mir­rored them, they feIt not just diminished but betrayed. Alcibiades' overuse of the Mirror Effect made whole peoples fe el used, so that he constantly had to flee fr om one place to another. Indeed Alcibiades so angered the Spartans that they finally had hirn murdered. He had gone too far. The Se­ducer's Mirror must be used with caution and discrimination. Observance 111 In 1652 the recently widowed Baroness Mancini moved her family frorn Rome to Paris, where she could count on the influence and protection of"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"her brother Cardinal Mazarin, the French prime minister. Of the baroness's five daughters, four dazzled the court with their beauty and high spirits. These infamously charming nieces of Cardinal Mazarin became known as the Mazarinettes, and soon found themselves invited to all the most important court functions. One daughter, Marie Mancini, did not share this good fortune, for she lacked the beauty and grace of her sisters-who, along with her mother and even Cardinal Mazarin, eventually came to dislike her, for they feit she spoiled the family image. They tried to persuade her to enter a con­vent, where she would be less of an embarrassment, but she refused. In­stead she applied herself to her studies, learning Latin and Greek, perfecting her French, and practicing her musical skills. On the rare occa­sions when the family would let her attend court affairs, she trained herself to be an artful listen er, sizing people up for their weaknesses and hidden desires. And when she finally met the future King Louis XIV, in 1657 (Louis was seventeen years old, Marie eighteen), she decided that to spite her family and unde, she would find a way to make this young man fall in love with her. This was a seemingly impossible task for such a plain-Iooking girl, but Marie studied the future king dosely. She noticed that her sisters' frivolity did not please hirn, and she sensed that he loathed the scheming and petty politicking that went on all around hirn. She saw that he had a romantic na­ture-he read adventure novels, insisted on marching at the head of his armies, and had high ideals and a passion for glory. The court did not feed these fantasies of his; it was a banal, superficial world that bored hirn. The key to Louis's heart, Marie saw, would be to construct a mirror re­flecting his fantasies and his youthful yearnings for glory and romance. To begin with she immersed herself in the romantic novels, poems, and plays that she knew the young king read voraciously. When Louis began to en­gage her in conversation, to his delight she would talk of the things that stirred his soul-not this fashion or that piece of gossip, but rather courtly love, the deeds of great knights, the nobility of past kings and heroes. She fed his thirst for glory by creating an image of an august, superior king whom he could aspire to become. She stirred his imagination. As the future Sun King spent more and more time in Marie's presence, it eventually became dear that he had fallen in love with the least likely young woman of the court. To the horror of her sisters and mother, he showered Marie Mancini with attention. He brought her along on his mili­tary campaigns, and made a show of stationing her where she could watch as he marched into battle. He even promised Marie that he would marry her and make her queen. Mazarin, however, would never allow the king to marry his niece, a woman who could bring France no diplomatie or royal alliances. Louis had to marry a princess of Spain or Austria. In 1658 Louis succumbed to the pressure and agreed to break off the first romantic involvement of his life. He did so with much regret, and at the end of his life he acknowledged that he never loved anyone as much as Marie Mancini.

First, she took a step back, to study her prey. Seduction often fails to get past the first step because it is too aggressive; the first move must always be a retreat. By studying the king from a distance Marie saw what distinguished hirn from others-his high ideals, romantic nature, and snobbish disdain for petty politics. Marie's next step was to make a mirror for these hidden yearnings on Louis's part, letting hirn glimpse what he hirnself could be-a godlike king! This mirror had several functions: Satisfying Louis's ego by giving hirn a double to look at, it also focused on hirn so exdusively as to give him the fe eling that Marie existed for hirn alone. Surrounded by a pack of schem­ing courtiers who only had their own self-interest at heart, he could not fall to be touched by this devotional fo cus. Finally Marie's mirror set up an ideal for hirn to live up to: the noble knight of the medieval court. To a soul both romantic and ambitious, nothing could be more intoxicating than to have someone hold up an idealized reflection of hirn. In effect it was Marie Mancini who created the image of the Sun King-indeed Louis later ad­mitted the enormous part she had played in fashioning his radiant self­image. This is the power of the Seducer's Mirror: By doubling the tastes and ideals of the target, it shows your attention to his or her psychology, an at­tention more charming than any aggressive pursuit. Find out what sets the other person apart, then hold up the mirror that will reflect it and bring it out of them. Fe ed their fantasies of power and greatness by reflecting their ideals, and they will succumb. Observance IV In 1538, with the death of his mother, Helena, the eight-year-old future czar Ivan IV (or Ivan the Te rrible) of Russia became an orphan. For the next five years he watched as the princely dass, the boyars, terrorized the country. Now and then, to mock the young Ivan, they would make him wear a crown and scepter and place hirn on the throne. When the little boy's fe et dangled over the edge of the chair, they would laugh and lift him off it, handing hirn from man to man in the air, making hirn fe el his help­lessness compared to them. When Ivan was thirteen, he boldly murdered the boyar leader and as­cended to the throne. For the next few decades he struggled to subdue the boyars' power, but they continued to defy hirn. By 1575 his efforts to trans­form Russia and defeat its enemies had exhausted hirn. Meanwhile, his subjects were complaining bitterly about his endless wars, his secret police, the unvanquished and oppressive boyars. His own ministers began to ques­tion his moves. Finally he had had enough. In 1564 he had temporarily abandoned the throne, fo rcing his subjects to call hirn back to power. Now he took the strategy a step further, and abdicated. To take his place Ivan elevated a general of his, Simeon Bekbulatovich,"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"to the throne. But although Simeon had recently converted to Christianity, he was by birth a Tartar, and his enthronement was an insult to Ivan's sub­jects, since Russians looked down on the Ta rtars as inferiors and infidels. Ye t Ivan ordered that all Russians, including the boyars, pledge obedience to their new ruler. And while Simeon moved into the Kremlin, Ivan lived in a humble house on Moscow's outskirts, from which he would sometimes visit the palace, bow before the throne, sit among the other boyars, and humbly petition Simeon for favors. Over time it became clear that Simeon was a kind ofking's double. He dressed like Ivan, and acted like Ivan, but he had no real power, since no one would really obey hirn. The boyars at the court who were old enough to remember taunting Ivan when he was a boy, by placing hirn on the th rone, saw the connection: They had made Ivan feel like a weak pre­tender, so now he mirrored them by placing a weak pretender of his own on the throne. For two long years Ivan held the mirror of Simeon up to the Russian people. The mirror said: Yo ur whining and disobedience have made me a czar with no real power, so I will reflect back to you a czar with no real power. Yo u have treated me disrespectfully, so I will do the same to you, making Russia the laughingstock of the world. In 1577, in the name of the Ru ssian people, the chastised boyars once again begged Ivan to return to the throne, which he did. He lived as czar until his death, in 1584, and the eonspiracies, complaining, and second-guessing disappeared along with Simeon. Interpretation In 1564, after threatening to abdicate, Ivan had been granted ab solute pow­ers. But these powers had slowly been chipped away as every sector of so­eiety-the boyars, the church, the government-vied for more control. Fo reign wars had exhausted the country, internal bickering had increased, and Ivan's attempts to respond had been met with scorn. Russia had turned into a kind of boisterous classroom in which the pupils laughed openly at the teaeher. If he raised his voice or complained, he only met more resis­tance. He had to te ach them a lesson, give them a taste of their own medi­eine. Simeon Bekbulatovich was the mirror he used to do so. After two years in which the throne had been an object of ridicule and disgust, the Russian people leamed their lesson. They wanted their czar back, conceding to hirn all the dignity and respect that the position should always have commanded. For the rest of his reign, Russia and Ivan got along fine. Understand: People are locked in their own experiences. When you whine about some insensitivity on their part, they may seem to understand, but inwardly they are untouched and even more resistant. The goal of power is always to lower people's resistance to you. For this you need tricks, and one trick is to teach them a lesson. Instead of haranguing people verbally, then, create a kind of mirror of their behavior. In doing so you leave them two choices: They can ignore LAW 44 385"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"386 LAW 44 you, or they can start to think about themselves. And even if they ignore you, you will have planted a seed in their unconscious that will eventually take root. When you mirror their behavior, incidentally, do not be afraid to add a touch of caricature and exaggeration, as Ivan did by enthroning a Tartar-it is the little spiee in the soup that will open their eyes and make them see the ridiculousness in their own actions. Observance V Dr. Milton H. Erickson, a pioneer in strategie psychotherapy, would often educate his patients powerfully but indirectly by creating a kind of mirror effect. Constructing an analogy to make patients see the truth on their own, he would bypass their resistance to change. When Dr. Erickson treated married couples complaining of sexual problems, for instance, he often found that psychotherapy's tradition of direct confrontation and probIern­airing only heightened the spouses' resistance and sharpened their differ­ences. Instead, he would draw a husband and wife out on other topics, often banal ones, trying to find an analogy for the sexual conflict. In one couple's first session, the pair were discussing their eating habits, especially at dinner. The wife preferred the leisurely approach-a drink before the meal, some appetizers, and then a small main course, all at a slow, civilized pace. This frustrated the husband-he wanted to get din­ner over quickly and to dig right into the main course, the bigger the better. As the conversation continued, the couple began to catch glimpses of an analogy to their problems in bed. The moment they made this connection, however, Dr. Erickson would change the subject, carefully avoiding a dis­cussion of the real problem. The couple thought Erickson was just getting to know them and would deal with the problem directly the next time he saw them. But at the end of this first session, Dr. 'Erickson directed them to arrange a dinner a few nights away that would combine each person's desire: The wife would get the slow meal, including time spent bon ding, and the husband would get the big dishes he wanted to eat. Without realizing they were acting under the doctor's gentle guidance, the couple would walk into a mirror of their problem, and in the mirror they would solve their problems themselves, ending the evening just as the doctor had hoped-by mirroring the im­proved dinner dynamies in bed. In dealing with more severe problems, such as the schizophrenie's mirror fantasy world of his or her own construction, Dr. Erickson would al­ways try to enter the mirror and work within it. He once treated a hospital inmate who believed he was Jesus Christ-draping sheets around his body, talking in vague parables, and bombarding staff and patients with endless Christian proselytizing. No therapy or drugs seemed to work, until one day Dr. Erickson went up to the young man and said, \"I understand you have had experience as a carpenter.\" Being Christ, the patient had to say that he had had such experience, and Erickson immediately put hirn to work building bookcases and other useful items, allowing hirn to wear his Jesus garb. Over the next weeks, as the patient worked on these projects,"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"his mind became less occupied with Jesus fantasies and more focused on his labor. As the carpentry work took precedence, a psychic shift took ef­feet: The religious fantasies remained, but faded comfortably into the back­ground, allowing the man to function in society. Interpretation Communication depends on metaphors and symbols, which are the basis of language itself. A metaphor is a kind of mirror to the concrete and real, which it often expresses more clearly and deeply than a literal description does. When you are dealing with the intractable willpower of other people, direct communication often only heightens their resistance. This happens most clearly when you complain about people's behav­ior, particularly in sensitive areas such as their lovemaking. You will effect a far more lasting change if, like Dr. Erickson, you construct an analogy, a symbolic mirror of the situation, and guide the other through it. As Christ hirnself understood, talking in parables is often the best way to teach a les­son, for it allows people to realize the truth on their OWll. When dealing with people who are lost in the reflections of fantasy worlds (including a host of people who do not live in mental hospitals), never try to push them into reality by shattering their mirrors. Instead, enter their world and operate inside it, under their rules, gently guiding them out of the hall of mirrors they have entered. Observance VI The great sixteenth-century Japanese tea master Takeno Sho-o once passed by a house and noticed a young man watering flowers near his front gate. Two things caught Sho-o's attention-first, the graceful way the man performed his task; and, second, the stunningly beautiful rose of Sharon blossoms that bloomed in the garden. He stopped and introduced hirnself to the man, whose name was Sen no Rikyu. Sho-o wanted to stay, but he had a prior engagement and had to hurry off. Before he left, however, Rikyu invited hirn to take tea with him the following morning. Sho-o hap­pily accepted. When Sho-o opened the garden gate the next day, he was horrified to see that not a single flower remained. More than anything else, he had come to see the rose of Sharon blossoms that he had not had the time to ap­preciate the day before; now, disappointed, he started to leave, but at the gate he stopped hirnself, and decided to enter Sen no Rikyu's tea room. Im­mediately inside, he stopped in his tracks and gazed in astonishment: Be­fore hirn a vase hung from the ceiling, and in the vase stood a single rose of Sharon blossom, the most beautiful in the garden. Somehow Sen no Rikyu had read his guest's thoughts, and, with this one eloquent gesture, had demonstrated that this day guest and host would be in perfect harmony. Sen no Rikyu went on to become the most famous tea master of all, and his trademark was this uncanny ability to harmonize hirnself with his guests' thoughts and to think one step ahead, enchanting them by adapting to their taste. One day Rikyu was invited to tea by Yamashina Hechigwan, an ad-LAW 44 387"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"388 LAW 44 mirer of the tea ceremony but also a man with a vivid sense of humor. When Rikyu arrived at Hechigwan's horne, he found the garden gate shut, so he opened it to look for the host. On the other side of the gate he saw that someone had first dug a ditch, then carefully covered it over with can­vas and earth. Realizing that Hechigwan had planned a practical joke, he obligingly walked right into the ditch, muddying his clothes in the process. Apparently horrified, Hechigwan came running out, and hurried Rikyu to a bath that for some inexplicable reason stood already prepared. After bathing, Rikyu joined Hechigwan in the tea ceremony, which both enjoyed immensely, sharing a laugh about the accident. Later Sen no Rikyu explained to a friend that he had heard about Hechigwan's practical joke beforehand, \"But since it should always be one's aim to conform to the wishes of one's host, I fell into the hole knowingly and thus assured the success of the meeting. Tea is by no means mere obsequiousness, but there is no tea where the host and guest are not in harmony with one another.\" Hechigwan's vision of the dignified Sen no Rikyu at the bottom of a ditch had pleased him endlessly, but Rikyu had gained a pleasure of his own in complying with his host's wish and watching him amuse hirnself in this way. Interpretation Sen no Rikyu was no magician or seer-he watched those around hirn acutely, plumbing the subtle gestures that revealed a hidden desire, then producing that desire's image. Although Sho-o never spoke of being en­chanted by the rose of Sharon blossoms, Rikyu read it in his eyes. If mir­roring a person's desires meant falling into a ditch, so be it. Rikyu's power resided in his skillful use of the Courtier's Mirror, which gave hirn the ap­pearance of an unusual ability to see into other people. Learn to manipulate the Courtier's MirrOf, for it will bring you great power. Study people's eyes, follow their gestures-surer barometers of pain and pleasure than any spoken word. Notice and remember the details-the clothing, the choice of friends, the daily habits, the tossed-out remarks­that reveal hidden and rarely indulged desires. Soak it all in, find out what lies under the surface, then make yourself the mirror of their unspoken selves. That is the key to this power: The other person has not asked for your consideration, has not mentioned his pleasure in the rose of Sharon, and when you reflect it back to hirn his pleasure is heightened because it is unasked for. Remember: The wordless communication, the indirect com­pliment, contains the most power. No one can resist the enchantment of the Courtier's Mirror. Observance VII Yellow Kid Weil, con artist extraordinaire, used the Deceiver's Mirror in his most brilliant cons. Most audacious of all was his re-creation of a bank in Muncie, Indiana. When Weil read one day that the Merchants Bank in Muncie had moved, he saw an opportunity he could not pass up. Weil rented out the original Merchants building, which still contained bank furniture, complete with teller windows. He bought money bags,"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"stenciled a bank's invented name on them, filled them with steel washers, and arrayed them impressively behind the teller windows, along with bun­dIes of boodle-real bills hiding newspaper cut to size. For his bank's staff and customers Weil hired gambIers, bookies, girls from local bawdy houses, and other assorted confederates. He even had a local thug pose as a bank dick. Claiming to be the broker for a certificate investment the bank was of­fering, Weil would fish the waters and hook the proper wealthy sucker. He would bring this man to the bank and ask to see the president. An \"officer\" of the bank would tell them that they had to wait, which only heightened the realism of the con-one always has to wait to see the bank president. And as they waited the bank would bustle with banklike activity, as call girls and bookies in disguise floated in and out, making deposits and with­drawals and tipping their hats to the phony bank dick. Lulled by this per­feet copy of reality, the sucker would deposit $50,000 into the fake bank without a worry in the world. Over the years Weil did the same thing with a deserted yacht club, an abandoned brokerage office, a relocated real estate office, and a com­pletely realistic gambling club. Interpretation The mirroring of reality offers immense deceptive powers. The right uni­form, the perfect accent, the proper props--the deception cannot be deci­phered because it is enmeshed in a simulation of reality. People have an intense desire and need to believe, and their first instinct is to trust a well­construeted facade, to mistake it for reality. After all, we cannot go around doubting the reality of everything we see-that would be too exhausting. We habitually accept appearances, and this is a credulity you can use. In this particular game it is the first moment that counts the most. If YOUf suckers' suspicions are not raised by their first glance at the mirror's reflection, they will stay suppressed. Once they enter your hall of mirrors, they will be unable to distinguish the real from the fake, and it will become easier and easier to deceive them. Remember: Study the world's surfaces and leam to mirror them in your habits, your manner, YOUf clothes. Like a camivorous plant, to unsuspecting insects you will look like all the other plants in the field. Authority: The task of a military operation is to accord decep­tively with the intentions of the enemy ... get to what they want first, subtly anticipate them.

In 1864 the composer Richard Wagner moved to Munich at the behest of Ludwig 11, known variously as the Swan King or the Mad King of Bavaria. Ludwig was Wagner's biggest fan and most generous patron. The strength of his support tumed Wagner's head-once established in Munich under the king's protection, he would be able to say and do whatever he wanted. Wagner moved into a lavish house, which the king eventually bought for hirn. This house was but a stone's throw from the former horne of Lola Montez, the notorious courtesan who had plunged Ludwig lI's grandfather into a crisis that had forced hirn to abdicate. Wamed that he could be in­fected by this association, Wagner only scoffed-\"I am no Lola Montez,\" he said. So on enough, however, the citizens of Munich began to resent the favors and money showered on Wagner, and dubbed hirn \"the second Lola,\" or \"Lolotte.\" He unconsciously began to tread in Lola's footsteps­spending money extravagantly, meddling in matters beyond music, even dabbling in politics and advising the king on cabinet appointments. Mean­while Ludwig's affection for Wagner seemed intense and undignified for a king-just like his grandfather's love for Lola Montez."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"Eventually Ludwig's ministers wrote bim a letter: \"Your Majesty now stands at a fateful parting of the ways: you have to choose between the love and respect of your faithful people and the 'friendship' of Richard Wag­ner.\" In December of 1865, Ludwig politely asked bis friend to leave and never return. Wagner had inadvertently placed himself in Lola Montez's reflection. Once there, everything he did reminded the stolid Bavarians of that dread woman, and there was nothing he could do ab out it. Avoid such association-effects like the plague. In a mirrored situation you have little or no control over the reflections and recollections that will be connected to you, and any situation beyond your control is dangerous. Even if the person or event has positive associations, you will suffer from not being able to live up to them, since the past generally ap pears greater than the present.

The pope, Clement VII, opposed the divorce, and threatened the king with excommunication. The king's most powerful minister, Cardinal Wolsey, also saw no need for divorce--and his halfhearted support of the king cost hirn his position and soon his life. One man in Henry's cabinet, Thomas CromwelI, not only supported him in his desire for a divorce but had an idea for realizing it: a complete break with the past. He convinced the king that by severing ties with Rome and making hirnself the head of a newly formed English church, he could divorce Catherine and marry Anne. By 1531 Henry saw this as the only so­lution. To reward Cromwell for his simple but brilliant idea, he elevated this son of a blacksmith to the post of royal councillor. By 1534 Cromwell had been named the king's secretary, and as the power behind the throne he had become the most powerful man in Eng­land. But for hirn the break with Rome went beyond' the satisfaction of the king's carnal desires: He envisioned a new Protestant order in England, with the power of the Catholic Church smashed and its vast wealth in the hands of the king and the govemment. In that same year he initiated a complete survey of the churches and monasteries of England. And as it turned out, the treasures and moneys that the churches had accumulated over the centuries were far more than he had imagined; his spies and agents came back with astonishing figures. To justify his schemes, Cromwell circulated stories about the corrup­tion in the English monasteries, their abuse of power, their exploitation of the people they supposedly served. Having won Parliament's support for breaking up the monasteries, he began to seize their holdings and to put them out of existence one by one. At the same time, he began to impose Protestantism, introducing reforms in religious ritual and punishing those who stuck to Catholicism, and who now were called heretics. Virtually overnight, England was converted to a new official religion. A terror fell on the country. Some people had suffered under the Catholic Church, which before the reforms had been immensely powerful, but most Britons had strong ties to Catholicism and to its comforting ritu­als. They watched in horror as churches were demolished, images of the Madonna and saints were broken in pieces, stained-glass windows were smashed, and the churches' treasures were confiscated. With monasteries that had succored the poor suddenly gone, the poor now flooded the streets. The growing ranks of the beggar dass were further swelled by for­mer monks. On top of all this, CromwelIlevied high taxes to pay for his ec­clesiastical reforms. In 1535 powerful revolts in the North of England threatened to toppie Henry from his throne. By the fo llowing year he had suppressed the rebel­Hons, but he had also begun to see the costs of Cromwell's reforms. The king hirnself had never wanted to go this far-he had only wanted a di-WIIEHE CHHISTMAS CAME FHOM Celebrating the turn of the year is an ancient custom. The Romans celebrated the Saturna­lia, the festival of Saturn, god of the harvest, between December 17 and 23. It was the most cheerful festival of the year. All work and commerce stopped, and the streets were filled with crowds and a carnival atmos­phere. Slaves were temporarily freed, and the houses were deco­rated with laurel branches. People visited one another, bringing gifts ofwax candles and little clay figurines. Long before the birth of Christ, the lews cele­brated an eight-day Festival of Lights [at the same season}, and it is believed that the Germanie peoples held a great festival not only at midsummer but also at the winter solstice, when they celebrated the rebirth of the sun and honored the great fertility gods Wotan and Freyja, Donar (Thor) and Freyr. Even after the Emperor Constantine (A.D. 306-337) declared Christianity to be Rome's official impe­rial religion, the evoca­tion of light and fe rtility as an important component of pre­Christian midwinter celebrations could not be entirely suppressed. In the year 274 the Roman Emperor Aure­lian (A.D. 214-275) had established an official LAW 45 393"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"mit of the sun-god Mithras, declaring his birthday, December 25, anational holiday.

So it was a clever move when, in the year A.D. 354, the Christian church under Pope Liberius (352-366) co­opted the birthday of Mithras and declared December 25 to be the birthday of Jesus Christ.

It was now Cromwell's turn to watch uneasily as the king began slowly to undo his reforms, reinstating Catholic sacraments and other ritu­als that Cromwell had outlawed. Sensing his fall from grace, in 1540 Cromwell decided to regain Henry's favor with one throw of the dice: He would find the king a new wife. Henry's third wife, lane Seymour, had died a few years before, and he had been pining for a new young queen. It was Cromwell who found hirn one: Anne of Cleves, a German princess and, most important to Cromwell, a Protestant. On Cromwell's commission, the painter Holbein produced a flattering portrait of Anne; when Henry saw it, he fell in love, and agreed to marry her. Cromwell seemed back in favor. Unfortunately, however, Holbein's painting was highly idealized, and when the king finally met the princess she did not please hirn in the least. His anger against Cromwell-first for the ill-conceived reforms, now for saddling hirn with an unattractive and Protestant wife-could no longer be contained. In lune of that year, Cromwell was arrested, charged as a Protes­tant extremist and a heretic, and sent to the Tower. Six weeks later, before a large and enthusiastic crowd, the public executioner cut off his head. Interpretation Thomas Cromwell had a simple idea: He would break up the power and wealth of the Church and lay the foundation for Protestantism in England. And he would do this in a mercilessly short time. He knew his speedy re­forms would cause pain and resentment, but he thought these feelings would fade in a few years. More important, by identifying hirns elf with change, he would become the leader of the new order, making the king de­pendent on hirn. But there was a problem in his strategy: Like a billiard ball hit too hard against the cushion, his reforms had reactions and caroms he did not envision and could not control. The man who initiates strong reforms often becomes the scapegoat for any kind of dissatisfaction. And eventually the reaction to his reforms may consume hirn, for change is upsetting to the human animal, even when it is for the good. Because the world is and always has been full of insecurity and threat, we latch on to familiar faces and create habits and rituals to make the world more comfortable. Change can be pleasant and even sometimes desirable in the abstract, but too much of it creates an anxiety that will stir and boil beneath the surface and then eventually erupt. Never underestimate the hidden conservatism of those around you. It is powerful and entrenched. Never let the seductive charm of an idea cloud your reason: lust as you cannot make people see the world your way, you cannot wrench them into the future with painful changes. They will rebel. If reform is necessary, anticipate the re action against it and find ways to disguise the change and sweeten the poison. OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW As a young Communist in the 1920s, Mao Tse-tung understood better than any of his colleagues the incredible odds against a Communist victory in"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"China. With their small numbers, limited funds, lack of military experi­ence, and small arsenal of weapons, the Party had no hope of success un­less it won over China's immense peasant population. But who in the world was more conservative, more rooted in tradition, than the Chinese peasantry? The oldest civilization on the planet had a history that would never loosen its power, no matter how violent the revolution. The ideas of Confucius remained as alive in the 1920s as they had been in the sixth cen­tury B.C., when the philosopher was alive. Despite the oppressions of the current system, would the peasantry ever give up the deep-rooted values of the past for the great unknown of Communism? The solution, as Mao saw it, involved a simple deception: Cloak the revolution in the clothing of the past, making it comforting and legitimate in people's eyes. One of Mao's favorite books was the very popular me­dieval Chinese novel The Water Marg in, which recounts the exploits of a Chinese Robin Hood and his robber band as they struggle against a cor­rupt and evil monarch. In China in Mao's time, family ties dominated over any other kind, for the Confucian hierarchy of father and oldest son re­mained firmly in place; but The Water Marg in preached a superior value­the fraternal ties of the band of robbers, the nobility of the cause that unites people beyond blood. The novel had great emotional resonance for Chi­nese people, who love to root for the underdog. Time and again, then, Mao would present his revolutionary army as an extension of the robber band in The Water Margin, likening his struggle to the timeless conflict be­tween the oppressed peasantry and an evil emperor. He made the past seem to envelop and legitimize the Communist cause; the peasantry could feel comfortable with and even support a group with such roots in the past. Even on ce the Party came to power, Mao continued to associate it with the past. He presented himself to the masses not as a Chinese Lenin but as a modern Chuko Liang, the real-life third-century strategist who figures prominently in the popular historical novel The Romance 0/ the Three King­doms. Liang was more than a great general-he was a poet, a philosoph er, and a figure of stern moral rectitude. So Mao represented himself as a poet­warrior like Liang, a man who mixed strategy with philosophy and preached a new ethics. He made himself appear like a hero from the great Chinese tradition of warrior statesmen. Soon, everything in Mao's speeches and writings had a reference to an earlier period in Chinese history. He recalled, for example, the great Em­peror Ch'in, who had unified the country in the third century B.C. Ch'in had burned the works of Confucius, consolidated and completed the build­ing of the Great Wall, and given his name to China. Like Ch'in, Mao also had brought the country together, and had sought bold reforms against an oppressive past. Ch'in had traditionally been seen as a violent dictator wh ose reign was short; the brilliance of Mao's strategy was to turn this around, simultaneously reinterpreting Ch'in, justifying his rule in the eyes of present-day Chinese, and using him to justify the violence of the new order that Mao himself was creating. Mter the failed Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s, apower struggle LAW 45 395"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"396 LAW 45 emerged in the Communist Party in which Mao's main foe was Lin Piao, once a elose friend of his. To make elear to the masses the difference be­tween his philosophy and Lin's, Mao once again exploited the past: He cast his opponent as representing Confucius, a philosopher Lin in fact would constantly quote. And Confucius signified the conservatism of the past. Mao associated himself, on the other hand, with the ancient philo­sophical movement known as Legalism, exemplified by the writings of Han-fei-tzu. The Legalists disdained Confucian ethics; they believed in the need for violence to create a new order. They worshiped power. To give hirnself weight in the struggle, Mao unleashed a nationwide propaganda campaign against Confucius, using the issues of Confucianism versus Le­galism to whip the young into a kind of frenzied revolt against the older generation. This grand context enveloped a rather banal power struggle, and Mao once again won over the masses and triumphed over his enemies. Interpretation No people had a more profound attachment to the past than the Chinese. In the face of this enormous obstaele to reform, Mao's strategy was simple: Instead of struggling against the past, he turned it to his advantage, associ­ating his radical Communists with the romantic figures of Chinese history. Weaving the story of the War of the Three Kingdoms into the struggle be­tween the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, he cast hirnself as Chuko Liang. As the emperors had, he welcomed the cultlike adoration of the masses, understanding that the Chinese could not function without some kind of father figure to admire. And after he made a terrible blunder with the Great Leap Forward, trying to force modernization on the country and failing miserably, he never repeated his mistake: From then on, radical change had to be eloaked in the comfortable elothes of the past. The lesson is simple: The past is powerful. What has happened before seems greater; habit and history give any act weight. Use this to your ad­vantage. When you destroy the familiar you create a void or vacuum; peo­pIe fear the chaos that will flood in to fill it. You must avoid stirring up such fe ars at all cost. Borrow the weight and legitimacy from the past, however remote, to create a comf orting and familiar presence. This will give your actions romantic associations, add to your presence, and eloak the nature of the changes you are attempting. It must be considered that there is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful 0/ success, nor more dangerous to handle, than to initiate a new order 0/ things.

They know that change is necessary, and that novelty provides relief from boredom, but deep inside they cling to the past. Change in the abstract, or superficial change, they desire, but a change that upsets core habits and routines is deeply disturbing to them. No revolution has gone without a powerftIllater reaction against it, for in the long run the void it creates proves too unsettling to the human ani­mal, who unconsciously associates such voids with death and chaos. The opportunity for change and renewal seduces people to the side of the revo­lution, but once their enthusiasm fades, which it will, they are left with a certain emptiness. Ye arning for the past, they create an opening for it to creep back in. For Machiavelli, the prophet who preaches and brings change can only survive by taking up arms: When the masses inevitably yearn for the past, he must be ready to use force. But the armed prophet cannot last long unless he quickly creates a new set of values and rituals to replace the old ones, and to soothe the anxieties of those who dread change. It is far easier, and less bloody, to playakind of con game. Preach change as much as you like, and even enact your reforms, but give them the comforting appear­ance of older events and traditions. Reigning from A.D. 8 to A.D. 23, the Chinese emperor Wang Mang emerged from a period of great historical turbulence in which the people yearned for order, an order represented for them by Confucius. Some two hundred years earlier, however, Emperor Ch'in had ordered the writings of Confucius burned. A few years later, word had spread that certain texts had miraculously survived, hidden under the scholar's house. These texts may not have been genuine, but they gave Wang his opportunity: He first confiscated them, then had his scribes insert passages into them that seemed to support the changes he had been imposing on the country. When he released the texts, it seemed that Confucius sanctioned Wang's reforms, and the people feIt comforted and accepted them more easily. Understand: The fact that the past is dead and buried gives you the freedom to reinterpret it. To support YOUT cause, tinker with the facts. The past is a text in which you can safely insert YOUT own lines. A simple ge sture like using an old title, or keeping the same number for a group, will tie you to the past and support you with the authority of history. As Machiavelli hirnself observed, the Romans used this device when they transformed their monarchy into a republic. They may have in­stalled two consuls in place of the king, but since the king had been served by twelve lictors, they retained the same number to serve under the con­suls. The king had personally performed an annual sacrifice, in a great spectacle that stirred the public; the republic retained this practice, only transferring it to a special \"chief of the ceremony, whom they called the King of the sacrifice.\" These and similar ge stures satisfied the people and kept them from clamoring for the monarchy's return.

Cosimo de' Medici made a show of enthusiastic sup­port for the republic, while in reality he worked to bring the city under the control of his wealthy family. In form, the Medicis retained the appearance of a republic; in substance, they rendered it powerless. They quietly en­acted a radical change, while appearing to safeguard tradition. Science claims a search for truth that would seem to protect it from conservatism and the irrationality of habit: It is a culture of innovation. Ye t when Charles Darwin published his ideas of evolution, he faced fiercer op­position from his fellow scientists than from religious authorities. His theo­ries challenged too many fixed ideas. Jonas Salk ran into the same wall with his radical innovations in immunology, as did Max Planck with his revolutionizing of physics. Planck later wrote of the scientific opposition he faced, \"A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.\" The answer to this innate conservatism is to play the cOUftier's game. Galileo did this at the beginning of his scientific career; he later became more confrontational, and paid for it. So pay lip service to tradition. Iden­tify the elements in YOUf revolution that can be made to seem to build on the past. Say the right things, make a show of conformity, and meanwhile let YOUf theories do their radical work. Play with appearances and respect past protocol. This is true in every arena-science being no exception. Finally, powerful people pay attention to the zeitgeist. If their reform is too far ahead of its time, few will understand it, and it will stir up anxiety and be hopelessly misinterpreted. The changes you make must seem less innovative than they are. England did eventually become a Protestant na­tion, as Cromwell wished, but it took over a century of gradual evolution. Watch the zeitgeist. If you work in a tumultuous time, there is power to be gained by preaching areturn to the past, to comfort, tradition, and rit­ual. During aperiod of stagnation, on the other hand, play the card of re­form and revolution-but beware of what you stir up. Those who finish a revolution are rarely those who start it.

They so on became lovers and moved in together. Halliwell, twenty-five at the time, was seven years older than Orton, and seemed the more confident of the two; but neither had much talent as actors, and after graduating, having set­tled down together in a dank London apartment, they decided to give up acting and collaborate as writers instead. Halliwell's inheritance was enough to keep them from having to find work for a few years, and in the beginning, he was also the driving force behind the stories and novels they wrote; he would dictate to Orton, who would type the manuscripts, occa­sionally inteIjecting his own lines and ideas. Their first efforts attracted some interest from literary agents, but it sputtered. The promise they had shown was leading nowhere. Eventually the inheritance money ran out, and the pair had to look for work. Their collaborations were less enthusiastic and less frequent. The fu­ture looked bleak. In 1957 Orton began to write on his own, but it wasn't until five years later, when the lovers were jailed for six months for defacing dozens of li­brary books, that he began to find his voice (perhaps not by chance: This was the first time he and Halliwell had been separated in nine years). He came out of prison determined to express his contempt for English society in the form of theatrical farces. He and Halliwell moved back in together, but now the roles were reversed: Orton did the writing while Halliwell put in comments and ideas. In 1964 Joe Orton completed his first full-length play, EnteTtaining MT. Sloane. The play made it to London's West End, where it received brilliant reviews: A great new writer had emerged from nowhere. Now success fol­lowed s lccess, at a dizzying pace. In 1966 Orton had a hit with his play Loot, and his popularity soared. Soon commissions came in from all sides, including from the Beatles, who paid Orton handsomely to write them a film script. Everything was pointing upwards, everything except Orton's relation­ship with Kenneth Halliwell. The pair still lived together, but as Orton grew successful, Halliwell began to deteriorate. Watching his lover become the center of attention, he suffered the humiliation of becoming a kind of personal assistant to the playwright, his role in what had once been a col­laboration growing smaller and smaller. In the 1950s he had supported Orton with his inheritance; now Orton supported hirn. At a party or among friends, people would naturally gravitate towards Orton-he was charming, and his mood was almost always buoyant. Unlike the handsome Orton, Halliwell was bald and awkward; his defensiveness made people want to avoid hirn. With Orton's success the couple's problems only worsened.

After Orton found success, the diaries began to describe Halliwell's brooding, his rude comments at parties, his growing sense of inferiority. All of this Orton narrated with a distance that bordered on contempt. The diaries made clear Halliwell's bittemess over Orton's success. Eventually the only thing that would have satisfied hirn would have been for Orton to have a failure of his own, an unsuccessful play perhaps, so that they could have commiserated in their failure, as they had done years be­fore. When the opposite happened-as Orton grew only more successful and popular-Halliwell did the only thing that would make them equals again: He made them equals in death. With Orton's murder, he became al­most as famous as his friend-posthumously. Joe Orton only partly understood his lover's deterioration. His attempt to help Halliwelliaunch a career in art registered for what it was: charity and guilt. Orton basically had two possible solutions to the problem.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW The merchant dass and the craft guilds to which medieval Florence owed its prosperity had created a republic that protected them from oppression by the nobility. Since high office could only be held for a few months, no one could gain lasting dominance, and although this meant that the politi­cal factions struggled constantly for control, the system kept out tyrants and petty dictators. The Medici family lived for several centuries under this system without making much of a mark. They had modest origins as apothecaries, and were typical middle-dass citizens. Not until the late four­teenth century, when Giovanni de' Medici made a modest fortune in bank­ing, did they emerge as a force to be reckoned with. Upon Giovanni's death, his son Cosimo took over the family business, and quickly demonstrated his talent for it. The business prospered under his control and the Medicis emerged as one of the preeminent banking families of Europe. But they had a riyal in Florence: Despite the city's re­publican system, one family, the Albizzis, had managed over the years to monopolize control of the govemment, forging alliances that allowed them to constantly fill important offices with their own men. Cosimo did not fight this, and in fact gave the Albizzis his tacit support. At the same time, while the Albizzis were beginning to flaunt their power, Cosimo made a point of staying in the background. Eventually, however, the Medici wealth could not be ignored, and in 1433, feeling threatened by the family, the Albizzis used their govemment musde to have Cosimo arrested on charges of conspiring to overthrow the republic. Some in the Albizzi faction wanted Cosimo executed, others feared this would spark a civil war. In the end they exiled hirn from Flo­rence. Cosimo did not fight the sentence; he left quietly. Sometimes, he knew, it is wiser to bide one's time and keep a low profile. Over the next year, the Albizzis began to stir up fears that they were setting up a dictatorship. Meanwhile, Cosimo, using his wealth to advan­tage, continued to exert influence on Florentine affairs, even from exile. A civil war broke out in the city, and in September of 1434 the Albizzis were toppled fr om power and sent into exile. Cosimo immediately retumed to Florence, his position restored. But he saw that he now faced a delicate sit­uation: If he seemed ambitious, as the Albizzis had, he would stir up oppo­sition and envy that would ultimately threaten his business.

Those who complained of his growing political dout were taxed into submission, or their properties were bought out from under them by Cosimo's banker allies. The republic survived in name only. Cosimo held the strings. While he worked behind the scenes to gain control, however, publidy Cosimo presented another picture. When he walked through the streets of F1orence, he dressed modestly, was attended by no more than one ser­vant, and bowed deferentially to magistrates and eIder citizens. He rode a mule instead of a horse. He never spoke out on matters of public import, even though he controlled F1orence's fo reign affairs for over thirty years. He gave money to charities and maintained his ties to F1orence's merchant dass. He financed all kinds of public buildings that fe d the F1orentines' pride in their city. When he built a palace for hirnself and his family in nearby Fiesoie, he turned down the ornate designs that Brunelleschi had drawn up for hirn and instead chose a modest structure designed by Michelozzo, a man of humble F10rentine origins. The palace was a symbol of Cosimo's strategy-all simplicity on the outside, all elegance and opu­lence within. Cosimo finally died in 1464, after ruling for thirty years. The citizens of F10rence wanted to build hirn a great tomb, and to celebrate his memory with elaborate funeral ceremonies, but on his deathbed he had asked to be buried without \"any pomp or demonstration.\" Some sixty years later, Machiavelli hailed Cosimo as the wisest of all princes, \"for he knew how extraordinary things that are seen and appear every hour make men much more envied than those that are done in deed and are covered over with decency.\" Interpretation A dose friend of Cosimo's, the bookseller Ve spasiano da Bisticci, once wrote of hirn, ''And whenever he wished to achieve something, he saw to it, in order to escape envy as much as possible, that the initiative appeared to come from others, and not from hirn.\" One of Cosimo's favorite expres­sions was, \"Envy is a weed that should not be watered.\" Understanding the power envy has in a democratic environment, Cosimo avoided the appear­ance of greatness.

Make a display of deferring to others, as if they were more powerful than you. Cosimo de' Medici per­fected this game; he was a consummate con artist of appearances. No one could gauge the extent of his power-his modest exterior hid the truth. Never be so fo olish as to believe that you are stirring up admiration by flaunting the qualities that raise you ab ove others. By making others aware of their inferior position, you are only stirring up \"unhappy admiration,\" or envy, which will gnaw away at them until they undermine you in ways you cannot foresee. The fo ol dares the gods of envy by flaunting his victories. The master of power understands that the appearance of superiority over others is inconsequential next to the reality of it. Of alt the disorders of the soul, envy is the only one no one confesses to. Plutarch, c. A.lJ. 46-120 KEYS TO POWER The human animal has a hard time dealing with feelings of inferiority. In the face of superior skill, talent, or power, we are often disturbed and ill at ease; this is because most of us have an inflated sense of ourselves, and when we meet people who surpass us they make it dear to us that we are in fact mediocre, or at least not as brilliant as we had thought. This distur­bance in our self-image cannot last long without stirring up ugly emotions. At first we feel envy: If only we had the quality or skill of the superior per­son, we would be happy. But envy brings us neither comfort nor any doser to equality. Nor can we admit to feeling it, for it is frowned upon socially­to show envy is to admit to feeling inferior. To dose friends, we may con­fe ss our secret unrealized desires, but we will never confess to feeling envy. So it goes underground. We disguise it in many ways, like finding grounds to criticize the person who makes us feel it: He may be smarter than I am, we say, but he has no morals or conscience. Or he may have more power, but that's because he cheats. If we do not slander hirn, perhaps we praise hirn excessively-another of envy's disguises. There are several strategies for dealing with the insidious, destructive emotion of envy. First, accept the fact that there will be people who will surpass you in some way, and also the fact that you may envy them. But make that feeling a way of pushing yourself to equal or surpass thern some­day. Let envy turn inward and it poisons the soul; expel it outward and it can move you to greater heights. Second, understand that as you gain power, those below you will fe el envious of you. They may not show it but it is inevitable. Do not naively ac­cept the facade they show you-read between the lines of their criticisms, their little sarcastic remarks, the signs of backstabbing, the excessive praise that is preparing you for a fall, the resentfullook in the eye. Half the prob­lem with envy comes when we do not recognize it until it is too late. Finally, expect that when people envy you they will work against you The envious hides as carefully lIS the secret, lustful sinner lind becomes Ihe endless inventor of tricks and strllillgems 10 hide and mask himself Thus he is able to pretend to ignore the superiority of others which eats up his heart, as if he <lid not see them, nor hellr them, nor were aWllre of them, nor hat! ever heard of them.

They will put obstacles in your path that you will not foresee, or that you cannot trace to their source. It is hard to defend yourself against this kind of attack. And by the time you realize that envy is at the root of a person's feelings about you, it is often too late: Your excuses, your false hu­mility, your defensive actions, only exacerbate the problem. Since it is far easier to avoid creating envy in the first place than to get rid of it once it is there, you should strategize to forestall it before it grows. It is often your own actions that stir up envy, your own unawareness. By becoming con­scious of those actions and qualities that create envy, you can take the teeth out of it before it nibbles you to death. Kierkegaard believed that there are types of people who create envy, and are as guilty when it arises as those who feel it. The most obvious type we all know: The moment something good happens to them, whether by luck or design, they crow about it. In fact they get pleasure out of making people feel inferior. This type is obvious and beyond hope. There are oth­ers, however, who stir up envy in more subtle and unconscious ways, and are partly to blame for their troubles. Envy is often a problem, for exam­pIe, for people with great natural talent. Sir Walter Raleigh was one of the most brilliant men at the court of Queen Elizabeth of England. He had skills as a scientist, wrote poetry still recognized as among the most beautiful writing of the time, was a proven leader of men, an enterprising entrepreneur, a great sea captain, and on top of all this was a handsome, dashing courtier who charmed his way into becoming one of the queen's favorites. Wherever he went, however, peo­pIe blocked his path. Eventually he suffered a terrific fall from grace, lead­ing even to prison and finally the executioner's axe. Raleigh could not understand the stubbom opposition he faced from the other courtiers. He did not see that he had not only made no attempt to disguise the degree of his skills and qualities, he had imposed them on one and all, making a show of his versatility, thinking it impressed people and won hirn friends. In fact it made hirn silent enemies, people who feIt infe­rior to hirn and did all they could to ruin hirn the moment he tripped up or made the slightest mistake. In the end, the reason he was executed was treason, but envy will use any cover it finds to mask its destructiveness. The envy elicited by Sir WaIter Raleigh is the worst kind: It was in­spired by his natural talent and grace, which he feIt was best displayed in its full flower. Money others can attain; power as weIl. But superior intelli­gence, good looks, charm-these are qualities no one can acquire. The nat­urally perfeet have to work the most to disguise their brilliance, displaying a defeet or two to deflect envy before it takes root. It is a common and naive mistake to think you are charming people with your natural talents when in fact they are coming to hate you. A great danger in the realm of power is the sudden improvement in for­tune-an unexpected promotion, a victory or success that seems to come out of nowhere. This is sure to stir up envy among your former peers. When Archbishop de Retz was promoted to the rank of cardinal, in 1651, he knew full weIl that many of his former colleagues envied hirn."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"Understanding the foolishness of alienating those below hirn, de Retz did everything he could to downplay his merit and emphasize the role of luck in his success. To put people at ease, he acted humbly and deferentially, as if nothing had changed. (In reality, of course, he now had much more power than before.) He wrote that these wise policies \"produced a good effect, by lessening the envy which was conceived against me, which is the greatest of all secrets.\" Follow de Retz's example. Subtly emphasize how lucky you have been, to make your happiness seem more attainable to other people, and the need for envy less acute. But be careful not to affect a false modesty that people can easily see through. This will only make them more envious. The act has to be good; your humility, and your openness to those you have left behind, have to seem genuine. Any hint of insincerity will only make your new status more oppressive. Remember: Despite your elevated posi­tion, it will do you no good to alienate your former peers. Power requires a wide and solid support base, which envy can silently destroy. Political power of any kind creates envy, and one of the best ways to deflect it before it takes root is to seem unambitious. When Ivan the Te rri­ble died, Boris Godunov knew he was the only one on the scene who could lead Russia. But if he sought the position eagerly, he would stir up envy and suspicion among the boyars, so he refused the crown, not once but several times. He made people insist that he take the throne. George Wash­ington used the same strategy to great effect, first in refusing to keep the po­sition of Commander in Chief of the American army, second in resisting the presidency. In both cases he made hirnself more popular than ever. People cannot envy the power that they themselves have given a person who does not seem to desire it. According to the Elizabethan statesman and writer Sir Francis Bacon, the wisest policy of the powerful is to create a kind of pity for themselves, as if their responsibilities were a burden and a sacrifice. How can one envy a man who has taken on a heavy load for the public interest? Disguise your power as a kind of self-sacrifice rather than a source of happiness and you make it seem less enviable. Emphasize your troubles and you turn a poten­tial danger (envy) into a source ofmoral support (pity). A similar ploy is to hint that your good fortune will benefit those around you. To do this you may need to open your purse strings, like Cimon, a wealthy general in an­cient Athens who gave lavishly in all kinds of ways to prevent people from resenting the influence he had bought in Athenian politics. He paid a high price to deflect their envy, but in the end it saved hirn from ostracism and banishment from the city. The painter J. M. W. Turner devised another way of giving to deflect the envy of his fellow artists, which he recognized as his greatest obstacle to his success. Noticing that his incomparable color skills made them afraid to hang their paintings next to his in exhibitions, he realized that their fear would turn to envy, and would eventually make it harder for hirn to find galleries to show in. On occasion, then, Tu rner is known to have tempo rar­ily dampened the colors in his paintings with soot to earn hirn the goodwill of his colleagues. one of his men to have them embarked. He himself returned to Rome. ... The quantity of marbles was immense, so that, spread over the piazza, they were the admiration of all and a joy to the pope, who heaped immeasurable fa vors upon Michelan­gelo; and when he began to work upon them again and again went to see him at his house, and talked to him about the tomb and other things as with his own brather. And in order that he might more easily go to him, the pope ordered that a drawbridge should be thrown across fram the Corri­dore to the raoms of Michelangelo, by which he might visit him in private. These many and frequent favors were the cause (as often is the case at court) of much envy, and, after the envy, of endless persecution, since Bramante, the architect, who was loved hy the pope, made him change his mind as to the monument hy te/Ung him, as is said by the vulgar, that it is unlucky to build one's tomh in one's lifetime, and other tales. Fear as welt as envy stimulated Bramante, fo r the judg­ment of Michelangelo had exposed many of his errars ....

VITA DI MICHELANGELO, ASCANIO CONDIVI, 1553 Did ever anybody seri­ously confess to envy? Something there is in it universally feit to be more shameful than even felonious crime. And not only does everybody disown it, but the better sort are inclined to incredulity when it is in earnest imputed 10 an intelli­gent man. But since ludgment is in the heart not the brain, no degree uf intellect supplies a guarantee against it. BII.LY BUDD, HERMAN MELVILLE. 1819-1891 408 LAW 46 To deflect envy, Graciän recommends that the powerful display a weakness, a minor social indiscretion, a harmless vice. Give those who envy you something to feed on, distracting them from your more impor­tant sins. Remember: It is the reality that matters. Yo u may have to play games with appearances, but in the end you will have what counts: true power. In some Arab countries, a man will avoid arousing envy by doing as Cosimo de Medici did by showing his wealth only on the inside of his house. Apply this wisdom to your own character. Beware of some of envy's disguises. Excessive praise is an almost sure sign that the person praising you envies you; they are either setting you up fo r a fall-it will be impossible fo r you to live up to their praise-or they are sharpening their blades behind your back. At the same time, those who are hypercritical of you, or who slander you publicly, probably envy you as weIl. Recognize their behavior as disguised envy and you keep out of the trap of mutual mud-slinging, or of taking their criticisms to heart. Win your revenge by ignoring their measly presence. Do not try to help or do favors for those who envy you; they will think you are condescending to them. Joe Orton's attempt to help Halliwell find a gallery for his work only intensified his lover's feelings of inferiority and envy. Once envy reveals itself fo r what it is, the only solution is often to flee the presence of the enviers, leaving them to stew in a hell of their own creation. Finally, be aware that some environments are more conducive to envy than others. The effects of envy are more serious among colleagues and peers, where there is aveneer of equality. Envy is also destructive in demo­cratic environments where overt displays of power are looked down upon. Be extrasensitive in such environments. The filmmaker Ingmar Bergman was hounded by Swedish tax authorities because he stood out in a country where standing out from the crowd is frowned on. It is almost impossible to avoid envy in such cases, and there is little you can do but accept it gra­ciously and take none of it personally. As Thoreau once said, \"Envy is the tax which all distinction must pay.» Image: A Garden of Weeds. Yo u may not fe ed them but they spread as you water the garden. Yo u may not see how, but they take over, taU and ugly, pre­venting anything beautiful fr om flourishing. Before it is too late, do not water indiscrimi-nately. Destroy the weeds of envy by giving them nothing to fe ed on."},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"Authority: Upon occasion, reveal a harmless defect in YOUf charac­ter. For the envious accuse the most perfeet of sinning by having no sins. They become an Argus, all eyes for finding fault with excel­lence-it is their only consolation.

You thus wave YOUf red cape before the Horns of Envy, in order to save YOUf immortality. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) REVERSAL The reason for being careful with the envious is that they are so indirect, and will find innumerable ways to undermine you. But treading carefully around them will often only make their envy worse. They sense that you are being cautious, and it registers as yet another sign of YOUf superiority. That is why you must act before envy takes root. Once envy is there, however, whether through YOUf fault or not, it is sometimes best to affect the opposite approach : Display the utmost disdain for those who envy you. Instead of hiding YOUf perfection, make it obvi­ous. Make every new triumph an opportunity to make the envious squirm. YOUf good fo rtune and power become their living hell. If you .attain a posi­tion of unimpeachable power, their envy will have no effect on you, and you will have the best revenge of all: They are trapped in envy while you are free in YOUf power. This is how Michelangelo triumphed over the venomous architect Bramante, who turned Pope Julius against Michelangelo's design for his tomb. Bramante envied Michelangelo's godlike skills, and to this one tri­umph-the aborted tomb project-he thought to add another, by pushing the pope to commission Michelangelo to paint the mUfals in the Sistine Chapel. The project would take years, during which Michelangelo would accomplish no more of his brilliant sculptures. Furthermore, Bramante considered Michelangelo not nearly as skilled in painting as in sculpture. The chapel would spoil his image as the perfect artist. Michelangelo saw the trap and wanted to turn down the commission, but he could not refuse the pope, so he accepted it without complaint. Then, however, he used Bramante's envy to SPuf hirn to greater heights, making the Sistine Chapel his most perfect work of all. Every time Bra­mante heard of it or saw it, he fe it more oppressed by his own envy-the sweetest and most lasting revenge you can exact on the envious. Know how to triumph over envy and malice.

He defeated Astyages with ease, had himself crowned king of Medea and Persia, and began to forge the Persian Empire. Victory followed victory in quick succession. Cyrus defeated Croesus, ruler of Lydia, then conquered the Ionian islands and other smaller kingdoms; he marched on Babyion and crushed it. Now he was known as Cyrus the Great, King of the World. Mter capturing the riches of Babyion, Cyrus set his sights on the east, on the half-barbaric tribes of the Massagetai, a vast realm on the Caspian Sea. A fierce warrior race led by Queen Tomyris, the Massagetai lacked the riches of Babyion, but Cyrus decided to attack them anyway, believing himself superhuman and incapable of defeat. The Massagetai would fall easily to his vast armies, making his empire immense. In 529 B.C., then, Cyrus marched to the wide river Araxes, gateway to the kingdom of the Massagetai. As he set up camp on the western bank, he received a message from Qu een Tomyris: \"King of the Medes,\" she told hirn, \"I advise you to abandon this enterprise, for you cannot know if in the end it will do you any good. Rule yoUf own people, and try to bear the sight of me ruling mine. But of course you will refuse my advice, as the last thing you wish for is to live in peace.\" Tomyris, confident of her army's strength and not wishing to delay the inevitable battle, offered to withdraw the troops on her side of the river, allowing Cyrus to cross its waters safely and fight her army on the eastern side, if that was his desire. Cyrus agreed, but instead of engaging the enemy directly he decided to play atrick. The Massagetai knew few luxuries. Once Cyrus had crossed the river and made his camp on the eastern side, he set the table for an elaborate banquet, full of meat, delicacies, and strong wine. Then he left his weakest troops in the camp and withdrew the rest of the army to the river. A large Massagetai detachment so on attacked the camp and killed all of the Persian soldiers in a fierce battle. Then, overwhelmed by the fabu­lous feast that had been left behind, they ate and drank to their hearts' con­tent. Later, inevitably, they fell asleep. The Persian army returned to the camp that night, killing many of the sleeping soldiers and capturing the rest. Among the prisoners was their general, a youth named Spargapises, son of Qu een Tomyris. When the queen learned what had happened, she sent a message to Cyrus, chi ding him for using tricks to defeat her army. \"Now listen to me,\" she wrote, \"and I will advise you for YOUf own good: Give me back my son and leave my country with YOUf forces intact, and be content with yoUf tri­umph over a third part of the Massagetai. If you refuse, I swear by the sun our master to give you more blood than you can drink, for all your glut­tony.\" Cyrus scoffed at her: He would not release her son. He would crush these barbarians.

In their anger they decimated the Persian army, killing Cyrus himself. After the battle, Tomyris and her soldiers searched the battlefield for Cyrus's corpse. When she found it she cut off his head and shoved it into a wineskin full of human blood, crying out, \"Though I have conquered you and live, yet you have ruined me by treacherously taking my son. See now-I fulfill my threat: You have your fill of blood.\" After Cyrus's death, the Persian Empire quickly unraveled. One act of arrogance undid all of Cyrus's good work. Interpretation There is nothing more intoxicating than victory, and nothing more dan­gerous. Cyrus had built his great empire on the ruins of a previous one. A hun­dred years earlier, the powerful Assyrian Empire had been totally de­stroyed, its once splendid capital of Nineveh but ruins in the sand. The Assyrians had suffered this fate because they had pushed too far, destroy­ing one city-state after another until they lost sight of the purposes of their victories, and also of the costs. They overextended themselves and made many enemies who were finally able to band together and destroy them. Cyrus ignored the lesson of Assyria. He paid no heed to the warnings of oracles and advisers. He did not worry about offending a queen. His many victories had gone to his head, clouding his reason. Instead of con­solidating his already vast empire, he pushed forward. Instead of recogniz­ing each situation as different, he thought each new war would bring the same result as the one before as long as he used the methods he knew: ruthless force and cunning. Understand: In the re alm of power, you must be guided by reason. To let a momentary thrill or an emotional victory influence or guide yOUf moves will prove fatal. When you attain success, step back. Be cautious. When you gain victory, und erstand the part played by the particular cir­cumstances of a situation, and never simply repeat the same actions again and again. History is littered with the ruins of victorious empires and the corpses of leaders who could not learn to stop and consolidate their gains. OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW No single person in history has occupied a more delicate and precarious position than the king's mistress. She had no real or legitimate power base to fall back on in times of trouble; she was sUITounded by packs of envious courtiers eagerly anticipating her fall from grace; and finally, since the source of her power was usually her physical beauty, for most royal mis­tresses that fall was inevitable and unpleasant."},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"King Louis XV of France began to keep official mistresses in the early days of his reign, each woman's good fortune rarely lasting more than a few years. But then came Madame de Pompadour, who, when she was a middle-elass child of nine named Jeanne Poisson, had been told by a for­tune-teller that she would someday be the king's favorite. This seemed an absurd dream, since the royal mistress almost always came from the aris­tocracy. Jeanne nevertheless believed herself destined to seduce the king, and doing so became her obsession. She applied herself to the talents the king's favorite had to have--music, dancing, acting, horseback riding­and she excelled in every one of them. As a young woman, she married a man of the lower nobility, which gave her an entree to the best salons in Paris. Word quickly spread of her beauty, talent, charm, and intelligence. Jeanne Poisson became elose friends with Vo ltaire, Montesquieu, and other great minds of the time, but she never lost sight of the goal she had set herself as a girl: to capture the heart of the king. Her husband had a chäteau in a fo rest where the king would often go hunting, and she began to spend a lot of time there. Studying his movements like a hawk, she would make sure he would \"happen\" to come upon her while she was out walking in her most alluring dress, or riding in her splendid coach. The king began to take note of her, making her gifts of the game he caught in the hunt. In 1744 Louis's current mistress, the Duchesse de Chäteauroux, died. Jeanne went on the offensive. She placed herself everywhere he would be: at masked balls at Versailles, at the opera, wherever their paths would cross, and wherever she could display her many talents: dancing, singing, riding, coquetry. The king finally succumbed to her charms, and in a cere­mony at Versailles in September of 1745, this twenty-four-year-old daugh­ter of a middle-elass banking agent was officially inaugurated as the king's mistress. She was given her own room in the palace, a room the king could enter at any time via a hidden stairway and back door. And because some of the courtiers were angry that he had chosen a woman of low origins, he made her a marquise. From now on she would be known as Madame de Pompadour. The king was a man whom the slightest feeling of boredom would op­press out of proportion. Madame de Pompadour knew that keeping hirn under her spell meant keeping hirn amused. To that end she put on con­stant theatrical productions at Versailles, in which she starred. She orga­nized elaborate hunting parties, masked balls, and whatever else it would take to keep hirn diverted outside the bedroom. She became a patroness of the arts, and the arbiter of taste and fashion for all of France. Her enemies at the court only grew in number with each new success, but Madame de Pompadour thwarted them in a totally novel way for a king's mistress: with extreme politeness. Snobs who resented her for her low birth she won over with charm and grace. Most unusual of all, she befriended the queen, and insisted that Louis XV pay more attention to his wife, and treat her more kindly. Even the royal family begrudgingly gave her their support.

JAPAN, FOlJRTEENTH CENTlJRY 414 LAW 47 crown her glory, the king made her a duchess. Her sway was feIt even in politics: Indeed she became the untitled minister of foreign affairs. In 1751, when Madame de Pompadour was at the height of her power, she experienced her worst crisis. Physically weakened by the responsibili­ties of her position, she found it increasingly difficuIt to meet the king's de­mands in bed. This was usually the point at which the mistress would meet her end, struggling to maintain her position as her beauty faded. But Madame de Pompadour had a strategy: She encouraged the king to set up a kind of brothel, Parc aux Cerfs, on the grounds of Ve rsailles. There the middle-aged king could have liaisons with the most beautiful young girls in the realm. Madame de Pompadour knew that her charm and her political acu­men had made her indispensable to the king. What did she have to fear from a sixteen-year-old who had none of her power and presence? What did it matter if she lost her position in the bedroom, as long as she re­mained the most powerful woman in France? To secure that position she became still closer friends with the queen, with whom she started attending church. Although her enemies at the court conspired to have her toppled from her official position as king's mistress, the king kept her on, for he needed her calming effect. It was only when her part in the disastrous Seven Years' War drew much criticism on her that she slowly withdrew from public affairs. Madame de Pompadour's health had always been delicate, and she died at the age of forty-three, in 1764. Her reign as mistress had lasted an unprecedented twenty years. \"She was regretted by all,\" wrote the Duc de Croy, \"for she was kindly and helpful to everyone who approached her.\" Interpretation Aware of the temporariness of her power, the king's mistress would often go into a kind of frenzy after capturing the king: She would try to accumu­late as much money as possible to protect her after her inevitable fall. And to extend her reign as long as possible, she would be ruthless with her ene­mies in the court. Her situation, in other words, seemed to demand from her a greed and vindictiveness that would often be her undoing. Madame de Pompadour succeeded where all others had failed because she never pressed her good fortune. Instead of bullying the courtiers from her power­ful position as the king's mistress, she tried to win their support. She never revealed the slightest hint of greed or arrogance. When she could no longer perform her physical duties as mistress, she did not fret at the thought of someone replacing her in bed. She simply applied some strat­egy-she encouraged the king to take young lovers, knowing that the younger and prettier they were, the less of a threat they posed, since they could not compare to her in charm and sophistication and would so on bore the monarch. Success plays strange tricks on the mind. It makes you feel invulnera­ble, while also making you more hostile and emotional when people chal-"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"lenge your power. It makes you less able to adapt to circumstance. You come to believe your character is more responsible for your success than your strategizing and planning. Like Madame de Pompadour, you need to realize that your moment of triumph is also a moment when you have to rely on cunning and strategy all the more, consolidating your power base, recognizing the role of luck and circumstance in your success, and remain­ing vigilant against changes in your good fortune. It is the moment of vic­tory when you need to play the courtier's game and pay more attention than ever to the laws of power. The g;reatest danger occurs at the moment 0/ victory. Napoleon Bonaparte, 1769-1821 KEYS TO POWER Power has its own rhythms and patterns. Those who succeed at the game are the ones who control the patterns and vary them at will, keeping peo­pIe off balance while they set the tempo. The essence of strategy is control­ling what comes next, and the elation of victory can upset your ability to control what comes next in two ways. First, you owe your success to a pat­tern that you are apt to try to repeat. You will try to keep moving in the same direction without stopping to see whether this is still the direction that is best for you. Second, success tends to go to your head and make you emotional. Feeling invulnerable, you make aggressive moves that ulti­mately undo the victory you have gained. The lesson is simple: The powernd vary their rhythms and patterns, change course, adapt to circumstance, and leam to improvise. Rather than letting their dancing feet impel them forward, they step back and look where they are going. It is as if their bloodstream bore a kind of antidote to the intoxication of victory, letting them control their emotions and come to a kind of mental halt when they have attained success. They steady them­selves, give themselves the space to reflect on what has happened, examine the role of circumstance and luck in their success. As they say in riding school, you have to be able to control yourself before you can control the horse. Luck and circumstance always play a role in power. This is inevitable, and actually makes the game more interesting. But despite what you may think, good luck is more dangerous than bad luck. Bad luck teaches valu­able lessons about patience, timing, and the need to be prepared for the worst; good luck deludes you into the opposite lesson, making you think your brillliance will carry you through. Your fortune will inevitably turn, and when it does you will be completely unprepared. According to Machiavelli, this is what undid Cesare Borgia. He had many triumphs, was actually a clever strategist, but had the bad luck to have good luck: He had a pope for a father. Then, when he had bad luck for real-his father's death-he was unprepared for it, and the many ene-LAW 47 415"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"416 LAW 47 mies he had made devoured him. The good luck that elevates you or seals your success brings the moment for you to open your eyes: The wheel of fortune will hurtle you down as easily as up. If you prepare for the fall, it is less likely to ruin you when it happens. People who have a run of success can catch a kind of fever, and even when they themselves try to stay calm, the people below them often pres­sure them to go past their mark and into dangerous waters. You have to have a strategy for dealing with these people. Simply preaching modera­tion will make you look weak and small-minded; seeming to fail to follow up on a victory can lessen your power. When the Athenian general and statesman Pericles led a series of naval campaigns around the Black Sea in 436 B.C., his easy triumphs en­flamed the Athenians' desire for more. They dreamed of conquering Egypt, overrunning Persia, sailing for Sicily. On the one hand Pericles reined in these dangerous emotions by warning of the perils of hubris. On the other hand he fed them by fighting small battles that he knew he could win, creating the appearance that he was preserving the momentum of suc­cess. The skill with which Pericles played this game is revealed by what happened when he died: The demagogues took over, pushed Athens into invading Sicily, and in one rash move destroyed an empire. The rhythm of power often requires an alternation of force and cun­ning. Too much force creates a counterreaction; too much cunning, no matter how cunning it is, becomes predictable. Working on behalf of his master, the shogun Oda Nobunaga, the great sixteenth-century Japanese general (and future emperor) Hideyoshi once engineered a stunning vic­tory over the army of the formidable General Yoshimoto. The shogun wanted to go further, to take on and crush yet another powerful enemy, but Hideyoshi reminded him of the old Japanese saying: \"When you have won a victory, tighten the strings of your helmet.\" For Hideyoshi this was the moment for the shogun to switch from force to cunning and indirec­tion, setting his enemies against one another through a series of deceptive alliances. In this way he would avoid stirring up needless opposition by appearing overly aggressive. When you are victorious, then, lie low, and lull the enemy into inaction. These changes of rhythm are immensely powerful. People who go past the mark are often motivated by a desire to please a master by proving their dedication. But an excess of effort exposes you to the risk of making the master suspicious of you. On several occasions, gen­erals under Philip of Macedon were disgraced and demoted immediately after leading their troops to a great victory; one more such victory, Philip thought, and the man might become a riyal instead of an underling. When you serve a master, it is often wise to measure your victories carefully, let­ting him get the glory and never making him uneasy. It is also wise to es­tablish a pattern of strict obedience to earn his trust. In the fourth century B.C., a captain under the notoriously severe Chinese general Wu Ch'i charged ahead before a battle had begun and came back with several"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"enemy heads. He thought he had shown his fiery enthusiasm, but Wu Ch'i was unimpressed. \"A talented officer,\" the general said with a sigh as he or­dered the man beheaded, \"but a disobedient one.\" Another moment when a small success can spoil the chances for a larger one may come if a master or superior grants you a favor: It is a dan­gerous mistake to ask for more. You will seem insecure-perhaps you feel you did not deserve this favor, and have to grab as much as you can when you have the chance, which may not come again. The proper response is to accept the favor graciously and withdraw. Any subsequent favors you should eam without having to ask for them. Finally, the moment when you stop has great dramatic import. What comes last sticks in the mind as a kind of exclamation point. There is no better time to stop and walk away than after a victory. Keep going and you risk lessening the effect, even ending up defeated. As lawyers say of cross­examination, ''Always stop with a victory.\" Image: Icarus Falling from the Sky. His father Daedalus fa shions wings of wax that allow the two men to fly out of the labyrinth and escape the Minotaur. Elated by the tri­umphant escape and the fe eling of flight, Icarus soars higher and high-er, until the sun melts the wings and he hurtles to his death. Authority: Princes and republics should content themselves with victory, for when they aim at more, they generally lose. The use of insulting lan­guage toward an enemy arises from the insolence of victory, or fr om the false hope of victory, which latter misleads men as often in their actions as in their words; for when this false hope takes possession of the mind, it makes men go beyond the mark, and causes them to sacrifice a cer­tain good for an uncertain better.

So they tumed to the sea, establishing colonies in Asia Minor, Sicily, the Italian peninsula, even Africa. The city-state of Sparta, however, was landlocked and surrounded by mountains. Lacking access to the Mediterranean, the Spartans never became a se afaring people; instead they tumed on the cities around them, and, in a series of brutal, violent conflicts lasting more than a hundred years, managed to conquer an im­mense area that would provide enough land for their citizens. This solution to their problem, however, brought a new, more formidable one: How could they maintain and police their conquered territories ? The subordi­nate peoples they ruled now outnumbered them ten to one. Surely this horde would take a horrible revenge on them. Sparta's solution was to create a society dedicated to the art of war. Spartans would be tougher, stronger, and fiercer than their neighbors. This was the only way they could ensure their stability and survival. When a Spartan boy reached the age of seven, he was taken from his mother and placed in a military club where he was trained to fight and un­derwent the strictest discipline. The boys slept on beds of reeds; they were allotted only one outer garment to wear for an entire year. They studied none of the arts; indeed, the Spartans banned music, and perrnitted only slaves to practice the crafts that were necessary to sustain them. The only skiIls the Spartans taught were those of warfare. Children seen as weaklings were left to die in a cavem in the mountains. No system of money or trad­ing was allowed in Sparta; acquired wealth, they believed, would sow self­ishness and dissension, weakening their warrlor discipline. The only way a Spartan could eam a living was through agriculture, mostly on state-owned lands, which slaves, called helots, would work for hirn. The Spartans' single-mindedness allowed them to forge the most pow­erful infantry in the world. They marched in perfect order and fought with incomparable bravery. Their tight-knit phalanxes could vanquish an army ten times their size, as they proved in defeating the Persians at Thermopy­lae. A Spartan column on the march would strike terror in the enemy; it seemed to have no weaknesses. Yet although the Spartans proved them­selves mighty warriors, they had no interest in creating an empire. They only wanted to keep what they had already conquered and to defend it against invaders. Decades would pass without a single change in the system that had succeeded so weIl in preserving Sparta's status quo. At the same time that the Spartans were evolving their warlike culture, another city-state was rising to equal prominence: Athens. Unlike Sparta, Athens had taken to the sea, not so much to create colonies as for purposes of trade. The Athenians became great merchants; their currency, the fa­mous \"owl coins,\" spread throughout the Mediterranean. Unlike the rigid Spartans, the Athenians responded to every problem with consummate creativity, adapting to the occasion and creating new social forms and new"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"arts at an incredible pace. Their society was in constant flux. And as their power grew, they carne to pose a threat to the defense-minded Spartans. In 431 B.C., the war that had been brewing between Athens and Sparta for so long finally erupted. It lasted twenty-seven years, but after many twists of fortune, the Spartan war machine finally emerged victorious. The Spartans now commanded an empire, and this time they could not stay in their shell. If they gave up what they had gained, the beaten Athenians would regroup and rise against them, and the long war would have been fought for naught. After the war, Athenian money poured into Sparta. The Spartans had been trained in warfare, not politics or economics; because they were so unaccustomed to it, wealth and its accompanying ways of life seduced and overwhelmed them. Spartan govemors were sent to rule what had been Athenian lands; far from horne, they succumbed to the worst forms of cor­ruption. Sparta had defeated Athens, but the fluid Athenian way of life was slowly breaking down its discipline and loosening its rigid order. And Athens, meanwhile, was adapting to losing its empire, managing to thrive as a cultural and economic center. Confused by a change in its status quo, Sparta grew weaker and weaker. Some thirty years after defeating Athens, it lost an important batde with the city-state of Thebes. Almost ovemight, this once mighty nation collapsed, never to recover. Interpretation In the evolution of species, protective armor has almost always spelled dis­aster. Although there are a few exceptions, the shell most often becomes a dead end for the animal encased in it; it slows the creature down, making it hard for it to forage for food and making it a target for fast-moving preda­tors. Animals that take to the sea or sky, and that move swifdy and unpre­dictably, are infinitely more powerful and secure. In facing a serious problem-controlling superior numbers-Sparta reacted like an animal that develops a shell to protect itself from the envi­ronment. But like a turde, the Spartans sacrificed mobility for safety. They managed to preserve stability for thr ee hundred years, but at what cost? They had no culture beyond warfare, no arts to relieve the tension, a con­stant anxiety about the status quo. While their neighbors took to the sea, leaming to adapt to a world of constant motion, the Spartans entombed themselves in their own system. Victory would mean new lands to govem, which they did not want; defeat would mean the end of their military ma­chine, which they did not want, either. Only stasis allowed them to survive. But nothing in the world can remain stable forever, and the shell or system you evolve for your protection will someday prove your undoing. In the case of Sparta, it was not the armies of Athens that defeated it, but the Athenian money. Money flows everywhere it has the opportunity to go; it cannot be controlled, or made to fit a prescribed pattern. It is in­herendy chaotic. And in the long run, money made Athens the conqueror, harharously cut \"Hhis long pendent ears. Jo wler expected nuth­ing less than to give up the ghost.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW When World War 11 ended and the Japanese, who had invaded China in 1937, had finally been thrown out, the Chinese Nationalists, lead by Chiang Kai-shek, decided the time had come to annihilate the Chinese Communists, their hated rivals, once and for all. They had almost suc­ceeded in 1935, forcing the Communists into the Long March, the grueling retreat that had greatly dirninished their numbers. Although the Commu­nists had recovered somewhat during the war against Japan, it would not be difficult to defeat them now. They controlled only isolated areas in the countryside, had unsophisticated weaponry, lacked any military experi­ence or training beyond mountain fighting, and controlled no important parts of China, except areas of Manchuria, which they had managed to take after the J apanese retreat. Chiang decided to commit his best fo rces in Manchuria. He would take over its major cities and from those bases would spread through this northern industrial region, sweeping the Communists away. Once Manchuria had fallen the Communists would collapse. In 1945 and '46 the plan worked perfectly: The Nationalists easily took the major Manchurian cities. Puzzlingly, though, in the face of this critical campaign, the Communist strategy made no sense. When the Na­tionalists began their push, the Communists dispersed to Manchuria's most out-of-the-way corners. Their small units harassed the Nationalist arrnies, ambushing them here, retreating unexpectedly there, but these dispersed units never linked up, making them hard to attack. They would seize a town only to give it up a few weeks later. Forming neither rear guards nor vanguards, they moved like mercury, never staying in one place, elusive and fo rmless. The Nationalists ascribed this to two things: cowardice in the face of superior fo rces and inexperience in strategy. Mao Tse-tung, the Com­munist leader, was more a poet and philosopher than a general, whereas Chiang had studied warf are in the West and was a fo lIower of the German military writer Carl von Clausewitz, among others."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"Yet a pattern did eventually emerge in Mao's attacks. After the Nation­alists had taken the cities, leaving the Communists to occupy what was gen­erally considered Manchuria's useless space, the Communists started using that large space to surround the cities. If Chiang sent an army fr om one city to reinforce another, the Communists would encircle the rescuing army. Chiang's fo rces were slowly broken into smaller and smaller units, isolated from one another, their lines of supply and communication cut. The Na­tionalists still had superior firepower, but if they could not move, what good was it? A kind of terror overcame the Nationalist soldiers. Commanders com­fo rtably remote fr om the fr ont lines might laugh at Mao, but the soldiers had fo ught the Communists in the mountains, and had come to fe ar their elusiveness. Now these soldiers sat in their cities and watched as their fa st­moving enemies, as fluid as water, poured in on them fr om all sides. There seemed to be millions of them. The Communists also encircled the sol­diers' spirits, bombarding them with propaganda to lower their morale and pressure them to desert. The Nationalists began to surrender in their minds. Their encircled and isolated cities started collapsing even before being directly attacked; one after another fe ll in quick succession. In November of 1948, the Na­tionalists surrendered Manchuria to the Communists-a humiliating blow to the technically superior Nationalist army, and one that proved decisive in the war. By the fo llowing year the Communists controlled all of China. Interpretation The two board games that best approximate the strategies of war are chess and the Asian game of go. In chess the board is smalI. In comparison to go, the attack comes relatively quickly, forcing a decisive battle. It rarely pays to withdraw, or to sacrifice YOUf pieces, which must be concentrated at key areas. Go is much less fo rmal. It is played on a large grid, with 361 inter­sections-nearly six times as many positions as in chess. Black and white stones (one color for each side) are placed on the board's interseetions, one at a time, wherever you like. Once all YOUf stones (52 for each side) are on the board, the object is to isolate the stones of YOUf opponent by encircling them. Agame of go-called wei-chi in China-can last up to three hundred moves. The strategy is more subtle and fluid than chess, developing slowly; the more complex the pattern your stones initially create on the board, the harder it is for YOUf opponent to understand your strategy. Fighting to con­trol a particular area is not worth the trouble: You have to think in larger terms, to be prepared to sacrifice an area in order eventually to dominate the board. What you are after is not an entrenched position but mobility. With mobility you can isolate the opponent in small areas and then encir­cle them. The aim is not to kill off the opponent's pieces directly, as in chess, but to induce a kind of paralysis and collapse. Chess is linear, posi­tion oriented, and aggressive; go is nonlinear and fluid. Aggression is indi-Tm: I L\\H[<: .\\I\\D THI·: THU: The sage neither seeks to follow the ways of the ancients nor estab­lishes any fixed stan­dard for all times but examines the things of his age and then prepares to deal with them.

THE ART OF WINNING WARS, JAMES MRAZEK, 1968 424 LAW 48 rect until the end of the game, when the winner can surround the oppo­nent's stones at an accelerated pace. Chinese military strategists have been influenced by go for centuries. Its proverbs have been applied to war time and again; Mao Tse-tung was an addict of wei-chi, and its precepts were ingrained in his strategies. A key wei-chi concept, for example, is to use the size of the board to your advan­tage, spreading out in every direction so that your opponent cannot fathom your movements in a simple linear way. \"Every Chinese,\" Mao once wrote, \"should consciously throw himself into this war of a jigsaw pattern\" against the Nationalists. Place your men in a jigsaw pattern in go, and your opponent loses himself trying to figure out what you are up to. Either he wastes time pursuing you or, like Chiang Kai­shek, he assumes you are incompetent and falls to protect himself. And if he concentrates on single areas, as Western strategy advises, he becomes a sitting duck for encirclement. In the wei-chi way of war, you encircle the enemy's brain, using mind games, propaganda, and irritation tactics to confuse and dishearten. This was the strategy of the Communists-an ap­parent formlessness that disoriented and terrified their enemy. Where chess is linear and direct, the ancient game of go is closer to the kind of strategy that will prove relevant in a world where battles are fought indirectly, in vast, loosely connected areas. Its strategies are abstract and multidimensional, inhabiting aplane beyond time and space: the strate­gist's mind. In this fluid form of warfare, you value movement over posi­tion. Your speed and mobility make it impossible to predict your moves; unable to understand you, your enemy can form no strategy to defeat you. Instead of fixing on particular spots, this indirect form of warfare spreads out, just as you can use the large and disconnected nature of the real world to your advantage. Be like a vapor. Do not give your opponents anything solid to attack; watch as they exhaust themselves pursuing you, trying to cope with your elusiveness. Only formlessness allows you to truly surprise your enemies-by the time they figure out where you are and what you are up to, it is too late. When you want to fight us, we don 't let you and you can 't find uso But when we want to fight you, we make sure that you can 't get away and we hit you squarely , .. and wipe you out. , , .

The young show this most clearly: Uncom­fo rtable with the fo rms that society imposes upon them, having no set iden­tity, they play with their own characters, trying on a variety of masks and poses to express themselves. This is the vitality that drives the motor of fo rm, creating constant changes in style. The powerful are often people who in their youth have shown im­mense creativity in expressing something new through a new fo rm. Society grants them power because it hungers for and rewards this sort of newness. The problem comes later, when they often grow conservative and posses­sive. They no longer dream of creating new fo rms; their identities are set, their habits congeal, and their rigidity makes them easy targets. Everyone knows their next move. Instead of demanding respect they elicit boredom: Get off the stage! we say, let someone else, someone younger, entertain uso When locked in the past, the powerful look comical-they are overripe fruit, waiting to fall from the tree. Power can only thrive if it is flexible in its fo rms. To be fo rmless is not to be amorphous; everything has a fo rm-it is impossible to avoid. The fo rmlessness of power is more like that of water, or mercury, taking the fo rm of whatever is around it. Changing constantly, it is never predictable. The powerful are constantly creating fo rm, and their power comes from the rapidity with which they can change. Their fo rmlessness is in the eye of the enemy who cannot see what they are up to and so has nothing solid to attack. This is the premier pose of power: ungraspable, as elusive and swift as the god Mercury, who could take any fo rm he pleased and used this ability to wreak havoc on Mount Olympus. Human creations evolve toward abstraction, toward being more men­tal and less material. This evolution is clear in art, which, in this century, made the great discovery of abstraction and conceptualism; it can also be seen in politics, which over time have become less overtly violent, more complicated, indirect and cerebral. Warfare and strategy too have fo llowed this pattern. Strategy began in the manipulation of armies on land, posi­tioning them in ordered fo rmations; on land, strategy is relatively two di­mensional, and controlled by topography. But all the great powers have eventually taken to the sea, for commerce and colonization. And to protect their trading lanes they have had to leam how to fight at sea. Maritime war­fare requires tremendous creativity and abstract thinking, since the lines are constantly shifting. Naval captains distinguish themselves by their abil­ity to adapt to the literal fluidity of the terrain and to confuse the enemy with an abstract, hard-to-anticipate fo rm. They are operating in a third di­mension: the mind. Back on land, guerrilla warfare too demonstrates this evolution toward abstraction. T. E. Lawrence was perhaps the first modem strategist to de-CII\\H.\\(''!'I'.11 \\1l\\JOH To carry out the instinctual inhibition demanded by the modern world and tu be able to cope with the energy stasis which results from this inhibi­tion. the ego has to undergo a change. The ego. i.e .• that part of the person that is exposed to danger, becomes rigid, as we say, when it is continu­ally subjected to the same or similar conflicts between need and a fear-inducing outer world. It acquires in this process a chronic, automaticallv funetioning mode of reaction, i.e., its \"char­aeter.\" It is as if the affective personality armored itself, as if the hard shell it develops were intended to de fleet and weaken the blows of the outer world as weil as the clamoring of the inner needs. This armoring makes the person less sensitive to unp1easure, but also restricts his libidinal and aggressive motility and thus reduees his capa city for achieve­ment ami pleasure. We say the ego has become less flexible and more rigid, and that the abil­ity to regulate the energy economy depends on the extent ofthe armoring.

His ideas influenced Mao, who found in his writings an uncanny Western equivalent to wei-chi. Lawrence was working with Arabs fighting for their territory against the Turks. His idea was to make the Arabs blend into the vast desert, never providing a target, never collecting together in one place. As the Turks scrambled to fight this vaporous army, they spread them­selves thin, wasting energy in moving from place to place. They had the su­perior firepower but the Arabs kept the initiative by playing cat and mouse, giving the Turks nothing to hold on to, destroying their morale. \"Most wars were wars of contact. ... Ours should be a war of detachment,\" Lawrence wrote. \"We were to contain the enemy by the silent threat of a vast unknown desert, not disdosing ourselves till we attacked.\" This is the ultimate form of strategy. The war of engagement has be­come far too dangerous and costly; indirection and elusiveness yield far better results at a much lower cost. The main cost, in fa ct, is mental-the thinking it takes to align your forces in scattered patterns, and to under­mine the minds and psychology of your opponents. And nothing will infu­riate and disorient them more than formlessness. In a world where wars of detachment are the order of the day, formlessness is crucial. The first psychological requirement of formlessness is to train yourself to take nothing personally. Never show any defensiveness. When you act defensive, you show your emotions, revealing a dear form. Your oppo­nents will realize they have hit a nerve, an Achilles' heel. And they will hit it again and again. So train yourself to take nothing personally. Never let anyone get your back up. Be like a slippery ball that cannot be held: Let no one know what gets to you, or where your weaknesses lie. Make your face a formless mask and you will infuriate and disorient your scheming col­leagues and opponents. One man who used this technique was Baron J ames Rothschild. A German Jew in Paris, in a culture decidedly unfriendly to foreigners, Roth­schild never took any attack on hirn personally or showed he had been hurt in any way. He furthermore adapted hirnself to the political dimate, whatever it was-the stiffly formal Restoration monarchy of Louis XVIII, the bourgeois reign of Louis-Philippe, the democratic revolution of 1848, the upstart Louis-Napoleon crowned emperor in 1852. Rothschild ac­cepted them one and all, and blended in. He could afford to appear hypo­critical or opportunistic because he was valued for his money, not his politics; his money was the currency of power. While he adapted and thrived, outwardly never showing a form, all the other great families that had begun the century immensely wealthy were ruined in the period's complicated shifts and turns of fortune. Attaching themselves to the past, they revealed their embrace of a form. Throughout history, the formless style of ruling has been most adeptly practiced by the queen who reigns alone. A queen is in a radically different position from a king; because she is a woman, her subjects and courtiers are likely to doubt her ability to rule, her strength of character. If she favors"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"one side in some ideological struggle, she is said to be acting out of emo­tional attachment. Yet if she represses her emotions and plays the authori­tarian, in the male fashion, she arouses worse criticism still. Either by nature or by experience, then, queens tend to adopt a flexible style of gov­erning that in the end often proves more powerful than the more direct, male form. Two female leaders exemplifying the formless style of rule are Queen Elizabeth of England and Empress Catherine the Great of Russia. In the vi­olent wars between Catholics and Protestants, Elizabeth steered amiddIe course. She avoided alliances that would commit her to one side, and that over time would harm the country. She managed to keep her country at peace until it was strong enough for war. Her reign was one of the most glo­rious in his tory because of her incredible capacity to adapt and her flexible ideology. Catherine the Great too evolved an improvisatory style of governing. Mter she deposed her husband, Emperor Peter II, taking sole control of Russia in 1762, no one thought she would survive. But she had no precon­ceived ideas, no philosophy or theory to dictate her policies. Although a foreigner (she came from Germany), she understood Russia's moods, and how it was changing over the years. \"One must govern in such a way that one's people think they themselves want to do what one commands them to do,\" she said, and to do this she had to be always a step ahead of their desires and to adapt to their resistance. By never forcing the issue, she re­formed Russia in a strikingly short period of time. This feminine, formless style of ruling may have emerged as a way of prospering under difficult circumstances, but it has proved immensely se­ductive to those who have served under it. Being fluid, it is relatively easy for its subjects to obey, for they feel less coerced, less bent to their ruler's ideology. It also opens up options where an adherence to a doctrine closes them off. Without committing to one side, it allows the ruler to play one enemy off another. Rigid rulers may seem strong, but with time their in­flexibility wears on the nerves, and their subjects find ways to push them from the sta ge. Flexible, formless rulers will be much criticized, but they will endure, and people will eventually come to identify with them, since they are as their subjects are-changing with the wind, open to circum­stance. Despite upsets and delays, the permeable style of power generally tri­umphs in the end, just as Athens eventually won victory over Sparta through its money and its culture. When you find yourself in conflict with someone stronger and more rigid, allow them a momentary victory. Seem to bow to their superiority. Then, by being formless and adaptable, slowly insinuate yourself into their soul. This way you will catch them off guard, for rigid people are always ready to ward off direct blows but are helpless against the subtle and insinuating. To succeed at such a strategy you must play the chameleon-conform on the surface, while breaking down your enemy from the inside. LAW 48 427"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"428 LAW 48 For centuries the Japanese would accept fo reigners graciously, and ap­peared susceptible to fo reign cultures and influences. Joao Rodriguez, a Portuguese priest who arrived in Japan in 1577 and lived there far many years, wrote, \"I am flabbergasted by the Japanese willingness to try and ac­cept everything Portuguese.\" He saw Japanese in the streets wearing Por­tuguese clothing, with rosary beads at their necks and crosses at their hips. This might seem like a weak, mutable culture, but Japan's adaptability actually protected the country from having an alien culture imposed by military invasion. It seduced the Po rtuguese and other Westemers into be­lieving the Japanese were yielding to a superior culture when actually the fo reign culture's ways were merely a fa shion to be donned and doffed. Under the surface, Japanese culture thrived. Had the Japanese been rigid about fo reign influences and tried to fight them off, they might have suf­fe red the injuries that the West inflicted on China. That is the power of fo rmlessness--it gives the aggressor nothing to react against, nothing to hit. In evolution, largeness is often the first step toward extinction. What is immense and bloated has no mobility, but must constantly fe ed itself. The unintelligent are often seduced into believing that size connotes power, the bigger the better. In 483 B.C., King Xerxes of Persia invaded Greece, believing he could conquer the country in one easy campaign. After all, he had the largest army ever assembled for one invasion-the historian Herodotus estimated it at over more than five million. The Persians planned to build a bridge across the Hellespont to overrun Greece from the land, while their equally immense navy would pin the Greek ships in harbor, preventing their fo rces fr om escaping to sea. The plan seemed sure, yet as Xerxes prepared the invasion, his adviser Artabanus wamed his master of grave misgivings: \"The two mightiest powers in the world are against you,\" he said. Xerxes laughed-what powers could match his gigantic army? \"I will tell you what they are,\" answered Artabanus. \"The land and the sea.\" There were no safe harbors large enough to receive Xerxes' fleet. And the more land the Per­sians conquered, and the longer their supply lines stretched, the more ru­inous the cost of fe eding this immense army would prove. Thinking his adviser a coward, Xerxes proceeded with the invasion. Yet as Artabanus predicted, bad weather at sea decimated the Pe rsian fleet, which was too large to take shelter in any harbor. On land, meanwhile, the Persian army destroyed everything in its path, which only made it impossi­ble to fe ed, since the destruction included crops and stores of fo od. It was also an easy and slow-moving target. The Greeks practiced all kinds of de­ceptive maneuvers to disorient the Persians. Xerxes' eventual defeat at the hands of the Greek allies was an immense disaster. The story is emblematic of all those who sacrifice mobility for size: The flexible and fleet of fo ot will almost always win, for they have more strategie options. The more gigantic the enemy, the easier it is to induce collapse. The need for formlessness becomes greater the older we get, as we grow more likely to become set in our ways and assume too rigid a fo rm."},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"We become predictable, always the first sign of decrepitude. And pre­dictability makes us appear comica1. Although ridicule and disdain might seem mild fo rms of attack, they are actually potent weapons, and will even­tually erode a fo undation of power. An enemy who does not respect you will grow bold, and boldness makes even the smallest animal dangerous. The late-eighteenth-century court of France, as exemplified by Marie­Antoinette, had become so hopelessly tied to a rigid fo rmality that the average Frenchman thought it a silly relic. This depreciation of a centuries­old institution was the first sign of a terminal disease, for it represented a symbolic loosening of the people's ties to monarchy. As the situation wors­ened, Marie-Antoinette and King Louis XVI grew only more rigid in their adherence to the past-and quickened their path to the guillotine. King Charles I of England reacted similarly to the tide of democratic change brewing in England in the 1630s: He disbanded Parliament, and his court rituals grew increasingly fo rmal and distant. He wanted to return to an older style of ruling, with adherence to all kinds of petty protoco1. His rigidity only heightened the desire for change. So on, of course, he was swept up in a devastating civil war, and eventually he lost his head to the executioner's axe. As you get older, you must rely even less on the past. Be vigilant lest the form your character has taken makes you seem a relic. It is not a matter of mimicking the fa shions of youth-that is equally worthy of laughter. Rather your mind must constantly adapt to each circumstance, even the in­evitable change that the time has come to move over and let those of younger age prepare for their ascendancy. Rigidity will only make you look uncannily like a cadaver. Never fo rget, though, that fo rmlessness is a strategie pose. It gives you room to create tactical surprises; as your enemies struggle to guess your next move, they reveal their own strategy, putting them at a decided disad­vantage. It keeps the initiative on your side, putting your enemies in the position of never acting, constantly reacting. It fo ils their spying and intelli­gence. Remember: Formlessness is a too1. Never confuse it with a go-with­the-flow style, or with a religious resignation to the twists of fo rtune. You use fo rmlessness, not because it creates inner harmony and peace, but be­cause it will increase your power. Finally, learning to adapt to each new circumstance me ans seeing events through your own eyes, and often ignoring the advice that people constantly peddle your way. It means that ultimately you must throw out the laws that others preach, and the books they write to tell you what to do, and the sage advice of the eIder. \"The laws that govern circumstances are abolished by new circumstances,\" Napoleon wrote, which means that it is up to you to gauge each new situation. Rely too much on other people's ideas and you end up taking a fo rm not of your own making. Too much re­spect for other people's wisdom will make you depreciate your own. Be brutal with the past, especially your own, and have no respect for the philosophies that are fo isted on you from outside. LAW 48 429"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"430 LAW 48 Image: Mercury.
