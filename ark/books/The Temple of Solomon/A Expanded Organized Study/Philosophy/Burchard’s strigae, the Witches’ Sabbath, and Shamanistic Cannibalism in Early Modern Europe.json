Whileresearch in this area is ongoing, to date it has crystallized into a thesis thatseems to be accepted by most scholars: that from as early as the twelfthcentury many churchmen and demonologists fused folkloric ideas aboutbeneficent nocturnal spirit hosts with folkloric beliefs about maleficentspirits and spirit hordes.This ‘‘sabbath-conflation’’ thesis, as we term it here, is underpinned bythree early passages, all of which, owing to their importance, have oftenbeen quoted by historians of witchcraft. The first is found in the canonEpiscopi, a text that makes its initial appearance in a disciplinary guidewritten around 906 by Regino, formerly abbot of Pru ̈m:It must not be omitted indeed that certain criminal women, who have turned backto Satan and are seduced by illusions of demons and by phantasms, believe and avowopenly that during the night hours they ride on certain beasts together with thegoddess of the pagans Diana and an uncounted host of women; that they pass overmany lands in the silent dead of night; that they obey her orders as those of a mistress,and that on certain nights they are summoned to her service.11.

Like thecanonEpiscopi, it describes a group of women who travel great distances atnight, although in this case the goddess is not mentioned and the timbre israther different. Here, Burchard condemns the women who ‘‘maintain andfirmly believe’’ that:in the silence of the quiet night, when you have settled down in bed, and yourhusband lies in your bosom, you are able, while still in your body, to go out throughthe closed doors and travel through the spaces of the world, together with otherswho are similarly deceived; and that without visible weapons, you kill people whohave been baptized and redeemed by Christ’s blood, and together cook and devourtheir flesh; and that where the heart was, you put straw or wood or something of thesort; and that after eating these people, you bring them alive again and grant them abrief spell of life? If you have believed this, you shall do penance on bread and waterfor fifty days, and likewise in each of the seven years following.5Burchard does not name these women but scholars have linked them tobeliefs aboutstrigae—cannibalistic witches that appear in European sourcesfrom the classical period onward and were believed to kill men by consumingthem from the inside.

John, who waspartly educated in France, claims that:The evil spirit with God’s permission uses his powers to make some people believethat things really happen to their bodies which they imagine (through their ownerror) to occur. These people claim that a Noctiluca or Herodiade, acting as Queenof the Night, summons nocturnal gatherings at which feasting and all kinds of riotousexercises take place. Those who attend are punished or rewarded according to theirdeserts. The same people also believe that children are sacrificed tolamiae, being cutup into small pieces and greedily devoured. Subsequently they are vomited up andthe presiding deity takes pity on them and returns them to the cradles from whichthey were snatched.7For many scholars, John’s passage represents an early conflation of thebenign goddess-related beliefs described in the canonEpiscopi, and the maligncannibalistic beliefs described in Burchard’sDecretum. Norman Cohn, one ofthe first historians to study the folkloric origins of the sabbath, noted that‘‘here the two ideas—of the ‘ladies of the night’ and of night-witches whosteal and devour babies—are ingeniously combined: both are commanded bythe moon-goddess or by Herodias, and the image of the nocturnal banquetmerges into that of the cannibalistic orgy.’’8This is echoed in Behringer’smore recent claim that ‘‘no later than the time of John of Salisbury (1120–1180), the false belief in these [beneficent] nighttime travels was connectedto the idea of common banquets and the notion oflamiae, creatures whokidnapped children and ate them.’’9Scholars have noted similar fusions inlater texts, and indeed, references to Diana’s ‘‘good game’’ are still found indemonological tracts from the height of the witch craze, long after the queenof the night mythology had metamorphosed into a notion of witches partici-pating in a baby-sacrificing, devil-worshipping orgiastic sect.106.

With regard to the witch trials them-selves, the mention of cannibalism is similarly inconsistent. While scattered referencesappear—at one time or another—in trials from most parts of Europe, they emergemost prominently in specific trials or trial clusters from the Western mainland. To citejust a few examples, we have well-known cases from Germany (No ̈rdlingen 1589–94), Switzerland (Laussane and adjacent areas 1438–98), France (Provins, 1452), Italy(Todi, 1428; Perugia 1455–56), and the Basque regions (Labourd and Navarre, 1609–14). The unequal distribution of cannibalistic themes—as they emerge in bothdemonological works and trial records—is likely to have many causes and meritsfurther research, as does the fact that the cannibalism that emerges in these cases isnot uniform. It ranges on a spectrum from the simple sucking of blood, to disinter-ment, to elaborate nocturnal feasts involving the cooking and sharing of flesh.

Whatconcerns us at present is the fact that Burchard’s ‘‘good’’ and ‘‘bad’’ compo-nent strands have been dealt with in very different ways by scholars analyzingearly modern witchcraft in the context of shamanism. Since emerging in thesecond half of the twentieth century, this ‘‘shamanistic paradigm,’’ as we termit here, has been controversial, with recent debates among historians focusingon the problems surrounding the definition of shamanism, and consequently,the question of whether the paradigm is useful at all.13These difficulties arerooted, in large part, in the fact that there is no universally accepted definitionof ‘‘shaman’’—or for that matter ‘‘sorcerer’’ or ‘‘witch’’—even within thefield of anthropology itself. Among anthropologists, this problem is increas-ingly negotiated through the deployment of ‘‘terms of convenience’’ (that is,terms that are useful to delimit the shape of an idea complex in a particularcultural context), as opposed to ‘‘ideal type definitions.’’14Following this,clearly defining the ‘‘terms of convenience’’ one wishes to use is arguably themost practical way forward when employing a term like ‘‘shaman’’ in thecontext of early modern Europe. In this paper, we shall be defining the sha-man as ‘‘a magical practitioner who directly communicates with spirits and/or travels to spirit worlds in a dream or trance state in order to magicallybenefit his community.’’ This differentiates the shaman from the witch, whois defined here as ‘‘an individual who, with or without communication withspirits and with or without the facility of trance, magically harms others forpurely personal gain.’’15According to these definitions, some forms of posses-sion come under the definition of shamanism, and an act of sorcery can beperformed by either a shaman or a witch.The women described in the canonEpiscopihave received much attentionfrom researchers working in the shamanistic paradigm. Some scholars have13. For a recent summarisation of work in this field see Ga ́bor Klaniczay, ‘‘Sha-manism and Witchcraft,’’Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft1 (2006): 214–21.

Some scholars find general definitions of shamanism unhelpful, but their usehere is defended on the grounds that it is difficult to find any other single word thatso efficiently embraces this particular constellation of ritual belief and practice.PAGE 22.................18420$$CH3 04-22-13 11:23:28 PS"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"23Wilby\u0002Burchard’sstrigae,the Witches’ Sabbath, and Shamanistic Cannibalismargued that those individuals who ‘‘avow openly’’ that ‘‘during the nighthours they ride on certain beasts together with the goddess of the pagans’’were the practitioners of largely beneficent shamanistic traditions rooted indevotion to goddess figures of pre-Christian origin that persisted in Europethrough the medieval and into the early modern period. These traditions,which appear to have been predominantly visionary in orientation, involvedshamanistic resurrection and the gaining of healing skills.16Gustav Henning-sen’s important study into the Sicilian fairy cult, thedonas de fuera, whosemembers claimed to follow ‘‘the Ladies from Outside’’ in dreams in order togenerate prosperity and gain healing skills, indicates these goddess traditionswere active in at least one part of seventeenth-century Europe.17Behringer’swork on sixteenth-century accounts of travel with the Swisssa ̈ligen lu ̈ttand‘‘people of the night’’ is also suggestive of similar shamanistic rites. Furthernarratives scattered through the witchcraft records intimate the same experi-ential complex, although they cannot be so confidently linked to an ecstaticnexus: for example, the testimonials of the witches at Milan in 1384 and1390, Bressanone in 1457, and the Dolomite Valleys in the early 1500s.1816. Ginzburg,Ecstasies, 89–152. Behringer,Shaman,35–71.17. Several scholars make a distinction between dream cults and shamanism.While this debate is important, the distinction is not necessary here. In many tribalcultures, the shaman’s relationship with the spirit world is conducted through morethan one modality, with public ritual, private ritual, and dream states typically work-ing together in different proportions and ways. Here, we work from the premise thatthe apparent prominence of dream rites in early modern Europe is likely to reflectthe fact that shamanistic traditions adapt in response to social change. In any regionwhere shamanistic rituals of folkloric provenance are repressed, it is logical to assumethat any original emphasis—should there have been one—on waking invocation andpublic performance would give way to more private dream rites. The perceived dis-tinction between shamanism and the dream cult is also exaggerated by the fact thathistorians currently underestimate the role that both dreams and compulsion play inworld shamanism.

Although scholars haveacknowledged that aggressive shamanistic rites persisted from archaic timesinto the early modern period, and some very fine work has been done in thisarea, the focus has been on beneficent warrior cults such as the benandantiand theta ́ltoswho fought enemy witches and sorcerers for the fertility offields and safety of towns.19The shamanistic dimension to the cannibalistickillings of the earlystrigaepassages has been largely overlooked. Discussionsof the witch-related cannibalism featured in demonological works and witchtrial records has tended to focus on the fact that false accusations of cannibal-ism were a common propaganda tool, used against Jews, Christians, lepers,and various heretic groups since the classical period.20More importantly, wehave an epistemological problem: it is very difficult to isolate any witch-confession-embedded reference to cannibalistic killing that does not immedi-ately sound like a demonological stereotype and, as such, point away frompopular belief and experience toward elite superimposition. In other words,if a suspect claims to have encountered the goddess or her fairy or fate-women variants in a witchcraft confession, her claim stands out by a mile,whereas if a woman claims to have acted like the flesh-eatingstriga, her claimdoes not.Over the past few decades this lack of scholarly attention to cannibalisticshamanism has, by default, generated the impression that folkloric strigaritesdid not possess a shamanistic dimension. Although they do not state it out-right, discussions of the witches’ sabbath and its origin imply that while thegoddess rites first described in the canonEpiscopisurvived into the early mod-ern period (and fused with the sabbath stereotype) on the level of both beliefand experience, the cannibalistic-killing rites depicted in theDecretumsur-vived into the period on the level of ‘‘beware-the-bogeyman’’ beliefs only.As a result, on those occasions when it seems clear that witchcraft suspects53–59.

Tuvans often told me that shamans can‘‘bite and eat people.’’ These are not myths about a remote past: a shaman proudlyclaimed to me to have himself ‘‘eaten’’ several people, but not yet enough, he recog-nized, to be called a ‘‘great shaman.’’29Ste ́panoff also notes similar beliefs among the Darkhats, ancient Buryats,Tungus, Chukchi, and Yakut, with the latter’s traditions, for example, being‘‘rich in shamans eating human hearts and livers and mutilating people.’’30In all of these cases, the shaman’s human victims can vary. In manyinstances, they are an enemy, such as a rival sorcerer, warrior, or tribesperson,who threatens the individual shaman or his community in some way. How-ever, in Amazonia and Siberia, we also have examples of shamans killing andconsuming in a more indiscriminate and opportunistic manner, as would theanimal with which they often identify themselves. In this case, any humanbeing that passes the shaman’s path when he is out hunting is potential prey.With regard to thekanaima`shaman, for example, Whitehead notes that it is‘‘critical to appreciate that the selection of victims is ultimately a matter ofindifference, in the sense that anyone will do . . . as with any subsistencehunter, they will take the easiest opportunity.’’31As a consequence, just as ahuman or animal hunter will try to increase his success by isolating the vul-nerable beasts from a herd, in some traditions the shaman will specificallytarget children or weakened adults. Of particular significance here, in relationto our cross-comparisons with early modern witch beliefs, is the fact that, asa direct result of this largely indiscriminate dimension to shamanic predation,in all of the cases cited here shamans were believed capable of attackingmembers of their own community and even their own children.32This bloodthirsty reputation makes the shaman deeply ambiguous, wher-ever in the world and in whatever culture he appears.

The shaman’s ambivalence stems from his serving, inperson, as a point of articulation between his perspective and that of hisferocious familiar spirits.’’33Similarly, Viveiros de Castro notes, in relation tothe Tapirape ́shaman, that ‘‘insofar as he is the friend of the enemies of theliving, he is both a protector and a threat: his visits to demonic beings conferdangerous powers on him and, in a certain respect, transform him into oneof them.’’ As such, he is ‘‘the typical assassin, sorcerer, and kidnapper ofsouls.’’ Hardly surprisingly, as Fausto emphasizes, ‘‘many Amazonian peopledo not clearly differentiate the shaman from the witch.’’34However, while the line between the dark shaman and the witch is veryfine, anthropologists have observed that in all of our cited cultures he istolerated, for a number of reasons. The first is linked to a nuanced under-standing of ecstatic compulsion. It has long been recognized that psychophys-ical compulsion is a feature of most shamanistic traditions, typically emergingin the context of possession and initiation (in the latter case, acceptance ofthe shamanic vocation often being likened to profound surrender to an over-whelming force). Anthropologists studying dark shamanic traditions havenoted that similarly compulsive urges underpin the shaman’s need to journeyin subtle body to hunt down and consume human flesh.35In this respect,with regard to his random killing sprees at least, the shaman is believed to befundamentally innocent of the murders he commits. The intensity of theseimpulses is intimated in Wilbert’s observation that Campa jaguar shamans (towhom, when hunting, humans appear ‘‘as peccary’’):travel long distances so as to avoid eating their friends and kin. Especially during themonths of March through to June were-jaguars are on the prowl of children or inshamanic terms young ‘‘peccary,’’ and again, as jaguars, shamans are unable to distin-guish their own human children from others. Thus, when in the form of jaguars,shamansarejaguars: they see like them and they think like them.3633. Fausto, ‘‘A Blend,’’ 171.34.

When the Warao novice shaman is visitedby the macaw god, ‘‘in his dream, requesting human flesh’’ the ‘‘intimidated’’novice agrees to ‘‘snare . . . a vulnerable member of his own or of a neigh-bouring community.’’39Alternatively, among thekanaima`, according to oneof Whitehead’s informants, ‘‘If you learned to kill, then you must kill—theyhave the urge to kill and it might even be a brother or sister.’’40The compul-sive quality of the shaman’s activities is also reflected in the fact that in all ofthe cited cultures certain behaviors and physical features—such as evidenceof ‘‘unusual perceptual capacities,’’ a ‘‘superfluous bone,’’ ‘‘a piercing gaze’’or being born ‘‘in the caul’’—indicate that an individual has an unavoidableshamanic destiny and will not be able to resist succumbing to the pressure ofthe spirits and becoming their ally.41Compulsion is not the whole story, however. All forms of shamanisminvolve a reciprocal dialogue between submission and control, in which theshaman’s effectiveness is measured by his ability to negotiate with, if notcommand, the occult forces and beings with which he comes into contact.In the context of cannibalistic shamanism, this means that one of the shaman’sprimary tasks is to mitigate his carnivorous impulses. As we have seen, theAmuesha and Campa jaguar shamans attempt to protect their own kin fromtheir bloodlust by hunting away from home. Alternatively, when the Asurinido Tocantin shaman absorbs thekarowara(a pathogenic, cannibalistic agentthat causes disease) he has to ‘‘learn to control it and not be controlled by it’’or he would attack those around him, such as menstruating women, whosmelt of blood.42But, however skilled the shaman, there is always the dangerthat the fine balance between compulsion and control will tip and his canni-balistic desires overwhelm him.

Such action is unintentional, almost a ‘technical failure’: the shaman’svision becomes deficient and he starts to see his kin as enemies or animalprey.’’43For similar reasons, the Amuesha shaman is approached cautiously:not even the members of his own locality may fully trust a ‘‘man-eating’’ shaman.For this reason, such shamans are forced to introduce certain innovations into theircuring techniques. . . . In these cases [of sucking out sickness,] shamans do not applytheir mouths directly to their patients’ bodies, but use instead a hollow cane tubethrough which they blow their breath and suck out the intrusive objects. In this waycannibalistic shamans attempt to resist the temptation to eat their own patients in theprocess of curing them.44As they approached death, Tuvan shamans were equally untrustworthy, andcould be bound and abandoned by their relatives because ‘‘in the last minutesof his life the shaman ‘becomes crazy’ and ‘devours all that fall under his gaze,he kills cattle and people, he does not recognize anybody any more.’ ’’45Although important, however, evidence of these psychological dynamicsis not enough, in itself, for a community to identify and tolerate an individualas a dark shaman. Anthropological sources suggest that compulsive episodesof envisioned killing and cannibalism occur spontaneously in non-shamaniccontexts, where they can be condemned as witchcraft, madness, or posses-sion.46Cannibalistic dreams and visions only become shamanistic, as opposedto just visionary, if the experiencer learns to manipulate his occult power forthe benefit of the community.Most notably, as we saw in the Amuesha case above, the dark shamanemploys his skills to heal the sick, with Ste ́panoff noting that in SiberiaHealing rituals use the devouring capacities of the shaman by turning them in a con-venient direction...adevouring power is required in shamans’ ritual practicesagainst evil forces.

At their most abstract, the shaman’scannibalistic rites defend his community against the gods themselves. Throughritually feedingHoebo, the god of the underworld, with human victims, theWarao dark shaman mitigates an appetite that, if left unattended, could con-sume and destroy the whole world. Similarly, thekanaima`’sshamanic preda-tion is essentially an act of propitiation to the spirit ‘‘Makunaima, creator ofplants and animals,’’ with Whitehead noting that the ‘‘exchange of the muti-lated human victims ofkanaima`assault for the beneficence of Makunaimaunderlies the logic ofkanaima`ritual practice.’’50On a more pragmatic level, the dark shaman is deployed as an assaultsorcerer to defend his community against more tangible threats; most com-monly enemy sorcerers or tribes. Santos-Granero observed that among theAmuesha:Not infrequently shamans publicly proclaim their cannibalistic proclivities. This boas-ting of their cannibalistic tastes should be understood, I would suggest, as a publicproclamation of supernatural power, ferocity and fearlessness. It constitutes both anassurance for the members of his local settlement of his extra-ordinary powers and awarning for his enemies of his mercilessness.5147. Ste ́panoff, ‘‘Devouring,’’ 300, 295.48.

By the end ofthe century they were ‘‘explicitly understood as a means to resist and rejectthe white man’s materiality and spirituality.’’53On a more interpersonal level,dark shamans can use their predatory powers to resolve smaller-scale griev-ances, either attacking others at the behest of a client or in order to resolve apurely personal conflict. It is in this area of neighborly vendetta that the darkshaman’s activities most closely resemble those of the stereotypical witch—generating animosities that can easily degenerate into witch hunts.54As in hishealing practice, the dark shaman often initiates these protective and defen-sive assaults through the deployment of cannibalistic familiar spirits.55In its animist context, the thinking that underpins shamanistic cannibalismis pragmatic. Any shamanistic tradition, whether white or dark, operates outof the belief that in order to make use of and mitigate the powers of thespirits, the shaman must become intimate with them. He must learn theirlanguage, travel to their worlds, participate in their activities, adopt them (insome cases) as magical allies, and, like the Amazonian Tapirape ́shaman, betransformed ‘‘into one of them.’’ The logic informing the cannibalistic prac-tices of Amazonian, Siberian, and South East Asian shamans becomes clearerwhen we consider this belief alongside the fact that these shamanistic cultures52.

Among the South American Waya ̃pi, the flesh-eating monster known as theanhangar, when controlled, becomes ‘‘one of the shamans’ offensive weapons,’’ while,in order to resolve community dispute, the Melanesianbuaishaman can send eitherhis ownloroang[spirit] or the ‘‘life forces’’ of previously cannibalized victims to attackthreatening parties. Similarly, the Warao dark shaman’s ability to ‘‘retaliate againstoutside attack’’ by engaging ‘‘pathogenic agents of supernatural origin’’ is so effectivethat he can even, opportunistically, achieve his goal by ‘‘mustering the westerngod’s allied diseases.’’ (Fausto, ‘‘A Blend,’’ 160; Eves, ‘‘Shamanism,’’ 225–27; Wil-bert, ‘‘The Order,’’ 45).PAGE 32.................18420$$CH3 04-22-13 11:23:36 PS"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"33Wilby\u0002Burchard’sstrigae,the Witches’ Sabbath, and Shamanistic Cannibalismall possess what we might call ‘‘predation-cosmologies.’’ In a predation-cosmology, the cosmos is peopled by hungry spirits (of either the nonhumanor the dead) who desire to feed on human flesh and blood. In Warao mythol-ogy, the Macaw god of the underworld and his denizens have an insatiableappetite for human prey, dismembering and consuming the corpses broughtto them by dark shamans in elaborate underworld banquets. Similarly, inSiberia spirits were endowed with huge appetites, with Ste ́panoff noting thatthe Koryakkalaand the Chukchikeˆlywere both particularly fond of humanliver. In all of these cultures, this spirit hunger was believed to be the primecause of sickness and death.56The Amazoniankarowarawere widely associ-ated with ‘‘cannibal spirits, who cause diseases by eating, from the inside, theflesh of humans,’’ while according to Ste ́panoff, ‘‘at the beginning of thetwentieth century, most of the diseases and deaths in Siberia were ascribed tothe appetite of the spirits.’’57In these cultures, the fact that spirits are destruc-tive and cannibalistic does not mean that they should not be objects of inter-action. Like all spiritual entities that possess power over the lives of men, theyneed to be negotiated with, by shamans, in order to benefit the community.And according to the essential logic of shamanism, this entails the shamanbecoming intimate with them through transforming into ‘‘one of them.’’58From this perspective, the shaman’s supernatural devouring function is simplya reflection or embodiment of the devouring function of the spirits and, as acorollary of this, the essential nature and dynamics of the cosmos itself. Thisontological justification gives us a deeper insight into why the murderousactivities of the dark shaman are often tolerated by his community. He is notonly endured because his dark powers are deemed innocent or useful. It isalso because the things he does mirrors the way thingsare. As a reflectionof the predation-cosmology the shaman is neither ‘‘good’’ nor ‘‘bad,’’ withSte ́panoff noting thatIn Siberia, shamans’ cannibal practices are not seen as a bad habit of a particularcategory of ‘‘evil’’ or ‘‘black’’ shamans, or as a lapse contradicting their benevolent56.

Among theYakutsa genuine shaman ‘‘had tobe able to make a knife pass from one side to the other of his body’’ while, in South-ern Siberia, we have stories of shamans who can survive fire without being burnt,with this bodily difference, as we saw earlier, being confirmed by certain physicalsigns at birth.

Rather, it looks like an inevitable expression of what makes themshamans. Humans are just one of the numerous objects of their appetite, besideshostile spirits and simple presents of meat and alcohol . . . the shaman’s body isfrom birth (as opposed to by will) an active channel, and that is why, traditionally,‘‘devouring’’ is not precisely understood as a ‘‘bad action’’ from an ethical point ofview.59Although many Amazonian cultures make stronger distinctions than theSiberian between ‘‘light’’ and ‘‘dark’’ categories of shaman, they share thiscore perspective, with Whitehead and Wright noting that ‘‘whatever thetragedy, distress and death that dark shamans and allied ritual specialists [inAmazonia] may perform on humanity, they are [believed to be] an inevitable,continuing and even a necessary part of the cosmos.’’60In this context, evenwhen a shaman is lynched or ostracized the process may be strangely devoidof blame, with Ste ́panoff, noting that in Siberia, ‘‘Cannibal shamans are killedor abandoned in order to preserve lay people rather than as a kind of punish-ment.’’61From this perspective, dark shamanistic traditions are sustained bythe profound fatalism that thrives in any preindustrial culture required toendure a high incidence of sickness and death.IVWe can use this recent anthropological research into dark shamanism todevelop new perspectives on early modern witchcraft. The first thing tostrike us is that, in the multilayered and diverse belief systems of medievaland early modern Europe, we find traces of structures similar to the predationcosmologies central to shamanistic cannibalism in a non-European context.In diverse parts of the continent, it was believed that officially ‘‘good’’ spiritsof the popular supernatural pantheon, like God, the saints, or beneficentfairies, existed alongside spirits whose core purpose was to hunt, kill, and/orconsume humans. Foremost, we have the figure of the cannibalistic Devilhimself (and his demon companions) who takes center stage in demonologi-cal works and witchcraft records from the fourteenth century onward. How-ever, we also have a number of human-eating spirit categories that emerge asdistinct from demonological stereotypes, up to and beyond the period of thethe experiential world to be redefined.’’ (Ste ́panoff, ‘‘Devouring,’’ 298–300; Eves,‘‘Shamanism,’’ 222–25).59.

Our first is that of the often solitary bloodsucking spirits, andincludes the vampire, thelamia, somemorademons, and some incarnationsof thestrigawhom we met earlier (which is linked to the classicalstrix).62Allof these spirits characteristically possess the ability to metamorphose into ani-mals and creep into houses, kill people while they are sleeping, and consumetheir organs and/or suck their blood. Although more frequently depicted aspart of a group, our second category, the werewolf, bears an ‘‘amazing kin-ship’’ with the vampire, being either a spirit of the dead or a human whoroams the countryside, killing and consuming both animals and humans.63Moving on to our third category, we find cannibalism performed by some ofthe many troops of roaming dead that have been loosely grouped under the‘‘Wild Hunt’’ umbrella; including the bloodsuckingsluagh, the child-eatingGalerie Hunt, and the grave-raidingChasse Proserpine.64Fourthly, althoughthey were associated with healing, in some parts of Europe the fairies alsohad a death-bringing, cannibalistic aspect, which at times made them indis-tinguishable from the spirit hosts of the Wild Hunt corpus. For some inhabi-tants of seventeenth-century Scotland, for example, there seems to have beenno difference between the spirit host who feasted under hills with the fairyking and queen and thesluaghwho sucked human blood and took to theskies, armed with elf-arrows, in search of human prey.65While only relevantto the extent that it is deemed to reflect active belief, the prominence ofcannibalistic spirit beings (whether ogres, trolls, or female demons/witches)in traditional folktales throughout the European continent also reflects thispredation cosmology. Marina Warner has noted recently that ‘‘only four sto-ries by Perrault do not feature cannibalism as such. In the Grimm Brothers’62.

Putting aside witchcraft records and demonological works forthe moment, and just focusing on our folkloric spirit categories, a wide rangeof literature (from collections of myths, legends, ballads, and anecdotes tocommentaries on ‘‘superstitious’’ belief and practice) dating from the earlymedieval period to the present contains suggestive motifs and themes. To agreater or lesser extent, and in different concentrations and combinationsaccording to source-type and locality, we find vampiric spirits, werewolves,Wild-Hunt cavalcades, and fairies all associated with the belief that humanscan participate in their killing and cannibalistic activities, that these activitiescan generate beneficent magical effects, and that they can be tolerated bytheir host communities. Similarly, accounts of this human participation arelittered with the motifs and themes of shamanistic trance and compulsion,such as references to dreams, visions, irresistible impulses, spirit-coercion,physical catatonia, false bodies, subtle-body travel, animal metamorphosis,suprahuman capacities, physical signs of destiny at birth, and so on.67All ofthe spirit categories listed here call for deeper examination in the context ofdark shamanism, but even this brief survey invites us to conclude that sha-manistic rites developed in relation to these cannibalistic spirit categories andthat cultural memories of these practices persisted into medieval and earlymodern Europe.VGiven that the witchcraft stereotypes that emerged in demonological worksfrom the fifteenth century onward drew on the folkloricstrigaeor Wild Hunt66.

What is more unexpected,however, is that these motifs and themes emerge from the records in such acoherent, systematic, and comprehensive way. For example, although it mayseem an obvious point, the first thing to emphasise is that witchcraft confes-sions and sentences all provide us with unanimous claims of human participa-tion in cannibalistic events; after all, the witch’s bloodsucking attack or baby-eating feast could not take place without a participating witch. We alsohave—in relation to both cannibalistic and noncannibalistic events—manyreferences to the motifs associated with shamanistic trance.68Some suspectsdirectly claimed that their malefic attacks and/or their attendance at the sab-bath occurred in dream or while they traveled ‘‘in spirit’’ or ‘‘in the form ofa soul’’; while even those who maintained that their experience was bodilyoften littered their testimony with claims to have transformed into animals,left false bodies or some form of inanimate object in their beds when travel-ing, and reached their destinations through flight or squeezing into housesthrough keyholes and closed doors.69Equally significant is the fact that theseclaims were often corroborated by elite commentators. A substantial propor-tion of demonologists and interrogators maintained that the witches’ killingsprees and sabbath experiences (whether cannibalistic or otherwise) werevisionary ones, with even those who argued that they were ‘‘real’’ eventsusually conceding that it sometimes happened in the imagination only.70TheSpanish inquisitor Alonso de Salazar Frı ́as (whose ‘‘strict insistence on empiri-cism’’ when investigating witches made him, according to Henningsen, ‘‘farahead of his time’’), persuasively claimed that:68. It is important to note that the shamanistic motifs and themes listed in thissection apply to both the cannibalistic and noncannibalistic killings/sabbaths describedin witchcraft records. This is congruent with our non-European material. Shamanistickilling, as it emerges in the anthropological sources, does not need to involve canni-balism, and yet the psychological dynamic and rationale behind cannibalistic and non-cannibalistic killings are in many ways the same. Although there is no space to gointo this issue here, many parallels could be drawn between the noncannibalistic ‘‘kill-ing shaman’’ and the noncannibalistic ‘‘killing witch,’’ as noted with regard to theWild Hunt, n. 12.69.

Manyothers made the same phenomenon clear, namely that their witchcraft had taken placein their dreams, as will be seen from the tenor of their confessions.71The fact that interrogators could maintain the position that witches weredreaming even when trance-journeying suspects denied that this was the casesuggests that the belief in the reality of visionary travel was present in popularculture, and not just an elite superimposition. Many demonological manualscontain accounts of instances where frustrated interrogators beat a witchwhile she lay in trance, in order to show her the bruises when she woke toprove that she did not travel to the sabbath bodily.72Although this narrativewas certainly a trope, it is likely to have been rooted in real exchanges; Sala-zar, for example, complained that despite his observations that ‘‘their witch-craft had taken place in their dreams’’ his suspects ‘‘claimed that they alwaysparticipated [at the sabbath] personally and corporeally.’’73Witchcraft narratives also contain—in relation to both cannibalistic andnoncannibalistic killing—the same theme of compulsion that we identifiedin our anthropological material. The indiscriminate, out-of-control huntingsprees of the Warao,kanaima`, Campa, and Amuesha shamans can be likened,morphologically, to the significant minority of witch confessions that describeseemingly random, indiscriminate, and often multiple killings—which cansometimes include the suspect’s own children—that beggar the understand-ing because they seem so pointless, incriminatory, and without clear links tospecific grievance.74Also relevant here is the fact that when indulging in hercannibalistic activities, the witch was generally unconcerned with the identityof the adult or infant being vampirized, disinterred, dismembered, or boileddown for fat; in effect, any ‘‘body’’ would do.

That this tactic may have been encouraged by some interro-gators is suggested by Bodin’s chilling claim that ‘‘in order to get the truthfrom those who are accused’’ judges must ‘‘appear to have pity on them, andtell them that it is not they, but the Devil who forced and compelled themto cause peoples’ death.’’82But our anthropological comparisons suggest thatthe interrogators who pursued this line of questioning may have beenexploiting beliefs surrounding the dynamics of visionary compulsion thatalready existed. Certainly, Wilbert’s claim that the Warao shaman’s macawspirits’ ‘‘keep prodding him for sustenance [in his dreams]’’ so that ‘‘withcompulsive intermittent regularity, the veteran dark shaman must continuecarrying blood and corpses to the netherworld’’ suggests similar psychologicaltensions to those experienced by the Labourd witch Isaac de Queyran, whoclaimed to have reluctantly succumbed to the Devil’s extortions to climbdown a chimney and poison his employer’s son as he slept. When deQueyran was asked, by his interrogators, ‘‘how the poor child had wrongedhim so that he should bring such misery upon him,’’ he answered that thechild was innocent and that ‘‘He did what he did to obey the Evil Spirit,who was tormenting him incessantly to do so, day and night.’’83Our dark shamanistic themes are also reflected in the fact that there was aperceived link between harmful magical activities and community benefit.Witches were usually brought to court in response to charges of directingharm—with or without a cannibalistic component—at specific individuals inresponse to personal grievance. These are the vengeance crimes that takecenter stage at any interrogation and reflect the global belief in the evil witch.80.

Some of the witches’ vengeance killings were performedto benefit a family member, or a community subgroup (such as a clique ofpersecuted witches), or an oppressed client—and in this capacity the witchemulated the protective function of the dark shaman. Indeed, it is not in thefact that they describe vengeance killings that witch narratives differ fromthose of dark shamans, but only in the degree to which they do so. Moreover,the high levels of vengeance killing in witch testimonies are not necessarily aclear reflection of the witch’s magical activities in general, because she wasusually brought before the authorities when hostilities between herself andher neighbors had become so intense that they provoked sorcery accusations.To put it another way, if we did not have access to sensitive anthropologicalstudies, and our only picture ofkanaima`or Warao dark shamans were trialrecords, produced by governing officials, relating to those who had upsettheir communities by overstepping their remit and too-frequently using theirdark powers for personal gain, we would be closer to the picture that emergesin our witch trials, but the picture would not be an accurate one.84That the activities of the witch could be associated with community bene-fit is also demonstrated in contemporary beliefs about magical healing.Despite the fact that they identified the witch with acts ofmaleficium,mostearly modern demonologists devoted at least one chapter of their works—andoften more—to an analysis of her healing abilities.85Although these discus-sions often focus on largely beneficent healers or ‘‘cunning women’’ (whoseactivities were generally subsumed under the umbrella category of ‘‘witch-craft’’) their relevance to themaleficium-performing witch is confirmed byample evidence of widespread and deeply rooted contemporary beliefs sur-rounding the dual aspect of the healer. Briggs, for example, notes that in84. The degree to which witches were employed as ‘‘assault sorcerers’’ by theircommunities is underresearched, with both historians of witchcraft and (untilrecently) anthropologists tending to focus on the community benefits of witchcraftand sorcery accusation as opposed to performance, with the former being rationalizedas a means to resolve tension and reinforce social mores.85. All early modern demonologists make reference—to a greater or lesserextent—to the healing powers of the witch. Among those who devote multiple chap-ters (or points of discussion) to the subject are Remy, Bodin, Boguet, de Lancre, andGuazzo. See Nicolas Remy,Demonolatry, trans. E. A.

This seems to reflect the exceptional degree to whichthe people of the duchy had integrated witchcraft within their therapeuticpractices.’’86Moving across to eastern Europe, in one of several similar exam-ples, Po ́cs points out that a Hungarian witch claimed that spirits termed the‘‘evil ones’’ helped her in healing because ‘‘they can also see the devils infancy dresses,’’ or in other words, ‘‘communicate as spirit creatures and ‘see’in the alternative world.’’87Kieckhefer notes that in central Italian trials fromthe fifteenth-century women accused of being bloodsucking witches were‘‘regularly if perhaps not professionally engaged in the mediation of supernat-ural powers’’—mediations that could include love magic, assault sorcery, andhealing.88This same duality is found in the Basque witch trials of 1609–14.Despite the fact that the Basque records give us ‘‘the most accomplisheddescriptions of the sabbath in all its history’’ and that, in these descriptions,rites surrounding cannibalistic killing and consumption attain a prominenceunparalleled elsewhere in Europe, it is nonetheless clear that for someBasques, attendance at these events was associated with healing abilities.89Labourd witch Leger Riuasseau, for example, told his interrogators that he‘‘had wagered half of his left foot [to the Devil] in return for the ability toheal and the permission simply to see the sabbath without being obliged todo anything else.’’90Similarly, we find a healing ritual embedded deep in asummary of the Spanish sabbath from Pierre de Lancre:Once the liquids, powders, and blood are assembled, they secretly dry them beforethe fire or in the sun, and they rub this on their arms, their spine, and their joints.Then they fly through the night like birds, together with their dressed-up toad. Andwhen they perform a cure, they say and repeat these words: ‘‘Emen hetan, emenhetan,’’ which means ‘‘Here and there, here and there.’’9186. Briggs,Witches, 385.87. Po ́cs,Between, 107–11. It is also interesting to note, and worth exploring fur-ther in this context, that more classic forms of demonic possession could be associatedwith supernatural powers. According to Feijoo, the inhabitants of the Spanish townof Oviedo believed that a local possessed woman ‘‘knew what was happeningthroughout the world’’ and ‘‘flew over the tallest treetops’’ (Tausiet, ‘‘From Illusion,’’50).88.

Despite the fact that trial records revealthe existence of fierce hostilities between witches and their accusers, anddespite the fact that witches were usually accused of horrendous crimes,scholars have often noted that early modern communities seem to have pos-sessed a ‘‘striking’’ capacity to tolerate the witch.93Witch trial records con-firm that individuals could be defined as witches and remain integrated intotheir communities for many decades, with Briggs noting that ‘‘it is very hardto imagine how hundreds or thousands of suspects could have escaped prose-cution. Yet in a sense they did, because for every one who ended up at thestake there were probably several with significant reputations who werenever tried at all.’’94The evidence suggests that in these cases, witchcraftdisputes were resolved through a variety of conciliatory methods. Victims ortheir families often requested that the witch magically rectify the harm shewas believed to have caused, and once the victim was successfully healed,they frequently let the matter drop. Despite the fact, for example, thatLabourd witch Isaac de Queyran had confessed to poisoning his master’s son,the distraught father promised to not only ‘‘pardon’’ but also ‘‘forgive’’ himif he came back and healed the child.95Henningsen argues that contritionplayed an important role in northern Spain, saying of the accusations atZugarramurdi (which sparked off the 1609 Basque witch craze) that ‘‘if the92.

As Briggs has argued, ‘‘the relative acceptance ofwitches who doubled as healers must be one partial explanation for the reluc-tance of families and individuals to press home what were effectively murdercharges.’’ For some, the witch’s protective abilities may have been seen as acommunal asset worth tolerating, while fear of the witch’s aggressive reprisalwould also have acted as a strong deterrent in this respect.97But, on the basisof our examination of anthropological analyses of dark shamanism, we canalso speculate that these conciliatory measures were rooted in deeply fatalisticconceptions surrounding the psychological dynamics of visionary compulsionand the ‘‘innocence’’ of those who fell prey to them.VIAlthough these anthropological comparisons have been brief, they suggestthat it could be fruitful to analyze Burchard’sstrigaein a shamanistic context.In the first instance, this perspective enables us to rearticulate a conventionalview. Instead of asserting that ‘‘beliefs, motifs and themes surrounding canni-balistic spirits and humans survived into early modern Europe’’ we can, alter-natively, assert that ‘‘beliefs, motifs and themes surrounding ‘shamanisticcannibalism’ survived into early modern Europe.’’ This rephrasing implies aqualitative difference. It suggests not only that beliefs about cannibalisticwitches, vampires, werewolves, and troops of the dead possessed a ‘‘beware-the-bogeyman’’ charge and function, but also that they were woven into acohesive and deeply rooted web of associations between the ecstatic compul-sion to perform cannibalistic killing and the ability to both understand andcombat sickness, death, and fate through access to the spirit world and theacquisition of magical power. Looking at European witchcraft through thislens could shed new light on old problems. For example, there is a generalagreement among historians that the majority of confession-embedded narra-tives describing cannibalism and cannibalistic killing were fictions created inresponse to prosecutorial coercion and suggestion. However, there is less clar-ity and consensus concerning the reasons why, in response to these dark linesof questioning, it was not uncommon for suspects to provide their interroga-tors with a wealth of specific and often startlingly vivid detail. Despite our96. Henningsen,Witches’ Advocate, 36.97.

Whilescholars have observed that a distinction emerges, in the sources, betweenbeneficent goddess–following beliefs and maleficentstrigae/Wild Huntbeliefs, they have also observed that in many contexts this distinction is notat all clear. However good the ‘‘Mistress of the Good Game’’ may have been,the mythology indicates that like many archaic goddess figures, she possessedthe same ambivalence seen so clearly in the tribal dark shaman and the spiritshe emulates, with a witch from Val di Fiemme claiming, for example, thatwhen her mistress ‘‘journeys through the air she has two patches around hereyes, one on each side, so that she cannot see anything: and if she were able tosee everything she would do great harm to the world.’’99Similarly, howeverbeneficent the fairy-procession nexus, when scholars have attempted to sepa-rate it—at the level of myth and legend—from that of the Wild Hunt, theyhave been ultimately frustrated, finding the two matrices of belief ‘‘hard todistinguish’’ or ‘‘indistinguishable.’’100Also relevant (and under-researched)in this context is the fact that the act of killing and consuming both humansand animals emerges as a core rite in several classic accounts of the ‘‘GoodGame,’’ including those from Milan, Bressanone, and the Dolomite Val-leys.101Even Burchard’sDecretum,which, as we saw earlier, showcases thetwo component mythologies of the sabbath conflation, also contains a thirdpassage that—through associating fate-women with werewolves—bringsthese two oppositional themes together:98.

On a popular level, itmay have been the experiential response to existential ambivalence, asopposed to an elite intellectual equation, that gave the European stereotypeof the cannibalistic witches’ sabbath its emotional impact.VIIWhile our anthropological perspectives can deepen our understanding of thebelief matrices that underpinned cannibalistic narratives, whether they canthey shed any light on the question of the experiential dimension is less clear.On the one hand, they do suggest that early modern culture possessed theconceptual infrastructure necessary to sustain dark shamanistic traditions. Onthe other, they cannot solve or alleviate the epistemological problems posedby the witchcraft records themselves. Even isolating an experiential dimen-sion in relation to the folkloric narratives describing beneficent shamanismis problematic (however filled with references to dreams, false bodies, andspirit-flight they might be). Arguments for the visionary dimension ofgoddess-related traditions like that of thedonas de fuerastill remain persuasivehypotheses as opposed to fact. Contemporary descriptions of shamanisticallythemed practices involving killing and cannibalism are even more problem-atic, because these accounts fuse so readily with elite demonological stereo-types. Recently, Willem de Ble ́court drew attention to the difficulties ofdetermining the existence of ecstatic rites in relation to the werewolf com-plex, pointing again to the lack of firm evidence and arguing that scholars102. Filotas,Pagan, 317.103.

In his detailed study of the Basque witch trials of 1609–14,Henningsen supports Salazar’s observation that ‘‘many’’ of the events describedby witchcraft suspects ‘‘had taken place in their dreams,’’ but argues thatthese vivid and stereotypically demonological visionary experiences emergedspontaneously among the general population in response to the propagandaand ensuing hysteria surrounding witch persecutions.106We can reasonablyassume that this process also occurred on a less dramatic scale, both in theBasque regions and in other parts of Europe, in response to smaller-scalewitchcraft panics. As noted earlier, we find evidence pointing to this phe-nomenon in non-European cultures, where some of those accused of witch-craft seem to spontaneously experience compulsive, culture-patternedvisionary experiences in which they perform stereotypically ‘‘witch-like’’ actsof killing and cannibalism—but with no obvious shamanistic dimension.107Given that early modern witchcraft records are so resistant to analysis ofthis sort, the only way forward is through microstudies. In order to assesswhether any cannibalistic narratives may have crystallized around an experi-ential core and, more importantly, whether this core was linked to some kindof shamanistic, as opposed to just visionary, dream or trance experience, weneed to examine trial clusters where cannibalism or cannibalistic killingemerges strongly and explore why, in these cases, these themes attained suchprominence. To this end, the contribution of the suspect (and the popularbeliefs, practices, and oral narratives that informed it) should be examined ascarefully as any interrogatorial influence. In the absence of hard evidence,such analyses are unlikely to provide confirmation of dark shamanistic rites,104.

In thelast century, a number of folklorists recorded the existence of a dream culttermed themazzeri, which was allegedly active in Corsica until at least themid-twentieth century.108If the practices of this cult are superimposed uponthe template of dark shamanistic practice we sketched out earlier in this paper,we find congruence on many levels. Mainly, but not exclusively women, themazzeriwere ‘‘called’’ by an irresistible force to go out in dreams in order tohunt down, kill, and consume animals. As they killed their prey, for a briefmoment they glimpsed the human face of an individual known to them,revealing the animal to be another person traveling in subtle-body form.Having been killed on the visionary plane this individual would then physi-cally die within a short space of time.109As it often was for the dark shaman,this predation was random and indiscriminate, to the extent that unfortunatemazzerecould, on occasion, find themselves attacking a member of theirown family or community. Like the Amuesha jaguar shamans, these Corsicandreamers also engaged in group battles. Once a year, themazzeriof rivalvillages would organize each other into ‘‘milizia’’ and fight each other in themountain passes, with Carrington noting that ‘‘the inhabitants of the villageswere deeply concerned by these phantom battles’’ because ‘‘the village thatlost mostmazzeriwould lose more lives in the coming year than the opposingvillage of the victoriousmazzeri.’’110Although themazzeriwere feared bytheir communities, and although they were so dangerous that they couldeven kill ‘‘those they loved the most,’’ they were tolerated because they werebelieved to be fundamentally innocent of their crimes. Corsican villagerswere aware that, as with our Amazonian and Siberian dark shamans, themazzerihad ‘‘no animosity towards the animal they have to kill, nor towardsthe human being it represents’’ and that their hunts occurred because the‘‘order [to kill] was absolute; [and] they could not even choose their victims.’’Indeed, such convictions could generate anecdotes in whichmazzerivisitedneighbors, in all good conscience, in order to apologize for inadvertently108.

Future research may reveal themazzerito havebeen an anomaly, but until this time, their existence means that we cannotdismiss the possibility that shamanistic traditions incorporating cannibalisticaggression may have operated in other parts of the continent several hundredyears earlier.111.
