Perhaps, therefore, Ishould begin by paying tribute to my publisher for expressing no nervous-ness concerning the size of the likely readership. Frege (1893–1903, I, p.xii)predicted that the form of hisGrundgesetzewould cause him torelinquish as readers all those mathematicians who, if they bump into logical expres-sions such as ‘concept’, ‘relation’, ‘judgment’, think:metaphysica sunt, non leguntur, andlikewise those philosophers who at the sight of a formula cry:mathematica sunt, nonleguntur.And, as he rightly observed, ‘the number of such persons is surely not small’.As then, so now. Any book which tries to form a bridge between math-ematics and philosophy risks vanishing into the gap. It is inevitable, howeverhard the writer strives for clarity, that the requirements of the subject matterplacedemandsonthereader,sometimesmathematical,sometimesphilosoph-ical. This is something which anyone who wants to make a serious study ofthe philosophy of mathematics must simply accept. To anyone who doubts itthere are two bodies of work which stand as an awful warning: the philosoph-ical literature contains far too many articles marred by elementary technicalmisunderstandings,1while mathematicians have often been tempted, espe-cially in later life, to commit to print philosophical reflections which are eitherwholly vacuous or hopelessly incoherent.Both mathematicians and philosophers, then, need to accept that studyingthephilosophyofmathematicsconfrontsthemwithchallengesforwhichtheirprevious training may not have prepared them. It does not follow automat-ically, of course, that one should try, as I have done here, to cater for theirdiffering needs in a single textbook. However, my main reason for writing thebook was that I wanted to explore the constantinterplaythat set theory seemsto exemplify between technical results and philosophical reflection, and thisconvinced me that there was more than expositional economy to be said fortrying to address both readerships simultaneously.1I should know: I have written one myself."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"viPrefaceIn this respect the book differs from its predecessor,Sets: An Introduction(1990), which was directed much more at philosophically ignorant mathem-aticians than at philosophers. The similarities between the new book and theold are certainly substantial, especially in the more technical parts, but eventhere the changes go well beyond the cosmetic. Technically informed readersmay find a quick summary helpful.At the formal level the most significant change is that I have abandonedthe supposition I made inSetsthat the universe of collections contains a sub-universe which has all the sets as members but is nevertheless capable of be-longing to other collections (not, of course, sets) itself. The truth is that I onlyincluded it for two reasons: to make it easy to embed category theory; and tosidestep some irritating pieces of pedantry such as the difficulty we face whenwe try, without going metalinguistic, to say in standard set theory that theclassofallordinalsiswell-ordered. Neitherreasonnowstrikesmeassufficientto compensate for the complications positing a sub-universe creates: the cat-egory theorists never thanked me for accommodating them, and if they wanta sub-universe, I now think that they can posit it for themselves; while thepedantry is going to have to be faced at some point, so postponing it does noone any favours.The style of set-theoretic formalism in which the sets form only a sub-universe (sometimes in the literature named after Grothendieck) has neverfound much favour. (Perhaps category theory is not popular enough.) So inthisrespectthenewbookisthemoreorthodox. Intwootherrespects,though,I have persisted in eccentricity: I still allow there to be individuals; and I stilldo not include the axiom scheme of replacement in the default theory.The reasons for these choices are discussed quite fully in the text, so hereI will be brief. The first eccentricity — allowing individuals — seems to meto be something close to a philosophical necessity: as it complicates the treat-ment only very slightly, I can only recommend that mathematicians who donot see the need should regard it as a foible and humour me in it. The second— doing without replacement — was in fact a large part of my motivation towriteSetstobeginwith. Ihadwhiledawaymystudentdaysunderthedelusionthat replacement is needed for the formalization of considerable amounts ofmathematics,andwhenIdiscoveredthatthiswasfalse,Iwantedtospreadtheword (spread it, that is to say, beyond the set theorists who knew it already).On this point my proselytizing zeal has hardly waned in the intervening dec-ade. One of the themes which I have tried to develop in the new book is theidea that set theory is a measure (not the only one, no doubt) of the degreeof abstractness of mathematics, and it is at the very least a striking fact aboutmathematical practice, which many set theory textbooks contrive to obscure,that even before we try to reduce levels by clever use of coding, the over-whelming majority of mathematics sits comfortably inside the first couple ofdozen levels of the hierarchy above the natural numbers."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"PrefaceviiThedifferencesfromstandardtreatmentsthatIhavedescribedsofaraffectour conception of the extent of the set-theoretic hierarchy. One final differ-ence affecting not our conception of it but only the axiomatization is that theaxiomsIhaveusedfocusfirstonthenotionofalevel,anddeducethepropertiesofsets(as subcollections of levels) only derivatively. The pioneer of this style ofaxiomatization was Scott (1974), but my earlier book used unpublished workof John Derrick to simplify his system significantly, and here I have taken theopportunity to make still more simplifications.Lecturers on the look-out for a course text may feel nervous about this. Noexecutive, it is said, has ever been sacked for ordering IBM computers, evenif they were not the best buy; by parity of reasoning, I suppose, no lecturer isever sacked for teachingZF. So it is worth stressing thatZU, the system whichacts as a default throughout this book, is interpretable inZFin the obviousmanner: the theorems stated in this book are, word for word, theorems ofZF. So teaching from this book is not like teaching from Quine’sMathematicalLogic: you will find no self-membered sets here.Most of the exercises have very largely been taken unchanged from myearlier book. I recommend browsing them, at least: it is a worthwhile aid tounderstanding the text, even for those students who do not seriously attemptto do them all.It is a pleasure, in conclusion, to record my thanks: to Philip Meguire andPierre Matet for correspondence about the weaknesses of my earlier book;to the members of the Cambridge seminar which discussed chapters of thenew book in draft and exposed inadequacies of exposition; and especially toTimothy Smiley, Eric James, Peter Clark and Richard Zach, all of whomspent more time than I had any right to expect reading the text and giving meperceptive, judicious comments on it.M.

But inorder to begin the task, it will help to have an idea of the reasons one mighthave for studying them.It is uncontroversial, first of all, that set-theoretic language can be used asa vehicle for communication. We shall concentrate here on the mathematicalcase, not because this is the only context in which set talk is useful — that isfar from being so — but rather because ordinary language cases do not seemto need a theory of anything like the same complexity to underpin them. Butin this role set theory is being usedmerelyas a language. What will interest ushere much more are those uses of set theory for which a substantial theory isrequired. Three strands can be distinguished.Thefirstoftheseistheuseofsettheoryasatoolinunderstandingtheinfin-ite. ThisstrandwillleadustodevelopinpartIIIofthebookthetheoryoftwodistinct types of infinite number, known as cardinals and ordinals. These twotheories are due in very large part to one man, Georg Cantor, who workedthem out in the last quarter of the 19th century. This material is hardly con-troversial nowadays: it may still be a matter of controversy in some quarterswhether infinite sets exist, but hardly anyone now tries to argue that their ex-istenceis,asamatterofpurelogic,contradictory. Thishasnotalwaysbeenso,however, and the fact that it is so now is a consequence of the widespread ac-ceptance of Cantor’s theories, which exhibited the contradictions others hadclaimed to derive from the supposition of infinite sets as confusions resultingfrom the failure to mark the necessary distinctions with sufficient clarity.The revolution in attitudes to the infinitely large which Cantor’s work en-gendered was thus as profound as the roughly simultaneous revolution causedby the rigorous development of the infinitesimal calculus. In the 20th cen-tury, once these two revolutions had been assimilated, the paradoxes of theinfinitely small (such as Zeno’s arrow) and of the infinitely large (such as thecorrespondence between a set and its proper subset) came to be regarded not"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"4Introduction to Part Ias serious philosophical problems but only as historical curiosities.The second role for set theory, which will occupy us throughout the bookbutespeciallyinpartII,isthefoundationaloneofsupplyingthesubjectmatterof mathematics. Modern textbooks on set theory are littered with variantsof this claim: one of them states baldly that ‘set theory is the foundation ofmathematics’ (Kunen 1980, p.xi), and similar claims are to be found not just(asperhapsonemightexpect)inbookswrittenbysettheoristsbutalsoinmanymainstream mathematics books.

Pre-theoreticallywesurelyfeelnotemptationwhatevertoconjecturethatnumbersmight‘really’besets—farlesssetsbuiltupfromtheemptysetalone— and yet throughout the 20th century many mathematicians did not merelyconjecture this but said that it was so.One of the themes that will emerge as this enquiry progresses, however,is that what mathematicians say is no more reliable as a guide to the inter-pretation of their work than what artists say abouttheirwork, or musicians.So we certainly should not automatically take mathematicians at their set-theoretically reductionist word. And there have in any case been notable re-cusantsthroughouttheperiod,suchasMacLane(1986)andMayberry(1994).Nevertheless,weshallneedtobearthisfoundationaluseforsettheoryinmindthroughout, both because it has been enormously influential in determiningthemannerinwhichthetheoryhasbeendevelopedandbecauseitwillbeoneof our aims to reach a position from which its cogency can be assessed.A third role for set theory, closely related to the second but nonetheless dis-tinguishable from it (cf. Carnap 1931), is to supply for diverse areas of math-ematics not a common subject matter but common modes of reasoning. Thebest known illustration of this is the axiom of choice, a set-theoretic principlewhich we shall study in part IV.Once again, the historical importance of this role for set theory is unques-tionable: the axiom of choice was the subject of controversy among mathem-aticians throughout the first half of the 20th century. But once again it is atleast debatable whether set theory can indeed have the role that is ascribedto it: it is far from clear that the axiom of choice is correctly regarded as aset-theoretic principle at all, and similar doubts may be raised about otherpurported applications of set-theoretic principles in mathematics.These three roles for set theory — as a means of taming the infinite, as asupplier of the subject matter of mathematics, and as a source of its modes ofreasoning — have all been important historically and have shaped the waythe subject has developed. Most of the book will be taken up with present-ing the technical material which underpins these roles and discussing theirsignificance.In this first part of the book, however, we shall confine ourselves to the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction to Part I5seemingly modest goal of setting up an elementary theory of sets within whichtoframe the later discussion. The history of such theories is now a century old— the theory we shall present here can trace its origins to Zermelo (1908b)— and yet there is, even now, no consensus in the literature about the formthey should take. Very many of the theories that have been advanced seek toformalize what has come to be known as theiterativeconception of sets, andwhat we shall be presenting here is one such theory. However, it is by nomeans a trivial task to tease out what the iterative conception amounts to. Sothe goal of this part of the book will turn out not to be quite as modest as itseems."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Chapter 1LogicThis book will consist in very large part in the exposition of a mathematicaltheory — the theory (or at any rateatheory) of sets. This exposition willhave at its core a sequence ofproofsdesigned to establishtheorems. We shalldistinguish among the theorems some which we shall calllemmas,propositionsorcorollaries. Traditionally, a lemma is a result of no intrinsic interest provedas a step towards the proof of a theorem; a proposition is a result of less inde-pendent importance than a theorem; and a corollary is an easy consequenceof a theorem. The distinctions are of no formal significance, however, and wemake use of them only as a way of providing signposts to the reader as to therelative importance of the results stated.One central element in the exposition will be explicitdefinitionsto explainour use of various words and symbols. It is a requirement of such a definitionthat it should be formally eliminable, so that every occurrence of the worddefined could in principle be replaced by the phrase that defines it withoutaffectingthecorrectnessoftheproof. Butthisprocessofeliminationmuststopeventually: at the beginning of our exposition there must be mathematicalwords or symbols which we do not define in terms of others but merely takeas given: they are calledprimitives. And proof must start somewhere, just asdefinition must. If we are to avoid an infinite regress, there must be somepropositionsthatarenotprovedbutcanbeusedintheproofsofthetheorems.Such propositions are calledaxioms.1.1 The axiomatic methodThe method for expounding a mathematical theory which we have just de-scribed goes back at least to Euclid, who wrote a textbook of geometry andarithmetic in axiomatic form around 300B.C.(It is difficult to be certain quitehow common the axiomatic method was before Euclid because his textbooksupplanted previous expositions so definitively that very little of them survivesto be examined today.)The axiomatic method is certainly not universal among mathematicianseven now, and its effectiveness has been overstated in some quarters, thereby"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The axiomatic method7providing an easy target for polemical attack by empiricists such as Lakatos(1976). It is nevertheless true that pure mathematicians at any rate regard itsuse as routine. How then should we account for it?Responses to this question fall into two camps which mathematicians havefor some time been wont to call realist and formalist. This was not an alto-gether happy choice of terminology since philosophers had already used bothwords for more specific positions in the philosophy of mathematics, but I shallfollow the mathematicians’ usage here.At the core of attitudes to the axiomatic method that may be calledrealistis the view that ‘undefined’ does not entail ‘meaningless’ and so it may bepossibletoprovideameaningfortheprimitivetermsofourtheoryinadvanceof laying down the axioms: perhaps they are previously understood termsof ordinary language; or, if not, we may be able to establish the intendedmeanings by means of what Frege calls elucidations — informal explanationswhich suffice to indicate the intended meanings of terms. But elucidation,Frege says, is inessential. It merelyserves the purpose of mutual understanding among investigators, as well as of thecommunication of science to others. We may relegate it to a propaedeutic. It has noplaceinthesystemofascience; noconclusionsarebasedonit. Someonewhopursuedresearch only by himself would not need it. (1906, p.302)If the primitive terms of our theory are words, such as ‘point’ or ‘line’, whichcan be given meanings in this manner, then by asserting the axioms of thetheory we commit ourselves to theirtruth. Realism is thus committed to thenotion that the words mathematicians use already have a meaning independ-ent of the system of axioms in which the words occur. It is for this reasonthat such views are described as realist. If the axioms make existential claims(which typically they do), then by taking them to be true we commit ourselvesto the existence of the requisite objects.Nevertheless, realism remains a broad church, since it says nothing yetabout the nature of the objects thus appealed to. Two sorts of realist canbe distinguished: a platonist takes the objects to exist independently of us andof our activities, and hence (since they are certainly not physical) to be insome sense abstract; a constructivist, on the other hand, takes the objects toexist only if they can be constructed, and hence to be in some sense mental.But ‘in some sense’ is usually a hedging phrase, and so it is here. To say thata number owes its existence to my construction of it does not of itself makethe number mental any more than my bookcase is mental because I built it:what is distinctive of constructivism in the philosophy of mathematics (andhence distinguishes numbers, as it conceives of them, from bookcases) is theidea that numbers areconstitutedby our constructions of them. I said earlierthat philosophers of mathematics use the word ‘realist’ differently, and thisis the point where the difference emerges, since constructivism would not be"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"8Logiccounted realist on their usage: it counts here as a species of realism because itinterprets mathematical existence theorems as truths about objects which donot owe their existence to the signs used to express them.During the 19th century, however, there emerged another cluster of waysof regarding axioms, which we shall refer to asformalist. What they had incommon was a rejection of the idea just mentioned that the axioms can beregarded simply as true statements about a subject matter external to them.Onepartofthemotivationfortheemergenceofformalismlayinthedifferentaxiom systems for geometry — Euclidean, hyperbolic, projective, spherical— which mathematicians began to study. The words ‘point’ and ‘line’ occurin all, but the claims made using these words conflict. So they cannot all betrue, at any rate not unconditionally. One view, then, is that axioms shouldbe thought of as assumptions which we suppose in order to demonstrate theproperties of those structures that exemplify them. The expositor of an ax-iomatic theory is thus as much concerned with truth on this view as on therealist one, but the truths asserted are conditional:ifany structure satisfiesthe axioms,thenit satisfies the theorem. This view has gone under variousnames in the literature — implicationism, deductivism, if-thenism, eliminat-ive structuralism. Here we shall call itimplicationism. It seems to be plainlythe right thing to say about the role axioms play in the general theories —of groups, rings, fields, topological spaces, differential manifolds, or whatever— which are the mainstay of modern mathematics. It is rather less happy,though, when it is applied to axiomatizations of the classical theories — ofnatural, real or complex numbers, of Euclidean geometry — which were thesole concern of mathematics until the 19th century. For by conditionalizingallourtheoremsweomittomentiontheexistenceofthestructureinquestion,and therefore have work to do if we are to explain the applicability of the the-ory: the domain of any interpretation in which the axioms of arithmetic aretrue is infinite, and yet we confidently apply arithmetical theorems within thefinite domain of our immediate experience without troubling to embed it insuch an infinite domain as implicationism would require us to do. Implica-tionism seems capable, therefore, of being at best onlypartof the explanationof these classical cases.Nonetheless, the axiomatic method was by the 1920s becoming such amathematical commonplace, and implicationism such a common attitude to-wards it, that it was inevitable it would be applied to the recently founded the-ory of sets. Thus mathematicians such as von Neumann (1925) and Zermelo(1930) discussed from a metatheoretic perspective the properties of structuressatisfying the set-theoretic axioms they were considering. One of the evidentattractionsoftheimplicationistviewofsettheoryisthatitobviatesthetediousrequirement imposed on the realist to justify the axioms astrueand replaces itwith at most the (presumably weaker) requirement to persuade the reader tobe interested in their logical consequences. Even in the extreme case where"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The axiomatic method9our axiom system turned out to be inconsistent, this would at worst make itsconsequences uninteresting, but we could then convict the implicationist onlyof wasting our time, not of committing amistake.There is an evident uneasiness about this way of discussing set theory, how-ever. One way of thinking of a structure is as a certain sort of set. So when wediscuss the properties ofstructuressatisfying the axioms of set theory, we seemalready to be presupposing the notion of set. This is a version of an objectionthat is sometimes called Poincar ́e’spetitiobecause Poincar ́e (1906) advanced itagainst an attempt that had been made to use mathematical induction in thecourse of a justification of the axioms of arithmetic.In its crudest form this objection is easily evaded if we are sufficiently clearabout what we are doing. There is no direct circularity if we presuppose setsinourstudyofsets(orinductioninourstudyofinduction)sincethefirstoccur-rence of the word is in the metalanguage, the second in the object language.Nevertheless, even if this is all that needs to be said to answer Poincar ́e’s ob-jection in the general case, matters are not so straightforward in the case ofa theory that claims to be foundational. If we embed mathematics in set the-ory and treat set theory implicationally, then mathematics — all mathematics— asserts only conditional truths about structures of a certain sort. But ourmetalinguistic study of set-theoretic structures is plainly recognizable as a spe-cies of mathematics. So we have no reason not to suppose that here too thecorrect interpretation of our results is only conditional. At no point, then,will mathematics assert anything unconditionally, and any application of anypart whatever of mathematics that depends on the unconditional existence ofmathematical objects will be vitiated.Thoroughgoing implicationism — the view that mathematics has no sub-ject matter whatever and consists solely of the logical derivation of con-sequences from axioms — is thus a very harsh discipline: many mathem-aticians profess to believe it, but few hold unswervingly to what it entails. Theimplicationist is never entitled, for instance, to assert unconditionally that noproofofacertainpropositionexists, sincethatisageneralizationaboutproofsand must therefore be interpreted as a conditional depending on the axiomsof proof theory. And conversely, the claim that a propositionisprovable isto be interpreted only as saying that according to proof theory it is: a furtherinference is required if we are to deduce from this that there is indeed a proof.One response to this difficulty with taking an implicationist view of set the-ory is to observe that it arises only on the premise that set theory is intendedas a foundation for mathematics. Deny the premise and the objection evap-orates. Recently some mathematicians have been tempted by the idea thatother theories — topos theory or category theory, for example — might bebetter suited to play this foundational role.Maybe so, but of course this move is only a postponement of the problem,notasolution. Thoseinclinedtomakeitwillhavetoaddressjustthesamedif-"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"10Logicficulties in relation to the axioms of whatever foundational theory they favourinstead (cf. Shapiro 1991). Perhaps it is for this reason that some mathem-aticians (e.g. Mayberry 1994) have tried simply to deny that mathematicshasa foundation. But plainly more needs to be said if this is to be anything moresubstantial than an indefinite refusal to address the question.Anotherresponsetothesedifficulties,morepopularamongmathematiciansthan among philosophers, has been to espouse a stricter formalism, a version,that is to say, of the view that the primitive terms of an axiomatic theory referto nothing outside of the theory itself. The crudest version of this doctrine,pure formalism, asserts that mathematics is no more than a game played withsymbols. Frege’s demolition of this view (1893–1903, II, §§86–137) is treatedby most philosophers as definitive. Indeed it has become popular to doubtwhether any of the mathematicians Frege quotes actually held a view so stu-pid. However, there are undoubtedly some mathematicians who claim, whenpressed, to believe it, and many others whose stated views entail it.Less extreme ispostulationism— which I have elsewhere (Potter 2000) calledaxiomatic formalism. This does not regard the sentences of an axiomatictheory as meaningless positions in a game but treats the primitive terms asderiving their meaning from the role they play in the axioms, which may nowbethoughtofasanimplicitdefinitionofthem,tobecontrastedwiththeexplicitdefinitions of the non-primitive terms. ‘The objects of the theory are definedipso factoby the system of axioms, which in some way generate the materialto which the true propositions will be applicable.’ (Cartan 1943, p.9) Thisview is plainly not as daft as pure formalism, but if we are to espouse it, wepresumably need some criterion to determine whether a system of axiomsdoesconfer meaning on its constituent terms. Those who advance this viewagree that no such meaning can be conferred by an inconsistent system, andmanyfromHilbertonhavethoughtthatbareconsistencyissufficienttoconfermeaning, but few have provided any argument for this, and without suchan argument the position remains suspect. Moreover, there is a converseproblem for the postulationist if the axiom system in question is not complete:if the language of arithmetic has its meaning conferred on it by some formaltheoryT, for instance, what explanation can the postulationist give of ourconviction that the G ̈odel sentence ofT, which is expressed in this language,is true?Nevertheless, postulationism, or something very like it, has been popu-lar among mathematicians, at least in relation to those parts of mathemat-ics for which the problem of perpetual conditionalizing noted above makesimplicationism inappropriate. For the great advantage of postulationismover implicationism is that if we are indeed entitled to postulate objects withthe requisite properties, anything we deduce concerning these objects willbe true unconditionally.

Field,admittedly, is ready enough to concede that their position is in one sense ‘theantithesis of platonism’ (1998, p.291), but Balaguer is determined to classifythe view as realist, not formalist, because itsimply doesn’t say that ‘existence and truth amount to nothing more than consist-ency’. Rather it says that all the mathematical objects that logically possibly couldexist actually do exist, and then itfollowsfrom this that all consistent purely mathem-atical theories truly describe some collection of actually existing mathematical objects.(1998, p.191)In order to make full-blooded platonism plausible, however, Balaguer has toconcedethatmathematicaltheorieshaveasubjectmatteronlyinwhathecallsa ‘metaphysically thin’ sense, a sense which makes it wholly unproblematichow we could ‘have beliefs about mathematical objects, or how [we] coulddreamupstoriesaboutsuchobjects’(p.49).

Calling this calculus ‘first-order’ marks that thevariables we use as placeholders in quantified sentences haveobjectsas theirintended range. Very often the variables that occur in mathematical texts areintended to range over only a restricted class of objects, and in order to aidreadability mathematicians commonly press into service all sorts of letters tomark these restrictions:m,n,kfor natural numbers,z,wfor complex num-bers,a,bfor cardinal numbers,G,Hfor groups, etc. In the first two chaptersof this book, however, the first-order variables are intended to be completelyunrestricted,rangingoveranyobjectswhatever,andtosignalthisweshalluseonly the lower-case lettersx,y,z,tand their decorated variantsx\u0002,x\u0002\u0002,x1,x2,etc."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"12LogicFirst-order predicate calculus is thus contrasted with the second-order ver-sion which permits in addition the use of quantified variables ranging overpropertiesof objects.

I have already men-tioned the popularity of the formalist standpoint among mathematicians, andlogicians are not exempt from the temptation. If one formalizes the rules ofinference, it is important nonetheless not to lose sight of the fact that theyremain rules ofinference— rules for reasoning from meaningful premises to"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Schemes13meaningful conclusions.It is undoubtedly significant, however, that a formalization of first-orderlogic is available at all. This marks a striking contrast between the levels oflogic, since in the second-order case only the formation rules are completelyformalizable, not the inference rules: it is a consequence of G ̈odel’s first in-completeness theorem that for each system of formal rules we might proposethere is a second-order logical inference we can recognize as valid which isnot justified by that system of rules.Notice, though, that even if there is some reason to regard formalizabilityas a requirement our logic should satisfy (a question to which we shall re-turn shortly), this does not suffice to pick out first-order logic uniquely, sincethere are other, larger systems with the same property. An elegant theoremdue to Lindstr ̈om (1969) shows that we must indeed restrict ourselves to reas-oning in first-order logic if we require our logic to satisfy in addition theL ̈owenheim/Skolem property that any set of sentences which has a modelhas a countable model. But, as Tharp (1975) has argued, it is hard to see whywe should wish to impose this condition straight off. Tharp attempts insteadto derive it from conditions on the quantifiers of our logic, but fails in turn (itseems to me) to motivate these further conditions satisfactorily.1.3 SchemesBy eschewing the use of second-order variables in the presentation of our the-oryweundoubtedlyfollowcurrentmathematicalfashion,butwetherebylimitseverely the strength of the theories we are able to postulate.

Kreisel (1967a, p.145) has suggested — onwhat evidence it is unclear — that this weakness ‘came as a surprise’ when itwas discovered by logicians in the 1910s and 1920s, but there is a clear sensein which it should not have been in the least surprising, for we shall provelater in this book that if there are infinitely many objects, then (at least on thestandard understanding of the second-order quantifier) there are uncountablymany properties those objects may have. A first-order scheme, on the otherhand, can only have countably many instances (assuming, as we normally do,that the language of the theory is countable). So it is to be expected that thefirst-order theory will assert much less than the second-order one does.So much, then, for the purely formal questions.

The result of this wasthat by the 1960s it had become standard to state mathematical theories infirst-order form using axiom schemes. Since then second-order logic has beenvery little studied by mathematicians (although recently there seems to havebeen renewed interest in it, at least among logicians).So there must have been a powerful reason driving mathematicians to first-order formulations. What was it? We have already noted the apparent fail-ure of attempts to supply plausible constraints on inference which character-ize first-order logic uniquely, but if first- and second-order logic are the onlychoices under consideration, then the question evidently becomes somewhatsimpler, since all we need do is to find a single constraint which the one satis-fiesbutnottheother. Yetevenwhenthequestionissimplifiedinthismanner,itissurprisinglyhardtosayforsurewhatmotivatedmathematicianstochoosefirst-order over second-order logic, as the texts one might expect to give reas-ons for the choice say almost nothing about it.Very influential on this subject among philosophers (at least in America)was Quine: he argued that the practice of substituting second-order variablesfor predicates is incoherent, because quantified variables ought to substitute,as in the first-order case, for names; and he queried whether there is a well-understood domain of entities (properties, attributes or whatever) that theycan be taken to refer to. Now Quine’s criticisms are not very good — for apersuasive demolition see Boolos 1975 — but in any case they are evidentlynot of the sort that would have influenced mathematicians even if they hadread them.A more likely influence is Bourbaki (1954), who adopted a version of first-order logic. It is unquestionable that Bourbaki’s works were widely read bymathematicians, in contrast to Quine’s: Birkhoff (1975), for instance, recallsthat their ‘systematic organization and lucid style mesmerized a whole gen-eration of American graduate students’. But the mere fact that Bourbakiadopted a first-order formulation certainly cannot be the whole of an ex-planation: many other features of Bourbaki’s logical system (his use of Hil-bert’sε-operator, for instance, or his failure to adopt the axiom of foundation)"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The choice of logic17sank without trace. What may have influenced many mathematicians was thephilosophyofmathematicswhichledBourbakitoadoptafirst-orderformula-tion of his system. This philosophy has at its core a conception of rigour thatis essentially formalist in character. In an unformalized mathematical text, hesays,one is exposed to the danger of faulty reasoning arising from, for example, incor-rect use of intuition or argument by analogy. In practice, the mathematician whowishes to satisfy himself of the perfect correctness or ‘rigour’ of a proof or a theoryhardly ever has recourse to one or another of the complete formalizations availablenowadays...In general, he is content to bring the exposition to a point where his ex-perience and mathematical flair tell him that translation into formal language wouldbe no more than an exercise of patience (though doubtless a very tedious one). If,as happens again and again, doubts arise as to the correctness of the text under con-sideration, they concern ultimately the possibility of translating it unambiguously intosuch a formalized language: either because the same word has been used in differentsenses according to the context, or because the rules of syntax have been violated bythe unconscious use of modes of argument which they do not specifically authorize.Apart from this last possibility, the process of rectification, sooner or later, invariablyconsists in the construction of texts which come closer and closer to a formalized textuntil, in the general opinion of mathematicians, it would be superfluous to go anyfurther in this direction. In other words, the correctness of a mathematical text is veri-fied by comparing it, more or less explicitly, with the rules of a formalized language.(Bourbaki 1954, Introduction)This conception of the formalism as an ultimate arbiter of rigour has cer-tainly been influential among mathematicians.I think there is clear evidence that the way in which doubts (about a piece of math-ematics) are resolved is that the doubtful notions or inferences are refined and cla-rified to the point where they can be taken as proofs and definitions from existingnotions, within some first order theory (which may be intuitionistic, non-classical, orcategory-theoretical, but in mainstream mathematics is nowadays usually some partof set theory, at least in the final analysis). (Drake 1989, p.11)The attraction of this view is that in principle it reduces the question of thecorrectness of a purported proof to a purely mechanical test. Adopting afully formalized theory thus has the effect of corralling mathematics in such away that nothing within its boundary is open to philosophical dispute. Thisseems to be the content of the observation, which crops up repeatedly in themathematical literature, that mathematicians are platonists on weekdays andformalistsonSundays: ifamathematicalproblemisrepresentedasamountingto the question whether a particular sentence is a theorem of a certain formalsystem, then it is certainly well-posed, so the mathematician can get on withthe business of solving the problem and leave it to philosophers to say what itssignificance is.On foundations we believe in the reality of mathematics, but of course when philo-sophers attack us with their paradoxes we rush behind formalism and say: ‘Mathem-"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"18Logicatics is just a combination of meaningless symbols.’ ...

For G ̈odel’s incompleteness theorem shows that no formal-ism encompasses all the reasoning we would be disposed to regard as correct;and even if we restrict ourselves to a fixed first-order formal theory, G ̈odel’scompleteness theorem shows only that what is formally provable coincidesextensionallywith what follows from the axioms (see Kreisel 1980, pp.161–2).The role the formal rules play in actual reasoning is in fact somewhatopaque, and indeed the authors of Bourbaki were uncomfortably aware ofthis even as they formulated the view just quoted: the minutes of their meet-ings report that Chevalley, one of the members involved in writing the text-books, ‘was assigned to mask this as unhypocritically as possible in the generalintroduction’ (Corry 1996, pp.319–20). At the beginning of the text proper(Bourbaki 1954) they state a large number of precise rules for the syntacticmanipulationofstringsofsymbols, butthen, havingstatedthem, immediatelyrevert to informal reasoning. So ‘the evidence of the proofs in the main textdepends on anunderstoodnotion of logical inference’ (Kreisel 1967b, p.210),not on the precise notion defined by the formal specification of syntax. Atthe time they were writing the book, this was a matter of straightforward ne-cessity: they realized that to formalize even simple mathematical argumentsusing the formalism they had chosen would take too long to be feasible. Theyseriously under-estimated justhowlong, though: they claimed that the num-berofcharactersintheunabbreviatedtermforthecardinalnumber1intheirformal system was ‘several tens of thousands’ (Bourbaki 1956, p.55), but theactual number is about 1012(Mathias 2002). Only much more recently has itbecome possible to contemplate using computers to check humanly construc-ted mathematical arguments against formal norms of correctness; but this isstill no more than an ongoing research project, and even if it is carried outsuccessfully, it will remain unclear why the fact that a proof can be formalizedshould be regarded as acriterionof its correctness.1.5 Definite descriptionsIfΦ(x)is a formula, let us abbreviate(∀y)(Φ(y)⇔x=y)asΦ!(x). Theformula(∃x)Φ!(x)is then written(∃!x)Φ(x)and read ‘There exists a uniquexsuch thatΦ(x)’. Strictly speaking, though, this definition ofΦ!(x)is unsatis-factory as it stands.

This sort of collision of variables is an irritating feature of quantifiedlogic which we shall ignore from now on. We shall assume whenever we usea variable that it is chosen so that it does not collide with any of the othervariables we are using: this is always possible, since the number of variablesoccurring in any given formula is finite whereas the number of variables wecan create is unlimited. (We can add primes toxindefinitely to obtainx\u0002,x\u0002\u0002,etc.).IfΦ(x)is a formula, then we shall use the expressionι!xΦ(x), which is read‘thexsuch thatΦ(x)’, to refer to the unique object which isΦif there is one,andtonothingotherwise.

We shall use lower-caseGreek letters such asσ,τ, etc. to stand for arbitrary terms; if the termσdepends on the variablesx1,...,xn, then we can write itσ(x1,...,xn)tohighlight that fact.

Thesame is not true of definite descriptions: consider for example the descriptionι!x(x\u0007=x). In general,ι!xΦ(x)exists iff(∃!x)Φ(x). We adopt the conventionthat ifσandτare terms, the equationσ=τis to be read as meaning ‘If oneofσandτexists, then they both do and they are equal’.Because definitions are formally just ways of introducing abbreviations, thequestion of their correctness is simply one of whether they enable us mech-anically and unambiguously to eliminate the expression being defined fromevery formula in which it occurs; the correctness in this sense of the defini-tions in this book will always (I hope) be trivially apparent. (The question oftheir psychological potency is of course quite a different matter.)The things for which definitions introduce abbreviations will be either for-mulae or terms. If they are terms, then apart from their formal correctness(i.e. unambiguous eliminability) there is the question of the existence of ob-jects for them to refer to. It is not wrong to use terms which do not denoteanything; but it may be misleading, since the rules of logic are not the samefor them as they are for ones which do. (For example, the move fromΦ(σ)to(∃x)Φ(x)is fallacious ifσdoes not exist.) So the introduction of a newsymbol to abbreviate a term will sometimes be accompanied by a justificationto show that this term denotes something; if no such justification is provided,the reason may well be that the justification in question is completely trivial."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"20LogicNotesThe logical spine of this book will be the informal exposition of a particularaxiomatic theory. No knowledge of metalogic is needed in order to followthat exposition, but only what Bourbaki famously called ‘a certain capacityfor abstract thought’. The commentary that surrounds this spine, which aimsto flesh out the exposition by means of various more or less philosophical re-flections on its intended content, does occasionally allude to a few metalogicalresults, however. Most readers will no doubt be familiar with these already,but those who are not will find enough for current purposes in the enjoyablyopinionated sketch by Hodges (1983): they should pay special attention to thelimitative results such as the L ̈owenheim/Skolem theorems and the existenceof non-standard models of first-order theories.I have cautioned against regarding formalizability as acriterionof the cor-rectness of mathematical reasoning. Nonetheless it is of considerable import-ance to note that the theory which forms the spine of this book is capableof formalization as a first-order theory, since it is this that ensures the ap-plicability to it of the metalogical results just alluded to. Implicit through-out the discussion, therefore, will be the distinction between object languageand metalanguage, and the related distinction between use and mention. Al-though I have promised to ignore these distinctions whenever it aids readab-ility to do so, it is important to be aware of them: Quine (1940, §§4–6) offersa bracing lecture on this subject.Goldfarb (1979) illuminates the context for the rise to dominance of first-orderlogicwithoutreallyattemptinganexplanationforit.

Commit yourself to their existence all together or one at atime, it’s the same commitment either way.

In general, if you are already committed to some things, youincur no further commitment when you affirm the existence of their fusion. The newcommitment is redundant, given the old one. (Lewis 1991, pp.81–2)Acollection,bycontrast,doesnotmerelylumpseveralobjectstogetherintoone: it keeps the things distinct and is a further entity over and above them.Various metaphors have been used to explain this — a collection is a sackcontaining its members, a lasso around them, an encoding of them — butnone is altogether happy.1We need to be aware straightaway, therefore, thatcollections are metaphysically problematic entities if they are entities at all,and need to be handled with care.The contrast between collections and fusions becomes explicit when weconsider the notion of membership. This is fundamental to our conception ofacollectionasconsistingofitsmembers, butitgetsnogripatallonthenotionofafusion. Thefusionofthecardsinapackismadeupoutofjustthosecards,but they cannot be said to be its members, since it is also made up out of thefour suits. A collection has a determinate number of members, whereas afusion may be carved up into parts in various equally valid (although perhapsnot equally interesting) ways.The distinction between collections and fusions is at its starkest when weconsider the trivial case of a single object such as my goldfish Bubble. ThecollectionwhoseonlymemberisBubbleisusuallycalledasingletonandwritten{Bubble}. It is not the same object as Bubble, since it has exactly one member(Bubble), whereas Bubble itself, being a goldfish, does not have any membersat all. The fusion of Bubble, by contrast, is just Bubble itself, no more and noless.And what if we try to make something out of nothing? A container withnothing in it is still a container, and the empty collection is correspondinglya collection with no members. But a fusion of nothing is an impossibility: ifwe try to form a fusion when there is nothing to fuse, we obtain not a trivialobject but no object at all.Thedistinctionbetweencollectionsandfusions, andthecorrespondingonebetween membership and inclusion, were not clearly drawn until the end ofthe 19th century. In textbooks the distinction between membership and in-clusion is sometimes attributed to Peano, who introduced different notationsfor the two concepts in 1889, §4.

A year later (1890, p.192) he did indeed introduce a notation todistinguish between a setband the singleton{b}(which he denotedιb), buthis motivation for this was somewhat quaint: ‘Let us decompose the sign =into its two partsisandequal to; the wordisis already denoted by\u0005; let usalso denote the expressionequal toby a sign, and letι(the first letter ofισoς)bethat sign; thus instead ofa=bone can writea\u0005ιb.’ Evidently, then, Peano’smotivation was overwhelmingly notational. The language of classes was forhim, atthisstageat least, justthat—a language—andthereis littleevidencethat he conceived of classes as entities in their own right.It seems in fact to be Frege who deserves credit for having first laid out theproperties of fusions clearly. A fusion, he said, ‘consists of objects; it is anaggregate, a collective unity, of them; if so it must vanish when these objectsvanish. If we burn down all the trees of a wood, we thereby burn down thewood. Thus there can be no empty fusion.’ (1895, pp.436–7, modified) Butthe work Frege was reviewing when he made this remark (Schr ̈oder 1890–5)was very influential for a time: it gave rise to a tradition in logic which can betraced through to the 1920s. And it was plainly fusions, not collections, thatDedekind had in mind inWas sind und was sollen die Zahlen?when he avoidedthe empty set and used the same symbol for membership and inclusion (1888,nos.2–3) — two tell-tale signs of a mereological conception. He drafted anemendation adopting the collection-theoretic conception only much later (seeSinaceur 1973).Given the early popularity of fusions, then, it is striking how complete andhow quick the mathematical community’s conversion to collections was. Inpractical terms it was no doubt of great significance that Zermelo chose col-lections, not fusions, as the subject of his axiomatization in 1908b. And thedistinctions which mereology elides, such as that between the cards in a packand the suits, are ones which mathematicians frequently wish to make: sotalk of collections has something to recommend it over talk of fusions, wheremathematics is concerned. But this cannot be the whole explanation: as inthe parallel case of first- and second-order logic that we noted earlier, moreremains to be said.2.2 MembershipCollections,unlikefusions,canalwaysbecharacterizeddeterminatelybytheirmembership. In our formalism we shall therefore treat the relation of mem-bership as primitive. In other words, the language of the theory of collectionshas in it as a non-logical primitive a binary relation symbol ‘∈’. The formula‘x∈y’ is read ‘xbelongs toy’."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"24CollectionsBut of course we must not lose sight of the fact that the theory of collectionsis of no use in itself: its point is to let us talk aboutotherthings. We shall notmake any presuppositions here about what those other things are. We shallsimply assume that we start with a theoryTabout them. We shall call theobjects in the domain of interpretation ofTindividuals. Some other authorscall them ‘atoms’, and many, in tribute to the dominance of German writersin the development of the subject, call them ‘Urelemente’ (literally ‘originalelements’). Before we start talking about collections, we need to ensure thatwe do not unthinkingly treat the claims made byTabout the individuals as ifthey applied to collections. (IfTwere a formalization of Newtonian mech-anics, for instance, we would not want to find ourselves claiming withoutargument that collections are subject to just the same physical laws as theirmembers.) To ring-fence the individuals, then, we introduce a predicate U(x)to mean thatxis an individual, and we relativize all the axioms ofTto U.That is to say, we replace every universal quantifier ‘(∀x)...’ in an axiomofTwith ‘(∀x)(U(x)⇒...)’ and every existential quantifier ‘(∃x)...’ with‘(∃x)(U(x)and...)’; and for every constant ‘a’ in the language ofTwe addU(a)as a new axiom.Having relativizedTto the individuals in this manner, we are now in aposition to introduce the central idea of thecollectionof objects satisfying apropertyΦ.Definition.IfΦ(x)is a formula, the termι!y(notU(y)and(∀x)(x∈y⇔Φ(x)))is abbreviated{x:Φ(x)}and read ‘the collection of allxsuch thatΦ(x)’.In words:{x:Φ(x)}, if it exists, is the unique non-individual whose ele-ments are precisely the objects satisfyingΦ. We shall also use variantsof this notation adapted to different circumstances: for instance, we of-ten write{x∈a:Φ(x)}instead of{x:x∈aandΦ(x)}; we write{y}for{x:x=y},{y,z}for{x:x=yorx=z}, etc.; and we write{σ(x):Φ(x)}for{y:(∃x)(y=σ(x)andΦ(x))}. The objects satisfyingΦare said to beelementsormembersof{x:Φ(x)}; they may, but need not, be individuals. The collec-tion{x:Φ(x)}, on the other hand, is constrained by definition not to be anindividual.(2.2.1)Lemma.IfΦ(x)is a formula such thata={x:Φ(x)}exists, then(∀x)(x∈a⇔Φ(x)).Proof. This follows at once from the definition.It would, I suppose, have been more accurate to call this a ‘lemma scheme’,since it cannot be formalized as a single first-order proposition but has to bethought of as describing a whole class of such propositions.

One of the matters that will interest us is to tryto settle which properties are collectivizing: not all of them can be, for thatsupposition rapidly leads to a contradiction.(2.3.1)Russell’s paradox (absolute version).{x:x/∈x}does not exist.Proof. Suppose thata={x:x/∈x}exists. Then(∀x)(x∈a⇔x/∈x)[lemma 2.2.1]. Therefore in particulara∈a⇔a/∈a. Contradiction.The first thing to notice about this result is that we have proved it beforestatinganyaxioms for our theory. This serves to emphasize that Russell’sparadox is not a challenge to, or refutation of, any one theory of collections,but a feature that has to be taken account of inanysuch theory. It is worthnoting, too, how elementary is the logic that is used to derive the paradox.Thatisnottosay,ofcourse,thattheparadoxisderivableinanylogicalsystemwhatever. By the simple device of writing out the proof in full we could nodoubtidentifyarestrictedlogicwhichblocksitsderivation.

Nor was thesad appendix which Frege added to the second volume of theGrundgesetzethefirst reference in print to a paradox of this kind: Hilbert referred in his (1900)lecture on the problems of mathematics to ‘the system of all cardinal numbersor even ofallCantor’s alephs, for which, as may be shown, a consistent sys-tem of axioms cannot be set up’. What is particularly striking about Russell’s"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"26Collectionsparadox, however, is that it is in essence more purely logical than the others:for any binary relationRit is a first-order logical truth thatnot(∃y)(∀x)(xRy⇔notxRx).By contrast, the other set-theoretic paradoxes involve cardinal or ordinalnumbers in some way.2Curiously, Hilbert described these other paradoxes(in a letter to Frege) as ‘even more convincing’: it is not clear why.2.4 Is it a paradox?A paradox is a fact which is contrary to expectation (from the Greekπαρα+δoξα,‘beyondexpectation’). WhetherRussell’sresultisaparadoxpresumablydepends on how one understands the notion of a collection. It was certainly asurprise to Frege to be told that one of the axioms of his formal system led tocontradiction, but what he was trying to capture was probably not the notionof a collection but a notion more closely connected to logic which we shallhere call aclass. So although there was undoubtedly a serious flaw in Frege’sunderstanding (a flaw which we shall discuss in appendix B), that does not yetgive us any reason to think that the flaw infects the notion of a collection.Indeed it is quite common nowadays to find books presenting the notionof a collection in such a way that what Russell discovered appears not to bea paradox at all, but rather something we should have expected all along.However,thisPanglossianviewshouldbetreatedwithalittlescepticism,sinceeven if all parties now agree that there is a coherent notion of collection, theydo not yet seem to agree on what it is.In any case, the idea that the paradoxes are not really so paradoxical ifwe only think about them in the right way is hard to find in print beforeG ̈odel(1944)anddidnotbecomewidespreaduntilmuchlater. In1940Quinethought the paradoxes ‘were implicit in the inferential methods of uncriticalcommon sense’ (1940, p.166) and as late as 1951 he could still assert that‘common sense is bankrupt for it wound up in contradiction. Deprived of histradition, the logician has had to resort to myth-making.’ (1951, p.153) Evennow there are still many who would agree with him (e.g. Weir 1998a).It is also worth being cautious about the significance of the set-theoreticparadoxes for the foundations of mathematics. The 30 years following theirdiscovery are often referred to as the period of the crisis of foundations, butit is not obvious that they deserve this title. Certainly there was a crisis inthe foundations ofset theory, but even here many mathematicians continuedto work informally in ways that did not depend on one resolution or other of2We shall look at the technicalities of these other paradoxes in later sections when we havedefined the notions of cardinal and ordinal numbers on which they depend."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Indefinite extensibility27the paradoxes: Hausdorff’s (1914) textbook on set theory, for example, barelymentions them. And there is no reason to regard even this as a crisis in thefoundationsofmathematicsmoregenerallyunlessonealreadyacceptstheset-theoretic reduction of mathematics; but in advance of a satisfying resolutionof the paradoxes the more natural reaction would be simply to treat them asa refutation of the possibility of such a reduction.There is nonetheless a more general threat which the set-theoretic para-doxes have sometimes been interpreted as presenting, namely that the canonsof reasoning which we ‘naively’ (i.e. pre-theoretically) find compelling are infact contradictory. Those who have argued this have not, however, agreed onwhat follows from it. One moral, favoured by the more logically inclined, isthatascommonsensecanleadusastray,weshouldnottrustitbutrelyinsteadon the outputs of a formal system; but others (e.g. Priest 1995; Restall 1992)havethoughtinsteadthatweshouldlearntoacceptthatcommonsense(whichis in the end all we have) is inevitably contradictory — learn, in short, to tol-erate contradictions.Now this last issue is to some extent tangential to the concerns of this book,sinceitdoesnotariseonlyinrelationtotheset-theoreticparadoxes: themoralthat common sense is contradictory could just as well have been drawn froma consideration of the liar paradox or the paradox of the unexpected hanging.So it is hard to see why this is any more pressing an issue for set theorists thanfor anyone engaged in rational argument. I shall therefore confine myselfhere to recording my faith in tutored common sense as a tool for deductivereasoning, and continue to make free use of this tool in what follows.But even if the set-theoretic paradoxes are notuniquelytroubling, they aretroubling nevertheless: simply saying that we ought never to have expectedany property whatever to be collectivizing, even if true, leaves us well short ofan account which will settle which properties are collectivizing and which arenot. What we must do if we are to achieve this last objective is evidently torefine our conception of what a collection is, and it will be a large part of thetask of this book to explore the prospects for a satisfactory resolution of theparadoxes by this means.2.5 Indefinite extensibilityOne idea that has cropped up repeatedly (e.g. Lear 1977; Dummett 1993) isthat it is central to the correct resolution of the paradoxes to limit ourselves tointuitionistic logic, i.e. to forswear the law of the excluded middle as a generalprinciple applicable to any proposition that concerns collections. It needs tobe emphasized straightaway that this proposal does not belong to the class wementioned earlier of attempts to resolve the paradoxes simply by weakeningthe logic while clinging onto the naive view that every property is collect-"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"28Collectionsivizing. The argument we gave in §2.3 to show that the property of non-self-membership is not collectivizing makes no use of excluded middle and istherefore intuitionistically valid. So the intuitionistic reasoner is barred fromthe naive view just as firmly as the classicist.3A rejection of intuitionistic logic when reasoning about collections cantherefore only be one part of a resolution of the paradoxes and not the whole.It is unsurprising, therefore, that most of the arguments that may be given forthis are intimately linked to particular conceptions of what a collection is. Forthis reason we shall at present confine ourselves to exploring one argument,due to Dummett, which does not on its face depend on any particular con-ception. His argument is that the correct logic to use when reasoning aboutwhat he calls an indefinitely extensible concept is intuitionistic. He takes theparadoxes to show that the concept of a collection is indefinitely extensible,but this is not, according to him, the only example. So his argument would,if correct, lead to intuitionism in a variety of spheres of discourse, of whichmathematics is only the most prominent.But not in all. Although indefinite extensibility is endemic in mathemat-ics and logic, Dummett is not claiming that it infects our ordinary sublunarydiscourse. According to Heck (1993, p.233), this isanewargument for intuitionism, quite different in character from the meaning-theoretic arguments for which Dummett is well known. It is a local argument foranti-realism about mathematics, one which depends upon considerations peculiarlymathematical in character; it therefore has not the propensity to generalize which themeaning-theoretic arguments have.In one respect Heck is not quite right: the argument was not in fact newwhen Dummett presented it in 1991 but can already be found in his earlierwritings, for instance in 1973, pp.529–30 and 568–9. Whatisnew in hispublications of the 1990s is rather his conception of how this local argumentforintuitionisminmathematicsisrelatedtotheglobalconsiderationstowhichHeck alludes. What has changed is that Dummett no longer imagines that awhollygeneralargumentfromconsiderationsofmeaningcoulddeliveraglobalanti-realism — a reason, that is to say, to abandon classical logictout court.Instead he now sees these considerations as doing no more than provide ascheme whose instances are the outlines of arguments for anti-realism localto particular spheres of discourse. How such an outline is to be fleshed outwill then depend on parochial features of the sphere of discourse in question.What this framework does, therefore, is permit us to see Dummett’s ‘new’3The reason this needs some emphasis is that one commonly finds the argument establishingRussell’s paradox expressed as a dilemma: the collectionaeither belongs to itself or not, buteither supposition leads to contradiction. Put like this, the argument does indeed depend on thelaw of the excluded middle; but as we have seen, this is not the only way to put it."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Indefinite extensibility29argument for intuitionism as indicating a way in which the outline argumentcan be fleshed out in the case where the sphere of discourse is mathematics.What, then, is Dummett’s argument? As I have suggested, Dummett usu-allyarguesviaanintermediatestage. Firsthepresentsananalysisofthefailureof a concept to be collectivizing as owing to itsindefinite extensibility. Then heargues that the correct logic to use in any reasoning that involves quantifica-tion over the range of an indefinitely extensible concept is intuitionistic. Letus consider these two stages of Dummett’s argument in turn.The first stage, the analysis of collectivization failure as due to indefiniteextensibility, was originated not by Dummett but by Russell, who as early as1906bcalled such propertiesself-reproductive. A property is self-reproductive orindefinitely extensible if, ‘given any class of terms all having [the] property,we can always define a new term also having the property’ (Russell 1973a,p.144). More precisely, a propertyFis indefinitely extensible if there is aprocess which, when applied to someFs, gives rise to another object which isnot among them but is nevertheless anF.As an analysis of the known paradoxes, this is quite persuasive. Not onlyRussell’s paradox but others we shall come across later, such as Burali-Forti’s(§11.2),canwithouttoomuchdistortionbeputintoaformwherebywhattheyexhibit is that a certain property — the one whose instances we are attempt-ing to collect — is indefinitely extensible in Dummett’s sense. It is less clear,though, what reason there is to think thatanynon-collectivizing property willbe indefinitely extensible. We might well think that vagueness is a second,distinct reason why some collections — the collection of balding men, or ofshort words — fail to exist. If we exclude vague properties byfiat, we have,of course, an inductive argument for the claim, since, as just observed, all theproofs we have found so far of failure to collectivize go via indefinite extensib-ility; but we can hardly regard that as compelling, especially since some of theparadoxes did not arise independently but were discovered by analysing theformsofargumentemployedinthosealreadyknown: ifthereisaset-theoreticparadox that is not analysable in terms of indefinite extensibility, then by thenature of the case it involves a wholly new idea, and we plainly have little ideain advance how likely this is to occur.Notice, too, that even if we agree that the failure to collectivize is alwaysa result of indefinite extensibility, the route from there via Dummett’s secondclaim to his conclusion — that indefinite extensibility leads to the abandon-ment of classical logic in all mathematical reasoning — depends on some sortof set-theoretic reductionism. For that reason, perhaps, Dummett has alsoattempted to argue directly (i.e. independent of any such reduction) that in-definite extensibility is a feature not just of the conceptsetbut ofnatural numberandreal number. These direct arguments are problematic, but this is not theplace to discuss them. Instead let us move on to Dummett’s second mainclaim, namely that the correct logic to use when reasoning about the range of"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"30Collectionsan indefinitely extensible concept is intuitionistic and not classical.It is no exaggeration to say that commentators have found Dummett’s ar-gument for this claim obscure. Boolos (1993), Clark (1993a; 1998), Oliver(1998) and Wright (1999) are among those who have struggled to understandit. At times the argument has seemed to centre on the idea that indefiniteextensibility is a species of vagueness, and this has understandably puzzledcommentators, since it is hard to see how the paradoxes lend encouragementto the thought that it is vague which objects are sets.What seems most likely is that Dummett’s failure to articulate clearly whyindefinite extensibility should lead inexorably to intuitionism is explained bythelevelofgeneralityatwhichtheargumentiscouched.

Weshould therefore return to this issue once we have fleshed out in more detailsome strategies for resolving the paradoxes.2.6 CollectionsWe have defined ‘collection of...’,butnot‘collection’ on its own. The naiveidea is that collections are precisely objects of the form{x:Φ(x)}for someformulaΦ(x);butthisdoesnotworkundertheformalrestrictionsweimposedon ourselves in chapter 1 (since the phrase ‘for some formula’ is not first-order).

A collection of collections is said to bepairwise disjointif every pair ofthem is disjoint, i.e. if no object belongs to more than one of them.One feature of these definitions needs to be stressed, though: no claim isbeing made yet that the terms we are introducing denote anything. For thisreason they should be treated with caution. For example, we cannot evenprove yet that two collectionsaandbare disjoint if and only ifa∩b=Øsince the latter statement is trivially true if it happens that neithera∩bnor Øexists, whether or notaandbare disjoint.NotesThe theory of fusions has been almost totally neglected by mathematiciansover the last century. Interest has been somewhat greater among philosoph-ers and philosophical logicians: Lesniewski’s studies (see Fraenkel, Bar-Hilleland Levy 1958, pp.200ff.) led to work by Lejewski (1964), Henry (1991) andothers, as well as to a calculus of individuals (Leonard and Goodman 1940)of particular interest to nominalist metaphysicians. But the target of this workhasbeendifferent. Verylittleinvestigationhasbeendoneintotheadequacyofthe theory of fusions as a foundation for mathematics. Indeed the collection-theoretic way of thinking is so entrenched among mathematicians that it is"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Notes33easy for them to forget how natural it is to think of a line, say, as the sum of itspoints rather than as the collection of them.Some of the resolutions of the paradoxes that have been attempted placerestrictions on the principle of extensionality. The reason we shall not givesuch resolutions house room here is that according to the approach we haveadopted, which takes extensionality as a definition, they are guilty of simplychanging the subject: whatever else it is, a theory which denies extensionalityis not a theory ofcollections. This view is widely shared: Boolos (1971, p.230),for example, hesitates to call extensionality analytic of the concept set onlybecause of Quinean doubts as to whetheranythingis analytic.The other kind of solution we shall devote no space to is that which retainsnaive comprehension. The difficulty this strategy faces is encapsulated in thefact noted earlier that Russell’s paradox arises directly from the sentencenot(∃y)(∀x)(xRy⇔notxRx),which is both a classical and an intuitionistic logical truth. A solution to theparadoxes which clings onto naive comprehension will therefore have to beone which makes this not a logical truth. A valiant attempt to motivate thisdesperate strategy is made by Weir (1998b; 1999).However,thereisarespectabletraditioninthesubjectthatdeniestheexist-ence of a hierarchical notion of collection and recognizes only fusions. Frege,for instance, drew the distinction between the two notions precisely in ordertodeny the coherence of the first. Russell similarly found the empty collectionand singletons problematic. More recently, Lewis (1991) has investigated atlength the idea of splitting the notion of collectionhood into two parts: themereological notion of fusion and the distinctively collection-theoretic opera-tion of singleton formation. Lewis thus claims only to isolate the metaphysicalproblem, not to solve it, since he purports to be mystified as to what this lastoperation could be. I have questioned elsewhere (1993) whether he has loc-ated the difficulty correctly, and there remains a doubt in any case whetherthe relation of inclusion between collections can be assimilated to the mere-ological relation of part to whole (see Oliver 1994)."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Chapter 3The hierarchyIn the last chapter we encountered the fact that some properties, such as non-self-membership, are not collectivizing (i.e. do not give rise to collections). Idiscouraged the notion that this is particularly surprising in itself, but I didnot provide a diagnosis. Now that we have the task of selecting axioms thatcharacterize some properties as collectivizing, we need to consider the matterin more detail.3.1 Two strategiesWe can distinguish two broad strategies that have guided realists in formulat-ing axiomatizations not just of the concept of a collection but of many othernotionsinmathematics: Ishallcallthesestrategiestheregressiveandtheintuitive.The regressive strategy takes the purpose of the theory to be the formationof a theoretical foundation for mathematics and regards an axiomatic baseas successful if it is strong enough to generate as theorems those results wealready believe on other grounds to be true, but not so strong as to provethose we believe to be false. ‘The attitude is frankly pragmatic; one curesthe visible symptoms [of the paradoxes] but neither diagnoses nor attacks theunderlying disease.’ (Weyl 1949, p.231)Accordingtothisview,then,theobjectofagoodaxiomatizationistoretainas many as possible of the naive set-theoretic arguments which we rememberwith nostalgia from our days in Cantor’s paradise, but to stop just short ofpermitting those arguments which lead to paradox. ‘There is at this pointnothing left for us to do but to proceed in the opposite direction and, startingfromsettheoryasitishistoricallygiven, toseekouttheprinciplesrequiredforestablishing the foundations of this mathematical discipline.’ (Zermelo 1908b,p.261) Note that we can make use of the regressive method only if we have aprior commitment to some species of realism, since it enjoins us to assess theplausibility of a putative axiom on the basis of whether it has consequenceswealreadybelieve to be true.

Thus, for example, when Bourbaki (1949a, p.3) says that absence ofcontradiction is to be regarded ‘as an empirical fact rather than as a meta-physical principle’, it is not immediately obvious whether this is a regressiveor a formalist remark.But although the adoption of the regressive method is quite distinct fromformalism, it shares many of its disadvantages. For one thing, the security ofa theory that is justified by either method seems to depend on no more thanits failure so far to lead to contradiction.During the 40 years since we have formulated with sufficient precision the axioms of[set theory] and drawn their consequences in the most varied branches of mathemat-ics, we have never come across a contradiction, and we are entitled to hope that onewill never be produced. (Bourbaki 1954, p.8)Of course, it is impossible to deny that the century which has elapsed withouta contradiction being found is psychologically influential in engendering con-fidence in the system. But this can scarcely be regarded as amounting to verymuch. The claim that the system is formally consistent is in principle refut-able simply by exhibiting a proof of a contradiction in it. But mathematiciansroutinely use only a tiny fragment of the generality permitted by the theory,anditwouldpresumablyonlybebypushingthetheorytoitslimitsthatacon-tradiction could be obtained. So the lapse of time can contribute significantlyto confidence only if attempts are being made to produce such a refutation: Iknow of no such attempts.It may be significant that the position is different for certain other theories,notably Quine’sNF(1937) andML(1940): the emphasis on syntactic analysisin the studies which have been undertaken of Quine’s systems is no doubt tosome extent a consequence of the syntactic paradox-barring which motivatedthem, but the question of their consistency is nonetheless regarded by manymathematicians as having a genuinely open character that the correspondingquestion forZFdoes not share.1Asecond, andevenmoreserious, difficultywhichtheregressivemethodin-herits from formalism is that it seems powerless to justify a theory that aspiresto be epistemologically foundational, since it depends on our havinganother1One might wonder whether it is coincidental thatMLwas contradictory as initially formulated(Rosser 1942) and needed emendation to reach its current form."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"36The hierarchymethod already available to us for assessing the truth or falsity of our axio-matictheory’sconsequences.

We shall consider it in §13.5. In the meantime we shall focus onanother possible motivation based on the idea that there is a fundamental re-lation of presupposition, priority or, as we shall usually say,dependencebetweencollections. The conception of the theory it gives rise to is now known as theiterativeconception. In contrast with the limitation of size conception, it took alongtimetoemerge. ItisnotmentioneddirectlyinRussell’s(1906a)discussionof possible solutions to the paradoxes, and the writings of the 1920s supply nomore than glimmerings of it. However, in an attempt to make the history ofthe subject read more like an inevitable convergence upon the one true reli-gion,someauthorshavetriedtofindevidenceoftheiterativeconceptionquitefar back in the history of the subject. Wang, for instance, says rather implaus-ibly that it is ‘close to Cantor’s original idea’ (1974, p.187) and seems con-vinced (p.193) that it is implicit in Zermelo’s 1908b, an article which makesno mention of it at all. Traces of the idea are to be found in Bernays (1935,p.55),whichrefersto‘iteratingtheuseofthequasi-combinatorialconceptofafunction and adding methods of collection’, although it is perhaps a little gen-erous of Wang to claim that Bernays here ‘develops and emphasizes’ (1974,p.187) the iterative conception. It is popular for modern writers to locate theiterative conception in Zermelo (1930), but for reasons that I will explain be-low (§3.9) I am sceptical about this. It is not really until G ̈odel (1947) thatwe find a clear description of one version of the iterative conception in print(although G ̈odel mentioned it in lectures several times in the 1930s). Even"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Construction37then it was slow to catch on: there is no mention of the iterative conceptionin Bourbaki (1954), for example, and as late as (1971, p.218n.) Boolos couldremark that although it is well known among logicians, ‘authors of set theorytextseitheromititorrelegateittobackpages;philosophers,inthemain,seemunaware of it’.It is only quite recently, then, that the idea has emerged of deriving ourconception of collections from a relation of dependence between them. Whenwe come to consider the properties of this relation, we have to distinguishcarefullytheratherdifferentunderstandingofitprovidedbytheconstructivistand the platonist.For the constructivist a collection depends on the objects from which it isformed. This gives us, at least in outline, a criterion for the existence of a col-lection: it is possible to construct a collection if and only if the objects which itpresupposesareavailable. Presumably, then, therelationofdependencemustbe transitive and irreflexive: no object can be used in its own construction.Moreover, the construction of a collection is supposed by the constructivistto take place in thought, and we might take this to imply that the relation ofdependenceiswell-founded—that,inotherwords,dependencemusttermin-ate eventually. The argument for this is presumably something to do with ourconception of what it amounts to (at any rate for a finite being) to understandsomething.But if the structural properties the constructivist’s relation of dependencewould need to have are tolerably clear, it is far less clear what the relationshould be. The objects a collection depends on are, we might say, those thatwe require in order to construct it. But which are they?In the case of a finite collection, all we need, at least in principle, are itsmembers. The same might also be said of a countable collection if we permitsupertasks, i.e. tasks which can be performed an infinite number of times ina finite period by the device of speeding up progressively (so that successiveperformances might take 1 second,1/2second,1/4second, etc., and the su-pertask would be complete in 2 seconds). But there seems to be little hope ofextending this idea to the uncountable case (see §11.1).Whatweneedingeneralisamethodforcomprehendinginfinitecollectionsby means of something that is finite and hence capable of being grasped by afinite mind, namely the property which the members of the collection satisfy.Moreover, if this property involves other objects, they too might be presup-posedbycollectionscomprehendedinthisway. Butwhatdoes‘involve’meanhere? One natural answer would be that a property expressed by a formulaΦ(x)involves all the objects in the range of the quantifiers occurring inΦ.The suggestion would then be that the relation of dependence between col-lections, which is our primary target, is in some way parasitic on a relation ofinvolvement between intensionally individuated properties.There is, however, a severe difficulty with this conception, and it arises be-"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"38The hierarchycause of the difference in individuation conditions between collections andproperties. Any one collectioncould, it seems, be comprehended in anynumber of ways involving any number of other objects. For instance, ifa={x:Φ(x)}, then alsoa={x:Φ(x)andy=y}, no matter whatyis,but we presumably do not wish to say thatapresupposesy. The only obviousalternative is to say that a collection presupposes only those objects involvedinallways of comprehending it, but now the difficulty is that it is very hard tosee why this should be true. There is no obvious reason why there should notbe a collection such that we require for its comprehensionsomeobject otherthanitsmembersbutitdoesnotmatterwhichone: ifso,thenalthoughwearequite clear what it is that the collection presupposes — namely some objectnot a member of it — we cannot express that presupposition relationally inthe manner that our account requires.3.3 Metaphysical dependenceThis is not a difficulty faced by the platonist, for whom the existence of acollectionisinnowaydependentonourabilitytocomprehendit: acollectiontherefore presupposes not the objects needed to think about it but only thoseneeded to constitute it, namely its members. These in turn will presupposetheir members, and so on down. The platonist’s relation of presupposition ordependence is thus what we shall later call the ancestral of the membershiprelation. This relation is then supposed to act as a metaphysical constraint onexistence: no collection exists if its doing so would come into conflict with thisconstraint.The difficulty the platonist now faces is to say what the relation of priorityamounts to. One possible strategy which seems to be implicit in the thinkingof many mathematicians is to regard platonism as a sort oflimiting caseof con-structivism: it is, roughly, what constructivism would become if we removedall the constraints on the creating subject. An account of the iterative concep-tion on these lines has been given by Wang (1974, pp.81–90), for example.The most urgent doubt concerning this proposal, however, is whether it evenmakes sense. The constructivist conception of the creating subject is of a fi-nite, reflective, thinking being in time. Which parts of this conception are tobe regarded as ‘constraints’ to be thrown off? Presumably not the ‘thinking’or the ‘reflective’ parts. But do we understand what it would be for a non-temporal being to think? And what about finiteness? Later parts of this bookwill be very largely concerned with tracing the rapidly growing confidencewith which mathematicians were able to handle the infinite, but it remains tothisdayarealphilosophicalperplexitytosayhowwefinitebeingsachievethisfeat of comprehending the infinite (or, indeed, whether we fully do so).

The point is not that we should beconcerned because the account has taken a sudden turn towards the theisticand left the atheist mathematician in the lurch, but rather that the appeal toan infinite being is of quite the wrong shape for the task in hand.Suppose, then, that we reject the idea of treating platonism as a limitingcase of constructivism, and try instead to give an account of dependency as arelationholdingbetween collections independentof our(or God’s)thinking ofthem. What should this account be?The etymology of ‘prior’ is of course temporal, and one popular method ofexplaining the dependence of a collection on its members has been in termsof time: my 1990 was perhaps a more or less typical example of the genre.But this is to make illicit appeal to the constructivist conception: according tothe platonist a collection does not exist in time and hence cannot be subjectto temporal relations. If they do not want their position to reduce to thelimiting case of constructivism we have just rejected, platonists are thereforeforced to admit hastily that the appeal to time is a ‘mere metaphor’. Nodoubt we should not dismiss it out of hand for that reason alone: withoutmetaphor, philosophy would be a hard subject to do, and a much harder oneto communicate about. Nevertheless, it is difficult to see how this particularmetaphor helps: to be told that collections are subject to a time-like structurethat is not time is not to be told very much (cf. Lear 1977).Another route we could try would be to see the modality involved as somekind of necessity. We might say, perhaps, that one object presupposes an-other if the one would not have existed without the other. This notion ofdependence dates back to Plato, to whom Aristotle in theMetaphysics(1971,1019a1-4) attributes the view that a thing is ‘prior in respect of its nature andsubstance when it is possible for it tobewithout other things, but not themwithoutit’. Whatthisamountstoifthethingisacollectionisthatitwouldnothave existed if its members had not. But once again we run into difficultiesvery soon, since in the case of pure collections — the empty collection andother collections depending on it alone — the platonist presumably believesthat the members exist necessarily and so the antecedent of the conditionalcannot be realized. We might hope to deal with applied collections by theproposed route and then treat pure collections by analogy as some sort of spe-cial case, but even this does not work, for although it is no doubt true that thesingleton of my goldfish would not have existed if Bubble had not existed, theplatonist is equally committed to the converse: Bubble would not have exis-ted if its singleton had not. So the platonist cannot, even in the applied case,appeal to counterfactual reasoning to explain the relation of priority betweencollections (cf. Fine 1995).There is therefore little choice but to conclude that priority is a modalitydistinct from that of time or necessity, a modality arising in some way out ofthe manner in which a collection is constituted from its members. Butifit"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"40The hierarchyis distinct, we cannot rely on our understanding of these other modalities indetermining its structural properties. The relation of dependence is transitiveby definition, of course, and it is presumably irreflexive, but ought we now tosuppose that it iswell-founded, i.e. that every chain of dependencies terminatesin a finite number of steps? The argument that it is well-founded has a longhistory, since it is in effect a version of one of the classical arguments for sub-stance: any chain of ontological presupposition must terminate, it is claimed,in entities which do not presuppose anything else for their existence, and intraditional metaphysics these entities are termed ‘substance’.The most renowned proponent of substance among 20th century philo-sophers was Wittgenstein, who based his argument for the existence of sub-stance on the requirement that sense be determinate. In the context in whichhe deployed the argument this assumption is legitimate: the world whose sub-stance he wished to demonstrate was intrinsically arepresentedworld, a worldstanding in a certain relation to the thoughts by means of which its state isrepresented. And there is a perspective, which I shall callinternal platonism,from which the argument is available in the current context too.No corresponding argument is available to the uncritical platonists withwhose position internal platonism is here being contrasted: if there were abar to ourgraspingany collection not obtainable from individuals in a finitenumber of steps, that would still not be, for them, an argument against theexistenceof such collections. But the internal platonist regards mathematicsas part of our attempt to represent the world and thinks that this imposesconstraints on the form it can take. One of these constraints is that no set canlieattheheadofaninfinitedescending∈-chain. Thisisnotanepistemologicalissue, even in an idealized sense: the point is not that we could not knowaboutasetat thetopofaninfinitedescending∈-chain. Norisitapointaboutwhat we can construct or imagine, even in an idealized sense. The point isratherthatanyconceptualschemewhichgenuinelyrepresentsaworldcannotcontaininfinitebackwardschainsofmeaning,andsocollectionswhichmirrorsuch chains could only be idle wheels in such a scheme.3.4 Levels and historiesIf we are to examine these issues further, it will be helpful to develop a way ofclassifying collections according to their presuppositions. Once this classifica-tion is in place, we will be able to distinguish two quite distinct aspects to theproblem of collection existence that confronts us.The classification goes like this. The initial level has as its members theobjects which already exist independently, i.e. the individuals, and in eachsubsequent level are the collections which presuppose only those collectionswhich occur on a lower level. So in general the elements of each level will"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Levels and histories41be precisely the individuals plus the elements and subcollections of all lowerlevels. The collection of all levels prior to a given level is called a ‘history’, andthe whole structure is called thecumulative iterative hierarchy(‘iterative’ becausethe account proceeds by describing the levels successively, starting with theindividuals; ‘cumulative’ because a collection contained in one level is alsocontained in all succeeding levels).Notice,though,thatwhatwehavejustsaidbywayofintroduction,howeveraccurately it describes the intended hierarchy, cannot constitute a definitionof itab initiobecause it involves the word ‘level’ which we have not definedexplicitly. It would therefore be natural at this point to suppose that we needtotreat‘level’asanextraprimitiveinouraxiomatizedtheory,butinfactthereis an elegant trick (due to Scott 1974) which allows us todefinewhat a level isexplicitly in terms of the membership relation.

More precisely,ifVis a history,acc(V)(if it exists) is called thelevelwith historyV.If Ø exists, it is trivially a history since it has no elements: if its accumulationexists, it is the collection of all the individuals.Definition.A collection is said to begrounded,ortobeaset,ifitisasubcollection of some level.(3.4.1)Proposition.IfVis a level with historyV, then any memberV\u0002ofVis a level belonging toVwith historyV∩V\u0002.Proof. Suppose thatVis a level with historyVandV\u0002∈V. CertainlyV\u0002⊆V\u0002∈Vand soV\u0002∈acc(V)=V. AlsoV\u0002=acc(V∩V\u0002)sinceVis a history.SoV\u0002will be a level provided thatV∩V\u0002is a history. But ifV\u0002\u0002∈V∩V\u0002,thenV\u0002\u0002⊆acc(V∩V\u0002)=V\u0002, so thatV∩V\u0002\u0002=(V∩V\u0002)∩V\u0002\u0002and henceacc((V∩V\u0002)∩V\u0002\u0002)=acc(V∩V\u0002\u0002)=V\u0002\u0002sinceVis a history. HenceV∩V\u0002is indeed a history as required.In the remainder of this chapter and the nextV,V\u0002,V1, etc. will always belevels.

Wemaythink of it as being justified by the account of dependency between collectionswhich we gave earlier, since the collections we include in a level are just thosewhichdependonlyoncollectionswhichoccuratlowerlevelsinthehierarchy.We shall occasionally refer to this as thefirst principle of plenitude.2A platonist might well feel, however, that this principle is deficient whentaken on its own: we have so far said nothing aboutwhatsubcollections thereare. What prevents us from doing so, according to at least one variety ofplatonist, is merely our self-denying insistence on formalizing everything ina first-order language. If we abandoned that constraint, we could say thatbstrongly accumulatesaif:(1)(∀x)(x∈b⇔xis an individual or(∃c∈a)(x∈corx⊆c)); and(2)(∀X)(∀c∈a)({x∈c:Xx}∈b).We could then use strong accumulations in our definition of ‘level’ in placeof accumulations, and it would be trivial to prove the following second-orderprinciple:Separation principle.3(∀X)(∀V)({x∈V:Xx}exists).In the first-order system, however, none of this is open to us. So instead weintroduce as axioms all the instances of the second-order separation principlethat are formulable in our first-order system.Axiom scheme of separation.IfΦ(x)is a formula, then the following isan axiom:(∀V)({x∈V:Φ(x)}exists).It is no accident, incidentally, that we have found ourselves introducing anaxiom scheme at some stage in our axiomatization: the theory we are aim-ing towards cannot be finitely axiomatized in the first-order language we areworking in, and so the presence in our system of at least one scheme is inevit-able. It will turn out, in fact, that separation is ouronlyscheme, and so part ofour interest in it will be as the focus for the concerns we raised in §1.3 aboutwhat is involved in asserting a scheme at all.Thedifferencebetweenthefirst-orderschemeandsecond-orderseparationis important, since the scheme falls well short of giving effect to what the pla-tonist might be thought to intend. If we regard the issue metatheoretically,2The second principle of plenitude, which we shall state in §4.1, addresses the question of howmany levels there are in the hierarchy.3Whenever we set down an axiom, as here, for discussion without intending to add it to ourdefault theory, we signal this by not emboldening its name."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The theory of levels43the reason for this inadequacy is clear enough: in the case where the levelVis infinite, second-order separation encompasses uncountably many instances(cf. Cantor’s theorem 9.2.6), whereas the first-order scheme has only count-ably many instances since the language of set theory is countable. So thefirst-order scheme is only at best an inadequate surrogate for second-orderseparation.Notice, though, that all of this applies only on the platonist understandingof the dependence relation. On the stricter constructivist understanding, weare entitled at each stage to construct only those collections which we canspecify in terms of collections already constructed. To capture the first-ordercontent of this idea, it would be necessary to restrict the quantifiers in ourformula to the levelVin question. We would then be left with the followingmuch weaker separation principle.Predicative separation.IfΦ(x)is a formula andx1,...,xnare the variablesother thanxon which it depends, then(∀V)(∀x1,...,xn∈V)({x∈V:Φ(V)(x)}exists)is an axiom.Suchapredicativeformoftheaxiomschemeofseparationwouldrestrictverysubstantially what we could prove in our theory.3.6 The theory of levelsIn §2.3 we proved the absolute version of Russell’s paradox: this showed thatwe cannot consistently assume what is sometimes called thenaive comprehensionprinciple, namely that every property is collectivizing.

One of the great advantages of this concep-tion of set is that it generates a simple criterion to determine which formulaedefine sets. A set has to be located in the hierarchy at a level which is afterthe levels of all its members. It follows that things form a set only if thereisa level to which they all belong: for if there is not, there will be nowhere inthe hierarchy for a set of them to be located.

Thus a set is pure iff it is a subset of somepure level.Consider now the following axiom candidate.Axiom of purity.Every set is pure.This axiom will certainly be true if there are no individuals. In fact, if a the-ory in which this is assumed had been our target all along, we could havesimplified our presentation right at the beginning: there would have been noneed to bring in the predicate U(x)since nothing in the theory would satisfyit. We could then have simplified our definition of collection terms in §2.2 bydeletingtheconditionthatacollectionshouldnotbeanindividual, sothatthedefinition would now read simply{x:Φ(x)}=ι!y(∀x)(x∈y⇔Φ(x)),and we could have simplified our account of the theory of levels by omittingthe references to individuals.The axiom of purity, or something equivalent to it, is assumed in almostevery modern treatment of set theory in the literature. The main reason forthis is that, as was discovered fairly early, it is not necessary to assume theexistence of individuals in order that set theory should act as a foundation formathematics, while if we rule them out from the outset, we can simplify thetheory, getting rid of one primitive and tidying up the development consider-ably. If the only objective is to give mathematicians a theory whichcanact asa foundation, it is inevitable that they will choose the one that seems simplestto them."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Well-foundedness51Indeed individuals would probably have made an exit from set theoryearlier than they did if it had not been for an accident in the progress ofwork in the metatheory. In 1922aFraenkel discovered a method for showingthe independence of the axiom of choice from theories such asZUthat allowindividuals. This method was refined (Lindenbaum and Mostowski 1938) andthen exploited by others (e.g. Mendelson 1956; Mostowski 1945) to prove theindependence from such theories of various other set-theoretic claims. It wasnot until 1963 that Cohen showed how to convert this into a method thatworks for theories likeZwhich ban individuals. In the intervening periodthere was therefore a reason for set theorists (who tend, after all, to be thepeople who write set theory books) to regard permitting individuals as worththe extra effort. After 1963, however, not even set theorists had any use forindividuals. Worse, there are proofs in set theory that do not work if we haveto allow for them. So it is unsurprising that in the last 40 years individualshave largely disappeared from view.However, we shall not follow this trend here. The reason is that to do sowould cut our theory off from at least one of its intended applications. It is byno means obvious what justifies the applicability of mathematics in general towhat lies outside it, and it may well be that the reduction of mathematics toset theory does not supply such a justification. But even if set theory’s role as afoundation for mathematics turned out to be wholly illusory, it would earn itskeep through the calculus it provides for counting infinite sets. The most nat-ural, if not literally the only, way to ensure that that calculus is available to beapplied to counting non-mathematical things — chairs, electrons, thoughts,angels — is to allow such things into the theory as individuals.3.9 Well-foundednessThe particular treatment of the hierarchy of levels adopted here did not be-come known until the 1970s. But the grounded collections were first singledout for study much earlier. Mirimanoff’s (1917) remarkable treatment calledthem ‘ordinary’ collections: they are often called ‘well-founded’ in the literat-ure, but we avoid that usage here in order to reserve that word for a closelyrelated property of the membership relation, namely that expressed in pro-position 3.7.11.The well-foundedness of the membership relation gives the grounded col-lections an especially simple structure which makes it inevitable that theywould be singled out for special study eventually. But Mirimanoff did notmake the further move of suggesting thateverycollection is a set. He did not,that is to say, propose to add the following axiom to the theory of sets.Axiom of foundation.Every collection is grounded."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"52The hierarchyOne way of putting this informally would be to use the language of classes: letMbe the class of all collections andVthegrounded partofM, i.e. the class of allsets; theaxiomoffoundationthenassertsthatV=M. Asmattersstand,how-ever, this way of putting the matterisinformal, since we have not introducedany formal machinery for referring to classes within our theory.4The ideaof limiting the formal theory to the grounded collections only was first con-sidered by von Neumann (1925) and Zermelo (1930), who proposed axiomsdesigned to achieve it. But neither of these authors had anargumentthat thereare no ungrounded collections. Their motive in restricting the theory to setswas simply that they wanted to discuss the possibility of proving categoricityresults, and the clear structure of the universe of sets makes such results easierto come by if we restrict ourselves to that domain. Zermelo (1930, p.31), forinstance, said only that the axiom ‘has always been satisfied in all practicalapplications to date, and therefore introduces for the moment no essentialrestriction of the theory’.But even if the axiom of foundation made it easier to prove categoricityresults, it remained without any applicationoutsidethe theory of collections. Ihavealreadyremarkedontheprominentroletheregressivemethodplayedindeterminingthetheorymathematiciansadopted. Sothefactthattheyshowedno inclination to adopt the axiom of foundation is unsurprising. The patternremained that it was treated solely as a tool for specialists in the theory ofcollections. Thus as late as 1954 Bourbaki saw no reason to include it inhis axiom system, which was explicitly intended to act as a foundation formathematicsand not as a basis for metatheoretic study.Treated as a case study in the history of mathematics this episode thusprovides strong evidence for the influence of the regressive method on thepractice of axiom selection in the foundations of mathematics. Because theaxiom of foundation did not havemathematicalconsequences, mathematiciansshowed no inclination to adopt it: interest in it was limited to specialists con-cerned with its metatheoretic consequences.Matters began to change only when G ̈odel (1947, p.519) presented thegroundedcollectionsnotmerely,asMirimanoffhaddone,asasub-universeoftheuniverseofcollectionsbutratherasanindependentlymotivatedhierarchywhich, as he pointed out, ‘has never led to any antinomy whatsoever’. Sincethe 1960s the assumption that every collection is grounded has been adoptedenthusiastically by set theorists, and the idea that theonlycoherent conceptionis the iterative one has become widespread.But the literature contains very few arguments in favour of the claim thatevery collection is a set. Most of those who do attempt an argument drawattention to the difficulty ofconceivingof an ungrounded collection. Suppes(1960, p.53) simply challenges the reader who doubts this to try to come up4For more on this issue, see appendix C."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Notes53withanexample. Mayberry(1977,p.32)suggeststhat‘anyonewhotries...toformaclearpictureofwhatanon-well-foundedcollectionmightbe...willseewhyextensionalityforcesustoacceptthewell-foundednessofthemembershiprelation.’ Drake (1974, p.13) stigmatizes ungrounded collections as ‘strange’and says it is ‘difficult to give any intuitive meaning’ to them. Parsons (1983,p.296) regards the evidence of the principle as ‘more a matter of our not be-ing able to understand how non-well-founded [collections] could be possiblerather than a stricter insight that they areimpossible’.I am not as pessimistic as Parsons about the prospects for a non-psycho-logistic argument for the iterative conception. In §3.3 I sketched an argu-ment that the hierarchy is well-founded. It is true that that argument seemsto require a premise which I there characterized as internalist — that col-lections should be representable, or available to reason, or whatever — butthat does not reduce the argument to psychologism. And it would, if correct,rule out the possibility Parsons (1983, p.296) is prepared to countenance that‘someone might conceive a structure very like a “real”∈-structure which viol-ated foundation but which might be thought of as a structure of sets in a newsense closely related to the old’.Even if the argument for well-foundedness that I gave earlier is correct,though, it undeniably depends on an extra premise that goes beyond mererealism — the premise which I branded ‘internalist’. It therefore seemsprudent, lest I lose readers who do not feel the internalist pull so strongly,not to assume the axiom of foundation. In practice that is no great conces-sion, however, since we shall focus exclusively on grounded collections (i.e.sets) in everything that we do from now on. Readers who believe there areungrounded collections as well will thus find nothing here with which theycan reasonably disagree: the most they are entitled to is a mounting sense offrustration that I am silent about them.NotesIn1906aRussellcanvassedthreeformsasolutiontotheparadoxesmighttake:theno-classtheory,limitationofsize,andthezigzagtheory.

The reason for this is that all the axioms we are committed toso far, the instances of separation, take the form of universal generalizationsand are therefore vacuously satisfied if there are no levels to instantiate them.It is time now to rescue our theory from this vacuity. Doing so will require usto enter into some ontological commitments concerning levels.4.1 How far can you go?What this amounts to is that we need to determine how many levels thereare in the hierarchy. The constructivist, of course, has a criterion by whichto settle this: the levels owe their existence to our construction of them inthought, and so to discover how many levels there can be, we need only de-termine the limits of our capacities for performing such constructions. Theremay be different answers to this depending on how liberal our conception ofthe creative subject is, but it is at least clear what the terms of the debate theconstructivist must engage in should be.For the platonist, by contrast, the matter is much more problematic. Thedifficulty is that everything we have said so far about the platonist’s under-standing of the dependency relation is negative. The argument has been thatthe nature of collections constrains them by means of the metaphysical re-quirements of dependency, but this constraint does nothing in itself to showthat thereareany collections.The iterative conception is often presented as if iton its owndelivered theexistence of at least a significant number of levels in the hierarchy, but theonly version of platonism which has much prospect of justifying this is thatwhich regards it as a limiting case — constructivism without the shackles oftime and finiteness. For this reason, perhaps, limiting case platonism is acommonplace of expositions of the iterative conception. It seems to underpinthe account in Boolos 1971, for instance. Since I have already disparagedlimiting case platonism in §3.2, let us put it to one side. The question that"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"56The theory of setsremains is whether anyothersort of platonism is entitled to the resources torescue the theory of sets from vacuity. What is needed is plainly a furtherprinciple to which our concept of set can be seen to be answerable, one notentailed by what we have said about the concept so far.The principle, which we shall call thesecond principle of plenitude(afterParsons 1996), states, roughly, that all levels exist which are not ruled out bythe metaphysical constraints on the dependency relation already mentioned.But thisisrough, and as it stands it is far from unproblematic. We areentitled to an existence principle asserting that everything exists which is notruled out only if we have a reason to believe that we have stated all relevantconstraints, and how are we to know that? Moreover, even if we could besurethatwehavestatedallthe constraintson collectionsimplicit intheir meta-physical nature, what would be the reason for supposing that the existence ofany collections followed? The claim being made here is evidently related tothe postulationist’s idea that consistency implies existence. It is not, of course,the wholly general claim of the postulationist that the consistency ofanyax-iom system implies the existence of mathematical objects with the propertiespostulated, but it is a particular case of it. We therefore owe an explanationof what it is in the conceptcollectionthat makes such a principle of ontolo-gical plenitude applicable to it. If consistency does not imply existence quitegenerally, why should it do so here?And the difficulty we face in coming up with such an explanation is thatit is far from clear how to give the principle of plenitude a coherent formu-lation. The most natural way to express it is by means of a modality: thereexist all the collections it is possible for there to be. But if this is not to bevacuous, themodalityinquestioncannotbeoneaccordingtowhichmathem-atical objects exist necessarily. Presumably the modality is to be constrainedby the metaphysical restrictions we placed on collections in the last chapter,but then the difficulty is to see how it can be prevented from delivering toomuch. Whatever levels there are in the hierarchy, why could there not beanother one beyond them? The answer must be that for there to be anotherlevel beyond those there are would violate the metaphysical constraints, but agreat deal more would have to be said to make that response convincing.Indeed in the crude version we have stated so far the principle of plenitudehas a crippling flaw. We cannot simply insist that there are all the sets thatarelogically possible, because however many there are it is logically possible forthere to be more. This is no doubt the reason why we often find the prin-ciple expressed in terms of other sorts of possibility — conceptual, perhaps, ormetaphysical. But to impose aconceptualvariant of the principle of plenitudeseems to import constructivist considerations which the platonist deems inap-propriate; and the metaphysical variant is in danger of collapsing into vacuityonce more."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The initial level574.2 The initial levelThesearedeepwaters, andweshallreturntothemlater, butinthemeantimewe need to make progress, and to do that we shall have to state axioms whichmake existence claims. In this section we shall do this only in the most modestway that our theory of levels permits, namely by asserting that there is at leastone level (or, equivalently, that there is at least one set).Temporary axiom.There is at least one level.The reason we call this assumption a temporary axiom is that very shortly(§4.9) we shall add another axiom which entails this one, and at that point weshall be able to withdraw the temporary axiom from service. Since a level isdefined to be the accumulation of a history, our temporary axiom asserts thatthere is at least one history that has an accumulation. We have already notedthat Ø is a history if it exists, so our temporary axiom amounts to the same asasserting that the collection acc(Ø)={x:xis an individual}exists.Definition.LetV0be the earliest level.(4.2.1)Proposition.V0={x:xis an individual}.Proof. Immediate [proposition 3.6.8].(4.2.2)Corollary.IfΦis any formula, then{x:xis an individual andΦ(x)}is a set.Proof. Immediate.The temporary axiom does no more than guarantee that the individuals forma set and does not allow us to prove the existence of any sets that are not setsof individuals. The theory with only it and separation as axioms is thereforeprobably as fair a representation as a formal theory can be of our ordinarylanguage uses of the term ‘set’, since these uses do not generally countenanceiterative constructions such as sets of sets and the like.Given the axiom scheme of separation in the form we stated in the lastchapter, the existence ofanyset entails the existence of V0, and so we cannotdeny V0without reducing our theory of sets to triviality. But even if we hadnot assumed the existence of a set of all individuals, it would still have beenpossible to develop a theory of pure levels. We could then have restrictedthe axiom scheme of separation only to them, and so could have assumedthe existence of a hierarchy of sets without thereby committing ourselves tothe existence of a set of individuals. This is of some significance because, as"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"58The theory of setsParsons (1977, p.359, n.4) has remarked, whether the existence of a set ofindividuals is even consistent depends to some extent on the nature of theindividuals. The example he quotes is that of the ordinal numbers. We shallintroduce ordinals in §11.2 as a particular kind of set, and will demonstratethere the Burali-Forti paradox, which shows that the ordinals do not forma set. This result does not threaten inconsistency in the temporary axiomof our system, of course, since we have ensured quite explicitly that sets, andthereforeinparticularordinalsasweshalldefinethem,arenotindividualsandhence are not potentially problematic candidates for membership of V0. ButParsons’ point is that it would be possible to formulate a theory of ordinalsquite independent of and prior to the theory of sets. Conceived of in thisway ordinals would be individuals and not sets. It would then be natural toworry about whether there could indeed be a set V0of all individuals as thetemporary axiom insists.The point is well taken. What it serves to highlight is that individuals areto be conceived of as being, in the language we have been using to describethe hierarchy, conceptuallypriorto sets. If we are to present ordinals as in-dividuals, therefore, it is a requirement that our theory of ordinals should beindependentof our theory of sets. If so, there would be nothing to prevent theordinalsformingaset. Burali-Forti’scontradictionwouldariseonlyifwethenmade the mistake of adding a further principle linking ordinals to sets (e.g. anaxiom claiming that we can index the levels of the hierarchy in such a waythat every ordinal has a level corresponding to it).The dependency theorist expresses this point by saying that all the indi-viduals are prior to all the collections.

What is hard to disentangle now is whether the earlysuspicions really amounted to an argument that the emptysetis illegitimate orto a continuing confusion between this and the uncontroversial point notedearlier that there can be no such thing as an emptyfusion. One importantearly source on this issue is Dedekind (1888): he regarded what he calledthe emptysystemas no more than a convenient fiction, but this is scarcelysurprising since, as we have already noted, there is other evidence that hemeant by ‘system’ what we now call a fusion. Lewis (1991), whose sympathiesare with fusions rather than collections every time, is also reduced to giving aregressive justification for the empty set.You’dbetterbelieveinit,andwiththeutmostconfidence; forthenyoucanbelievewithequal confidence in its singleton,...and so on until you have enough modelling clayto make the whole of mathematics. (p.12)Ofcourse,fortheseregressivepurposestheemptysetdoesnotactuallyhavetobe empty — to be, as Lewis puts it (p.13), ‘a little speck of sheer nothingness,a sort of black hole in the fabric of Reality itself...aspecial individual with awhiff of nothingness about it.’ So Lewis just makes an arbitrary choice — thefusion of all the individuals, as it happens — and lets that serve as the emptyset. Of course, this stipulation has the minor disadvantage that if there werenothing at all, there would be no such fusion (since there cannot be a fusionof nothing), but in that case, he says, ‘maybe we can let mathematics fall. Justhow much security do we really need?’Thus Lewis at his most fey. But what is rather more puzzling is that Zer-melo (1908b, p.263), who was certainly dealing with collections and not fu-sions, also called the empty set ‘improper’; and G ̈odel (1944, p.144) was will-ing at least to tolerate, if not actually to endorse, a similar idea.One might wonder whether these repetitions of the idea that the emptyset is fictitious or has to be constructed arbitrarily show the persistence ofintuitions derived from fusions in the conception of aggregation being em-ployed; but this can be no more than a conjecture since neither Zermelo norG ̈odel gives in the texts mentioned anyargumentfor regarding the empty setas merely fictitious. On the other hand, it is rare to find in the literature anydirect reason for believing that the empty set does exist, except for variants ofthe argument from convenience originally deployed by Dedekind. But noticethatconvenienceseemshardlysufficient,evenforsomeonewhosubscribestotheregressive method, to constitute an argument for thetruthof the assumptionthat the empty set exists, since it is so evidently possible (although admittedlyinconvenient) to manage without it.According to the formal development we have adopted here, no collectionis an individual, and hence in particular the empty set is not one. This wasachieved by taking the notion of an individual as primitive by means of thepredicate U(x).

Two solutions to this formal problem arepossible, neither of them altogether satisfactory.The first solution, adopted by Quine, is to say that an individualxis notin fact memberless as we had supposed, but to stipulate that it has itself as amember, so thatx={x}. Individuals then become collections, albeit non-grounded ones, and sets are distinguished from individuals by being collec-tions which do not belong to themselves. This procedure is also suggested byFrege(1893–1903,§18,n.1),butforthesomewhatdifferent(althoughequallytechnical)reasonthatitenableshimtosettlethetruth-conditionsofstatementsidentifying an individual with a set. The principal disadvantage of proceedingin this way, however, is that itisso obviously just a device: there is no groundwhatever for thinking that individuals really do belong to themselves, so whyadopt a theory according to which it is true?The second solution is to say that the empty set is an individual, but onepicked at random to fulfil this role (see Fraenkel et al. 1958, p.24). This is aninstance of a procedure which is very common in the foundations of mathem-atics and which we shall meet again in these pages, namely the procedure ofarbitrary choice. It arises when we attempt to reduce one theory to another bymeansofanembeddinganddiscoverthatthereismorethanonewayofdoingit. On some occasions there is an extrinsic reason to prefer one embedding toanother; on others, as now, the various embeddings are quite on a par and sowe must either make a wholly arbitrary choice or abandon the reduction.4.4 Cutting things down to sizeWe mention now a technical device which is sometimes useful in cases wherethe set{x:Φ(x)}does not exist. The idea, which is due to Scott (1955) andTarski (1955), is that instead of attempting the doomed task of forming thenon-existentsetofallthosexsuchthatΦ(x),werestrictourselvestocollectingonly suchxof earliest possible birthday, i.e. those occurring as low as possiblein the hierarchy of levels. This defines a set in every case — and indeedone which may retain enough information aboutΦto be useful as a partialrepresentation of it.Definition.Suppose thatΦ(x)is a formula.

This is in factthe central case: since the level aboveVis V0∪P(V), whether the axiom ofcreationistruereallyhingesonwhethereverysethasapowerset. Butistherea non-regressive argument to think this is so?The dependency theorist might try to give such an argument on the basisof the principle of plenitude: ifais a set, it ispossiblefor there to be a powerset ofa, and our principle of plenitude will then tell us that thereisone. Onceagain,though,therehasbeenatendency,atleastamongplatonists,tosupposethat this key step is so obvious as not to require argument at all. Some whohavethought about the issue have been reduced to regarding the power setoperation as essentially primitive. But to say that it is ‘primitive’ or a ‘given’ isevidently only to label the difficulty, not to solve it.A constructivist will, as we have seen, be likely to adopt a different hier-archy, in which the next level afterVis not V0∪P(V). If we had adoptedsuch a hierarchy, the axiom of creation and the existence of power sets wouldcome apart: we would have to address the possibility that for every level thereis a next level but that this process never exhausts even the subsets of the firstlevel. Something like this idea is expressed by Lusin (1927, pp.32–3), whosuggests that in order to encompass all the subsets of an infinite set in one set,wewouldhavetobeabletocircumscribethelawsfordefiningsuchsets,whichhe claims is impossible. A somewhat different argument against the existenceof the power set of an infinite set is to be found in Mayberry (2000)."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Ordered pairs634.6 Ordered pairsThe ordered pair(x,y)is supposed to be a single object which codes within itin some way the identities of the two objectsxandy. What is required is thattheordered pair principle,(x,y)=(z,t)⇒x=zandy=t,should be satisfied for allx,y,z,t. When we are working within the theory ofsets there are various technical tricks that enable us to do this. The first satis-factory method is due to Wiener (1914), but here we shall use one discoveredby Kuratowski (1921).Definition.(x,y)={{x},{x,y}}(‘theordered pairofxandy’).Weshallwrite(x,y,z)for((x,y),z),(x,y,z,t)for((x,y,z),t),etc. Orderedpairs evidently exist whenever their terms are either sets or individuals [pro-position 4.5.5], but before we make use of them we need to demonstrate thatthey satisfy the ordered pair principle enunciated above.(4.6.1)Lemma.Ifx,y,zare sets or individuals, then{x,y}={x,z}⇒y=z.Proof. Suppose that{x,y}={x,z}. Theny∈{x,y}={x,z}, so that eithery=zas required ory=x: but ify=x, thenz∈{x,z}={x,y}={y}, andsoy=zin this case as well.(4.6.2)Proposition.Ifx,y,z,tare sets or individuals, then(x,y)=(z,t)⇒x=zandy=t.Proof. Suppose that(x,y)=(z,t), i.e.{{x},{x,y}} = {{z},{z,t}}. So either{x}={z}, in which casex=z,or{x}={z,t}, in which casex=z=t.Hence in either case{x}={z}, so that{x,y}={z,t}[lemma 4.6.1] andthereforey=t[lemma 4.6.1 again].If it were our purpose to minimize the number of axioms, the advantage ofbeing able to define ordered pairs would be clear: Whitehead and Russell(1910–13) did not know about such devices and therefore had no choice butto develop two parallel but distinct theories, one of collections and one of re-lations, and to state most of their axioms twice, once for each case. Neverthe-less, when Russell learnt about the possibility of defining ordered pairs fromWiener, he did not express ‘any particular approval’ (Wiener 1953, p.191),and he did not bother to mention the manoeuvre at all in the introduction tothe 2nd edition ofPrincipia(Whitehead and Russell 1927)."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"64The theory of setsOne reason to be wary of it is that all the explicit definitions of pairingterms have, because of their arbitrariness, various more or less accidentalconsequences. This is a case of an issue that has plagued the foundationsof mathematics — the problem ofdoing too much. It is sometimes referred to intheliteratureasBenacerraf’sproblem,becausehefamouslyraisedaninstanceof it in ‘What numbers could not be’ (1965), but in fact it dates back at least toDedekind.The problem typically arises when we try to synthesize in some theory anotion of which we take ourselves already to have a conception independentof that theory: we have to choose some particular way of modelling the no-tion within our theory, and in doing so we invest the model with extraneousproperties which we could not have derived from our prior conception of thenotion.At the formal level one way out of this difficulty is to introduce the prob-lematic entity explicitly by means of a new primitive term governed by appro-priate axioms. In the case at hand, this would involve treating ‘(x,y)’asaprimitive term and stating the ordered pair principle as an axiom. If we adop-ted this practice, the derivation of proposition 4.6.2 would continue to havea metamathematical interest, since it would demonstrate that the theory withthe ordered pair axiom included is conservative over the old theory withoutthe axiom, but it would not be needed for the formal development.There is a difficulty with this strategy, however. It is caused by the fact thatamong the objects we wish to form ordered pairs of are the sets themselves. Ifweareseriousabouttheideathatorderedpairsarenotsetsbutdistinctentitiesof which we have an independent conception, we shall therefore have to alterour definition of ‘level’ to ensure that ordered pairs get included in the hier-archy. One way of doing this would be to replace accumulations with exten-ded accumulations: theextended accumulationofaconsists of the accumulationofatogether with the ordered pairs whose terms belong to the accumulationofa. This manoeuvre would of course complicate the formal developmentslightly, but if it were adopted, hardly anything in the rest of the book wouldhave to be changed.The problem of doing too much is one that most mathematicians wouldregard as irrelevant to their concerns: they are habituated by frequent use tothe practice of modelling one theory within another and simply disregardingthe extraneous properties which this practice throws up. Moreover, they areundoubtedlyaidedinthisbythefactthatthepropertiesatissueareextraneous— answers to questions it would never occur to us to ask, lying out amongwhatQuineevocativelycallsthe‘don’tcares’. Kuratowski’strickhascertainlyproved popular: among those writing after it became well-known, Bourbaki(1954)istherareexceptioninnotmakinguseofit,insteadtreatingtheorderedpair as an extra primitive in his formal system; but even Bourbaki relentedeventually and (in the 4th edition ofTh ́ eorie des ensembles) followed what had by"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Relations65then become the universal practice among mathematicians of adopting thetrick as a definition of the ordered pair.As the reader will note, I have chosen to follow this practice here too. Imust therefore give up the idea that the collections called ‘ordered pairs’ hereare the genuine article. The reason is that the moral Benacerraf drew — thatsince their numerical properties do not determine which sets numbers are,numbers are not sets — applies in this case too. If there are such things asordered pairs in the proper sense — entities governed solely by the orderedpair principle — then for the same reason they are not sets. So the theoryof sets does not contain the theory of ordered pairs, but only a convenientsurrogate of it. But that is all we need:{{x},{x,y}}is a single set that codesthe identities of the two objectsxandy, and it is for that purpose that we useit; as long as we do not confuse it with thegenuineordered pair (if such thereis), no harm is done. In other words, the ordered pair as it is used here is to bethought of only as a technical tool to be used within the theory of sets and notas genuinely explanatory of whatever prior concept of ordered pair we mayhave had.Definition.Ifzis an ordered pair, letdom(z)=ι!x(∃y)(z=(x,y))(‘thefirst coordinateofz’);im(z)=ι!y(∃x)(z=(x,y))(‘thesecond coordinateofz’).Thus dom(x,y)=xand im(x,y)=y.4.7 RelationsAccording to the standard conception, relations correspond to binary predic-ates in the same way that sets correspond to unary ones.Definition.A set is called arelationif every element of it is an ordered pair.IfΦ(x,y)is a formula, then{(x,y):Φ(x,y)}is a relation provided that itis a set; it is said to be the relation betweenxandydefined bythe formulaΦ(x,y). Conversely, any relationris defined by the formula(x,y)∈r,which is customarily writtenxr y. The set{(y,x):xr y}is called theinverseofr— some authors call it the ‘converse’ — and it is denotedr−1. The setsdom[r]={dom(z):z∈r}and im[r]={im(z):z∈r}are called thedomainandimageofrrespectively.

It depends on picking once for all two definite objects.For the trick to work, all that matters is that the chosen objects are distinct:once we have got round to defining the natural numbers 0 and 1 (which willbe in §5.4), we might as well use them for this purpose, so we shall state thedefinition as if those are the ones we have chosen, but nothing of importancehinges on the matter.Definition.a\u0012b=(a×{0})∪(b×{1})(‘disjoint union’).The purpose of this definition is to tag each member ofawith the label 0 andeach member ofbwith the label 1, so that they retain their distinctness whenwe form the union.Exercises1.

ThehistoryofVωisthereforeinfinite.Our intuitions about infinite collections are undoubtedly more nebulous andmore capable of arousing controversy than those about finite ones. Indeedmany of the properties of infinite collections are paradoxical at first sight.When Cantor wrote his works on set theory, an abhorrence of actually in-finite collections had been commonplace since Aristotle: they were, for ex-ample, scrupulously avoided by Euclid (c.300B.C.). There were certainly afew heretics — Galileo and Bolzano, for example — but Aristotle’s views hadbeen widely accepted.It was just at the time when infinitesimals had been successfully expungedfromanalysisbyWeierstrass(Cantor’steacher)—nottoberehabilitateduntilthe 1950s — that Cantor himself tamed the paradoxes of the actual infinitein his work on cardinal and ordinal arithmetic. However, he had to brookconsiderable opposition and devoted lengthy passages in his published workto the defence of his views against what he called thehorror infiniti, ‘a kindof shortsightedness which destroys the possibility of seeing the actual infinite’(1886, p.230).Perhaps the most influential of those whom Cantor (1886, pp.225–6)took to be opponents of the actual infinite was Gauss, who had protestedin a frequently quoted letter to Schumacher ‘against treating infinite mag-nitudes as something completed, which is never admissible in mathematics’(Gauss 1860–65, vol.II, p.269) As so often, however, it pays to examine thequotation in context. In the letter to which Gauss was responding Schu-macher had tried to prove that space is Euclidean by an ingenious but fal-laciousargumentinvolvingtheconstructionofalargesemi-circle. Ifthesemi-circle is kept fixed and the triangle is made small, Schumacher’s argumentdoes indeed show that the sum of the angles of the triangle will tend to 180◦.What Gauss quite correctly objected to, though, was Schumacher’s use of theopposite procedure — keeping the triangle fixed and letting the radius of thesemi-circletendtoinfinity—toshowthatthesumoftheanglesofthetriangleis 180◦.But even if Gauss was not in this famous quotation opposing the notion ofanactuallyinfiniteset,therewerecertainlymanyotherswhodid. Indeeditwasnot uncommon at first to regard the paradoxes of set theory as paradoxes oftheinfinite. Some years after Cantor’s work Poincar ́e (1906, p.316) could stillassert that ‘there is no actual infinite; the Cantorians forgot this and fell intocontradiction’.

We might indeed be able to supply an argument forthis: however, it would not be a proofab initio, but only relative to some otherinfinitary theory for which we might have some independent ground (e.g. Eu-clidean geometry). Even if that were possible, though, it would heavily qualifyour theory’s suitability to take on the foundational role for which we weregrooming it: in the case just quoted, for example, the theory would obviouslybe ruled out as a candidate to act as a foundation for Euclidean geometry.More importantly, though, it would not even meet the case since, as we havealready seen, there seems to be no reason to think the mere logical possibil-ity of a set implies its actual existence, and indeed it is dubious whether thesupposition that it does imply it is even coherent.Modern mathematical practice makes use of infinite collections every-where, at least if we take its surface grammar at face value: not only does theconstruction of proxies for the standard objects of mathematics in set theorythat we shall outline in part II need there to be at least one infinite set in orderfor it to get started, but even independently of that construction mathem-aticians quite routinely use infinite sets in reasoning about these standard ob-jects.

But there are two distinctways in which we could have done this, depending on whether we supposedthe infinite collections to exist because there are infinitely many individuals orbecause there are levels infinitely far up the hierarchy. If we had opted for thefirst of these, our axiom would have been as follows.Axiom of infinity1.V0is infinite.The axiom of infinity which we have asserted here is of the second sort. (Inthe next section we shall suggest an informal way of picturing the hierarchyaccordingtowhichthefirstofthesesuppositionsmakesthehierarchyinfinitelywide and the second makes it infinitely high.)The requirement of mathematics is sets from which to construct the relev-ant objects, and we do not care much which sets they are. So the regressivemethod does not directly give us a ground for preferring one sort of axiom ofinfinity over the other.

Philosophers, whose subject habituates them to seekingany port in a storm, might not be so dismissive.

For ifssignifies an element ofS, then the thoughts\u0002thatscan bean object of my thought, is itself an element ofS.

If it were to turn outthat mathematics depends for its truth on an inevitable feature of that realm,that would certainly be a radical conclusion, for it would at a stroke convertour philosophy of mathematics into idealism, but it is far from clear that thiswould be absurd.Note, though, that even if it is sound, Dedekind’s proof shows the existenceonly of infinitely many objects, not of a set to which they all belong. But theaxiomswehavestatedalreadydemonstratethat,forwecanprovetheexistenceof, for instance, the setsØ,{Ø},{{Ø}},...Dedekind’s proof is therefore of use only to a dependency theorist who, in-voking Aristotle’s celebrated distinction between potential and actual infinity,regards the relation of dependency that holds between the levels as showingthat they form only a potential infinity, not an actual one, and for that reasonhesitates to assert that there is a set Vωcontaining all of them. For such aperson Dedekind’s proof is not redundant, since it attempts to demonstratethat the individuals are actually, not just potentially, infinite in number, andthereforegivesastrongergroundforbelievingthatthereisasetcontainingallof them.In any case, we have chosen here not to follow the course of supposingthat there are infinitely many individuals.

The constructivist’s route to establishing this principle is relat-ively clear and depends solely on the coherence of the notion of a supertask,as already discussed. Platonists, on the other hand, seem to have frustratinglylittle they can say by way of justification for this form of infinity axiom.4.10 StructuresThe general framework we set up in §2.2 consisted of a prior theoryT,towhich we added a predicate U(x)to mean ‘xis an individual’, before relativ-izing the axioms ofTto U. LetZ[T] be the theory obtained by adding to thisframework the axioms of creation and infinity together with all the instancesof the separation scheme. (Although it will not figure prominently in thisbook, we should also mention the corresponding second-order theoryZ2[T],in which the separation scheme is replaced by the second-order separationprinciple.) Two special cases are worthy of note. If we start from the theorynullwhich has no axioms at all, so that nothing whatever is assumed aboutthe individuals, the theoryZ[null] thus obtained is usually denoted simplyZU. If we start from the theoryemptywhose only model is empty, we get atheoryZ[empty] which is usually denoted simplyZ. Whenemptyis relativ-ized to U, it asserts that there are no individuals, so another way of arriving atZwould be to obtain it fromZUby adding the axiom of purity of §3.8.But treating its objects as individuals is not the only way in which a theorycan be embedded in set theory.Definition.An ordered pair(A,r)is called astructureifris a relation onA.We shall sometimes refer toAas thecarrier setof the structure and to(A,r)asthe result ofendowingit with the relationr.

Of thesetwo permissions the latter is the less significant. I have argued that platonistswith internalist sympathies might well be willing to grant that all collectionsare grounded. In recognition of this we shall adopt the convention from nowon that our quantifiers are restricted to range over sets and individuals only.So if the theory I have chosen leaves room for ungrounded collections, it isonly because I do not want to pick a fight unnecessarily. That it leaves roomfor individuals, on the other hand, is central to ensuring its applicability.

But if our theory of sets is pure, we cannot do this, at anyrate not directly: we are only entitled to apply the theorem to Ø and setsformed from it by iterations of the power-set operation; and it begins to seemmiraculous that mathematics applies to the world at all.If for some reason we were determined to study only the pure theory, allwouldnotbelostquiteyet,itistrue: wecouldtrytorepairthedamagelaterbyadding appropriate bridging principles connecting the pure sets of our theoryto the denizens of the real world that we want eventually to be able to count.Butitisveryhardtoseewhatthepointwouldbeofproceedinginthisfashion.Althoughourtheoryisnon-standardinthetworespectsjustmentioned, wehave sided with the majority in two others, the adoption of classical logic andthe acceptance of impredicative definitions. Denial of these two principleshas long been a badge of constructivism, but it is worth noting that in factthey are independent of each other, not just technically but philosophically:semi-intuitionists such as Poincar ́e argued against impredicative sets withoutquerying classical logic, while others (e.g. Lear 1977) argued for intuitionisticlogic in set theory without bringing impredicative sets into question.It is worth noting, too, that if it were only the proof-theoretic strength ofthe resulting system that concerned us, only the elimination of impredicativesets would represent a significant restriction. This is because there are meth-ods (such as the so-called negative translation) for re-interpreting the classicalconnectivesinanysentenceintuitionisticallysoastopreserveprovability(fromwhich, of course, we may deduce that the classical system is consistent if theintuitionistic one is). In the case of arithmetic, for which the result was provedby G ̈odel (1933), the translation is especially simple because the atomic sen-tences(i.e.numericalequations)areintuitionisticallydecidable,andhencecanbe left intact. In the case of set theory we have to translate the atomic formulax∈yinto its double negation, and the treatment of extensionality is alsorather delicate. This lessens somewhat the naturalness of the translation, andit is not as clear in this case as in the arithmetical one that its existence cre-ates problems for arguments that aim to reject excluded middle on grounds ofmanifestability (see Potter 1998).Nonetheless,anytranslation,whethernaturalornot,givesusarelativecon-sistency result. Impredicativity, by contrast, makes an enormous difference tothe formal strength of the first-order system we are studying, and it does soindependently of whether the underlying logic is classical. There are variousways of explaining the reason for this, but one is that impredicativity allowsfor elaborate feedback loops between different levels in the hierarchy, greatlyenriching its structure.

The use of the extensional mode is by nomeansconfinedtomathematics—itisacommonplaceofalmosteverysphereofdiscoursethat comesto mind —but inmathematics itis ofespecial import-ance. Mathematicians are persistently inclined, once they have proved twoproperties extensionally equivalent, to ignore the difference and treat themthereafter as one. They therefore find a particular utility in a language whichshares this blindness. Set theory thus gives us a way to systematize manners oftalkingandpatterns ofreasoning thatare alreadywidespreadin mathematics.But what we have introduced is not simply a language: the axioms of thetheorycarryexistentialcommitmentssignificantenoughfortheirtruthtobeamatterofsomecontroversy.

This lack of ontologicalinnocence has caused set theory to be pressed into the service of a differentand more ambitious project which aims not merely to express certain ways ofgrouping objects that are common in mathematics but to supply the objectsthemselves.The principal locus of this latter project has traditionally been the part ofmathematics that is usually called either ‘calculus’ or ‘analysis’ — that is,roughly, the study of real-valued functions of a real variable, together withthe corresponding case for the complex numbers. The idea of studying suchfunctions is certainly not new — Archimedes, for example, used methods thatrecognizably belong to the calculus to prove results on the areas of variousfigures — but the subject owes its modern importance to the extraordinarilyfruitfuldevelopmentswhichbeganwiththediscoveriesofNewtonandLeibnizinthelate17thcentury. Foroverahundredyears, however, themethodsthatmathematicians used to prove the theorems of the calculus made apparentlyineliminable use of diagrams.

Inevitably, then, it wasoverwhelmingly the latter that motivated mathematicians, not the former.Berkeley inThe Analyst(1734) famously mocked the unclarity and lack ofrigour to be found in the arguments used by early expositors of the calcu-lus, but his criticisms had little effect on the practice of mathematicians. Whateventually came to concern them were cases where appeal to diagrams wasshown to be capable of leading them into error. The examples that gave riseto this concern are well known. Here I shall mention one of the most strik-ing, which arises when we investigate the relationship between the two mostimportant properties that fall within the scope of the calculus, continuity anddifferentiability. A functionfof a real variable is said to becontinuousat anargumentaiff(x)tends tof(a)asxtends toa; it is said to bedifferentiableataiff(x)−f(a)x−atends to a limit asxtends toa, the limit being called thederivativeoffataand denotedf\u0002(a). Every differentiable function is continuous, butit is easy to give examples where the converse fails. The modulus functionx\u0013→|x|, for instance, is continuous but not differentiable at 0. If we call theset of points at which a continuous function fails to be differentiable itsexcep-tional set, it is then natural to wonder what sorts of sets can be exceptional inthis sense. It is not hard to see by extending the example of the modulus func-tion that every finite set of real numbers is exceptional. And by constructinga function which performs a damped oscillation we can see thatsomeinfinitesets, such as{1,1/2,1/4,...}, are exceptional. But intuitions derived from dia-grams suggest (or at any rate suggested to some 19th century analysts) thatthere should be some sense in which all exceptional sets are small. If, for ex-ample, we imagine a particle traversing the graph of a continuous function,then an exceptional point will be one at which the particle abruptly changesits direction in a discontinuous manner. This is an instance of a familiar no-tion from kinematics: it is what is supposed occurs in an elastic collision. Butcould a particle change direction discontinuously ateverymoment? It seemsclear that this is impossible. For this reason, or reasons similar to it, analystssupplied various properties of smallness which, they conjectured, all excep-tional sets must have.

By the end of this period it had thus become possible to proveall the results of the calculus solely on the assumption that the real numbersform what is called a complete ordered field.1This systematization of the calculus thus shifted the epistemic focus awayfrom what we can glean from diagrams and onto two issues which could nowbe seen to be distinct: the status of the symbolic reasoning used in diagram-free proofs; and the status of the initial assumption presupposed by that reas-oning, namely that the real numbers form a complete ordered field.The first of these issues was addressed above all by Frege, whoseBegriffs-schrift(1879) provided not only a notation for expressing arguments involvingmultiple generality but a codification of the rules of proof used in such ar-guments. Frege’s work was ignored, however: it was left to Peano to inventa more typographically tractable notation, and to others such as Russell andHilbert to turn the logic of multiple generality into a manageable tool for thecodification of mathematical reasoning. This logic came to be seen by some,indeed,asnotonlyatoolbutacanon: whetheranargumentcouldbesymbol-ized in the formal system came to be seen as a criterion of its very correctness.It was G ̈odel’s first incompleteness theorem that put paid to this inflated am-bitionbyshowingthatnoformalsystemcodifiesallthetypesofargumentthatwe are entitled to regard as correct.It is also worth adding the further caveat that even if a type of argumentcanbe codified within the currently accepted formal system (which in the presentworkis,asalreadynoted,takentobetheclassicalfirst-orderpredicatecalculuswith identity), this does not answer the epistemological question of how weknowthattheargumentisvalid: itmerelypostponesthatquestionbypalmingit off on the underlying logic. In particular, the fact that proofs in analysisproceed by modes of reasoning formalizable in the accepted formal systemdoes not in itself show that Kant was wrong when he talked of continuedappeal to intuition in mathematics: this further conclusion will follow onlyif there is a route independent of intuition to the correctness of the formalsystem.Nevertheless, it took some time for this further problem to emerge as acentralissueinthejustificationofmathematicalanalysis.

Itrelatestotheircertaintybecausetheconceptionoftherealnumbers to which Weierstrass’ axiomatization is answerable is not the onlyone that is available. To see why, we need to say a little more about the detailof his treatment. The characteristic form of argument that is deployed in thecalculus seemsprima facieto involve the idea of a real number quantitytendingto a limit. The method Weierstrass used for representing such argumentsreplaces this locution with quantified variables. The key point to note, ofcourse, is that the word ‘variable’ here is now to be understood in the sense inwhich it is used in logic, and there is no longer any requirement to conceive ofa quantity as actuallyvarying. This is what is usually known as theepsilon-deltamethod, so called because in textbook expositions it is traditional for epsilonand delta to be used as the variables. Thus Weierstrass treated the expressionf(x)tends tof(a)asxtends toaasmeaningthat(∀ε>0)(∃δ>0)(∀x∈R)(|x−a|<δ⇒|f(x)−f(a)|<ε).The epsilon-delta method is thus what finally allowed mathematicians to ban-ish the practice of glossing the definition of continuity asf(x)is infinitesimally close tof(a)whenxis infinitesimally close toa.This talk of infinitesimals had been one of the primary targets of Berkeley’sridicule inThe Analyst; but however much they tried to avoid it, mathem-aticians had not until Weierstrass seen how to eliminate it completely. Nowthey could, and did. For 80 years after Weierstrass it was a commonplacetaught to undergraduates that talk of infinitesimals was at best a non-rigorousheuristic for proof-searching and a quaint throwback to an earlier and moreprimitive era, at worst a dangerous invitation to serious logical error.But then, in the 1960s, the subject now known asnon-standardanalysis grewup, principally at the hands of Abraham Robinson. What he showed wasthat there is a conception of the continuum — let us call it thenon-standardconception — according to which thereareinfinitesimal quantities lying in it;and that this conception is just as consistent as the standard Weierstrassianone.The development of non-standard analysis has not in fact broken thestranglehold of classical analysis to any significant extent, but that seems tobe a matter of taste and practical utility rather than of necessity. Moreover,"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"86Introduction to Part IIthe development of non-standard analysis has led to some revisions in pre-Weierstrassian history. The most striking of these concerns a proof Cauchygave in hisCours d’Analyse(1821) that if a sequence of continuous functionsconverges pointwise to a limit functionf, then the limit function is also con-tinuous. When it is represented in epsilon-delta form, Cauchy’s proof is ex-posed as fallacious, since it then involves an illicit inversion of the order of twoof the quantifiers occurring in it. Indeed it is easy to come up with examplesshowing that Cauchy’s result cannot be true. In order to make it correct,we need to replace the reference to pointwise convergence with the strongernotion ofuniformconvergence. The difference between the two lies purely inthe order of the quantifiers in their epsilon-delta definitions; and it is lack ofattention to just this that Cauchy stands accused of.Thus the standard post-Weierstrassian view. But there is something verysuspect about it. The counterexamples one has to construct to show thatCauchy’s result is fallacious are extremely simple. It is enough to note, forinstance, that asntends to infinity,xntends to\u00060if0\u0001x<11ifx=1and the limit function is obviously discontinuous atx=1. It beggars beliefthat a mathematician of Cauchy’s ability would not have noticed this.A possible explanation for this puzzle has been provided by Lakatos (1978).He seized on the striking fact that there is a way of interpreting Cauchy’s res-ultastrueaboutfunctionsdefinednotonthestandardbutonthenon-standardcontinuum, and used this to argue that Cauchy was guilty of no logical fallacybutwassimplytalkingaboutadifferentsubjectfromWeierstrass. Thesugges-tion, then, is that the situation in analysis is analogous to that in the study ofaggregation which we described in part I. In both cases mathematicians wereworking with an inchoate blend of properties of two distinct (but related) con-cepts. The point to note here is the common role played in each narrative bythe process of axiomatization, which serves to clarify concepts by enunciatingtheir properties.But even when the concept of the continuum that is in play has been cla-rified sufficiently, a question still remains as to whether there is anything thatanswers to it. According to Kant, our knowledge of the truths of analysisis derived ultimately from our knowledge of the spatio-temporal structure ofexperience. A Weierstrassian axiomatization of analysis does nothing to chal-lengethisaccountunlessitcanbeshownhowitispossibletoconstructobjectssatisfying the axioms without recourse to that same spatio-temporal structure.The research programme that attempts to do this has dominated work in thefoundations of mathematics ever since Weierstrass."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Introduction to Part II87The first step in executing this programme is nowadays known asarithmet-izationand consists in the construction of a complete ordered field within thetheory of sets, taking the natural numbers as given. This step was carried outby Cantor (1872), Dedekind (1872), Heine (1872), M ́eray (1872), and others,using several quite distinct methods.But once again this postpones the Kantian problem rather than solving it.We still need to ground the knowledge of the natural numbers that these con-structions presuppose. This next step, which might be called theset-theorizationof arithmetic, is therefore to construct the natural numbers in pure set theory.Once again this can be done in quite distinct ways. The first construction tobecarriedoutinfulldetailiscontainedinDedekind’sWassindundwassollendieZahlen?(1888), but Frege’sDie Grundlagen der Arithmetik(1884) contains a sketchfrom which another workable treatment can be derived.As is so often the case in foundational matters, however, the logical direc-tion is the opposite of the direction of discovery, and we shall here follow theformer rather than the latter. Thus we begin this part of the book with Dede-kind’s construction of the natural numbers and end with the real numbers. Ifwe chain these together with the Weierstrassian account of the calculus, weobtain an embedding of real analysis in the theory of sets.

In this chapter we make a start on this project by considering thenatural numbers.5.1 ClosureWe focus first on the problem of identifying a structure which has all the rightalgebraicproperties for the natural numbers. (We defer consideration of theirorder properties to the next chapter.) Dedekind’s original (1888) treatment ofthis problem has scarcely been bettered since, and so we shall follow it quiteclosely here. The key to Dedekind’s treatment is something that he called a‘chain’ (Kette) but is nowadays more usually called aclosure.Definition.Suppose thatris a relation on a setA.

To get closure, we need to add in all their relatives,alltheirrelatives, and so onad infinitum. But what does ‘and so on’ mean here?We might be tempted to gloss it as ‘for any finite number of iterations’, butthat would, as Dedekind remarked in a letter to Keferstein, ‘contain the mostpernicious and obvious kind of vicious circle’ (van Heijenoort 1967, pp.100–01),sinceitisourintentiontousethisnotiontodefinewhatwemeanby‘finite’.Dedekind’s solution to this problem was to see that there is another, quitedifferent way of specifying what is meant by the closure of a set.

The intersection of allther-closed subsets ofAwhich containBwill be denotedClr(B)and calledther-closureofB.What makes this definition work is that any intersection ofr-closed sets isr-closed.

What Dedekind took as fundamental was the function whichtakes each natural number to its successor: the properties he required thisfunction to have are that no two numbers have the same successor (i.e. thesuccessor function is one-to-one), that zero is not the successor of any naturalnumber, and that every number is in the closure of zero with respect to thesuccessor function. We shall call a structure which has these properties a‘Dedekind algebra’ in his honour.Definition.ADedekind algebrais a structure(A,f)such thatfis a one-to-one function fromAto itself andA=Clf(a)for somea∈A\u0001f[A].Itisobviousthatif(A,f)isaDedekindalgebra, thenAisisinfinite. Byusingthe technique of closures, we can easily show, conversely, that any infinite setcontains a Dedekind algebra.(5.2.1)Theorem.There exists a (pure) Dedekind algebra.Proof. Suppose thatBis any (pure) infinite set. (The existence of such sets isguaranteedbytheaxiomofinfinity.) Thenthereisbyhypothesisaone-to-onefunctiongfromBinto itself that is not onto. SoBhas an elementawhich isnot in the image ofg.IfweletA=Clg(a)andf=g|A, it is evident that(A,f)is a Dedekind algebra.This theorem is needed so that we can justify the following definition.Definition.We choose once for all some (pure) Dedekind algebra (of lowestpossible birthday) and denote it(ωωωω,s). The elements ofωωωωare callednaturalnumbers: the functionsis called thesuccessor functiononωωωω.The parenthetical stipulation that the Dedekind algebra we choose should bepure and of lowest possible birthday is of no great mathematical import, butit does at least prevent Julius Caesar from being a natural number, an out-come of notorious concern to Frege (1884). Whether a set is the carrier setof a Dedekind algebra is solely a matter of cardinality, and the lowest level atwhich a pure set of the appropriate size occurs is the first limit level. So theparentheticalstipulationhastheeffectoffixingthelevelatwhichthesetofnat-ural numbers occurs in the hierarchy. Nonetheless, I should stress that thesestipulations are still very far from determining even the carrier set uniquely,let alone the successor function: these choices are wholly conventional.Mathematicians are inclined to avoid such vagueness by fixing on one andignoring any rivals. One popular choice is to makeωωωωthe closure of Ø underthe operationa\u0013→a∪{a}. But defining the natural numbers in this waymakes many more things true about them than we want: it becomes the casethat Ø∈2, for instance. This is of course another instance of the problem ofdoing too much that we met in §4.6 when we defined the ordered pair. Theway out we took then was to give an explicit definition but make clear that"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Definition of natural numbers91we did not claim to be defining the notion of ordered pair of which we had aprior grasp. We could evidently do the same here: use the standard explicitdefinition just mentioned but make clear that what we have defined are notreallynatural numbers (sinceof coursethe empty set is not a member of thenumber two). For purely mathematical purposes that might do well enough(which is presumably why mathematicians do it), but it would scarcely help usintheproject weareengaged inhere. Whatallowed ustoadopt Kuratowski’sersatz ordered pairs with a tolerably clear conscience was that we did notpretend our aim in this book was to provide an account of the genuine article.Butwhenitcomestonumbers,thingsstanddifferently. Weareconcernedherewith a foundational project: we aim to assess, and hence should try to presentthe best version of, the proposal that set theory could serve as a foundationfor arithmetic, in the sense of explicitly supplying its content, or at any rate ofexplaining our knowledge of it.So what else can we do? One possibility would be to add a new primitive,‘s’, to our language, defineωωωωto be its domain, and add the stipulation that(ωωωω,s)is a Dedekind algebra to our system as an extra axiom. This procedurewould get round the problem of doing too much, but was famously stigmat-ized by Russell for the opposite vice of doing too little and hence having ‘theadvantages of theft over honest toil’ (1919, p.71). Certainly if we planned touse the device of postulation as a means of avoiding the tedious business ofproving theorem 5.2.1, Russell’s jibe would be entirely fair. But what if weagreed to adopt the method of postulationonlyin cases where a proof is avail-able that the procedure is conservative? In that case there would no longer bea sense of having got something for nothing, since we should still have to sup-ply our proof of the theorem, slightly repackaged now in metalinguistic formas a proof of the conservativeness of the postulation. The problem is ratherthat we still owe an explanation of why a proof of conservativeness is enough.We need to explain, that is to say, how the new primitive we introduce gainsa meaning if it is conservative (and, equally, how it fails to gain a meaning ifnot).The formal development that follows is neutral between these options, ofcourse. All we shall need in proofs is that(ωωωω,s)is a Dedekind algebra, and itwill not matter which device was used to achieve this.By definition there is an element 0∈ωωωω\u0001s[ωωωω] such thatωωωω=Cls(0).Moreover,ωωωω=Cls(0)={0}∪Cls(s(0))[proposition 5.1.1(a)]={0}∪s[Cls(0)] [proposition 5.1.1(b)]={0}∪s[ωωωω],and so if 0\u0002∈ωωωω\u0001s[ωωωω], then 0=0\u0002.

The last ofthem is standardly known as theprinciple of mathematical induction. For conveni-ence we shall restate it in a slightly different form.(5.2.2)Simple induction scheme.IfΦ(n)is a formula,(Φ(0)and(∀n∈ωωωω)(Φ(n)⇒Φ(n+1)))⇒(∀n∈ωωωω)Φ(n).Proof.

We shall discuss the effects of this licence at various points in whatfollows.The elementary arithmetic of the natural numbers has of course beenknown for thousands of years — Euclid (c.300B.C.) describes elementarynumber theory (divisibility, prime numbers, etc.) in some detail — but thecentrality of induction did not emerge until much more recently. Indeed in-duction seems hardly to have been used explicitly as a method of proof untilthemid-17thcentury(Pascal1665); whatoldertextscontaininsteadaremuchvaguer instructions to repeat an argument ‘as many times as required’ or il-lustrations of general reduction methods in particular cases.5.3 RecursionA family whose indexing set isωωωω(or, what is the same thing, a function whosedomain isωωωω) is often called aninfinite sequence(or sometimes just asequence).There is a standard method of defining a sequence by what is known asre-cursion: this consists in defining the initial termx0of the sequence and thendefiningxn+1in terms ofxn.

One thing worth stressing about this development is how few assump-tions we need to make in order to ground it. Another is that the assumptionsin question can be stated as a self-standing theory quite independent of thetheory of sets. In order to state this theory, we need a language which hasa unary function symbolS, but we shall also (for convenience — we couldeliminate it if we wanted) suppose that we have a primitive constant 0. Theaxioms are then as follows:(∀x)(∀y)(Sx=Sy⇒x=y)(∀x)Sx\u0007=0(∀X)((X(0)and(∀x)(X(x)⇒X(Sx)))⇒(∀x)Xx)."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Peano arithmetic99This theory is calledsecond-order Peano arithmeticand denotedPA2. Expressedin these terms our definition in §5.2 amounts to the stipulation that(ωωωω,s,0)should be a model ofPA2, and corollary 5.3.2 is the statement thatPA2iscategorical.If we intended an independent development of this theory, however, wemight be troubled by the fact that the third axiom, the induction axiom, issecond-order. If we were determined that our theory should be first-order, wewould be forced to replace it with its first-order surrogate,(Φ(0)and(∀x)(Φ(x)⇒Φ(Sx)))⇒(∀x)Φ(x)for any formulaΦ. What results from substituting this first-order scheme forthesecond-orderinductionaxiomisknownastheelementarytheoryofthesuccessorfunction. It is used as a standard example in textbooks on model theory, whichoften include the proof that it is complete, i.e. that there is nothing to be saidin a first-order language about the successor function that does not followfrom these axioms. It follows immediately from this completeness result thatthe elementary theory of the successor function is decidable. Textbooks alsocontain the proof that the theory is not finitely axiomatizable.But the particular axiom scheme we have given is by no means inevitable.We could, for instance, have substituted for it the axioms(∀x)(∃y)(x=0orx=Sy)(∀x)SS...S\b\t\u000bntermsx\u0007=xfor everyn\u00021.The fact that this substitution is possible should arouse the suspicion that theelementary theory of the successor function is actually rather weak. And so itproves. The trouble is that in the theory as now constituted we are assertingonly those instances of induction that can be expressed in a language contain-ing 0 andS, and it turns out that hardly anything of mathematical interestcanbe so expressed.

The first-order theory that results from thisextension, which is calledPeano arithmeticorPA, is distinctly non-trivial.Nevertheless, it follows easily from the compactness theorem thatPAis notcategorical, and hence that there are true second-order sentences (such as theinduction axiom itself) which it does not entail. Not only that, but there areeven true sentences in the first-order language of arithmetic itself whichPAdoes not entail (G ̈odel 1931). On the other hand, it is surprising, after ourcautionary experience with addition and multiplication, to discover that wedo not need to posit an endless succession of new primitives, one for expo-nentiation, one for the factorial function, and one for every other primitiverecursive function: once we have addition and multiplication, all the otherprimitive recursive functions are definable inPA(G ̈odel 1931). It is above allthis remarkable stability that makesPAseem to be something more than amerely accidental fragment of the second-order theoryPA2.What gives Peano arithmetic this (relative) strength is the complexity gen-erated by theinterplaybetween addition and multiplication in the inductionscheme. As we have just noted, the elementary theory of addition is completeand therefore weaker thanPA.Skolem arithmetic, the elementary theory of mul-tiplication on its own (i.e. without + orS), is also complete (Skolem 1931) andeven finitely axiomatizable (Cegielski 1981), so it is again significantly weakerthanPA.PAitself, by contrast, suffices to derive a large amount of highly non-trivial mathematics. Consider, for example, the part of arithmetic knownas number theory. This begins with the definition of divisibility: the formula(∃r∈ωωωω)(n=mr)is writtenm|nand read ‘mdividesn’.

Whenever we are confrontedwith a proof of an arithmetical proposition, there will be a question whetherthe properties the induction principle is applied to in the course of the proofcan be defined using first-order arithmetical formulae.

This is not provable inPA, but it must have a set-theoretic proof, sincewe have proved in set theory thatPAhas a model.NotesThe set-theoretic construction of the natural numbers we have given here isdue to Dedekind (1888). The following year Peano (1889) converted it into anaxiom system now known almost universally as Peano’s axioms. In chapter 1we described, even if we did not entirely explain, the rise of first-order logic asthe supposed framework for rigorous mathematics. This made it natural forPA, the first-order fragment of Peano’s axioms, to be the object of intensivestudy. For the results of this study consult Kaye 1991.

One ofthe most famous instances is Dirichlet’s theorem that ifrandsare coprime,there are infinitely many prime numbers of the formrn+s. Dirichlet’s (1837)proof of this uses elegant methods in complex function theory: for a modernpresentation see Serre 1973.

As an example of this, if the structure(A,\u0001)is a partially ordered set andB⊆A, then in any reference toBas a partiallyordered set without further qualification it will invariably be(B,\u0001B), i.e.Bwith the partial ordering it inherits fromAby restriction, that is meant.

One such danger is exemplified bythe following two theorems.Completeness theorem.Every consistent first-order theory has a set-theoretic model.L ̈owenheim/Skolem theorem.Every structure is elementarily equival-ent to a countable structure.Thesetwotheorems oflogichave beenused tomount thefollowing argumentagainst a realist understanding of set theory. Suppose that I am a realist. IbelievethattheaxiomsofZUaretrueandhenceconsistent. Ithereforebelievethattheset-theoreticformalizationoftheclaimthattheyareconsistentistrue,even though it is not provable from the axioms.1Because of the two theorems1It is at this point that the realist parts company with the formalist: formalists might perhapshave a non-mathematical belief thatZUis consistent, not because it is true but on inductivegrounds, for instance; however, they would not take that as a reason to believe the set-theoreticclaim obtained by formalizing this belief."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Skolem’s paradox115just quoted, therefore, I ought also to believe thatZUhas a countable set-theoretic model (and even a model whose domain isωωωω). Every theorem ofZUis true in this model: in particular, therefore, it is true in the model thatP(ωωωω)isuncountable. Nevertheless,torepeat,themodeliscountable. ThisisknownasSkolem’s paradox.But it is a paradox only in the sense that it is initially surprising, not thatit is a contradiction, for its resolution is straightforward. What it means for aset to be uncountable is expressed by a fairly complicated logical expressioninvolving∈; what it means for a set to be uncountablein the modelis obtainedby replacing∈with whatever relation is the interpretation of ‘∈’ in the model,and then relativizing all the quantifiers to the domain of the model. The res-ulting sentence will not express at all the same claim as that the set in questionis actually uncountable. So Skolem’s paradox, at least in the form we havebeen considering here, is certainly very far from being a formal contradic-tion. When taken at face value, indeed, it is hard even to find it especiallysurprising.But consider now what happens if we temporarily adopt a metalinguisticperspective from which to study our own set-theoretic language, the languagewe have been using in the bulk of this book so far, which is now regardedas the object language. By running through the above argument once more,we discover from this new perspective that set theory has a countable model.Thisisdisconcertingbecauseitpromptsthethoughtthatthiscountablemodelmight beourmodel: theintendedmodel could turn out — behind our backs —to be countable.Skolem’s paradox has therefore been used by various authors as a spring-board to an argument that there are no uncountable sets. Thus Kaufmann(1930,ch.5),forexample,usedittoquestionthecoherenceofimpredicativelyspecified sets; and Wright (1985) has essayed a direct argument that we can-not grasp the notion of an arbitrary subset of a given infinite set such as theset of natural numbers.2But we need to be careful. For the conclusion wehave reached in the metalanguage is that the object language theoryZUhasa countable model. If we try to re-express this in the object language, we getnot a contradictory thought but no thought at all. There is no formula in theobject language expressing what we mean when we say in the metalanguagethat a set is countable.Nonetheless, we are not yet quite ready to conclude that the theorem iswithout philosophical consequences. Putnam (1980), for instance, has used ittomountachallengeonthe‘moderaterealistpositionwhichseekstopreservethe centrality of the classical notions of truth and reference without postulat-2Even if Wright’s argument works, it is not clear that it should worry the platonist, at least inthe form in which Wright presents it, since it appeals to constructivist assumptions which theplatonist need feel under no pressure to accept (see Clark 1993b)."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"116Countinging nonnatural mental powers’.

It remains controversialwhether the ordinal use is primary (see Dummett 1991, p.293). In Dede-kind’s treatment the principle which justifies using numbers for counting wasderived as a theorem. Frege, by contrast, proposed to move in the oppositedirection, taking this theorem as his starting point and deriving the propertiesof natural numbers from it. This project stalled when he unwisely used aninconsistent theory to justify the procedure, but interest in it was renewed byWright(1983).

In that case, he says,there would be nothing to prevent us, in case we so desired, from filling up its gaps inthought and thus making it continuous; this filling up would consist in a creation ofnew points and would have to be carried out in accordance with the above principle.He does not go into the question of whether it is possible to complete time inthe same manner. The Kantian resonance is evident: we can represent spaceto ourselves as continuous whether or not it really is. Something similar is tobe found in Poincar ́e’s view that space is not revealed to us as a continuumdirectly by the senses. It is necessary, he says, ‘that by an active operation ofthe mind we agree to consider two states of consciousness as identical bydis-regardingtheir differences’ (1913, ch.III, §3). Many other authors have simplytaken it as intuitively obvious that this is how space is. The weakness of thisis that the completeness principle makes a claim aboutarbitrarysubsets of therealline,anditisfarfromclearthatourintuitionsaboutthesearereliable: see§15.7 for a theorem about arbitrary subsets of the plane which it takes somemathematical sophistication not to regard as an obvious falsehood.If we are hesitant about arguing for completeness directly, an alternativemight be to argue that the intermediate value theorem — that every con-tinuous function on the real line has the intermediate value property — is anobvious truth.

What constitutes winning varies depending on thegame that is being played, of course; but let us denote byAthe set of playswhich are wins for the first player. We shall make no assumptions at all aboutAat this stage, soeverysubsetAof the Baire lineωωωωωωωωconstitutes the first-personwins of some game. The only simplifying assumption we make is that thereare no draws, so every play which does not belong toAis automatically a winfor the second player.

Similarly, a winning strategy for the second player is a functionτfrom\u0003n∈ωωωω2n+1ωωωωtoωωωωsuch that every playxwhich conforms to it, in the sense thatx(2n+1)=τ(x(0),x(1),...,x(2n))for alln,isawinforthesecondplayer; andwewrites∗τforthegameinwhichthefirstplayer’smovesareenumeratedbysandthesecondplayerfollowsthestrategyτin response."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"128LinesLet us say that a game isdeterminedif one or other player has a winningstrategy.

Our primary goal in this chapter will be the construction ofsuch a set in our default theoryZU. We went some way towards this in thelast chapter when we showed how to construct a continuum. But an orderingis not enough structure for the purpose of measurement: addition and mul-tiplication cannot be defined in terms of order structure alone. To see why,justconsidera numberlinemade outof elastic: stretchingthe elasticina non-uniform manner will distort thealgebraicrelations between the numbers butleave their order relations intact. So if we are to carry out our programme wemust start afresh: our strategy will be to use the setωωωωof natural numbers toconstruct in turn setsZ(of integers),Q(of rational numbers) andR(of realnumbers) endowed with an algebraic structure as well as an ordering.8.1 Equivalence relationsOur constructions of the first two of these sets will make use of a standardtechnique of set construction known as the ‘method of equivalence classes’.Definition.A relation on a setAis called anequivalence relationif it istransitive, reflexive and symmetric.The smallest equivalence relation on a setAis the diagonal relation definedby equalityx=y.Definition.Theequivalence classesof an equivalence relationsonAarethe setss[a]={x∈A:asx}.

The guiding idea is that every integer can bewritten in the formm−nwithm,n∈ωωωω.

So let us write this last relation as(m,n)∼(m\u0002,n\u0002):itis obviously an equivalence relation, so we can letZ=(ωωωω×ωωωω)/∼. Thedefinitions of addition, multiplication and the ordering relation can easily beworked out by informal calculations. For instance, the calculation(m−n)+(m\u0002−n\u0002)=(m+m\u0002)−(n+n\u0002)suggeststhat,writing[m,n]fortheequivalenceclassoftheorderedpair(m,n)with respect to∼, we should define[m,n]+[m\u0002,n\u0002]=[m+m\u0002,n+n\u0002].Similarly, we want(m−n)(m\u0002−n\u0002)=(mm\u0002+nn\u0002)−(mn\u0002+nm\u0002),and so we define[m,n][m\u0002,n\u0002]=[mm\u0002+nn\u0002,mn\u0002+nm\u0002].And in order for it to be the case thatm−n\u0001m\u0002−n\u0002⇔m+n\u0002\u0001n+m\u0002,we need to define[m,n]\u0001[m\u0002,n\u0002]⇔m+n\u0002\u0001n+m\u0002.Before going any further we ought first to check these definitions for con-sistency, i.e. show that they are independent of the particular ordered pairschosen to represent the equivalence classes. But this is in each case easy.Then we need to embed the natural numbers in this construction by associat-ing each natural numbernwith the integern−0, i.e. by lettingnZ=[n,0].Once all this is done, it is a straightforward matter to check that the standardalgebraic properties of the integers are satisfied by our constructions, and thusto prove the following theorem.(8.2.1)Theorem.The setZhas defined on it(O) a relation\u0001,(A) an operation(j,k)\u0013→j+k,(M) an operation(j,k)\u0013→jk,(I) a functionn\u0013→nZfromωωωωtoZ"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"132Real numbersThey have these properties:(A1)(∀j,k,l∈Z)j+(k+l)=(j+k)+l;(A2)(∀k∈Z)k+0Z=k;(A3)(∀k∈Z)(∃k\u0002∈Z)k+k\u0002=0Z;(A4)(∀j,k∈Z)j+k=k+j;(M1)(∀j,k,l∈Z)(jk)l=(jk)l;(M2)(∀k∈Z)k1Z=k;(M3)(∀j,k∈Z)jk=kj;(M4)(∀j,k∈Z)(jk=0Z⇒j=0Zork=0Z);(AM)(∀j,k,l∈Z)j(k+l)=jk+jl;(O)\u0001is a total ordering onZ;(OA)(∀j,k,l∈Z)(j\u0001k⇒j+l\u0001j+l);(OM)(∀j,k,l∈Z)(j\u0001kandl\u00020⇒jl\u0001kl);(IA)(∀m,n∈ωωωω)(m+n)Z=mZ+nZ;(IM)(∀m,n∈ωωωω)(mn)Z=mZnZ;(IO)(∀m,n∈ωωωω)(m\u0001n⇔mZ\u0001nZ).(8.2.2)Proposition.

Finally we wish to identify any integerkwith therational numberk/1, so we definekQ=[k,1].Many of the purely algebraic properties of the rational numbers thus definedare summarized by saying that they form anordered field. The definition is asfollows.Definition.Anordered fieldis a setFendowed with(O) a relation\u0001,(A) an operation(x,y)\u0013→x+y,(M) an operation(x,y)\u0013→xy,(I) a functionk\u0013→kFfromZtoF.They are required to have the following properties:(A1)(∀x,y,z∈F)x+(y+z)=(x+y)+z;"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"134Real numbers(A2)(∀y∈F)y+0F=y;(A3)(∀y∈F)(∃y\u0002∈F)y+y\u0002=0F;(A4)(∀x,y∈F)x+y=y+x;(M1)(∀x,y,z∈F)(xy)z=x(yz);(M2)(∀y∈F)y1F=y;(M3)(∀x,y∈F)xy=yx;(M4)(∀x∈F\u0001{0F})(∃x\u0002∈F\u0001{0F})xx\u0002=1F;(AM)(∀x,y,z∈F)x(y+z)=xy+xz;(O)\u0001is a total ordering onF;(OA)(∀x,y,z∈F)(x\u0001y⇒x+z\u0001x+z);(OM)(∀x,y,z∈F)(x\u0001yandz\u00020⇒xz\u0001yz);(IA)(∀j,k∈Z)(j+k)F=jF+kF;(IM)(∀j,k∈Z)(jk)F=jFkF;(IO)(∀j,k∈Z)(j\u0001k⇔jF\u0001kF).We shall take for granted the development of the arithmetic of elements ofan ordered field from this definition. Thus, for instance, we shall take it forgranted that wecan define theabsolutevalueof an elementxof an orderedfieldFby letting|x|=\u0006xifx\u000200 otherwise.Note that any ordered field is a line, since ifx<y, thenx<12(x+y)<y.The definition we have given translates easily into a list of axioms in a first-order language containing as its non-logical symbols only addition, multiplic-ation and the order relation. So the notion of an ordered field is finitely first-order axiomatizable. The development of the properties of ordered fields weare referring to is representable by means of derivations from these axioms infirst-order logic.(8.3.1)Theorem. Qis an ordered field.(8.3.2)Proposition. Qis countable.Proof.Zis countable [proposition 8.2.2], henceZ×(Z\u0001{0})is countable,henceZ×(Z\u0001{0})/∼is countable."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Real numbers135(8.3.3)Corollary.The ordered set(Q,\u0001)is isomorphic to(Q,\u0001).Proof.Qis a line since it is an ordered field; and we have just shown that itis countable.

The real lineRhas a countable dense subset, which is isomorphic tothe ordered setQ. Now it is easy to check that the operation of addition onQis normal in each variable. So we can use proposition 7.3.5 to extend itto an operation of addition on the completionR. It is then a straightforward(if tedious) matter to check that all the properties of addition required by thedefinition of an ordered field (associativity, commutativity, etc.) are satisfiedby the operation onRthus defined.Inmuchthesamewayitiseasytoshowthattheoperationofmultiplicationby a positive rational number is normal, so we can extend it so as to definemultiplication by a positive real number. Then we can use this to define mul-tiplication by a negative real number in the obvious way. Checking that theoperationthusdefinedsatisfiestherequirementsofthedefinitionisevenmoretedious than in the case of addition.We have thus carried out (or, to be more accurate, sketched) the constructionof a complete ordered field. The method of construction is not unique, ofcourse: there are other quite different ways of proving theorem 8.4.1 (for in-stance,byusingequivalenceclassesofCauchysequencesofrationalnumbers).However, although the condition of being a complete ordered field does notdetermine a unique structure, all such structures are isomorphic (see corollary8.7.6 below). So we are in a similar position to the one we found ourselves inwhen we defined the set of natural numbers: we need to pick one structure ofa certain sort, but any we do pick has accidental properties we do not want.We shall not repeat the comments we made there about this dilemma.Definition.We choose some (pure) complete ordered field (of lowest pos-sible birthday): we denote itRand call its membersreal numbers.We noted in the Introduction that a rigorous development of the calculus offunctions of a real variable is available, based on the assumption that the realnumbers form a complete ordered field. If we simply appended that rigorousdevelopment at this point, we would thus obtain a representation of a largepart of mathematics inZU.But what would that show? At the very least, it would give us anotherrelative consistency result: ifZUis consistent, so is the Weierstrassian theory"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"136Real numbersof the continuum. But if the further step of reducing set theory to some sortof logic were possible, we could say much more, for we should then haveachieved a species of logicism — a grounding of the calculus in logic. Andif the logic in question were knowable independent of intuition, this wouldpresumably constitute a final refutation of Kant’s view. But, as we saw in partI, the project of reducing set theory to anything deserving the name of logicis fraught with difficulty. And in any case it is far from clear that the logic inquestion here could reasonably be regarded as analytic in Kant’s sense. Sothe work presented here falls some way short of definitively refuting Kant.Nonetheless, the grounding of analysis in set theory, even if it does notrefute Kant outright, does something to weaken his case. For it seems muchlesspersuasiveinthecaseofsettheorythanitdidinthetheoryofrealnumbersto argue that the intuitions we need to ground our knowledge of it are spatio-temporal in character. It is for this reason that the set-theoretic reduction ofmathematics has given rise to a tradition, starting perhaps with Dedekind andthen progressing through G ̈odel to Dummett, which conceives of reason ascapable of constructing intuitions from the structure not of spatio-temporalexperience but of thought itself.8.5 The uncountability of the real numbersFrom the work we have done we can deduce thatRis uncountable, but ourroute to this conclusion has been rather indirect. In view of the historicaland philosophical importance of the result, let us allow ourselves the luxuryof a second, more direct proof. We start by defining a set much favouredby analysts as a tool in constructing counterexamples. Writing [a,b] for theclosed, bounded interval{x∈R:a\u0001x\u0001b}as usual, we letK0=[0,1]K1=[0,13]∪[23,1]K2=[0,19]∪[29,13]∪[23,79]∪[89,1]...ThenCantor’s ternary setisK=\u0001n∈ωωωωKn.Otherwise put,Kis the closed set we get from the unit interval if we removeits open middle third, remove the middle third of each of the two pieces re-maining, remove the middle thirds of each of the four pieces remaining afterthat, and so on.01929798913231"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The uncountability of the real numbers137Yet another way of visualizing it is as the set of those real numbers of theform\r∞n=1sn/3nwithsn=0 or 2 for alln, i.e. numbers between 0 and 1 withternaryexpansions(representationstothebase3)inwhichthedigit1doesnotoccur.Suppose now thatsis any sequence of real numbers.

This argu-ment has been the focus of a great deal of criticism. One complaint that iscertainly unfair is that the proof is inexplicit: it does not exhibit anyparticularreal number that we cannot count, but then we would not expect it to; whatit does is to generate from any sequence of real numbers a number not in therange of that sequence. A complaint that has more justice is that the proof isproblematic not for want of explicitness but because it isimpredicative.

This is the reason why the proof of uncountability is unacceptable tothe constructivist: the objection is that although we have definedf(s)expli-citly, we have done so only in terms ofs. In truth, the point might be betterput by saying that thedefinitionof the real numbers is impredicative, since theproof of uncountability does no more than exploit the definition. What itshould remind us of, at any rate, is that the failure of the countable line tomodel the continuum arises only because we requireallcontinuous functionsto have the intermediate value property, including ones that are not definablein first-order terms.8.6 Algebraic real numbersThe theory consisting of all the sentences in thefirst-orderlanguage ofordered fields that are true of the real numbers has non-isomorphic mod-els, which are known asreal-closed fields. The theory so described is obvi-ously complete, but it also turns out, much less obviously, to be axiomatizable(Tarski 1948). Since the language of ordered fields is countable, model theory(the L ̈owenheim/Skolem theorem) tells us that the theory must have a count-able model, and indeed that there must be a model of it that is a subfield ofR.The minimal such example is the set of algebraic real numbers.Definition.A real number is said to bealgebraicif it is a root of a polyno-mial equation with rational coefficients;transcendentalif not. The set of allalgebraic real numbers is denotedA.We shall not here make the detour into algebra necessary to demonstrate thatAis indeed a real-closed field (or even that it is a field). However, we donot need to use either this last fact or the model-theoretic considerations justmentioned in order to show that the algebraic numbers are countable.(8.6.1)Proposition. Ais countable.Proof. The setQof rational numbers is countable [proposition 8.3.2]. So theset String(Q)of strings of rational numbers is countable [proposition 6.5.3].SothesetQ[x]ofpolynomialsintheindeterminatexwithrationalcoefficientsis countable (since each of them can be represented by the string consisting ofits coefficients). SoQ[x]×ωωωωis countable [proposition 6.5.1]. Now take anyordered pair(p,r)in this last set: definef(p,r)to be therth real root of theequationp(x)=0, if such a root exists; and 0 otherwise. Thenfmaps thecountable setQ[x]×ωωωωontoA(since a polynomial of degreenhas at mostnreal roots). ThereforeAis countable too."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Algebraic real numbers139(8.6.2)Corollary.There exist transcendental real numbers.Proof.Ais countable;Ris not.AroundthetimethatCantordiscoveredthisproofoftheirexistencein(1874),other mathematicians were finding explicit examples of transcendental num-bers: Liouville had shown (1844) that\r∞n=11/kn!is transcendental for anyintegerk>1; then Hermite (1873) proved thateis transcendental, andLindemann (1882) proved thatπis. Various other examples were discoveredsubsequently: for instance, it was proved in 1930 that 2√2is transcendental.So Cantor was not at this point proving something new. Moreover, althoughhis proof is admittedly somewhat swifter than Liouville’s (and of course re-veals connections that the other does not), it has seemed clear to various au-thors (e.g. Kac and Ullam 1968; G. H. Moore 1982) that this brevity comesat the price that it proves the existence of a transcendental number withoutproviding a means of finding an example. This is quite wrong, however: thedifference between these proofs and Cantor’s isnotthat they are any moreexplicit; the method we have given for counting the algebraic numbers couldeasily be made effective, and Cantor’s diagonal argument would then give usan explicit construction of a transcendental real number.The objection to Cantor’s method of obtaining a transcendental numberis not that it is not explicit, therefore, but only that it is not pretty. The de-pendence of the roots of a polynomial on its coefficients, although of coursecontinuous, is computationally very unstable: Wilkinson (1959) notes, for in-stance, that if we perturb just one of the coefficients of the polynomial(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)...(x+20)by 2−23we obtain a polynomial with only 10 real roots whose other 10 rootsall have imaginary parts between 0.8 and 3. So although we could turn Can-tor’s procedure into an algorithm to calculate a transcendental number indecimal notation to any required degree of accuracy, some care is requiredto ensure that it is not too demanding computationally (see Davenport, Siretand Tournier 1993, §3.2.1). It turns out, in fact, that thereisa reasonablealgorithm of complexityO(n2log2nloglogn)(Gray 1994), but plainly if whatwewantisatranscendentalnumberexpressedindecimalnotation,Liouville’smethod is much simpler: puttingk=10 gives us, without doing any compu-tational work, the explicit example∞\u000en=1110n!=0.110001000...(known as Liouville’s number).

They may, however, differ in regard to hownatural they are, or how genuinely mathematical. These are distinct (thoughrelated) criteria for assessing examples, the first fairly precise, the second lessso. An example isnaturalif it is independent of any arbitrary choice, such as achoice of representational scheme or of coding. Both Liouville’s number andCantor’s transcendental numbers are on this criterion unnatural — indeed byvarying the enumeration of the algebraic numbers that is diagonalized, Can-tor’s method can be made to produce any transcendental number whatever(Gray 1994) — wherease,πand 2√2are natural, since no arbitrary choicesare involved in their definitions.

Moreover, the prime subfield ofQis justQitself, so we may think ofQas being theminimumordered field: every ordered field contains a copy ofit.

It is easyto check thatfis an isomorphism of ordered fields.One consequence of this theorem is that Archimedes’ principle cannot beexpressed in the first-order language of ordered fields (since there is an upperbound to the cardinalities of its models). Another is that our construction intheorem 8.4.1 would not have worked if the ordered field we started fromhad not been archimedean: however we try to extend the operations froma non-archimedean ordered field to its order-completion, we shall inevitablyfind that some of the ordered field properties fail.(8.7.6)Corollary.Any complete ordered field is isomorphic toR.Proof.

The image of this embedding is complete and denseinRand must therefore be equal toR.Theorem 8.7.5 also provides us with a characterization of the ordered fieldof real numbers by a sort of maximality property: the real numbers are (upto isomorphism) the only ordered field in which every archimedean orderedfield can be embedded.In fact the whole of this theory can be generalized to the case of an orderedgroup, i.e. an ordered set on which only anadditionfunction is defined satisfy-ing (A1)–(A4), (O) and (OA) above. An ordered group is said to bearchimedeanif for allx,y>0 there existsnsuch thatx+x+···+x\b\t\u000bnterms>y.The only ordered group in which every archimedean ordered group can beembedded is (up to isomorphism) the additive group of the real numbers (seeWarner 1968, §43).

If we succeed in convincing ourselves of this, the maximalitycondition can then be presented as a natural completion of the conception:a line in space, even if it is not itself complete, will be embeddable in thecomplete group of real numbers, bearing out Dedekind’s idea of ‘filling up itsgaps in thought and thus making it continuous’.8.8 Non-standard ordered fieldsSuppose now that we expand our first-order language so as to include a con-stant for every real number and a relation symbol for every relation onRthat is definable in set theory: call this theextendedlanguage. It is an easyconsequence of the compactness theorem for first-order logic that the set ofsentencesof thislanguage that aretrue about thereal numbers hasother non-isomorphic set-theoretic models. These other models are callednon-standardordered fields.As A. Robinson (1961) was the first to observe, this gives us an elegant newmethod of proof: to prove that a sentenceΦin the extended language is trueaboutR, move to the non-standard fieldR∗and prove thatΦis true there;it follows thatΦis true inRtoo. The method is non-constructive since itsbasis is model-theoretic: once we have a non-standard proof ofΦ, we canbe confident that a standard proof exists, but there is no general method ofconversion,andthestandardproofmaymakeuseofmuchhigherlevelsintheset-theoretichierarchythanthenon-standardone(HensonandKeisler1986).Non-standard analysis therefore conforms to a pattern according to whichan ideal theory (non-standard analysis) is superimposed on a real theory (theconventional theory of the Weierstrassian continuum). No requirement is im-posed that the entities apparently referred to in the ideal theory (the infinites-imals)shouldberegardedasrealobjects. Theirreliabilityisguaranteedratherbyaproofofconservativeness. Andtheirutilityarisesbecausetheysometimesallow us to eliminate higher-order (hence abstract and therefore perhaps con-ceptually difficult) objects from proofs, with the result that the non-standardproofs may be easier for us humans to find and understand than the standardones; or perhaps the proofs using infinitesimals are much shorter. (This is nota realization of Hilbert’s programme because the proof of conservativeness isnot only non-finitary but non-constructive: indeed it even makes essential useof the axiom of choice.)A non-standard field must contain the real numbers as a proper subfieldand hence is non-archimedean, but the converse need not hold: the non-archimedean fieldQ(ε), for instance, is not non-standard because there arefirst-order properties expressible in the extended language which distinguishit fromR."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Non-standard ordered fields145Proponents of non-standard analysis have amassed various quotations insupport of the notion that it realizes the intentions of those earlier analystswho made use of the method of infinitesimals. Cauchy, for instance, thoughtthat this methodcanandmustbeusedasameansofdiscoveryorofproof...butinfinitesimalquantitiesshould never, in my opinion, be admitted in the final equations, where their presencewould be without purpose or utility. (1844, p.13)And Leibniz, the originator of the method, said (in a letter to Varignon of1702) thatif someone refuses to admit infinite and infinitesimal lines in a rigorous metaphysicalsense and as real things, he can still use them with confidence as ideal concepts whichshorten his reasoning, similar to what we call imaginary roots in ordinary algebra(for example√−2). ... Infinites and infinitesimals are grounded in such a way thateverythingingeometry,andeveninnature,takesplaceasiftheywereperfectrealities.(Leibniz 1996, pp.252–4)Whatever Leibniz’s own views on the matter, however, it is clear that a fur-ther argument would be needed to convince us to place the real/ideal split atjust this point. The analogy Leibniz drew with imaginary numbers is relev-ant: despite the terminology, modern mathematicians do not regard imagin-ary numbers as any less real than real numbers. Each of the extensions of thenumber system that we have discussed in this chapter could be presented as ameans of adjoining ideal elements in order to solve a new class of equations:we move from the natural numbers to the integers so as to be able to solvex+n=m; we move to the rational numbers to solvejx+k=0; we move tothe real numbers to solvef(x)=0 for any continuousfthat changes sign;and we extend to the complex numbers to be able to solvep(x)=0 for anarbitrary polynomial. None of these extensions seems to have much reasonprima facieto be regarded as more ideal than any other.But note that some of these extensions have a very particular sort of stabil-ity. Consider the first of them as an instance. We wish to be able to solve theequationsx+n=mform,n∈ωωωω, but withinωωωωwe can do this only in thecase whenm\u0002n, so we extend toZand can then do it without restriction.But of course by extending our number system toZwe generate a whole newclass of equations of the same form as before but now withmandnrangingover the whole ofZ. The stability we have just alluded to consists in the factthat we do not have to carry out a further extension to meet this point:Zalready contains solutions to all these new equations as well as to the ones itwas created to solve.As we shall see, however, the extension from the standard to the non-standard real numbers does not possess the same sort of stability. The limitedstability it does possess arises from a trade-off it attempts to exploit betweenfirst- and second-order formulations of analysis. The elementary theory of the"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"146Real numbersreal numbers, let us recall, is the theory of real-closed fields. The algebraicreal numbers constitute a model of this theory. Within this model we candevelop a coherent account of the calculus of polynomials, but the study ofthe phenomenon of differentiability in general is not available. For that tobe possible we find ourselves adding asecond-orderprinciple (in our case thecompleteness axiom, although other, more limited principles might perhapssuffice). We now add to our language constants for all the objects of thissecond-order-specified domain and then restrict to the first-order fragment inorder to apply the compactness theorem and obtain a non-standard model. Itis evidently crucial to the success of this construction that Archimedes’ prin-ciple should be irreducibly second-order, since it is this that the restriction tothe first-order fragment exploits so as to obtain a non-archimedean extensionoftherealnumbersthatisnonethelesselementarilyequivalenttoit(i.e.sharesall its first-order properties).Now it is clearly quite implausible to ascribe to Cauchy or Leibniz evenan inchoate understanding of a first-order transfer principle since, as we havealready noted, the distinction between first- and second-order properties wasmade available only by the development of logic in the late 19th century, andeven then it did not straightaway seem especially important. Even now veryfew mathematicians who are not logicians have any firm grip on which of theconcepts they make use of are first- and which second-order.But even when this point is granted and non-standard analysis is treatedas no more than an allusive rational reconstruction of what the exponents ofthe method of infinitesimals intended, it is in danger of obscuring importantinsights. In particular, it is plain that many mathematicians who made use ofinfinitesimalsdidnotregardthemasmereidealelements. Thisisbynomeanssurprising: the pattern in mathematics has always been that elements whichstart out as mere posits become accepted and end up being treated as real.But if we take that course in this case and treat infinitesimals as real, we loseeven the limited stability we obtained above and have no reason not to posit anew level of objects which are infinitesimal relative to the non-standard field.(To be more precise, we add to our language a constant standing for eachnon-standard number, and then apply the compactness theorem to obtaina proper extension which has all the same first-order properties as the non-standard field.)We have evidently embarked now on a process which we can iterate inmuch the same manner as we iterated the construction of the set-theoretichierarchy. If we do this, we arrive at a conception of the continuum which isvery different from, and far richer than, the Weierstrassian one. But adopt-ing this conception would have radical consequences too for the set-theoreticreduction we have been contemplating in this part of the book.

Any reader who wants allthe details will find them laid out in numerous textbooks: Landau’sGrundla-gen der Analysis(1930) is my own particular favourite for nostalgic reasons, butHenkin et al. 1962 is also commendably clear and detailed. Another con-struction with an equally long history uses the quotient of the set of Cauchysequences of rational numbers by the relation which makes two sequencesequivalent if the difference between their terms tends to zero.The development of real analysis on some variant of the assumption thatthe real numbers form a complete ordered field can be found in numerousplaces: many generations of British university students learnt the materialfrom Hardy 1910; among more recent texts my own favourite is Stromberg1981.We have mentioned only in passing the theory of real-closed fields, fieldselementarily equivalent to the real numbers, the study of which goes backto Artin and Schreier (1927). For an exposition consult van der Waerden1949, ch.11. Tarski’s proof that the theory is axiomatizable proceeds by themethodofquantifiereliminationandinfactyieldsadecisionprocedureforallsentences of the language. The fruitfulness of these ideas is well described byvan den Dries (1988).The theory of real-closed fields is closely related to that of Euclidean con-structions, i.e. to the question of which geometrical constructions are possibleif we restrict ourselves to the Euclidean tools of straightedge and compasses.The extraordinary hold this study has had on the imaginations of mathem-aticians focused for many centuries on three problems in particular — squar-ing the circle, duplicating the cube, and trisecting the angle. The first ofthese entered the language as a metaphor for any impossible task even be-fore Lindemann’s (1882) proof thatπis transcendental had shown it to beinsoluble.The best introduction to non-standard analysis for those familiar with thestandard version remains that of its originator, A. Robinson (1974), but Hurdand Loeb (1985) is also good. For a briefer account see Abian 1974. Tall(1982) describes a simple axiomatization of non-standard analysis.

We can separateout two parts to this process: first we identify the axioms of the theory; thenwe construct a set-theoretic model of them. Any critique of the first part isspecific to the discipline in question and, although we have paused briefly todiscuss the issue in the case of the continuum, it is not strictly the concern ofthe set theorist. What, then, of the second part? What does it establish?It is at any rate uncontroversial that we have established a series of non-negligible relative consistency results: ifZUis consistent, then so are Peanoarithmetic and the theory of complete ordered fields. And we should be care-ful not to under-estimate now the genuine doubts some logicians in the 1920sand 1930s harboured as to the consistency of theories such as these which wedo not now regard as being at all dubious.On the other hand, even then no one thought set theory wasmoresecurethan number theory, so the interest of these relative consistency results is notthat they increase our confidence in the weaker theories but rather that theyprovide us with a way of calibrating their relative strength. Moreover, thisuse of set theory to calibrate strength can be applied to individual theoremsand their proofs. As we have seen, an explicit example of this is Dirichlet’stheorem, whose original proof, if transcribed into our system, would makeuse of higher levels in the set-theoretic hierarchy than the elementary proofdiscovered much later.Notice, though, that there is an important issue of stability to be addressedhere.

The reasons that have ledpeople to think this can be grouped into two sorts, one (in my view) distinctlymore promising than the other.The less promising argument takes as its ground a principle of ontologicaleconomy (Occam’s razor): since the specification for the natural numberswhich we drew up in the first stage of the process listed enough of their prop-erties to characterize them up to isomorphism, and since we have shown thatthere is asetwhich has just these properties, it would multiply entities beyondnecessity to suppose that the natural numbers are anything other than themembers of the set-theoretic model. That this is a bad argument irrespect-ive of the general merits of Occam’s razor was lucidly exposed by Benacerraf(1965), who pointed out that the non-uniqueness of the set-theoretic modelfatally flaws the claim that its members are really the natural numbers: if noone pure set has a privileged claim to that title, then none can have title at all.I said, though, that there is a more promising argument. The historicalorigins of this more promising argument lie in Frege’s failed logicism. Fregeattempted to embed arithmetic in a theory not of sets but of classes, and heheld that the properties of classes on which this embedding depended werelogicaltruths which we could see to be analytic in a suitably extended sense ofKant’s term. Frege’s project, of course, was a failure, and hardly anyone nowclaims that the whole of mathematics could be embedded in logic, especiallynot on the rather narrow conception of logic lately in vogue. Nonetheless, thepossibility remains live that set theory, if not part of logic, might have a priv-ileged epistemological status not shared by the theory of real numbers, say.Set theory might — to put the point very loosely — be inherently morefound-ationalthan other branches of mathematics.

He undoubtedly had an influence on Cantor, who mentioned thebook in glowing terms, but he failed to make much progress because he failedtospot the key idea, which was left to Cantor to discover, that equinumerositycan be used as the basis of a theory of size.9.1 Definition of cardinalsIn order to develop this theory of size, it will be helpful to associate with eachset an object called itscardinality, which we can look on as being (or at any raterepresenting) its size. What we need is that the cardinalities of two sets shouldbe the same if and only if the sets are equinumerous. When the sets involvedare finite, the natural numbers can be used to achieve precisely this, as wesaw in §6.4. But what about the non-finite case? A naive conjecture mightbe that all non-finite sets are equinumerous and that we therefore need onlyone object (‘infinity’) to measure their size, but we have already seen thatRisuncountable, and another way of expressing this is to say thatωωωωandRare ofdifferent cardinalities, so the theory we erect cannot be as straightforward asthe naive conjecture suggests.Fromaformalpointofviewwhatwearelookingforisaterm‘card(x)’withthe following property (sometimes referred to in the literature, with dubioushistorical justification, asHume’s principle.card(A)=card(B)iffAandBare equinumerous."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"156CardinalsThere is, incidentally, an evident similarity between this and the abstractionprinciple for classes that we shall consider in appendix B. And just as in thecase of classes, if all we do is to talk of cardinality as a way of expressingrelations of equinumerosity, what we do is innocent enough.This is indeed a reasonable account of what we find in Cantor’s early work.His first paper on equinumerosity (1874) does not mention the notion of car-dinality at all, and when it does appear in his 1878 paper, it is only in com-pound phrases, so that ‘Ahas the same cardinality asB’ is to be regardedsimply as another way of saying ‘AandBare equinumerous’. It seems not tobe until his 1883 book that he treats cardinals as distinct objects to be manip-ulated in their own right.If we wish to join Cantor in taking this step of regarding cardinals notmerely as an eliminablefac ̧on de parlerbut as objects in their own right, it isat this point that a difference emerges with the case of classes, since there isno purely logical bar to supposing that every cardinal is an object, as we canshow now by giving an explicit definition of sets that can serve as cardinalswithin our theory.

ThereforeAis infinite[theorem 9.3.3].Otherwise put, the axiom of countable choice implies that every cardinal iscomparable withא0.(9.4.2)Theorem.It follows from the axiom of countable choice that if(An)is a sequence of countable sets, then\u0003n∈ωωωωAnis also a countable set.Proof. Let us suppose for simplicity that each of the countable setsAnis non-empty. So for eachn∈ωωωωthe set of functions fromωωωωontoAnis non-empty.It follows from the axiom of countable choice that there is a sequence(fn)such thatfnis a function fromωωωωontoAnfor eachn.So(m,n)\u0013→fn(m)is a function fromωωωω×ωωωωonto\u0003n∈ωωωωAn. If we compose this with a one-to-one correspondence betweenωωωωandωωωω×ωωωω, we obtain a function fromωωωωonto\u0003{An:n∈ωωωω}as required.The axiom of countable choice is used quite frequently to prove results inthe theory of real numbers. For instance, it is one of the central notions ofthe general theory of integration that a set of real numbers isnullif it can becovered by a sequence of intervals of arbitrarily small total length (where thelengthl(I)of a bounded intervalIis defined in the obvious manner as thedifference in value between its endpoints). Let us try to prove that if(Cn)isa sequence of null sets,\u0003n∈ωωωωCnis also null. To do this, take anyε>0 andcover eachCnby a sequence of intervalsInmsuch that\r∞m=0l(Inm)<ε/2n+1.(ThisispossiblesinceCnisbyhypothesisanullset.)

We have a theorem of the form(∀n∈ωωωω)(∃x∈R)Φ(n,x),and wish to obtain a sequence(xn)inRsuch that(∀n∈ωωωω)Φ(n,xn). Thisis trivially licensed by the axiom of countable choice: the setsAn={x∈R:Φ(n,x)}are non-empty by hypothesis, and so the axiom ensures theexistence of a sequence(xn)inRsuch that for eachnwe havexn∈An, i.e.Φ(n,xn). Butintextbooksonthecalculussuchusesoftheaxiomarerarelysig-nalled explicitly. The one we have just described might be introduced simplyby saying,For each natural numbernletxnbe a real numberxnsuch thatΦ(n,xn).Indeedthis tendencyto downplay uses ofthe axiom ofcountable choice mim-ics the historical situation. For an explicit example of this consider the fol-lowing argument, which may well have been the first use of the axiom inmathematics when it was published by Heine (1872) — with an ascription toCantor.(9.4.3)Proposition.TheaxiomofcountablechoiceentailsthatanyfunctionfromRtoRwhich is sequentially continuous at a point is also continuous atit.Proof. Suppose thatfis not continuous ata. So there is an intervalJcon-tainingf(a)such that for every intervalIcontainingawe havef[I]\u0002J.In particular, therefore, for eachn∈ωωωωwe can (using the axiom of countablechoice) choosexnbetweena−1nanda+1nsuch thatf(xn)/∈J. Then we canconclude that the sequence(xn)tends toabut(f(xn))does not converge tof(a).Heine expresses the conclusion of the proposition unconditionally, and in-deed the text makes no special comment whatever on the step in the proofwhich requires the axiom of countable choice for its justification. Betweenthis publication and the end of the century the axiom was used implicitly onmany occasions by Cantor, Dedekind, Borel, Baire and others. At first onlyPeano and his colleagues in Turin seem to have commented explicitly on itsuse: Peano (1890, p.210) claimed that ‘one cannot apply an infinite numberof times anarbitrarylaw according to which a classais made to correspond toan individual of that class’; and Bettazzi (1896, p.512) criticized Dedekind’sproof that every set is either finite or infinite on the ground that"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"164Cardinalsone must choose an object (correspondence) arbitrarily in each of the infinite sets,which does not seem rigorous; unless one wishes to accept as a postulate that such achoice can be carried out — something, however, which seems ill-advised to me.Sometimes, though, it is possible to avoid using the axiom of count-able choice by giving an explicit rule for defining the elements of the se-quence in question. For example, if we have a theorem of the form(∀n∈ωωωω)(∃x∈Q)Φ(n,x), we can without using the axiom of countablechoice define a sequence(xn)inQsuch thatΦ(n,xn)for alln∈ωωωω.Todothis, we note thatQis countable (unlikeR) and so there exists a sequence(ar)whose image isQ;ifweletrnbe the least element of the set{r∈ωωωω:Φ(n,ar)}(which is non-empty by hypothesis) and letxn=arnfor eachn∈ωωωω, we obtaina sequence(xn)with the property we require. A good example of this way ofavoiding countable choice is the global version of the result about continuitywhich we proved a moment ago.(9.4.4)Proposition.A function fromRtoRwhich is sequentially continu-ous everywhere is also continuous everywhere.Proof.Iffis sequentially continuous, then in order to prove thatf[I]⊆Jitis enough to provef[I∩Q]⊆J. So we can avoid the appeal to the axiomof countable choice in our earlier proof by choosingrationalnumbers at eachstage.But it is not possible to avoid the axiom of countable choice in all cases, atleast if the default theory is like the one we are using in this book: the axiomof countable choice cannot be proved inZU(Fraenkel 1922a) or even inZ(Cohen 1963). The extent to which classical analysis depends on ineliminableuses of the axiom has been studied extensively and is now well understood:it has been shown, for example, that in the absence of the axiom not onlymay there be subsets ofRwhich are neither finite nor infinite (Cohen 1966,p.138),butthereisevenamodelinwhichthecontinuumisacountableunionof countable sets (Feferman and Levy 1963). It follows from this, moreover,that we cannot hope to eliminate the appeal to the axiom of countable choicefrom the proof we gave earlier that a countable union of null sets is null, sinceotherwisethemodeljustmentionedwouldbeoneinwhichthewholereallineis null, which is absurd.A liberal constructivist might well think that the axiom of countable choicehas a certain plausibility, since it appears to be only medically, rather thanlogically, impossible to make an infinite number of choices in a finite timeby the device of performing each choice in half the time it took to performthe previous one (cf. Russell 1936, pp.143–4).

The history of Cantor’s devel-opment of his theory of cardinality is well described by Dauben (1990). A. W.Moore (1990) illuminates the earlier background. What is striking about thisdevelopment is how few precursors Cantor had: only Bolzano (1851) cameanywhere close to a coherent theory.CantorconjecturedaspecialcaseofBernstein’sequinumerositytheoreminhis 1883 book and the general result in an 1895 paper, but it was his pupil,Felix Bernstein, who proved it — in 1897 when he was barely 19.

The proof we have givenhere, which uses Dedekind’s theory of chains to avoid mention of the naturalnumbers, was found by Dedekind following a conversation with Bernstein2in 1897 and communicated to Cantor by letter in 1899. However, Dede-kind never published this proof, and it was rediscovered by Zermelo in 1906(see Poincar ́e 1906; Peano 1906; Zermelo 1908b).

What is wrong with this is that it fails the requirement for a gooddefinition of being independent of the choice of the representative setsAandB. To see why, considerא0א−0, i.e. the cardinal ofA\u0001BwhereAandBare both countably infinite. If we letA=ωωωωandB=ωωωω, then of courseA\u0001B=Ø and we getא0א−0=0.

It is a very special case, though, as evena naive counting argument shows: the set of closed subsets ofRhas cardinalc=2א0, whereas the set ofallsubsets has cardinalcc. We shall have more tosay about this in chapter 15; it will emerge, in particular, that the difficultiesin the way of extending the method of the Cantor/Bendixson theorem so asto yield a proof of the continuum hypothesis are at least as great as the naiveargument suggests.11.4 CardinalityDefinition.|α|=card(αααα)."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Cardinality185Whenwespeakofthecardinalityofanordinalα,weshallmeannotthecardinalnumber of that particular set (which is, after all, an accidental by-productof the definition of the ordinals that we are using) but the cardinal|α|justdefined.

This impredicativity is significant because it is what takes thetheory of ordinals beyond Cantor’s original idea of ‘ordinal notations’. Forany system of notations is countable and will therefore fail to exhaustωωωω1.The method of labelling objects with ordinals is a powerful tool for provingresults in set theory.

Tait (2000) describes how inGrundlagenCantor went beyondhis earlier conception of ordinals as a system of notations to serve as indicesfor recursive definitions.The history of Burali-Forti’s paradox is somewhat convoluted. To explainit, we shall (temporarily) adopt the name ‘quasi-ordinal’ for the order-type ofa perfectly ordered set (see exercise 5 of §11.1). With this terminology, whatBurali-Forti (1897b) proved was that the set of all quasi-ordinals is not totallyordered in its natural partial order. He also asserted that every quasi-ordinalis an ordinal, thereby contradicting Cantor’s (1897) theorem that the ordinalsare totally ordered. But there was a mistake here: Burali-Forti had misun-derstood Cantor’s definition of a well-ordering, and it is in fact the converseimplication — every ordinal is a quasi-ordinal — which holds. So the con-tradiction dissolves: there is nothing absurd about a non-totally ordered sethaving a totally ordered subset. Burali-Forti corrected his error in his 1897aand added the rather enigmatic remark that ‘the reader can check which pro-positions in (1897b) are verified also by the well-ordered classes’. He seemsnot to have taken his own advice, however: it was left to Russell (1903) to dothe checking and hence resurrect the paradox by noticing that Burali-Forti’sargument shows without any essential change that the ordinals are not totallyordered. This last resultisgenuinely paradoxical, and because of Russell’sattribution it has become universally known as ‘Burali-Forti’s paradox’, al-though Burali-Forti himself denied as late as 1906 (in a letter to Couturat)that any contradiction was involved. (The letter as Couturat published it ishopelessly confused: it would be charitable to Burali-Forti to suppose thatit has been mistranslated.) Cantor had in any event discovered the paradoxindependently some time before 1899.Transfinite induction as a means of proof and transfinite recursion as ameans of definition are now a commonplace in the toolkit of any pure math-ematician: textbooks of classical analysis such as Hobson 1921 contain fre-quent illustrations.Of special interest to logicians has been the discovery that transfinite in-ductioncanbeusedinharnesswithcuteliminationinprooftheorytodemon-stratetheconsistencyofvariousformalsystems.

The reason it is important is that it is thefirst ordinal for which the normal form does not supply areduction:ifγ0is thesalient ordinal forβ, its normal form to the baseβis justγ0=β(γ0), whereasfor anyα<γ0we obtainα=β(α0)δ0+β(α1)δ1+···+β(αn−1)δn−1,where 0<δr<βandαn−1<αn−2<···<α0<α.

This expression is called thecomplete normal formofαto the baseβ.Two cases of this are worth highlighting. If the base being used is a finiteordinalN>1, it is easy to see that the salient ordinal isω, so that a reductionto complete normal form is possible only for finite ordinals (i.e. natural num-bers). Thus, for example, we can calculate the complete normal form of 2350to the base 3 by writing2350=37+34.2+1=33.2+1+33+1.2+1;and similarly the complete normal form of 8192 to the base 2 is8192=213=223+22+1=222+1+22+1.If the base isω, on the other hand, the salient ordinal, i.e. the least solution ofthe equationω(α)=α,isε0=ωωω...,which is standardly denotedε0.

Inapplicationtofinitesetswetakethetheoryto formalize thepractice ofcounting whichwe havepractised sincechildhood. And — the crucial step — in application to infinite sets we takethe theory to be a natural conceptual extension of the finite case.One measure of the success of this extension is that the material we havepresented in this part of the book is nowadays a commonplace in the toolkitof most pure mathematicians.1Another measure of success is that hardlyany mathematician now thinks the existence of infinite sets might be logicallyinconsistent, or even incoherent. If some are finitists (and very few are), it isbecause they are unconvinced by the positive arguments for the existence ofinfinite sets, not because they think there is a negative argument which showsthat there are none.It is hard to overstate what a radical shift this is in the mathematicians’ wayof conceptualizing what they do. Even if they do not really believe that everyreal number is obtainable from Ø by transfinite iterations of the power-setoperation (as their deference toZFas a framework would, if taken at face1If thetheory of ordinals is less wellknown than that of cardinals, it is because of theexistence ofa device for avoiding them in many of their mathematical applications, popularized especiallyby Bourbaki: see §14.5."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"206Conclusion to Part IIIvalue, entail), they certainly believe — most of the time, at least — that thereal numbers form a set. Two hundred years ago no one thought that.Yet this reconceptualization, while it vastly extends the scope of mathemat-ics and provides us with new tools even in relation to very old problems, doesnot of itself lead to revisions in classical mathematics, which seems to havea content that is neutral as between the differing interpretations. ‘Water iswet’ has some content which I, who know that it is (mostly) H2O, can graspin common with those who lived before Lavoisier was born; and in much thesame way there is a mathematical content which can be transmitted to mefrom an 18th century mathematics book even if I do not enter wholly into18th century modes of thought when I read it.The reason for belabouring this point here is that it indicates how differ-ences in the interpretation of a piece of mathematics can arise when there isnomathematicaldispute about its correctness. And this problem of interpreta-tion is one which anyone studying the theory of cardinals and ordinals mustface.2We have proved that 2א0>א0. But is this true in thesamesense that4>2? From a narrowly formal perspective, of course, we can give a pos-itive answer to this question, since both are instances of Cantor’s theorem.But that only answers the question to the extent that the formalism in whichthe common proof of the two inequalities is formulated has a sense. Whatwe really wanted was to be taught how to think about infinite sets, and theanswer which the theory urges upon us is that we should think of them, as faras possible, as being just like finite sets. But how far is that? Analogy is oneof the most important tools in mathematical thought, but the analogy we aredealing with here is one that we can be sure will at some point fail us.2The consideration of large cardinal axioms, to which we shall turn in the last part of the book,only makes this question even more pressing."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Part IVFurther Axioms"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Introduction to Part IVThe last two parts of the book have been almost entirely positive in charac-ter: we have shown how to develop within our default theoryZUnot onlytraditional mathematics — arithmetic, calculus and (by extension) geometry— but also Cantor’s theories of infinite numbers. But now we must revert tothe more uncertain tone of the first part in order to introduce some possibleadditions to the default theory which we left undiscussed then.Themereexistenceofaxiomsnotyetincludedinthedefaulttheorywillnotsurprise anyone who adheres to the iterative conception of set. The axiomswe stated in part I guarantee the existence of levelsV0,V1,V2,...,Vω,Vω+1,Vω+2,...but say nothing as to the existence or non-existence of a level Vω+ω. And yetthe second principle of plenitude, which we used in chapter 4 to justify thelower levels, seems to entail the existence of Vω+ωas well. Our first task, then,will be to study propositions (known ashigher axioms of infinity) asserting theexistence of this or higher levels in the hierarchy.Higher axioms of infinity are responsible for many of the perplexities thatthe iterative conception throws up, since it seems to force on us not merelyone such axiom but an endlessly growing hierarchy of them. We want toknow how many levels there are in the hierarchy, but any answer we give canimmediatelybeseentobedefectivesincetherecouldbe(andhence,accordingto the second principle of plenitude, are) further levels beyond that.

The reason for this, of course, is G ̈odel’sincompleteness theorems, which show that in the language of any fully formalsettheorythereisasentence(knownasaG ̈odelsentence)whichistruebutnotprovable, assuming that the axioms themselves are true. If what is in questionis a first-order theoryUsuch as we considered in part I, the formalizationCon(U)of the claim thatUis consistent will be a G ̈odel sentence.So, for realists at least, it is inevitable that a first-order theory will not ex-haust the claims about sets that we are, on reflection, prepared to accept astrue. (Theresponseofformaliststoincompletenesswillevidentlybesomewhatdifferent, unless they can give an account of a notion of truth independent ofwhat follows from the axioms.)The central difference between first- and second-order theories of sets lies,as we noted in part I, in the fact that the first-order axiom scheme of separ-ation falls far short of expressing all the instances of the second-order axiomthat the platonist would be willing to accept. The first-order axiomatizationtherefore does not characterize the operation which takes us from one levelin the hierarchy to the next. Or, since the next level afterVisV∪P(V),itamounts to much the same to say that the axiomatization fails to capture theoperation that takes a set to its power set.One of the simplest ways in which this failure manifests itself is in relationto the question of the cardinality of the power set. If card(A)=a, thencard(P(A))=2a, and we know from Cantor’s theorem that 2ais bigger thana. But how much bigger? More precisely, are there any cardinals lying inbetween? The answer to this question turns out to be independent of ourdefault theory. Even the most basic case withaא=0, which is known as thecontinuum problembecause 2א0is the cardinal of the continuum, is not settledby any of the first-order theories we have been discussing, and hence is aninstance of the same sort of incompleteness as Souslin’s hypothesis.But by far the most important of the set-theoretic propositions not decidedby the axioms of our default theory is the axiom of choice, which asserts theexistenceateachlevelinthehierarchyofasupplyofsetswithcertainconveni-ent properties. The mathematical importance of this axiom lies principally inthelargenumber ofimportant propositionsthat havebeenshown tobe unde-rivable without it, and the large number of elegant propositions in disparateareas of pure mathematics that have been shown to be equivalent to it.

Only in chapter 4 did we add assumptions— the axioms of creation and infinity — which can be thought of as sayingthat the hierarchy extends to a certain height. But there are evidently otherways of extending the theory so as to assert that the hierarchy goes to otherheights. We shall call such assertionsaxioms of infinity. Typically they can beput in the form of a claim that the level Vαexists for certain ordinalsα: theaxiom of infinity we stated in §4.9 asserts that Vωexists and hence counts asan axiom of infinity in this new sense. We shall not attempt to give a precisecharacterization of what constitutes an axiom of infinity, and indeed we shallsee shortly that no formal characterization of the scope of the term is possible.Notice, however, that on our intended meaning axioms of infinity can beorderedaccordingtostrengthinanaturalway.

The connection arises because of the fact, familiar from recursivefunction theory, that ifTis a formal theory, there is a sentence Con(T)inthe language of arithmetic which can be read via some coding as expressingthe consistency ofT, but which can also, like any arithmetical sentence, beinterpreted set-theoretically as saying something about the setωωωω. And ifU\u0002isstrictly stronger thanU, we can expect to be able to prove inU\u0002that Con(U)istrueaboutωωωω; but, byG ̈odel’sincompletenesstheorem, wecannotprovethisinU.It is hardly surprising, of course, that there is a set-theoretic claim provableinU\u0002but not in the weaker theoryU: what is significant is that it is an ele-mentary arithmetical one; i.e. it is obtained from a sentence in the first-order"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"212Orders of infinitylanguage of arithmetic simply by interpreting the quantifiers in that sentenceas ranging overωωωω. In fact, we can say more: the G ̈odel sentence Con(U)isΠ1, i.e. expressible in the form(∀x)f(x)=0 for some primitive recursivefunctionf.(G ̈odel himself sometimes described such sentences as being ‘ofGoldbach type’ because the celebrated problem of number theory known asGoldbach’s conjecture is expressible in this form.)The pattern, then, is that whenever we add a stronger axiom of infinity toour set theory (i.e. stronger in the sense just enunciated), we also extend therangeofΠ1sentencesofarithmeticthatwecanprovetobetrueinωωωω. Thisisagraphic illustration of the fact, already noted, that the set of natural numbersis defined within our system by means of a first-order approximation to afull second-order characterization. It is defined, that is to say, by requiringthat no subset ofωωωωshould be a counterexample to the induction property;but because of the limitations of the first-order language in which we havepresented the theory, this can only mean that no subsetdefinable in the languageof the theoryis a counterexample. If we strengthen the axiom of infinity, weenlarge the range of sets that are definable, constraining further the definitionofωωωωand hence increasing the range of arithmetical sentences that are true inall interpretations.Thereisnothingspecialaboutthenaturalnumbersinthisregard,however.Wefocusonthemasthesimplest(andhenceperhapsthemosttroubling)case,but we can expect the phenomenon to occur for any other infinite structure(therealline,forexample)whichwepresentbymeansofacategoricalcharac-terization, since any such characterization is second-order, and its first-orderapproximation will therefore have its interpretation constrained in the man-ner just mentioned by any strengthening of the axiom of infinity.13.1 Goodstein’s theoremTheworkwedidinchapter5givesusaproofinZUthatPAhasamodel. Thiscan be formalized to generate a proof inZUthat the G ̈odel sentence Con(PA)is true inωωωω, although not provable inPA. But whatisCon(PA)?G ̈odel’s proofis constructive, so if we want an answer to this question, all we have to do isto choose an explicit numerical coding of the language of arithmetic and thenfollow through the details to obtain the G ̈odel sentence explicitly. We knowthat it will have the overall form(∀x)f(x)=0, but beyond that there is noreason to expect it to be intrinsically interesting.OurproofinZUthattheG ̈odelsentenceistrue,i.e.that(∀n∈ωωωω)f(n)=0,dependsonknowingthecoding,sinceitisviathecodingthatthesentencecanbe read as expressing something we have the means to prove inZU, namelythatPAis consistent. Different codings will give different G ̈odel sentences,"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Goodstein’s theorem213and if I presented you with the sentence without telling you the coding I hadused to obtain it, you would have no privileged route to finding a proof of it.Indeed there is no reason to expect the sentence to be simple enough to beremotely memorable, so it is unlikely that I could even persuade you to beinterested in finding the proof. In short, the G ̈odel sentence is neither naturalnor genuinely mathematical.There is therefore, at least from a practical psychological perspective, someinterest in the question whether we can find an explicit example of an incom-pleteness inPAthat is not only natural (i.e. independent of any coding) butalso, if possible, genuinely mathematical. It turns out that the work on ordinalarithmetic which we carried out in the last chapter puts us in a position toproduce such an example.Recall our demonstration at the end of the last chapter that every naturalnumberrhas an expression, called itscomplete normal formto the basen,inwhich no number>nappears. If we replacenin this expression withn+1,evaluate the natural number so described, and then subtract one from the an-swer, we obtain a natural number which we shall denoteFn(r). For example,2350=37+34.2+1=33.2+1+33+1.2+1,which is a complete normal form to the base 3, and soF3(2350)=44.2+1+44+1.2.Similarly,8192=213=223+22+1=222+1+22+1,which is a complete normal form to the base 2, and soF2(8192)=333+1+33+1−1.In general the functionFnthus defined is primitive recursive.

The Goodstein sequence starting at 2 is trivial, termin-ating at the 4th step.g(2,1)=2;g(2,2)=3−1=2;g(2,3)=1;g(2,4)=0.And the sequence starting at 3 terminates at the 6th step.g(3,1)=3=2+1g(3,2)=3g(3,3)=4−1=3g(3,4)=2g(3,5)=1g(3,6)=0.But the very next case is somewhat different.

What is not obvious, and issupplied by Goodstein’s theorem above, is the information that the functionGiseverywhere defined, i.e. that it is total recursive. But it increases withquite awesome rapidity:G(1)=2,G(2)=4,G(3)=6,G(4)∼10121,210,694.And it is this rapidity of growth that makes the function relevant to our pur-poses here. An analysis of the form of proofs inPAcan be used to showthat there is a limit to the rapidity of growth of any recursive function whichcan be proved to be total inPA; moreover, the Goodstein functionGex-ceeds this rate of growth. So althoughGistotal recursive, the fact that it is isnot provable inPA(see Kirby and Paris 1982). In other words, the sentence(∀x)(∃y)g(x,y)=0 in the first-order language of arithmetic is an example ofan incompleteness inPA, a sentence which is true inωωωωbut not provable inPA.It is undoubtedly natural, in contrast to the G ̈odel sentence, since it does notdepend on any arbitrary choice of coding. But further, it is plainly possible toargue that it is genuinely mathematical: it does not seem implausible that onemight become interested in whether it is true independently of its role as aninstance of incompleteness.It is worth noting, incidentally, that although the Goodstein sentence is notprovable inPA, any instance of it is. This is because an instance isΣ1, andanytrueΣ1sentence is provable inPA. (If the sentence(∃x)f(x)=0 is true inωωωω,thenthereexistsanaturalnumbernsuchthatf(n)=0: thecalculationwhichshows this, followed by an application of existential generalization, constitutesa proof inPAof the original sentence.)In order to obtain a mathematical incompleteness inPA, we have had topay a price in logical complexity: the G ̈odel sentences mentioned earlier wereΠ1, i.e. of the form(∀x)f(x)=0, whereas the Goodstein sentence isΠ2,ofthe form(∀x)(∃y)f(x,y)=0. The importance of this difference emergeswhen we consider them in the light of Hilbert’s programme. Suppose that Iam committed to the truth ofPA: in that case a proof inPAof an arithmeticalsentence certainly gives me a straightforward reason to believe that it is true.But suppose now that I am given a set theoryUextendingPAand believe notthat it is true but only that it is formally consistent.

The level Vωexists by theaxiomofinfinity. Hence,bytheaxiomofcreation,sodothelevelsVω+1,Vω+2,etc. But the axioms ofZUdo not entail that there is a second limit level Vω+ω.Ought we then to add another axiom to our system to ensure that this levelexists? Let us denote byZfUandZfthe extensions ofZUandZrespectivelyobtained by adding the following axiom.Axiom of ordinals.For each ordinalαthere is a corresponding levelVα.The effect of this axiom is to strengthen the axiom of infinity by ensuring theexistence of many further levels Vαwithα\u0002ω+ω, one for each ordinalαwhose existence we could prove inZU. However, the effect of the axiomon the height of the hierarchy is very much amplified beyond this becausethe ordinals are not an independent measure of calibration but an integralpart of the theory: the existence of the new levels just mentioned ensuresthe existence of further ordinalsαthat were not previously available, and theaxiom of ordinals applied tothemguarantees the existence of correspondinglevels Vα. And so on. The hierarchy described by the new theory is thereforecolossally higher than anything we could have countenanced before.One fruit of the extra headroom whichZfUaffords is that it permits anelegant characterization of the structure of the membership relation on thepure transitive sets. This characterization, which is known as Mostowski’scollapsinglemma,isaveryusefultoolforstudyingtheiterativehierarchy,andfor that reason set theorists will regardZfUas a more attractive theory thanZU. (Of course, the pure hierarchy described byZfis from this point of viewmore attractive still, because it does not have any non-set-theoretic objects tocomplicate its properties.) We should not under-estimate the extent to whichaxiom selection is influenced by set theorists themselves, who want an elegantstructure to study. We saw earlier how much of the initial motivation forthe axiom of foundation was of this sort, and similar considerations evidentlycount in favour of systems such asZf."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"The axiom of ordinals219Let us also note here another consequence of the axiom of ordinals (al-though one that will be more important when we discuss the standard ax-iomatizations of set theory in appendix A than in the current context): theaxiom of ordinals permits the theory of ordinals to be developed using a quitedifferent idea from the one we employed in chapter 11. Let us give the namevon Neumann ordinalsto the setsα\u0002defined by transfinite recursion as follows:0\u0002=Ø(α+1)\u0002=α∪{α\u0002}λ\u0002=\u0002α<λα\u0002for any limit ordinalλ.The idea we want to consider is that we could have used the von Neumannordinals instead of ordinals in the formal treatment. The key point is that ifthe theory we are working in isZU, this idea is stillborn becauseρ(α\u0002)=α:inZUwe cannot prove the existence of a level Vω+ωand hence cannot prove theexistenceofthecorrespondingvonNeumannordinal(ω+ω)\u0002. Sotherearenotenough von Neumann ordinals to give us a workable theory. InZfU, on theother hand, things are different: we can prove that the von Neumann ordinalα\u0002exists for every ordinalα, and hence can, if we wish, use von Neumannordinals as proxies for the ordinals.There would obviously be no practical advantage to be gained from doingthis unless we could develop the theory of von Neumann ordinals independ-ently by defining themdirectlywithout using recursion on the standard ordin-als, but this can in fact be done quite easily. The autonomous definition of avon Neumann ordinal is as follows.Definition.Avon Neumann ordinalis a transitive setAsuch that∈Ais atransitive relation onA.WhenwedecouplevonNeumannordinalsfromthedefinitionbyrecursioninthis manner, we discover that this autonomous theory of ordinals works verysmoothly, mainly because of the elegant fact thatα<β⇔α\u0002∈β\u0002.We shall not go through the details, which may be found in almost any settheorytextbook: sufficeittosaythatthisdefinitiondoescorrectlycharacterizethe sets that we want. In summary, then, we could if we wished develop thetheory of ordinals using the von Neumann definition, as long as we assumedthe axiom of ordinals.What reason do we have, though, to believe our new axiom? If von Neu-mann’s theory of ordinals were the only one available, that would give us asort of regressive reason to believe the axiom. And this is certainly of some"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"220Orders of infinityhistorical importance, since the possibility of the alternative theory of ordinalspresented in part III was not discovered until the 1950s and did not reallybecome widely known until some time later. So in the 1920s the evident use-fulness of ordinals in proving mathematical theorems might have seemed togive the axiom of ordinals strong support.In the context ofZU, however, this hardly provides much support for theaxiom once we see that another treatment, which does not require the ax-iom, is available. There is a general moral here. Regressive arguments forany set-theoretic axiom depend on a prior belief in themathematicaltruth ofsome consequences of the axiom, but the fact that they are consequences ofit depends in turn on an embedding of part of mathematics in set theory: adifferent embedding may not require the same axiom, and so the regressivejustification is relative to the embedding. It is of interest, therefore, to enquireinto whether the axiom of ordinals has any mathematical consequences thatare less dependent on our choice of embedding.We showed in part II that two of the structures of central interest to math-ematicians, the natural numbers and the real numbers, can be modelled bystructures of low infinite rank in the hierarchy: to be precise, there is a set ofrankωthat will serve for the set of natural numbers, and one of rankω+1that will do for the real numbers. Of course, we need not just these sets butthe familiar relations and functions defined on them, which will be of slightlyhigher rank. Then, in order to do ordinary mathematics, we shall want todefine other functions which may be of slightly higher rank still.Some parts of mathematics are often said to be more abstract than oth-ers. Functional analysis, for instance, is more abstract than the calculus offunctions of one real variable. This use of the word ‘abstract’, which is quitefamiliar to most mathematicians, seems to be represented quite well by theranksof the objects referred to in this set-theoretic modelling of the parts ofmathematics in question: functional analysis is more abstract than the calcu-lus because the objects it deals with are modelled by sets of higher rank.One of the trends we can trace in the development of mathematics, espe-cially during the 20th century, is a move towards greater abstractness in thesense just defined. Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of 20th centurymathematics is straightforwardly representable by sets of fairly low infiniteranks, certainly less thanω+ 20. So although the G ̈odelian considerationsalluded to earlier tell us that there are sentences in the language of arith-metic, such as Con(ZU), that are provable with the axiom of ordinals butnot without, there is once again a further question whether there are any ex-amples that might count as genuinely mathematical in the sense in which wehave been using that term, i.e. as being of interest to mathematicians who arenot set theorists.In fact there are. We proved in §7.5 that the game on every open, closed,countable or co-countable subset of the Baire line is determined. It is very"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Reflection221natural, having proved these results, to wonder what larger class of gamesis determined. One obvious class to consider in this connection is theBorelsets, i.e. the sets obtainable from the closed and open subsets of the line bytaking countable unions and complements as often as we wish, and this isthe case which turns out to supply us with an example of a mathematicalincompleteness inZU: it can be proved inZfU(Martin 1975), but not inZU(Friedman 1971), that the game on every Borel set is determined.On its own, of course, this does not give us a regressive argument for thetruthof the axiom of ordinals: for that we would have to have anindependentreasontobelievethatthegameoneveryBorelsetisdetermined. Whatitdoessupply, however, is an extrinsic reason for mathematicians to be interested inthe axiom, since it demonstrates that the axiom of ordinals has consequencesin the theory of games on Borel sets, which no doubt deserves to be regardedas a genuine branch of mathematics, rather than merely within set theory it-self. Moreover, the result is especially striking, since it seems to be the sortof claim that one might formulate quite independently of any search for sen-tences whose proofs make essential use of higher axioms of infinity.On the other hand, a claim about Borel sets is not the ideal example toimpress mathematicians generally: the branch of mathematics which studiesthe properties of such sets — descriptive set theory — is, as its name mightsuggest, practised largely by set theorists themselves. Friedman has more re-cently turned his attention to number theory and devised methods for gener-ating various sentences whose proofs involve differing degrees of abstractness.Although these are certainly natural, i.e. independent of coding, one mightquestion whether those that have been published so far are genuinely math-ematical. There therefore remains room for scepticism about the relevance ofthe axiom of ordinals to mathematical practice. The turning point, of course,wouldbeagenuineconjectureofnumbertheory—onemadebyanumberthe-orist— whose proof turned out to require higher-order methods, but to dateno such example has been found.13.3 ReflectionIf the relevance of the axiom of ordinals to the practice of mathematics is stillvery limited, and if the regressive support it gains from the few applicationsthat have been discovered is negligible, the principal argument for it must beintuitive. The most obvious such argument is that there is no good reasonwhy the hierarchy should not extend beyond Vω+ω, and so by some version ofthe second principle of plenitude we conclude that it does so extend. In thissection I want to investigate whether this intuitive argument, or an extensionof it, can be made to justify an even stronger class of axioms of infinity knowncollectively as the axiom scheme of reflection. They are intended to capture"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"222Orders of infinitythe idea that every property of the whole universe is reflected in some sub-universe.Axiom scheme of reflection.For each formulaΦwith free variablesx1,x2,...,xnthis is an axiom:(∀x1,...,xn)(∃V)(Φ⇒Φ(V)).Thisaxiomistoberead,ofcourse,accordingtotheconventionof§3.4,whichhasfallendormantbutisherebyrevivedfortheremainderofthissection, thatthelettersV,V\u0002,etc.rangeonlyoverlevels.

Thesystem whose only axioms are the instances of the schemes of separation andreflection is denotedZFU; its pure variant is denotedZF. We can illustratehow the axiom scheme of reflection is employed in practice by proving theaxioms of infinity, creation and ordinals from it.(13.3.1)Proposition (ZFU).There exists a level.Proof. Reflection on any sentence whatever shows that there is at least onelevel.(13.3.2)Proposition (ZFU).For every level there is another level after it.Proof.IfVis any level, use reflection on the fact that(∃a)(a=V)to obtain(∃V\u0002)(∃a∈V\u0002)(a=V), i.e.(∃V\u0002)(V∈V\u0002).(13.3.3)Proposition (ZFU).There exists a limit level.Proof. From proposition 13.3.2 we obtain(∀a)(∃V)(a∈V).Reflection on this gives us a levelV\u0002such that(∀a∈V\u0002)(∃V∈V\u0002)(a∈V).(13.3.4)Proposition (ZFU).For every ordinalαthe levelVαexists.Proof. By induction onα. The caseα=0 is already taken care of by pro-position 13.3.1, and the case of a successor ordinal follows from proposition13.3.2. So suppose now thatλis a limit ordinal and Vαexists for allα<λ.Sothere exists a levelVwhich reflects this, i.e. Vα∈Vfor allα<λ. It followsthat Vλ=\u0003α<λVαexists as required.In summary, then, we have shown thatZFUis at least as strong asZfU.Infact, it is stronger: the following theorem (or, to be strict, theorem scheme) isprovable inZFUbut not inZfU."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Reflection223(13.3.5)Proposition (ZFU).Ifτis a term, then(∀a)((∀x∈a)(τ(x)is a set)⇒{τ(x):x∈a}is a set).Proof.

If reflection is so strong, then, why shouldwe believe it? As we have noted, regressive arguments for the axiom of or-dinals are already very weak. When we get to reflection, they become weakerstill. The likelihood that we would need something stronger than the axiom ofordinals in order to prove a result we already had other reasons for believingtrue seem slim indeed. The best we could hope for in this direction might bea weaker extrinsic argument, perhaps to the effect that the theory with fullreflection is more convenient or more elegant than the theory without it.We have seen that the axiom of ordinals can easily be put in the form of aparticularinstanceofthereflectionscheme, sothereissomeprospectthatanyintuitive argument we have for the axiom of ordinals might apply more gen-erally to all the other instances. The most prominent example of this strategyisan argument of G ̈odel, who is reported by Wang (1974, p.536) as observingthat itdoes not have the same kind ofimmediateevidence (previous to any closer analysis ofthe iterative concept of set) which the other axioms have. This is seen from the factthat it was not included in Zermelo’s original system of axioms. [G ̈odel] suggests that,heuristically, the best way of arriving at it from this standpoint is the following. Fromthe very idea of the iterative concept of set it follows that if an ordinalαhas beenobtained, the operation of power setPiteratedαtimes leads to a setPα(Ø). But, forthe same reason, it would seem to follow that if, instead ofP, one takes some largerjump in the hierarchy of types, ...Qα(Ø)likewise is a set. Now, to assume this forany conceivable jump operation (even for those that are defined by reference to theuniverse of all sets or by use of the choice operation) is equivalent to the axiom.What is most interesting about this argument is that it attempts to justify anaxiom scheme bygeneralizingfrom an argument for a particular instance. Inother words, it does not conform to the pattern we met in part I, where axiomschemes such as separation were seen as gaining their justification from our"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"224Orders of infinityprior belief in the second-order axioms to which they were (poor) approxima-tions.Buttheformoftheaxiomschemeofreflectionsuggeststhatthisdifferenceisinevitable, sincethe reflectionof aformula bya levelis aninherently syntacticnotion that is highly sensitive to the form of expression used. Indeed, eventhe consistency of the reflection scheme (never mind its truth) is sensitive tothe forms of expression available in the language. The platonist presumablybelieves that the universe of sets has some height or other, whether or notwe can express it. But if wecouldexpress in absolute terms what the heightis, and apply reflection to that expression, we would obtain a levelwithintheuniverse with the very same height, contrary to our intentions. In the contextof our formal theory, of course, this serves to remind us that the height of thehierarchy is, in a certain sense, inexpressible from within. But it also suggeststhat a careless generalization of the reflection scheme might turn out to beinconsistent. And this danger has been confirmed: third-order reflection in itsapparently most natural formulation is inconsistent (Tait 1998).Itfollows,therefore,thatanyargumentforthereflectionschemewillhavetobe sensitive to distinctions of level concerning what can be expressed. Some-thing of this may be traced in Cantor’s idea that the universe of sets in someway represents the Absolute, and hence that it would be a sort of blasphemyto suppose that a finite being can express it. This sort of thought has beenpopular in theology: according to St Gregory, for instance, ‘no matter howfar our mind may have progressed in the contemplation of God, it does notattain to what He is but only to what is beneath Him’. But work would evid-ently be required to establish that the class of all sets is in the relevant sense arepresentation of Him.A non-theological argument for reflection has been offered by Fraenkelet al., who suggest thatwhenwetrytoreconciletheimageoftheever-growinguniversewithourdesiretotalkabout the truth or falsity of statements that refer toallsets we are led to assume thatsome temporary universes are as close an ‘approximation’ to the ultimate unreacheduniverse as we wish. In other words, there is no propertyexpressible in the language of settheorywhichdistinguishestheuniversefromsome‘temporaryuniverses’. (1958,p.118,latter emphasis mine)In other words, the fact that our attempts at justifying reflection have beensyntactic generalizations from particular instances is not accidental but is aninevitableconsequenceofthenatureofthereflectionscheme. Butinthatcaseit seems likely that any such justification will have a distinctly constructivistspin. A direct argument in support of reflection based on a platonistic under-standing of the iterative notion of set would indeed be ‘a coup’ (Aken 1986,p.1001), but for the reason just stated the prospects for such an argument arepoor."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Replacement22513.4 ReplacementLet us consider now an alternative strategy for justifying the reflection schemewhich stems from a technical result concerning the following scheme.Axiom scheme of replacement.Ifτ(x)is any term, this is an axiom:(∀x∈a)(τ(x)is a set)⇒{τ(x):x∈a}is a set.We have already shown in proposition 13.3.4 that every instance of thisscheme is a theorem ofZFU. But the technical result I want to consider isthe converse of this: if we letZFUrbe the theory whose axioms are those ofZUtogether with the axiom scheme of replacement, then we canprovereflec-tion inZFUr.(13.4.1)Theorem (ZFUr).IfΦis any formula, then(∃V)(Φ⇒Φ(V)).Proof. Every first-order sentence is logically equivalent to aprenexsentence,i.e. one of the formQ1x1Q2x2...QnxnΨ(x1,...,xn),where eachQris either∃or∀andΨis quantifier-free.

In the case wherer=0 we obtainΦ⇔Φ(Vω),whence the result.This technical result thus offers us the prospect of a wholly different route toan intuitive justification forZFU: instead of trying to justify reflection directly,we could concentrate on trying to justify replacement and then use the resultjust mentioned to derive reflection as a theorem. In this connection it is worthnoting a feature of the proof of reflection that marks it out as unusual. Thereflection principle is, of course, strictly speaking not a single theorem buta theorem scheme. This is not the first such scheme we have come across,but in all our previous encounters with the genre the schematic formula hasoccurred throughout the proof unanalysed: just as the scheme...Φ...weare trying to prove consists of instances of a second-order formula...X...,so theproofof the scheme has consisted of instances of a second-order proofinvolving the variableX. The proof we have just given of reflection, however,does not fall into this pattern at all: the proof strategy for each instance ofthe scheme depends on the logical complexity of the instance ofΦoccurringin it, and so it cannot be represented as an instance of a second-order proof.We saw earlier that reflection is unusual because we cannot justify it just byviewing it as a restriction of a single second-order axiom: the feature we havejust noted is powerful confirmation of this.In this respect reflection differs from replacement, whichcanbe viewed as aspecial case of a single second-order axiom.Axiom of replacement.(∀F)(∀a)(ais a set⇒{F(x):x∈a}is a set.11This is second-order because the first quantifier is intended to range over all functions in thelogical sense."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Limitation of size227So if we can find an argument for this second-order principle, we can thenassert the first-order scheme as an approximation to it, on the same patternas our justification of separation in chapter 3. The platonist, in particular,might regard this as a more plausible strategy, since it avoids the difficulty wefaced at the end of the last section: that a justification for reflection has to besensitive to the limits of what can be described, and hence seems inevitably tohave a constructivist slant.13.5 Limitation of sizeBut even if our new strategy is more plausible for the platonist, it is still veryproblematic. The argument that has most often been advanced to supportthesecond-order replacement principle, and hence derivatively the first-orderreplacement scheme, is of a wholly different sort from the motivation for theiterative conception which we discussed in chapter 3. This new sort of mo-tivation is known aslimitation of size. We group together under this headingthose principles which classify properties as collectivizing or not according tohowmanyobjects there are with the property. The origins of such principlesare quite old: Cantor outlined a theory based on them during the 1890s, forexample, although he did not publish it and communicated it only in letters(to Hilbert in 1897 and Dedekind in 1899). And Russell (independently, oneassumes) sketched another such theory, under the description ‘limitation ofsize’, in his 1906adiscussion of possible solutions to the paradoxes. The the-ory Russell eventually settled on does not owe anything to limitation of size,however, and little seems to have been made of the idea for some years there-after; but from the late 1920s it gained popularity, perhaps because of theadvocacy of von Neumann. The result of this was that it entered the con-sciousness of mathematicians, from which it has yet to be wholly dislodged. Itlives on, for example, in the practice of calling a mathematical entity (such asa category) ‘small’ if it is a collection.In discussing limitation of size it will be helpful to follow Boolos (1989) indistinguishing two variants, weak and strong.Weak limitation-of-size principle.If there are no moreFs thanGs and theGs form a collection, then theFs form a collection.Strong limitation-of-size principle.A propertyFfails to be collectivizing iffthere as as manyFs as there are objects.What these two principles have in common is the idea that there is a limit tothe size of a collection. The strong principle evidently implies the weak butnot conversely, since the weak principle allows the possibility that the limit onsize might fall short of the size of the universe. When we come to examine thedetails of the argument for limitation of size, there is, as one might expect, a"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"228Orders of infinitysubstantial difference between the platonist and constructivist accounts. Weshall consider what the constructivist has to say first, as it seems rather morestraightforward.Theconstructivist’smotivationforaffirmingthelimitation-of-sizeprinciple,weakorstrong, isthattherearelimitsonhowmanyobjectscanformacollec-tion — limits which result from constraints on our ability to comprehend theobjects to be collected. Let us follow Cantor in calling a cardinalityabsolutelyinfiniteif it is too large for that number of objects to be collected together. Itis easy to see how the very attempt to collect so many things together couldbe presented as an instance of that recurrent theme of human folly — hubrisin the face of the incomprehensible. Such a view is very old — it is a com-monplace among the Greeks — and Cantor espoused it with enthusiasm inthe argument he gave for the weak limitation-of-size principle. The differ-ence was that ancient authors had identified the Absolute with the infinite,whereasCantor now proposed to split them apartso that on his account therewould be cardinalities which are infinite but not absolutely infinite (hence arecomprehensible by human thought).Any theological argument for a mathematical principle will strike manymodern eyes as something close to a category mistake, and we are entitledto wonder whether a different argument is available. What we need fromthe constructivist is more detail on what is involved in comprehending someobjects as a collection. It cannot be merely a matter of understanding theproperty they share, since we presumably understand the property of self-identityeventhoughtheviewrequiresustodenythatwecanformacollectioncontainingeverythingwhichhasthisproperty. Perhaps,then,whatisrequiredis that we should run through the objects in our thought. If so, it is easy to seewhy pre-Cantorians identified the absolutely infinite with the simply infinite,since it is by no means clear how a finite being — even an idealized one — isexpected to be able to run through an infinity of things. To make any sense ofthis,wehavetobewillingtoacceptthecoherenceofthenotionofasupertask.Even supertasks have their limits, however: as we noted earlier (§11.1), ifa supertask is performed in time, and the structure of time is that of the realline, then every supertask is countable. So this account would make all un-countable cardinalities absolutely infinite. Some constructivists might be un-troubled by this, of course, but it is certainly inadequate to the intentions ofCantor himself, whose theory of uncountable cardinals was one of his greatestachievements. The strong suspicion must be that Cantor’s talk of sets being‘collectedtogetherinthought’isnottobetakenatitsconstructivistfacevalue.But if instead we adopt the platonist conception, the difficulty we face isthat it is very hard to see what argument remains for the weak limitation-of-size principle. If it is quite independent of our thought whether some thingsform a collection, why should it matter that there are a great many of them?And even if we succeed in motivating the weak limitation-of-size principle,"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Limitation of size229there remains the difficulty of saying how big the absolutely infinite cardinal-ities are. The platonist is committed, on pain of contradiction, to saying thatthere is no collection of everything, and hence that the number of everythingis absolutely infinite. Many from von Neumann on have claimed that this istheonlyabsolutely infinite cardinality, but it is not clear on what ground. Ifall that interested us were paradox-barring, it mightsufficeto rule out just thisone case, but why should we think that this is the only case thathasbeen ruledout?Let us turn now to the question of which of the axioms ofZFUrare justifiedby limitation of size. The easiest cases are the two axiom schemes, separationand replacement, which are obviously justified by weak limitation of size. Butthesetwoschemes, sopowerfulinthecontextoftheotheraxioms, donoworkat all on their own, as is easily seen by observing that they are both triviallysatisfied in a universe consisting only of the empty set. (The situation hereis thus analogous to the one faced by the iterative conception, which did notjustify the existence of any levels in the hierarchy until it was afforced by thesecond principle of plenitude.) This problem is not solved if we move to thestrong version of the limitation-of-size principle. Consider, for instance, auniverse with a countable infinity of individuals, and let the only sets there arebe hereditarily finite — finite sets of individuals, finite sets of such sets, etc.The total number of objects in such a universe would then still be countablyinfinite,andthestronglimitation-of-sizeprinciplewouldbesatisfied,buttherewould be no set of all individuals, and so even the temporary axiom of §4.2would not be satisfied.Rather similar considerations apply to the axiom of creation. For this tofollow from limitation of size, it would have to be the case that ifais small, i.e.less than the total number of objects, then 2ais too. But why should we thinkthat? There can be found in the literature somewhat half-hearted attemptsto assert that 2ais ‘not much bigger’ thana, but even if that were so (whichis open to doubt), a further argument would be required to conclude that thetotal number of things cannot be 2a.The difficulty is well illustrated by the fate of recent neo-logicist attempts tobase a theory of sets on the so-calledNew V, a second-order axiom encapsu-lating the strong limitation-of-size principle.{x:Fx}={x:Gx}⇔((∀x)(Fx⇔Gx)or there are as manyFsasGs).It is not, as some commentators (e.g. Ketland 2002) have thought, ‘surprising’that New V turns out to be incapable of generating a workable theory unlessweaddastrongaxiomastohowmanysetsthereare,butmerelyanindicationof the weakness of limitation of size taken on its own.

What we need, inotherwords,isanargumentastothesizeoftheset-theoreticpartoftheuniverse.But that is simply to ask how many sets there are, which is just the questionthat limitation of size cannot answer.We have focused so far on what limitation of size has to say about sets, butwe need also to consider whether it provides any motivation for this focus:does it, in other words, give us any reason to rule out ungrounded collections?It seems clear that it does not.

If we want an intuitive argument to support our theoryof sets, therefore, the dependency account seems to hold out a better prospectof success. But the replacement axiom has been thought to be something ofan embarrassment for this approach, since it is unclear how the dependencyaccount is supposed to justify it. Limiting case platonism might justify it, aftera fashion, but we have rejected that as unsatisfactory.

Of course,if the internal platonist argument for the well-foundedness of dependencysketched in §3.3 is correct, this generalization is harmless, since all collectionsare sets anyway. If it is not, then some further argument is required in orderto justify it. But in that circumstance more would in any case have to be saidabout the metaphysical nature of ungrounded collections in order to justifywhatever other axioms were assumed about them: whether the generalizedseparation principle is correct would presumably depend on that.So let us leave that question on one side and focus instead on what I amcalling the size principle. I wish to suggest that this can be given a plausiblemotivationbasedon the ideathat whatis essential toa collectionis how manymembers it has. To put the idea in context, let us consider a notion that isnowadays a commonplace in mathematics. A property is group-theoretic iftwo isomorphic groups cannot differ with respect to it; a property istopologicalif two homeomorphic metric spaces cannot differ with respect to it; and soon. Now the analogue of isomorphism or homeomorphism in the case ofcollections is the notion of a one-to-one correspondence. By extension, then,a property iscollection-theoreticif a class has it if and only if all equinumerousclasses have it. If, as seems reasonable, we take the property a class may haveof there being a collection with just those members to be collection-theoretic,we arrive straightforwardly at the size principle.This argument does little more than spell out the simple thought that acollection isbarelycomposed of its members: no further structure is imposedon them than they have already. So, the thought runs, whatelsecould therebe to determine whether some objects form a collection than how many thereare of them? What else could even be relevant?13.7 Higher stillRecent research in set theory has been dominated by the study of what areknown aslarge cardinal axioms. These are cardinal existence claims that are in-dependent ofZFCbut are nevertheless believed to be consistent with it.

Each large cardinal axiom is inparticular an axiom of infinity in the sense of this chapter, since the existenceof a large cardinal entails the existence of the levels in the hierarchy needed toarrive at it. There is now a huge literature on large cardinals — for instance(in increasing order of size) strongly inaccessible, strongly Mahlo, measurable,Woodin, and supercompact cardinals — and on the corresponding axioms ofinfinity.The study of these axioms has brought to light further close connectionswith the structure of sets of real numbers: we have noted already that theproof of determinacy for Borel sets requires the axiom of ordinals; and thisresult has turned out to have analogues at higher levels. The pattern is thusthatproofsofthedeterminacyofmoreandmorecomplexsubsetsoftheBaireline appeal to larger and larger cardinals.Perhaps the most striking result of this sort has its origins in a famous errorofLebesgue(1905, pp.191–2). HeclaimedthatacontinuousimageofaBorelset is in turn a Borel set, but his argument was, as he later acknowledged,‘simple, short, but false’ (Lusin 1930, p.vii): he had mistakenly assumed thatf−1(\u0001n∈ωωωωAn)=\u0001n∈ωωωωf−1(An),which need not be true iffis not one-to-one. The error was noticed bySouslin (1917), who gave an example to show that ananalyticset, i.e. one thatis the continuous image of a Borel set, need not be Borel.2This discovery lednaturally to the study of theprojectivesets, i.e. the sets obtainable from closedsets if we are allowed to form continuous images as well as countable unionsand complements arbitrarily often. The projective sets form a much more in-clusive class than the Borel sets, and the definition of a projective set may bemuch more complex. In studying such sets the key idea is the realization byKuratowski and Tarski (1931) that methods for obtaining projective sets cor-respond to logical operations. This has the consequence that whereas the ax-iomofordinalsissufficienttoprovethedeterminacyofthegameonanyBorelset, to generalize this result to an arbitrary projective set it is not enough toassume even the existence of a measurable cardinal; the proof of this determ-inacy claim thathasbeen found makes the very much stronger assumptionthat there exist infinitely many Woodin cardinals (Martin and Steel 1988).And with a yet stronger axiom of infinity the result can be generalized stillfurther, to what are sometimes called thequasi-projectivesets, an even more in-clusiveclassconsistingofsetswhichoccurinaconstructiblehierarchystarting2Ironically, Lebesgue had constructed just such a set for another purpose in his original paper."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Higher still233from the set of real numbers: if we assume that there are not only infinitelymany Woodin cardinals but also a measurable cardinal above them, we canprove that the game on every quasi-projective set is determined.3We shall have a little more to say about these results in §15.7. For the mo-ment, however, we confine ourselves to comments on the motivation for largecardinal axioms. G ̈odel’s theorems warn us, of course, that we cannot expectaproofthat any such axiom is consistent. Intuitive arguments for the plaus-ibility of large cardinal axioms have been attempted, e.g. Reinhardt’s (1974)argument for the existence of supercompact cardinals,4but those that havebeen given so far have a notably sketchy and provisional character. Whenreading about large cardinals, it is hard to avoid a nagging feeling that theirsize makes them literally incredible. Having swallowed the notion of a meas-urable cardinal, for instance, we turn the page and read that a supercompactcardinal is larger still — so much larger that the set of measurable cardinalsless than the least supercompact cardinal is itself of measurable cardinality.Itisnotablethattheformalistmodeofspeech,alwayspopularamongmath-ematicians, seems especially so when large cardinals are in question. Indeedit is tempting to sympathize with Wittgenstein’s suggestion that it is a mistaketo regard infinite cardinals asbigat all.א0is not an enormous number....The child who has learntא0multiplications hasn’tlearnt anything huge. ... “I bought something infinite and carried it home.” Youmight say, “Good lord!

This is the idea thatinfinite sets are, as far as possible, just like finite sets. If we adopt this idea, weare encouraged to regard the claim that a large cardinal is much bigger than,say,א0as having the same sort of import as the claim that 1020is much biggerthan 12. But if we do that, do we lose our grip on reality? Do we, as Booloshas suggested,suspect that, however it may have been at the beginning of the story, by the timewe have come thus far the wheels are spinning and we are no longer listening to adescription of anything that is the case? (2000, p.268)3This assertion is often abbreviated as ADL(R)in the literature.4Maddy has declined to call arguments such as Reinhardt’s intuitive on the ground that ‘theyextendbeyondanythingthatcouldplausiblybetracedtoanunderlyingperceptual,neurologicalfoundation’ (1990, p.141).

But we shouldnot ignore another use they have in application to results whichareprovablewithout them but which can be given much shorter, more elegant or moreperspicuous proofs by means of them.Notice straightaway that although they are all desirable in their way, thesethree criteria — brevity, elegance and perspicuity — are undoubtedly dis-tinct: the shortest proof is often not the most perspicuous, nor sometimes themost elegant. When it comes to studying the matter systematically, we haveto recognize that elegance and perspicuity are of course much less objectivethan mere length and hence less amenable to formal study. In relation tolength, however, the phenomenon we are alluding to — that there is a trade-off between the abstractness of a proof and its brevity — is a familiar fact ofmathematical experience: when learning mathematics we sometimes strugglethrough a long but (at least in an informal sense) elementary proof of a result,only to discover much later that it can be proved more quickly by applying anabstract theory. So far this is just an informal observation, though: in makingit precise, we face the difficulty that the size of a proof is highly sensitive tothe form in which the theory is presented. If we measure the size of a proofby the number of lines it contains, every axiomatizable first-order theory isequivalent to one in which every theorem has a 3-line proof. This brevity isonly achieved, however, by sacrificing a feature of all the theories we actuallydeal with, namely that they are axiomatized by means of a finite number ofaxiomsorschemes,andforsuchtheorieswehavethefollowingtheorem: ifU\u0002is strictly stronger thanU, there exists a numberNsuch that for anymthereis a sentence provable in no more thanNlines inU\u0002whose shortest proof inUhas more thanmlines (Buss 1994).On the other hand, the number of lines in a proof is not a good measure offeasibility, since each line might be unfeasibly long. But even if we measurethe size of a proof by the number of characters it contains, small variationsof presentation may have an enormous effect on size. A dramatic example ofthis is provided by Mathias (2002), who has shown that the term used to ex-press the cardinal number 1, which in many formal systems has a few dozencharacters, in Bourbaki’s (1954) formal system has about 1012characters; andan apparently trivial emendation of the system in the 4th edition of the book,by which the ordered pair is given the Kuratowski definition rather than be-ing treated as a primitive, makes the term explode to about 1054characters.5Despite this, however, it turns out that the analogue of Buss’s theorem for this5More precisely, Mathias claims that the term in question has 2,409,875,496,393,137,472,149,767,527,877,436,912,979,508,338,752,092,897 characters, but I have not checked his arith-metic myself."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Speed-up theorems235measure of size is available (Mostowski 1952): ifU\u0002is strictly stronger thanU,there exists a numberNsuch that for anymthere is a sentence with a proofshorter thanNcharacters inU\u0002whose shortest proof inUhas more thanmcharacters.Nonetheless, as with the incompleteness phenomenon discussed earlier,what we are interested in here is not so much these wholly general resultsas genuinely mathematical instances of them.

Examples of speed-up that we meet in practice may not be sostriking. Moreover, perspicuity is just as important as length: it is not muchhelp that a short proof exists if we cannot find it. Examples of these phe-nomena occur at various levels in the hierarchy. We mentioned in chapter 5that Dirichlet’s theorem in arithmetic was shown to have a proof inPAonly acentury after an analytic one was discovered. Adjoining infinitesimals to thetheory of real numbers is capable of speeding up proofs. And the theoremthat the game on any Borel set is determined was first proved assuming theexistence of measurable cardinals; Martin’s later proof (1975) which requiresjust the axiom of ordinals is significantly more complicated and depends onan entirely new idea.NotesWe have been concerned here with two related phenomena: there are resultsprovable in a strong set theoryU\u0002whose proofs in a weaker theoryUare verymuch longer; and there are results provable inU\u0002which are not provable inUat all.

In this chapter we shallinvestigate some generalizations of the axiom of countable choice that sharethis feature, and enquire a little further into whether the lack of uniqueness insuch specifications should be regarded as troubling.14.1 The axiom of countable dependent choiceConsiderthefollowingattempttoprovethatapartiallyorderedsetispartiallywell-orderediffitcontainsnostrictlydecreasingsequences.

Now choose an elementx0inBand define a sequence(xn)inBas follows: oncexnhas been chosen, letxn+1be any element ofBless thanxn. (Such an element exists becauseBhas nominimal element.) The sequence(xn)is clearly strictly decreasing.The difficulty with this argument is that it requires a countable infinity ofchoicestobemadeinordertogeneratethesequence(xn). However,itcannotbe justified by appeal to the axiom of countable choice, because that axiomlicenses onlyindependentchoices. One way of putting the point might be byappeal to a temporal metaphor: the choices involved are not simultaneous,sincexn+1cannot be chosen until the value ofxnis known. The necessityfor making choices in this way arises sufficiently often in mathematics for itto be worthwhile to single out the set-theoretic principle which licenses theprocedure.Axiom of countable dependent choice.Ifris a relation on a setAsuch that(∀x∈A)(∃y∈A)(xr y), then for anya∈Athere exists a sequence(xn)inAsuch thatx0=aandxnrxn+1for alln∈ωωωω."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"The axiom of countable dependent choice239(14.1.1)Proposition.The axiom of countable dependent choice implies theaxiom of countable choice.Proof.

Some authors havethought that this dependence on choice could be used to neutralize the sub-model version as a philosophical weapon. Indeed the reason Skolem (1922)gave for proving the weaker version of the theorem which we stated in §6.6,when he had already proved the submodel version two years earlier, was thathewantedtoderivephilosophicalconsequencesfromitwithoutdependingonchoice.But in fact the issue about the use of choice here is a red herring, for in thecase which is used to generate Skolem’s paradox the theorem is applied to amodelofsettheoryitself, andinthiscasetheuseofdependentchoicetoprovethe theorem is eliminable. That is to say, the following theorem is provable inZUwithoutany use of choice.Theorem.Every [transitive] model ofZFhas a countable [transitive] sub-model.It is this theorem that provides us with a more precise (and, some havethought, more troubling) version of Skolem’s paradox. To see why, let usonce more shift our perspective to that of a metalanguage. Applying thesubmodel version of the L ̈owenheim/Skolem theorem, we can deduce thatthere is a countable transitive setMsuch that(M,∈)is a model of set the-ory. Moreover, sinceMis countable and transitive, every member ofMisalso countable. Yet all the theorems ofZFare true inM: in particular,Mhas members, such as the set which acts inMas the power set of the naturalnumbers, which are not countable-in-M. So countability is not equivalent tocountability-in-M. Set theorists express this by saying that countability is notanabsoluteproperty.What we saw when we first discussed Skolem’s paradox in §6.6 was that ifwe keep the meaning of the logical vocabulary fixed but leave the domain ofinterpretation and the extension of the membership relation unconstrained,we cannot tie down the cardinality of the domain. What we can now do onthe basis of the stronger version of the theorem is to extend this even to thecasewheretheextensionofthemembershiprelationiskeptfixed. Whatvariesbetweeninterpretationsisnowonlytherangeofthequantifiers,butthisdegreeof variation is sufficient to change the extension of the predicate ‘countable’.Thus set theory has (assuming always that it is consistent) a modelMwhichis uncountable from within and countable from without. It is easy to see howwe have allowed this to happen: the first-order scheme of separation is weakbecause at each level in the construction of a model it forces us to include{x∈V:Φ}only for formulaeΦin the (countable) language of the theory.The second-order variant of the theory has no such weakness.So for some models of first-order set theory there are perspectives fromwhich they are countable.

Even so, in his 1900 lecture to the International Congressof Mathematicians, Hilbert rather generously referred to the well-orderingprinciple as a ‘theorem of Cantor’, but instead posed the problem of findingadefinitewell-ordering on the real line. Soon Zermelo (1904) formulated theaxiom of choice (Auswahlaxiom) explicitly and showed how to deduce the well-ordering principle from it.(14.4.2)Lemma (Zermelo 1904).For every well-ordering on a setAthereexists a definite choice function forP(A), and conversely.Necessity.

Immediate from the lemma.The more demanding problem posed by Hilbert ofdefininga well-ordering onRis not soluble even if we assume the axiom of choice: there is no termσinthe first-order language of set theory for which we can prove inZFCthatσisa well-ordering ofR(Feferman 1965). Put more informally, this means thatthe axiom of choice guarantees the existence of a well-ordering onRwithoutgiving us the means to define one.The axiom of choice was used a number of times by mathematicians in thefirst few years of the 20th century — for details see the notes at the end ofthe chapter — but it was certainly Zermelo’s use of it in his 1904 proof of thewell-ordering principle that pushed the axiom of choice to centre stage andmade it a matter of active controversy among mathematicians. This was evenmore the case after K ̈onig (1905) published a purported proof of a resultcon-tradictingthe axiom of choice: there then followed a flurry of discussion of Zer-melo’s proof inMathematische Annalen(Borel 1905; Bernstein 1905a; Jourdain1905; Sch ̈onflies 1905),Bulletin de la Soci ́et ́e Math ́ ematique de France(Borel, Baire,Hadamard and Lebesgue 1905),Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society(Hobson 1905; Dixon 1905; Hardy 1906; Jourdain 1906; Russell 1906b), andelsewhere."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Maximal principles245Onemotivedrivingsomeofthecriticsseemstohavebeenthattheyalreadybelieved the well-ordering principle to be false and therefore needed to findfault with Zermelo’s proof somehow. Now his 1904 proof made use oftransfinite induction on the ordinals (as does the one we have just given), andany use of ordinals was still tainted by Burali-Forti’s paradox, so some of theobjectors focused on this rather than on the use of the axiom of choice. Hob-son (1905, p.185), for instance, complained that ‘the non-recognition of theexistence of “inconsistent” aggregates, which existence, on the assumption ofCantor’s theory cannot be denied, introduces an additional element of doubtas regards this proof’. It was in order to answerthiscriticism that Zermelopublished another proof (1908a) which eliminated the previous use of ordin-als by means of an extension of Dedekind’sKettentheorie. This left the axiomof choice as the only principle used in the new proof that the critics couldreasonably object to.The well-ordering principle is often a useful way of applying the axiom ofchoice: here is a more or less typical illustration.(14.4.4)Proposition.Assuming the axiom of choice, every partial ordering\u0001on a setAcan be extended to a total ordering.Proof. The key to the proof is that by the well-ordering principle we can ex-pressA×Aas the range of a transfinite sequenceA×A={(xα,yα):α<β}.We then define recursively a family(<α)α\u0002βof partial orderings onAcon-taining<as follows.

The final element of this transfinitesequence of partial orderings contains<and is obviously a maximal elementof the set of all partial orderings onA, i.e. a total ordering onA.14.5 Maximal principlesIt gradually became apparent that Zermelo’s (1908a) elimination of ordin-als from his proof of the well-ordering principle was a case of a much moregeneral method for applying the axiom of choice without invoking ordinals:very many applications of the axiom of choice in mathematics use it to obtainmaximal elements of particular partially ordered sets. In this section we shallisolate the properties which these uses of the axiom depend on. This materialis principally of mathematical interest and is not used in the remainder of thebook.Definition.A partially ordered set(A,\u0001)is said to beinductively ordered(and\u0001is said to be aninductive orderingonA) if every totally ordered subsetofAhas a supremum inA."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"246The axiom of choiceEvery inductively ordered set is non-empty and has a least element (since Øis totally ordered).

But it is one thing to prove a result and quite an-other to appreciate its utility. Hausdorff’s widely readMengenlehre(1914) doesnot even mention this result, and although it does contain the closely relatedresult that every partially ordered set has a maximal totally ordered subset(see exercise 6 below), which is often referred to as ‘Hausdorff’s maximalityprinciple’, neither he nor anyone else seems to have appreciated its useful-ness then. Whitehead and Russell came rather close to stating the maximalprinciple in their presentation of Zermelo’s theorem inPrincipia Mathematica(1910–13,∗258), but once again they failed to see its usefulness.WhenKuratowskirediscoveredthemaximalprinciplein1922,ontheotherhand, it was quite explicitly as part of a reductionist programme stemmingfrom Zermelo’s (1908b) axiomatization of set theory. As we have alreadynoted, the form this axiomatization took was strongly influenced by Zer-melo’s desire to provide a basis for his new proof of the well-ordering prin-ciple: crudely speaking, he chose the weakest natural-seeming axioms whichwould justify his proof. As a result the system was not strong enough to con-tain ordinal arithmetic without an additional postulate on the existence oftransfinite numbers. But in the following years numerous important resultswere proved from the axiom of choice by transfinite induction.

Then Kuratowskiturned Zermelo’s method for eliminating ordinals into a general procedureand hence obtained the maximal principle: the result was a method by whichproofs which use transfinite induction could be transformed into proofs whichdo not and which could therefore be formalized in Zermelo’s system."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"Maximal principles249ButjustwhenKuratowskiwasdemonstratinghowusesofordinalscouldbeuniformly eliminated from proofs, the adoption of the axioms for set theorystrong enough to deliver von Neumann’s theory of ordinals was making thismanoeuvre formally unnecessary.2So although after Kuratowski the max-imalprinciplecontinuedtobeusedoccasionally,itdidnotachievewidespreadfame because the advantages he claimed for it were axiomatic and aestheticrather than practical: mathematicians have always been loath to give up con-venienttoolsforthesakeoflogicalpurity. Thesecondrediscoveryofthemax-imal principle by Zorn (1935) was decisive in ensuring its lasting popularity asa mathematical tool, partly no doubt because he gave convincing evidence ofits usefulness rather than merely its elegance, but also because he had recentlyemigrated from Hamburg to New England: it was taken up by the active re-search communities there, among whom it became known as ‘Zorn’s lemma’,the name by which it is universally known today (see Campbell 1978).The final step in popularizing this maximal principle was taken by Bour-baki, who not only stated both the version for abstract partial order relations(due to Bochner 1928) and the Teichm ̈uller/Tukey principle (in 1939), but— more importantly — went on to exploit these principles systematically inthe subsequent parts of the treatise. Bourbaki’s presentation is in this regardthe fulfilment of Kuratowski’s reductionist programme of eliminating ordin-als: Bourbaki does not even trouble to define the notion of an ordinal in thetext of his work but relegates it to an exercise, and he avoids using ordin-als in his proofs. However, Bourbaki’s reason for proceeding in this mannercannot have been foundational in quite the way that Kuratowski’s had been,since Bourbaki’s formal system is quite strong enough to define the ordinalsif required; instead the reason was presumably aesthetic, stemming from apreference for what were seen as purely algebraic methods.Exercises1.

However, wehavenotyetconsideredwhethertheaxiom is true. Certainly many mathematicians have doubted it. For instance,Littlewood (1926, p.25): ‘Reflection makes the intuition of its truth doubtful,analysing it into prejudices derived from the finite case, and short of intuitionthereseemsnoevidenceinitsfavour.’ Whatisclearisthatthesortoftemporalmotivation which we gave for the axiom of countable dependent choice is notavailable. A quasi-temporal argument can perhaps be given in favour of theaxiom of well-ordered choice, first proposed by Hardy (1906), which assertsthat the range of every transfinite sequence(Aα)α<βof non-empty sets has achoice function, but even here the temporal analogy seems rather far-fetchedwhenβisuncountable. Andinthegeneralcase, wherewewanttochooseoneelement from each of an arbitrary family of non-empty sets, whatever is left ofthe temporal idea evaporates, as the sets are not presented in any particularorder, temporal or otherwise.The arguments that are given by mathematicians for believing the axiomof choice are often quite weak. One common argument generalizes fromthe finite case on the basis that there is no reason to suppose that infinitecollectionsbehaveanydifferently. Thedifficultywiththisisthatwehavebeengiven nothing except a wing and a prayer to support the view that they donotbehave differently. Another variant proceeds more cautiously by generalizingfirst from the finite to the countable case in the constructive manner alreadyoutlined, and then generalizing to the uncountable case by appeal to the ideathat an ideal being could achieve the choices required of him (or perhapsHim). The main difficulty with this is that the most convincing argument for"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Regressive arguments251the extension from the finite to the countable case, namely that it dependsmerely on performing the supertask of making an infinite number of choicesin a finite time, does not extend to the uncountable case. If we say, on theother hand, that the choices involved are merely logical choices and do notactually have to bemade, hence do not occur in time at all, then it is very hardto see what is left in the metaphor of ‘choice’ that is doing any work. In short,this sort of argument for the axiom of choice appears to rest on a version ofthe limiting case platonism which we were so suspicious of in §3.2.Another line that has often been taken is to justify the axiom of choiceby appealing to qualities of the theory which results from assuming it. Wehave had cause to mention already a few of the consequences of the axiomof choice, but it has many more. A common pattern in many parts of math-ematics is that a theorem provable for a restricted class of cases without theaxiom becomes provable without restriction if we assume it. Here are a fewexamples:(1) Every finite-dimensional vector space has a basis.(AC)Everyvector space has a basis.(2) Every countable field has an algebraic closure.(AC)Everyfield has an algebraic closure.(3) Every separable Hilbert space contains a complete orthonormal se-quence.(AC) Every Hilbert space contains a complete orthonormal set.(4) Every consistent set of sentences in a countable first-order language hasa model.(AC) Every consistent set of sentences in a first-order language of arbit-rary cardinality has a model.If the criterion on which we judge mathematical theories is their elegance,then, the axiom of choice may be counted a success. Many parts of puremathematicsattainamoreelegantformifweassumetheaxiomofchoicethanif we do not. Another criterion on which the axiom of choice scores highly isfruitfulness. There are many problems in diverse parts of mathematics whichcan be solved only with its aid; and many authors have taken the fruitfulnessof an axiom as an argument for its truth.3For the genuine formalist, of course, there is little more to be said: evenif the elegance and fruitfulness of the resulting theories are reason enough toaccept the axiom of choice — which for the formalist means ‘treat its con-sequences as worthy of attention’ — this does not preclude the possibility that3Curiously, though, one occasionally finds quite the opposite view expressed: ‘The moreproblems a new axiom settles, the less reason we have for believing the axiom is true.’(Shoenfield 1977, p.344)"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"252The axiom of choiceotherset-theoretic principles contradicting the axiom of choice might also beworthy of study. The difficulty with assessing how attractive these competingtheories might be, however, is that very little work has been done on findingout their properties: a few mathematicians have studied the consequences ofthe axiom of determinacy, which contradicts the axiom of choice (see §15.7below), but at the moment this is a rather isolated case. If the study of ax-ioms contradicting the axiom of choice became more common, moreover, itis not evident that this would simply lead to competing versions of the wholeof mathematics, one version assuming the axiom of choice and the other as-suming the other principle. What seems more likely is that different sorts ofmathematicians might settle on different set-theoretic principles as appropri-ate to their own disciplines.It is still not clear, however, whether a split of this sort — different addi-tional axioms for different parts of mathematics — could usefully be accom-modated within a single theory of sets. Such an accommodation would bepossible only if the objects used as proxies in embedding the various theoriesintothetheoryofsetswereset-theoreticallydistinguishableinsomeprincipledmanner, but this does not at the moment seem at all plausible. Althoughmathematiciansdonotseemtohavearticulatedthepointinquitethisform, itmay be one of the reasons why some of them eschew the idea that any singletheory can act as a foundation for the whole of mathematics.None of these considerations, however, is of much direct help to therealistin deciding whether the axiom of choice is true, unless there is some gen-eral reason to think that the truth is always pretty. On the contrary, there issome reason to suspect that, in mathematics at least, the truth, while not per-haps downright ugly, is at any rate not always optimally beautiful. So for theconsequences of the axiom of choice to give the realist a regressive reason tobelieve that it is true, it is not enough that they should form an elegant theory:thereneedstobesomereasontobelievethattheyaretrue,independentofthefact that they follow from it. In this respect, of course, the axiom is in just thesame position as any other candidate for extending the default theory, such asthe higher axioms of infinity of the last chapter.14.7 The axiom of constructibilityThere is one striking difference, though: in contrast to the axioms of infinity,the consequences of the axiom of choice which might bear on the questionof its truth are never number-theoretic. To explain this point, we need toexamine in more detail the method by which G ̈odel proved that the axiom ofchoice is consistent with set theory. At the opposite extreme to the maximalconception of the formation of power sets, mentioned earlier, is theminimalconception according to which the only sets created at each stage are those"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"The axiom of constructibility253forcedonusbytheaxiomsofZU. Fraenkel(1922b)suggestedaddinganaxiomof restriction (Axiom der Beschr ̈anktheit) to achieve this, but did not succeed informalizing the notion. The first satisfactory formulation of an axiom of thisbroad sort is due to G ̈odel (1938), who defined in the language of set theorya much more restrictive hierarchy consisting (roughly) of sets which can bedefined by means of a formula which refers only to sets which have alreadybeen created.In §3.5 we briefly canvassed the idea of a hierarchy formed by a whollypredicative process. If Lαis a level in such a hierarchy, the following levelLα+1will consist only of sets of the form{x∈Lα:Φ(Lα)}, i.e. sets definableby means of formulae whose quantifiers are restricted to range only over Lα.G ̈odel showed that the definition of this notion of constructibility, whichprimafaciequantifies metalinguistically overΦ, can in fact be formalized within thetheory of sets, and hence that the constructible hierarchyLconsisting of thesubsets of the constructible levels Lαis a well-defined subclass of the universeof setsV.4The assertion thateveryset is constructible, i.e. thatV=L, canthen, somewhatsurprisingly, beexpressedasasinglesentenceinthelanguageof set theory. We shall call it theaxiom of constructibility.Axiom of constructibility.Every set is constructible.G ̈odel showed that not only the axiom of constructibility but all the axiomsofZFhold when all the quantifiers in them are restricted toL. It follows atonce, of course, that ifZFis consistent, then so isZFtogether with the axiomof constructibility. This is significant because of the following result.Theorem (G ̈odel 1938).The axiom of constructibility entails the axiom ofchoice.If we combine this with the relative consistency result just mentioned, wereach the conclusion that ifZFis consistent, then it remains so when we addthe axiom of choice.Nowwenotedearlierthatpredicativesettheoryonitsownisratherweak: ifwe replace the axiom scheme of separation with its predicative weakening, wecannot, for instance, prove the existence of any uncountable sets. So G ̈odel’sdemonstration that all the axioms of set theory, including impredicative sep-aration, hold in the constructible hierarchy is at first sight surprising. Thepointtorealize, however, isthatwhatgivesG ̈odel’sconstructiblehierarchyitsstrength is its appeal to apriortheory of ordinals. What G ̈odel discovered wasthatapredicativeprocessoftheformationoflevelscangenerateimpredicativesets if the number of iterations of the process is given by an impredicativelyspecified ordinal: each level Lαin the constructible hierarchy contains onlysets specifiable predicatively in terms of the lower levels, but this hierarchy is4Here once again we use for convenience the language of classes.

This bears on the discussion in the last chapter ofthe technical advantages of such axioms. We noted there that set theoriststhemselves have a reason to assume the axiom of ordinals because it ensuresthat every well-founded set-theoretic model of set theory itself is isomorphicto a standard model, i.e. a model in which ‘∈’ is interpreted as membership(Mostowski’s collapsing lemma). The axiom scheme of reflection supports thestudy of models even more strongly because it gives the hierarchy room forother operations to close out with fixed points. One example is provided byG ̈odel’s proof of the consistency of the axiom of choice just described: G ̈odeldiscovered the proof in 1935, but one reason for the delay in publication wasthat he spent a long time trying to make it work in such a way that it wouldapplytoatheorylikeZwhichdoesnotassumeanythingasstrongasreflection.When we discussed the submodel form of the L ̈owenheim/Skolem the-orem, we touched briefly on one consequence of reflection that is relevanthere: ifZFis consistent, there is a countable transitive class which is a stand-ard model of it; and reflection shows that this class is aset. In fact, G ̈odel’sconstructible hierarchy allows us to describe one particular countable modelmuch more precisely. This is because whether a set is an inner model ofZFis only a matter of whether it satisfies certain closure conditions, so that theintersection of all the transitive standard models ofZFis itself a model, calledtheminimalmodel. NowthisminimalmodelcanbeshowntobeequaltoLξ0forsome countable ordinalξ0. This provides us with a graphic illustration of therelativity of cardinality that we discussed earlier: the von Neumann ordinalswhich belong to Lξ0are precisely those<ξ0, and yet, since Lξ0is a model ofZF, many of these von Neumann ordinals are, relative to Lξ0, uncountable.What makes this possible, of course, is just that the power-set operation hasbeen interpreted in the constructible hierarchy as thinly as possible within theconstraints of the first-order theoryZF. We might be tempted to think of Lξ0as realizing a sort of contrary of the principle of plenitude — a principle ofpaucity, if you will — in respect both of the thinness of each level and of thetotal number of levels.We have called the assumption that every set is constructible an ‘axiom’,but is there any reason to think it is true? At first sight the principle of ontolo-gical parsimony which encourages some authors to eliminate individuals andun-well-founded classes makes it an attractive assumption, since it asserts thateverysetoccursinahighlyrestrictivehierarchyinwhichonlythosesetsessen-tial to the theory are created. G ̈odel himself initially flirted with the thoughtthatitgives‘anaturalcompletionoftheaxiomsofsettheory, insofarasitde-termines the vague notion of an arbitrary infinite set in a definite way’ (1938,p.557). However,thepictureoftheset-theoreticuniversewhichthisforceson"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"The axiom of constructibility255us has seemed very implausible to many subsequent writers (including G ̈odelhimself in later life): it is difficult to find a reason for believing that the pre-dicative creation process represented by the constructible hierarchy and theimpredicative process represented by the traditional hierarchy should bothresult in the same sets being created, as the axiom of constructibility wouldhave us believe.So the axiom of constructibility has little direct support. Does it then haveany regressive support? It certainly gives a neat theory which settles not justthe axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis (see below) but variousotherwise problematic questions in the theory of sets of real numbers. How-ever, this has been thought by most set theorists not to give regressive supportto the axiom, because it is felt to settle these questions in the ‘wrong’ way.It would take us too far afield to examine here the intuitions they appeal toin reaching this conclusion: I shall note only that it is not shared universally.Friedman (2000, p.437), for instance, regards the intuition that the axiom ofconstructibility is false as dubious: ‘I don’t have it, and mathematicians ingeneraldisclaimit.’ AndJensen(1995, p.398)hasevensaid, ‘Ipersonallyfind[constructibility] a very attractive axiom.’In any case, the axiom of constructibility is of no help to us in decidingwhetherweshouldbelievetheaxiomofchoiceifwedonotalreadybelievetheaxiom of purity, for if the set of individuals is formless — and hence not well-orderable — no amount of care in limiting the construction of the hierarchycan change that. But even if constructibility is not a plausible hypothesis,the method of proving relative consistency results by forming inner modelsof the theory such asLgenerates useful information about the strength ofthe axioms that hold in it. The most striking result of this sort is that theaxiom of constructibility (and hence the axiom of choice) makes no differencewhatever in the sphere of first-order arithmetic (Ax and Kochen 1965). Forsuppose we have a proof of a first-order arithmetical sentence which uses theaxiom of choice. This proof is not correct as it stands if the axiom of choice isfalse. But the key fact to note is that if we relativize all the quantifiers in ourdefinition of the set of natural numbers toL, the set that is picked out doesnot change. (In the set theorists’ jargon,ωωωωisabsoluteforL.) This is significantbecause the axiom of choice is certainly true inL, whether or not it is true inthe whole set-theoretic universeV. So if we now relativize all the quantifiersin our proof toL, what we obtain is a correct proof, not assuming the axiomof choice, of a conclusion concerning the set of natural numbers ofL. Butbecauseωωωωis absolute forL, the conclusion of the relativized proof is thesameas the conclusion of the original one. Thus, to repeat, any first-order number-theoretic sentence provable with the axiom of choice is provable without it.Similar remarks apply even more directly to elementary geometry, becauseit can be given a complete first-order axiomatization (Tarski 1959) and soanyconsistent extension of it will be trivially conservative. Therefore adding the"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"256The axiom of choiceaxiom of constructibility (ora fortiorithe axiom of choice) to set theory willmake no difference to what can be proved in elementary geometry either.Indeed Putnam (1980) has extended the idea even further by observing thatfor any given countable setSof real numbers there is a model of set theorywhich satisfies the axiom of constructibility and contains the given setSaswell as a standard copy of the natural numbers. By applying this result to thecase in which the setScontains all the ‘operational constraints’ — correctassignments of values to all magnitudes which sentient beings in this physicaluniversecanactuallymeasure—Putnamdrawstheconclusionthatthetruth-valueoftheaxiomofconstructibility(andafortiorioftheaxiomofchoice)cannotbe determined by these operational constraints.These facts are important partly because they indicate that whether the ax-iom of choice is true is a question to which many mathematicians, not justnumber theorists, may safely remain indifferent. But they are important,too, because they entail that the only propositions which the regressive the-orist could use to test the axiom of choice belong to the parts of mathematicswhose application to the world might be thought to be already theory-laden.We cannot, in other words, expect to find results which could provide simpleempirical tests of the axiom, such as ‘If the axiom of choice is true, the ForthBridge will not fall down.’ The consequences of the axiom of choice whichthe regressive theorist has to work on belong to relatively abstract branches ofmathematics where our intuitions are already stretched taut.14.8 Intuitive argumentsSo if regressive arguments for the truth of the axiom are likely to remain in-conclusive, wemustfallbackonintuitionsbearingdirectlyontheaxiomitself.An argument one finds quite frequently is that the axiom of choice can be de-rived from the first principle of plenitude which we stated in §3.5. The idea inoutline is that if a level in the hierarchy really does containallpossible subsetsof the previous levels, it will in particular contain all the choice sets. ‘For thefat (or “full”) hierarchy, the axiom of choice is quite evident.’ (Kreisel 1980,p.192)ThissortofargumentgoesbacktoRamsey(1926): headvancedacon-ception of sets as wholly extensional entities not dependent for their existenceon there being any means of specifying their members, and claimed that onthis conception the axiom of choice is ‘an obvious tautology’.The argument can be spelt out as follows. Consider the following second-order logical principle:(∀x)(∃y)Φ(x,y)⇒(∃F)(∀x)Φ(x,F(x)).(1)Hintikka (1998, pp.39–48) and others have argued that it is hard to see howwe could deny the truth of this principle for all formulaeΦexcept by read-"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Intuitive arguments257ing the first-order existential quantifier classically and the second-order oneconstructively; when both are read classically, the principle is quite unobjec-tionable.Let us suppose for the sake of argument, then, that (1)isa logical truth.

Since the formalization of first-order logic is complete, that resultholds good whatever second-order logical principles we manage to persuadeourselves of. What the argument just given does, rather, is to draw attentionto the fact that the axiomatizations of set theory from which the axiom ofchoice has been shown to be independent are all first-order. Specifically, theaxiom of choice is not derivable from any instance of thefirst-orderseparationscheme: the sign ‘F’ in the argument for the axiom of choice stands for alogicalfunction, i.e. a second-order entity, not a set of ordered pairs. So theexplanation is simply that the instance of separation used to obtain the setCis not expressible in the first-order language.Theeffectofthisistonarrowdowntheoptionsforanyonewishingtorejectthe axiom of choice. Short of denying the second-order principle (1), one isforced to adopt some argument for first-order separation other than the onewe gave in §3.5 which justified it as an approximation to the second-orderaxiom. This might well not bother the constructivists, who are unlikely tohave been impressed by that argument in the first place, but their argumentsfall well short of justifying the impredicative separation scheme, and so theycan be expected to have stopped reading long ago. The question of interesthere, therefore, is not whether the constructivists should believe the axiom ofchoice but whether there is a moderate platonist argument that grounds allthe instances of the separation scheme expressible in the first-order language(even the impredicative ones) but does not extend to the instances of separ-ation involved in the axiom of choice.

All of the latter can easily be transformed into a form in whichthe existential claims they make are claims ofuniqueexistence.

It is no doubt be-cause of this that even mathematicians who believe that the axiom of choice istrue nevertheless regard proofs which do not use it as providing more inform-ation than those that do. However, it is a large step from there to saying thatsets which are not fully specified in this manner not only encode less informa-tionbutdonotevenexist. Forthatwewouldrequireafurtherargument. Andit presumably could not simply be a general argument against non-unique ex-istence claims, since the second-order principle (1), which we have agreed toaccept as uncontroversial for the moment, evidently makes just such a claim.It seems that it would instead have to be a quite specific argument limited inits applicability to collections, or if not to collections alone then at any rate tothe objects of mathematics.Perhapsat thispointthediscussionmightreturntotheperspectiveadoptedat the end of §3.3. I put forward there what I called an internal platonist ar-gument for the well-foundedness of the hierarchy of sets that avoided outrightconstructivism while accepting as a premise that mathematics is part of ourattempt to represent the world. It is hard to see how the conception of math-ematicsthusinvitedcouldsupporttheaxiomofchoice. Onerathervaguewayof putting the point would be to say that the argument for the axiom of choicedepends crucially on the coherence of the notion of a wholly arbitrary subset,but that even if this notion is coherent, it cannot participate in our attempt torepresent the world, and hence is not part of the mathematics we use to helpus do so."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Notes259Perhaps what this debate about whether to accept the axiom of choice in-dicates is that the disjunction between regularity and randomness is as fun-damental to our conception of the world as that between discreteness andcontinuity.

Indeed there is no evidence to suggest that Cantor ever doubtedthe validity of the axiom for a moment: it was a principle which, in Zer-melo’s words, he ‘unconsciously and instinctively used everywhere and ex-pressly stated nowhere’ (Cantor 1932, p.451). We noted in §9.4 how implicituses of the axiom of countable choice became common in the last quarter ofthe 19th century. The unrestricted axiom of choice, by contrast, was hardlyused by anyone other than Cantor until after the appearance of hisBeitr ̈ age(1895; 1897). Felix Bernstein, a pupil of Cantor working in Germany, used aconsequence of the axiom of choice called the partition principle in his 1901doctoral thesis on cardinal arithmetic (published in 1905b) and was immedi-ately criticized for doing so by Levi (1902); the axiom of choice was also usedin Italy by Burali-Forti (1896), even though he elsewhere expressed antagon-ism to the axiom of countable choice. The axiom of choice was also usedimplicitly by the Cambridge mathematicians Whitehead (1902) and Hardy(1904). Russell came rather close to an explicit statement of the axiom inthe work he contributed to Whitehead’s 1902 paper when he postulated thatevery non-finite set is a disjoint union of countably infinite sets (which is equi-valent to the axiom of choice). But it was only later that Russell came to seethat Whitehead had implicitly assumed the axiom of choice in his proof (inthe same paper) that any family of cardinal numbers has a product; it wasRussell’s (1906b) attempt to prove this assumption that led him to formulateexplicitly what he called the ‘multiplicative axiom’. Meanwhile in GermanyZermelo(1904)hadalsostatedtheaxiomofchoiceexplicitly, decidingthatheneeded it if he was to prove that every set is well-orderable.At a purely descriptive level the best source for more on the history of theemergence of the axiom of choice is G. H. Moore (1982).

If we do not assume the axiom of choice, however,the version we have stated above is strictly weaker (Solovay 1970), and theequation 2א0א=1is then equivalent to the conjunction of the continuumhypothesis and the claim that 2א0is an aleph (i.e. that the real numbers arewell-orderable).Cantor devoted a great deal of time to investigating whether or not thecontinuum hypothesis is true and on several occasions believed briefly that hehad proved it. Indeed he first stated it (in 1878, p.258) not as a conjecture butas something he claimed to have proved (‘by a process of induction which wedo not describe further at this point’). One approach Cantor used in tryingto tackle the problem was to study the properties of perfect sets (closed sub-sets of the real line without isolated points). We showed in §10.4 that everynon-empty perfect set has the power of the continuum. It follows that thecontinuum hypothesis is entailed by the following stronger claim.Perfect set hypothesis.Every uncountable subset of the real line has a non-empty perfect subset.The Cantor/Bendixson theorem, first proved in the 1880s, establishes thishypothesis forclosedsubsets ofR, but it is far from easy to extend this resultto other more inclusive classes (not least because the property is not preservedby complementation). Eventually, though, new methods enabled Alexandroff(1916) to prove it for Borel sets, and Souslin (see Lusin 1917) for analytic sets.But the more ambitious project of establishing the continuum hypothesisviathe perfect set hypothesis was stymied, at least for those such as Cantor whoaccepted the axiom of choice, by Bernstein’s (1908) discovery that the perfectset hypothesiscontradictsthe axiom of choice.(15.5.1)Proposition.If2א0is an aleph, there is a subset of the real line withthe power of the continuum which neither contains nor is disjoint from anynon-empty perfect set.Proof.

Moreover,this does not require the axiom of choice, since we are supposing that 2א0isan aleph, and hence that the real line is well-orderable. The ranges of the twotransfinite sequences{aα:α<ωβ}and{bα:α<ωβ}are evidently disjoint setswith the power of the continuum and every non-empty perfect set intersectsboth of them.(15.5.2)Corollary.The axiom of choice and the perfect set hypothesis can-not both be true.Proof. Iftheaxiomofchoiceistrue,then2א0isanalephandhencebypropos-ition 15.5.1 there is an uncountable set of real numbers with no non-emptyperfect subset, contradicting the perfect set hypothesis.So the axiom of choice refutes the perfect set hypothesis. The much strongeraxiom of constructibility refutes even the special case of the perfect set hypo-thesis for projective sets (G ̈odel 1938). But the continuum hypothesis itself issufficiently weaker than the perfect set hypothesis to escape this stricture: it isentailed by the axiom of constructibility, but it is standardly used nowadaysas an example of a proposition that isindependentof the ordinary axioms of settheory: even if we assume the whole ofZFC, we can prove neither the con-tinuum hypothesis (Cohen 1963) nor its negation (G ̈odel 1938), provided onlythatZFCitself is consistent.So is there anything we can prove about the size of 2א0without assumingfurther axioms?

It isthusconsistent(although,onesomehowfeels,ratherunlikely)that2א0א=4049,for instance, or 2א0א=ω2+61.Many mathematicians conclude on the basis of these independence resultsnotonlythatthecontinuumhypothesisisundecidedbutthatitisundecidable.Let us pause now to consider whether this is the right conclusion to draw.Exercise(Sierpinski 1924) Show that 2א0א=1iffאא02>אא01.15.6 Is the continuum hypothesis decidable?Note first that the continuum hypothesis is obviously equivalent to the state-ment(∀A⊆P(ωωωω))(A∼ωωωωorA∼P(ωωωω)),where∼expresses equinumerosity, and thatthisstatement, even when it isexpressedfullywithoutabbreviations, quantifies onlyoverthefirst fewinfinitelevels of the hierarchy of sets. (The exact number of levels involved dependson just how the ordered pair is defined, but by careful use of coding we couldif it mattered reduce the quantification to the third infinite level.) This issignificant because it shows that the continuum hypothesis — in stark con-trast, for instance, to the higher axioms of infinity considered in chapter 13—isdecidedby second-order set theoryZ2. This contrast, although relativelytrivial in itself, is certainly not always appreciated by mathematicians. It iswell known to set theorists, of course, and is a theme of Scott’s foreword toBell (1977). ‘There are any number of contradictory set theories, all extend-ing the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms,’ he observes (p.xiv), ‘but the models are alljust models of the first-order axioms, and first-order logic is weak.’ The pointhas also been made repeatedly by Kreisel, but usually in works unlikely to beread by mainstream mathematicians (e.g. Kreisel 1967a); it is rare for booksaimed at a general mathematical audience to give the point any prominence.Two consequences of this second-order decidability result should be noted.The first is that the uncritical platonist who accepts the argument given inthe last chapter that the axiom of choice follows from the second-order lo-gical principle must correspondingly accept that the truth or falsity of thecontinuum hypothesis might be settled by second-order logic. It is, indeed,"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Is the continuum hypothesis decidable?271easy enough to formulate a sentence in the language of pure second-order lo-gic which is a logical truth iff the continuum hypothesis is true, and anothersentence (not, of course, the negation of the first) which is a logical truth iffthe continuum hypothesis is false (see Shapiro 1985, p.741). The difficulty isevidently that in contrast to the case of the axiom of choice we do not seemto have any intuitions about whether these second-order principles that couldsettle the continuum hypothesis are themselves true or false. So this obser-vation does not seem especially likely to be a route to an argument that willactually settle the continuum hypothesis one way or the other. And even ifwe did find such an argument (for example, a mathematical argument fromsome new set-theoretic principle), although we could then work back fromthat to knowledge of the corresponding second-order logical truth, this wouldnot automatically make the continuum hypothesis itself logical, since it wouldfollow from the second-order logical truth in question only via the axioms ofsecond-order set theory.All of this, of course, applies only to the sort of platonist who accepts thesecond-order separation principle. But I also want to mention another con-sequence of the second-order decidability of the continuum hypothesis, thistime one that does not seem to depend so directly on accepting second-orderseparation. The point I want to mention is that there is a difference in char-acter between the continuum hypothesis and other sentences undecided byZFC, such as the various large cardinal axioms. This is admittedly somewhatvaguer than the preceding point, and it is correspondingly more obscure howmuchitdependsontheplatonistcommitmenttothesecond-ordersystem,butat the very least it shows that the analogy that has often been casually drawn(e.g. Errera 1952, A. Robinson 1968) between the position of the continuumhypothesis in set theory and that of the parallel postulate in geometry is muchtoo hasty: the undecidability of the parallel postulate has nothing to do withthe weakness of first-order systems.Kreisel (1971) has urged that a much better analogy would be with theproven insolubility in elementary geometry of the classical problems of squar-ing the circle and trisecting the angle: what is shown is not that an anglecannot be trisected but only that it cannot be done with a straightedge andcompasses. But even if this analogy is apposite, it is not clear that it helps us tosolve the continuum problem, since it does not give us much of a clue whereto look for the new methods that we need.One superficially appealing strategy would be to bring higher infinities toouraid. We sawin chapter13 howone property(determinacy) canbe provedsuccessively for closed sets, Borel sets and projective sets, but only by invokinghigher and higher infinities at each stage. By analogy one might conjecture,as G ̈odel did (1947), that the continuum hypothesis, which we have provedfor closed sets already, could be extended to more inclusive categories of setin something like the same manner."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"272Further cardinal arithmeticHowever plausible this conjecture may have seemed when G ̈odel made it,subsequent work in set theory has shown that it is very unlikely to be true.What G ̈odel had presumably not expected was that the method of forcingdevised by Cohen (1963) to prove the independence of the continuum hy-pothesis fromZFwould turn out to be even more robust than G ̈odel’s innermodel construction when confronted with large cardinal axioms (Levy andSolovay 1967). Broadly stated, every large cardinal axiom so far proposed isknown not to settle the continuum hypothesis.This marks another way of differentiating between independence claims.We have already noted that the independence of the continuum hypothesisis different from that of the parallel postulate in geometry, because it is dis-tinctively a first-order result; what we can now see is that it is also differentfrom the sort we considered in chapter 13, such as the independence of theG ̈odel sentence of a theory or the independence of Borel determinacy fromZU, since these claims can be decided by ascent to a higher level in the hier-archy, whereas the continuum hypothesis cannot.With this distinction in mind let us call a sentencestrongly undecidableif itis independent of set theory even if any axiom of infinity, however strong, isadjoined to it. We should recognize at once, of course, that this is not a form-alizable notion, since G ̈odel’s theorem shows that no formal characterizationis possible of what should count as an axiom of infinity. The best we couldhope for would be, as G ̈odel (1965, p.85) suggested, ‘a characterization ofthe following sort: An axiom of infinity is a proposition which has a certain(decidable) formal structure and which in addition is true.’ In any such char-acterizationtruthwouldofcourseremainastheinherentlynon-formalnotioninvolved. It must be said, however, that neither G ̈odel nor anyone else hasyet offered a plausible candidate for a formal characterization of the requiredsort.In lectures he gave in 1939 or 1940, shortly after proving the consistencyof the continuum hypothesis, G ̈odel speculated that it might be strongly un-decidable whether every real number is constructible (see G ̈odel 1986–2003,vol.III, pp.175 and 185). Later, though, he seems to have had a change ofheart and not only suggested that the continuum hypothesis might be decidedby a suitably strong axiom of infinity but even briefly speculated in 1946 thatthere might benostrongly undecidable propositions in set theory.It is not impossible that ... some completeness theorem would hold which would saythat every proposition expressible in set theory is decidable from the present axiomsplussometrueassertionaboutthelargenessoftheuniverseofsets. (G ̈odel1965, p.85)But even if the continuum hypothesis is strongly undecidable in the sensejust outlined, it does not automatically follow that it isabsolutelyundecidable— undecidable, that is to say, byanytrue principles about sets, whether ornot they count as axioms of infinity.

Andinanycaselargecardinalaxiomsarenottheonlywayof extendingZF. Indeed G ̈odel himself, only a year after he had speculatedthat there might be no strongly undecidable statements, pointed out anotherway in which a proposition could be decided. Not only do there probablyexist new axioms of infinity based on unknown principles, he said, but alsothere may exist, besides the ordinary axioms [and] the axioms of infinity ... other(hitherto unknown) axioms of set theory which a more profound understanding of theconcepts underlying logic and mathematics would enable us to recognize as impliedby these concepts.

Hilbert, who in1900 regardedsettling itasone ofthe most important challenges in mathematics, sketched in 1925 a purportedproof of the continuum hypothesis based on a classification of the elementsof Baire space into orders of recursive definability; but he never completedthe details, and Zermelo is reported as saying that ‘no one understood whathe meant’ (P. Levy 1964, p.89). G ̈odel himself quite late in his life believedhe had a proof that 2א0א=2on the basis of several new set-theoretic ax-ioms, but he withdrew the paper before publication (see G ̈odel 1986–2003,vol.III, pp.405–25). More recently, various other set-theoretic principleshave been shown to entail that 2א0א=2: e.g. the principle known as ‘Mar-tin’s maximum’ (Foreman, Magidor and Shelah 1988) or an axiom proposedby Woodin (2001b).What should we make of these new axioms? Formalists, of course, will asusual regard universes in which the new axioms hold and those in which theyfail as equally valid (although whether they are equallyinterestingwill dependon how the mathematics develops). But there does not seem to be any reasonfor them to regard the continuum hypothesis as special in this regard. For therealist, on the other hand, there is always the possibility that intuitive prin-ciples will settle the continuum hypothesis one way or the other. One state-ment which entails it is the axiom of constructibility, which may be thoughtof as a minimizing principle whose approximate effect is to make each level ofthe hierarchy as thin as is permitted by the other axioms. As we suggested inthe last chapter, part of the reason why few realist mathematicians are willingto regard the axiom of constructibility as true is that it seems to contravenethe first principle of plenitude which guides the formation of the hierarchy.The reason for repeating this point here is that if it is right, it is natural towonder whether a converse argument can be mounted to the effect that thefirst principle of plenitude requires 2א0to be as large as possible. This idea hasbeen urged by Cohen."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"274Further cardinal arithmeticA point of view which the author feels may eventually come to be accepted is that CHisobviouslyfalse. The main reason one accepts the Axiom of Infinity is probably thatwe feel it absurd to think that the process of adding only one set at a time can exhaustthe entire universe. Similarly with the higher axioms of infinity. Nowא1is the setof countable ordinals and this is merely a special and the simplest way of generatinga higher cardinal. The setP(ωωωω)is, in contrast, generated by a totally new and morepowerfulprinciple,namelythePowerSetAxiom. Itisunreasonabletoexpectthatanydescription of a larger cardinal which attempts to build up that cardinal from ideasderiving from the Replacement Axiom can ever reachP(ωωωω). ThusP(ωωωω)is greaterthanאn,אω,אωω, etc. This point of view regardsP(ωωωω)as an incredibly rich set givento us by one bold new axiom, which can never be approached by any piecemealprocess of construction. (1966, p.151, modified)Thisisaradicalargument, anditishardtomakesenseofitinconventionalterms. For it is certainly provable inZFCthat 2א0א=αfor someα. One pos-sibility, of course, would be simply to deny thatP(ωωωω)is a set, but that is notCohen’s intention: his proposal is not that an ordinalαsuch that 2א0א=αdoes not exist, but only that it cannot bedescribedin any other terms alreadyavailable to us in the first-order theory. Cohen (1973) followed up his sug-gestion by proposing one axiom which attempts to give expression to the ideathatP(ωωωω)islarge,andTakeuti(1971)hassuggestedothers. Scott,meanwhile,went further, speculating (in Bell 1977, p.xiv) that ‘we would be pushed in theend to say that all sets arecountable(and that the continuum is not even a set!)when at last all cardinals are absolutely destroyed’.But it is by no means clear why the maximal conception of the power-set operation should deliver the sort of conclusion these authors want. If weenrich the power set at each level, we enlarge not onlyP(ωωωω)but also the setof non-isomorphic well-orderings ofωωωωand hence (in one sense) the size ofא1.While the property ofbeing an ordinalis invariant or absolute, the property (of ordinals)ofbeing [uncountable]is not. The point is often overlooked in the (popular) ‘debate’ onthe continuum hypothesis, where theorderlinessof the ordinals (in Vκor Lκ) is contras-ted with themessofP(ωωωω)(in Vκ): a similar mess is involved in the collection of maps(in Vκ)ofωωωωonto initial segments of the ordinals. It does not seem at all surprising thatwe have not (yet) decided whether the two ‘messes’ match. (Kreisel 1980, p.198)But the matter is even harder to resolve for the regressivist, because it isdifficult to come by consequences of the continuum hypothesis to use as data.Indeed, one reason for the tendency of mathematicians to regard the con-tinuum hypothesis as absolutely undecidable may well be that it receives solittle regressive support from its consequences. For we saw in the last chapterthat the axiom of constructibility does not enable us to prove any new theor-ems in first-order arithmetic; and since the continuum hypothesis is entailedbytheaxiomofconstructibility,thesamewillbetrueofit. Butbyamoreelab-orateargumentwecanshowstillmore: eveninsecond-orderarithmeticthereis nothing provable using the continuum hypothesis that is not already prov-able using only the axiom of choice (Platek 1969). It follows that anyone who"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"The axiom of determinacy275wishes to justify the continuum hypothesis on the basis of its consequencesmust claim independent knowledge, i.e. knowledge acquired by some otherroute, of truths of at least the third order. But, as we noted at the beginningof this section, the continuum hypothesis is itself of the third order; so at anyrate the regressive approach does not seem to effect any logical simplificationof the problem.Feferman’s view is that the continuum hypothesis is ‘inherently vague’(2000, p.405). This, or something like it, is a common view among math-ematicians. Not all of those who hold it, though, are clear about its con-sequences. For whether a sentence is vague or not is presumably a functionof its meaning. So we cannot corral the undecided sentences and leave theothers untainted: if we admit the continuum hypothesis as vague, we shall behard pressed to resist the conclusion that all other sentences involving quan-tification at the third infinite level of the hierarchy are more or less vague aswell. The concern has been well expressed by Steel.There may be something in the idea that the language of third order arithmetic isvague, but the suggestion that it is inherently so is a gratuitous counsel of despair. Ifthe language of third order arithmetic permits vague or ambiguous sentences, then itis important to trim or sharpen it so as to eliminate these. ... In his argument thatthe concept of an arbitrary set of reals is inherently vague, Feferman likens it to the‘concept’ of a feasible number. This analogy is far-fetched at best. The concept of anarbitrary set of reals is the foundation for a great deal of mathematics, and has neverled into contradiction. The first two things of a general nature one is inclined to sayabout feasible numbers will contradict each other.

As we have seen, Cantor succeeded in showing, assumingthe axiom of choice, that every closed set has this property, and he hopedto extend this to all sets in due course. In this project we now know thathe was doomed to failure. There is a striking contrast, though, between theproperty Cantor was investigating and several others which arise naturally inthestudyoftherealline. Consider, forinstance, thepropertyofmeasurabilitycentral to the theory of integration: every closed set is measurable, and if weassume the axiom of countable choice, we can prove that every Borel set ismeasurable. But the axiom of choice entails the existence of non-measurablesets. The existence of such sets may be thought unwelcome on naive groundsof simplicity, but in fact matters are somewhat worse.Theorem (Banach and Tarski 1924).The axiom of choice implies thatthere is a decomposition of the surface of the unit sphere into a finite number"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"276Further cardinal arithmeticof pieces which can by rigid motions of three-dimensional Euclidean space bereassembled to form the surfaces of two spheres of unit radius.2Now of course it is trivially the case that the decomposition described in thetheorem is impossible if we require the pieces into which the sphere is decom-posed all to bemeasurable, since rigid motions preserve area, and the surfaceareaofeachofthespheresinquestionis4π. Sowhatthetheoremclaimsmustbe a decomposition into non-measurable pieces.The Banach/Tarski theorem has sometimes been used in an attempt tore-futethe axiom of choice: the conclusion of the theorem is intuitively false, it issaid, and therefore the axiom of choice cannot be true. In order to use it inthisway,though,wewouldneedtohaveanintuitiveargumentnotdependingon the concept of area for disbelieving in the possibility of the decompositionmentioned in the theorem, and it is by no means clear that such an argu-ment exists. The point is one we came across when we were consideringreal analysis in chapter 8. We have already seen that in testing the axiomof choice geometrical intuitions derived fromelementarygeometry — the geo-metry of straightedge and compasses — are irrelevant. So the geometricalintuitions involved here cannot be elementary in this sense, but must dependon our general grasp of properties of transcendental functions. But experi-ence already suggests that our intuitions concerning such functions need to beeducated before much reliance can be placed on them.This is a common phenomenon in mathematics. The ancient Greeks ap-parently regarded their discovery of the existence of irrational numbers asparadoxical (whether or not one of them drowned because of it, as mythclaims); if no trained mathematician would have this reaction today, that isprecisely because by studying the phenomenon we have reached an under-standing of the reasons for it, and hence, far from seeming paradoxical, itcomes to be just what we intuitively expect. In much the same way, thosewho have received the appropriate education seem generally disinclined toregard the conclusion of the Banach/Tarski theorem as false. (What is harderto judge, of course, is whether they are influenced in this view by also havingbeen educated to believe the axiom of choice.)The impression that the Banach/Tarski theorem does not show the axiomof choice to be false is further strengthened if it is compared to the followingresult.Theorem (Mazurkiewicz and Sierpinski 1914).There is a non-emptysubsetEof the Euclidean plane which has two disjoint subsets each of whichcan be split into finitely many parts which can be rearranged isometrically toform a partition ofE.2R.M.Robinson(1947)hasshownthatthenumberofpiecesinthedecompositioncanbemadeas small as four."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"The axiom of determinacy277This theorem is certainly surprising, but this time we cannot blame the axiomof choice since the proof does not require it: the sets involved in the decom-positionaremeasurable.3Itmayindeedbethatthisisnotquiteassurprisingasthe previous result, but it surely weakens one’s confidence that the conclusionof the Banach/Tarski theorem is intuitively false.Nonetheless, the Banach/Tarski theorem has led some mathematicians tospeculate on the idea of abandoning the axiom of choice and putting in itsplace an axiom which ensures that every set is measurable and hence rulesout the decompositions of the sphere which they find paradoxical. The primecandidate for such an axiom is one that was first proposed by Mycielski andSteinhaus (1962).Axiom of determinacy.The game on every subset of the Baire line is determ-ined.The axiom of determinacy entails that every set of real numbers is measur-able (Mycielski and Swierczkowski 1964). This is welcome news to anyonewho finds the Banach/Tarski decomposition paradoxical, since it shows thatdeterminacy rules this result out. It follows, of course, that determinacy mustbe incompatible with the axiom of choice, but in fact this is something we caneasily prove directly.(15.7.1)Proposition.The axiom of determinacy entails that2א0is not analeph.Proof. Suppose that 2א0א=β. The set of first player strategies has cardinal2א0and hence can be enumerated as the range of a transfinite sequence{σα:α<ωβ}. In the same way we can let{τα:α<ωβ}enumerate thestrategies available to the second player. Suppose now thatα<ωβ. Thefunctiont\u0013→σα∗tis one-to-one, and so the set{σα∗t:t∈ωωωωωωωω}of all thepossible games in which the first player follows the strategyσαhas the samecardinalasωωωωωωωω,i.e.2א0;similarlytheset{s∗τα:s∈ωωωωωωωω}hascardinal2א0aswell.It is therefore possible recursively to chooseaα,bα∈ωωωωωωωωso thatbα=σα∗tforsometbutbα/∈{aγ:γ<α}, andaα=s∗ταfor somesbutaα/∈{bγ:γ<α}.It is simple to check thatA={aα:α<ωβ}andB={bα:α<ωβ}are disjointand neither player has a winning strategy for the game onA.Inparticular,therefore,theaxiomofdeterminacyisincompatiblewiththeax-iom of choice and also entails that 2א0א=\u00071. Rather more elaborate methodscan be used to strengthen proposition 15.7.1 to the following.Theorem (Davis 1964).The axiom of determinacy entails the perfect sethypothesis.3It is easy to deduce that the area of the setEmentioned in the theorem must be zero."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"278Further cardinal arithmeticAs an immediate corollary it follows that the axiom of determinacy entailsthe continuum hypothesis (which, as we noted earlier, does not contradict2א0א=\u00071in the absence of choice).The principal reason for the interest set theorists have taken in the axiomof determinacy is the connection between determinacy and large cardinal ax-ioms. Wesawinchapter13howsuccessivelystrongeraxiomshadtobeaddedtoZFto prove the determinacy of all Borel sets and then of all projective sets.Mimicking G ̈odel’s failed programme for settling the continuum hypothesis,we might even wonder whether a still stronger axiom of infinity would provethe axiom of determinacy. Indeed, the axiom of determinacy is already in asense an axiom of infinity, as it was shown by Solovay in 1967 to entail thatא1andא2are measurable cardinals; and it is possible to convert the proof inZfUof any proposition of a sufficiently simple syntactic form into a proof inZUplus Borel determinacy.4An axiom that entailed determinacy would have to contradict the axiomof choice, of course, and few suitable candidates are known. One that mighthavebeenacandidatewasstatedbyReinhardtinhis1967doctoralthesis(seeReinhardt 1974). His proposal was, in effect, that we add to set theory anoperatorjwhich permutes the members of the hierarchy while leaving theirfirst-order properties unchanged, i.e.(∀x1,...,xn)Φ(x1,...,xn)⇔Φ(jx1,...,jxn)for every formulaΦ. Kunen (1971) showed that if we assume the axiom ofchoice, then the only such operator is the identity, i.e.jx=xfor allx,and hence that Reinhardt’s axiom asserting the existence of a non-trivial per-mutation is inconsistent withZFC. Since then, Reinhardt’s axiom has beenregarded by set theorists as an upper limit to their invention of large cardinalaxioms when working under the constraint of the axiom of choice. What re-mains unknown, however, is whether this limit applies in the absence of theaxiom of choice — whether, for instance, Reinhardt’s axiom is inconsistenteven withZF.In the absence of much work on the consequences of Reinhardt’s proposal,it is hard to speculate, but it does seem to throw up the intriguing possibilitythat the axiom of choice might act in some way as a barrier to the free con-struction of the hierarchy. In other words, the axiom of choice, which wasbilled as an expression of the platonist’s desire to maximize the number of setsat each level, might conflict with the desire to maximize the number of levels.Something of this sort is already known to hold for the much stronger axiomof constructibility, which has been shown by Scott (1961) to contradict theexistence of a measurable cardinal.4Bizarrely,though,theaxiomofdeterminacyalsoentailsthatאnisnotmeasurableforanyn>2."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"The axiom of determinacy279Of course, in the unlikely event that considerations of this sort led math-ematicians to give up the axiom of choice, that would still not in itself settlematters in favour of determinacy. Since the axiom of determinacy entails theexistence of large cardinals, no proof of its consistency relative toZFis pos-sible. It is natural, then, to look for an intuitive argument that the axiomof determinacy is true. But proponents of the axiom have generally stoppedshort of offering this. When they first proposed the axiom, for example, My-cielski and Steinhaus (1962) were equivocal. They did offer what they calledan ‘intuitive justification’ for it.Suppose that both players I and II are infinitely clever and that they know perfectlywell what [the game] is, then owing to the complete information during every play,theresultoftheplaycannotdependonchance. [Theaxiomofdeterminacy]expressesexactly this. (p.1)However, they went on to deny that they wished todepreciate classical mathematics with its fundamental ‘absolute’ intuitions on the uni-versum of sets (to which belongs the axiom of choice), [but] only to propose anothertheory which seems very interesting.The axiom of determinacy, they said,can be considered as a restriction of the classical notion of a set leading to a smalleruniversum, say of determined sets, which reflect some physical intuitions which arenot fulfilled by the classical sets (e.g. paradoxical decompositions of the sphere areeliminated). (p.2)The idea that determinacy should simply be adopted as an axiom insteadof choice has not found much favour among mathematicians since then.Moschovakis (1980, p.379), for instance, called the axiom of determinacy‘blatantly false’. Recently set theorists have been more inclined to consideras an axiom candidate the weakerprojective determinacy, an axiom asserting thateveryprojectivesetisdetermined.

Moreover, as we have already noted in §13.7, it isprovablefromalargecardinalaxiomassertingtheexistenceofinfinitelymanyWoodin cardinals. On the other hand, projective determinacy does not refutetheBanach/Tarskitheorem,nordoesitsettlethecontinuumhypothesis(Levyand Solovay 1967).However, the general notion of a projective set of real numbers is so re-mote from geometrical intuition that it is hard to see what direct intuitivereason might be given for believing a proposition about them such as project-ive determinacy. So any argument for accepting it as an axiom (as opposed totreating it as a theorem in set theory with a suitable large cardinal axiom) islikelytobewhollyregressive. Martin(1977,p.814)regardsitas‘anhypothesiswith a status similar to that of a theoretical hypothesis in physics’. Because of"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"280Further cardinal arithmeticits ‘pleasing consequences’, he suggests, ‘it is not unreasonable to suspect thatit may be true’ (Martin 1976, p.90). This view is echoed by Woodin (1994,p.34).There is little a priori evidence that [projective determinacy] is a plausible axiom,or even that it is a consistent axiom. However, the theory that follows from the as-sumption of [projective determinacy] is so rich that, a posteriori, the axiom is bothconsistent and true. The lesson here is an important one. Axioms need not be a prioritrue.And more recently he has re-affirmed his view that there is ‘compelling evid-ence that [projective determinacy] is the “right axiom” for the projective sets’(2001a,p.571).

On the other hand,it is also possible that the web of implication involving determinacy hypotheses andrelating them to large cardinals will grow steadily until it presents such a natural andcompelling picture that more will succumb to its beauty.15.8 The generalized continuum hypothesisOnce mathematicians became interested in the continuum hypothesis, it wasnaturalthattheywouldalsowishtostudythefollowingnaturalgeneralizationof it.Definition.Thegeneralized continuum hypothesisis the proposition thatfor no infinite cardinalais there a cardinalbsuch thata<b<2a.(15.8.1)Lemma.2a+\u000122a2.Proof.

It is also known to be independentofZFCeven if we assume the continuum hypothesis as well.From a logical point of view, however, the most significant point of differ-ence with the continuum hypothesis is that the generalized continuum hypo-thesis is not obviously decided by the second-order set theoriesZ2,ZF2, etc.This is because we are not able to rule out the possibility that the behaviourof the operations concerned might be different at different levels in the hier-archy.Very little is known about the relationship between the generalized con-tinuum hypothesis and large cardinal axioms. The one striking exception isa theorem of Solovay (1974): the existence of a strongly compact cardinalentails that there is no upper bound to the cardinalsasuch that 2a=a+.As one might expect, the generalized continuum hypothesis leaves its traceon ordinary mathematics rather more faintly than the continuum hypothesis,but generally in the more abstract parts of the same branches. Its character isoverwhelmingly that of a simplifying assumption: it simplifies cardinal arith-meticinthesamesortofwayas, butmoreradicallythan, theaxiomofchoice.For that reason it is not uncommon for mathematicians to use the general-ized continuum hypothesis as an assumption in proving theorems even whenit is not strictly needed (sometimes, indeed, when any competent set theoristwould be able to see immediately that it is not needed).This is emphatically not the speed-up phenomenon we encountered in§13.8: a proof that avoids the generalized continuum hypothesis is typicallynot vastly longer than the one that does not. It seems rather to be a case ofpsychologicalspeed-up: the proof using the generalized continuum hypothesisis easier to find, especially if one is not expert in the niceties of cardinal arith-metic.

This work certainlymade a strong case for the practical virtues ofZUas a theory: it is elegant andsimple; and its axioms can be justified on the basis of the conception of sets assubject, through their intrinsic nature, to a primitive relation of dependence.In this last part of the book, however, the neat picture has begun to frag-ment. The unitary account we were building up has split into several com-peting strands as we have come across different ways, some of them mutuallyinconsistent, of extending the system. The best-known point of bifurcation,of course, concerns the truth-value of the continuum hypothesis, and it is asgoodacaseasanytofocusonhere. Wehavealreadycautionedagainsttakingtoo seriously the popular analogy between Cohen’s (1963) proof that the con-tinuum hypothesis is independent ofZFCand the proof discovered a centuryearlier of the independence of the parallel postulate in geometry. But even ifthat point is disputed, there is in both cases reason to be cautious about thesignificance of purely formal results: the independence of the parallel postu-late does not in itself show that non-Euclidean geometry describes a way thatspacecould be; nor does Cohen’s result show on its own that there are twocompeting theories ofsets.Butsayingthatisofitselfnohelpwhateverinworkingouthowwemightbeable to settle whether the continuum hypothesis is true.

So there is plenty of scope for further ax-iomswhichsimplyexpresssomewhatmoreoftheoriginallyintendedmeaningof one or other of the two principles.As we have presented them, the two principles of plenitude are distinct,and it has sometimes been assumed that they are independent of each other.Many accounts of the matter nonetheless seem implicitly to give some sort ofprimacy to the first principle. The constructivist account, for instance, con-"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Conclusion to Part IV285ceives of each stage in the hierarchy as being constructedafterthe precedingone, so the question of the richness of each level is prior (even in a temporalsense) to the question of how many levels there are in total. The most popularsort of platonist explanation, on the other hand, has been the one which is alimiting case of the constructivist account, and it seems to have been tacitlyassumed that the priority just mentioned of the first principle over the secondis preserved in the progress to this limit.On the dependency account which we have favoured here, on the otherhand, it is surely dubious whether the first principle is prior (even conceptu-ally) to the second. The only reason to think that it is would be if we haddistinguished between the sorts of possibility invoked in the two principles.For instance, if the first principle is represented as saying that for any levelVtheset{x∈V:Xx}existsforanypropertyX,onewaywemighttrytoexpressthis is by saying that all subsets ofVexist that are logically possible. When wecome to express the second principle, on the other hand, we might do so bysaying that all the levels exist that are possible, where the type of possibilityinvoked might now be narrower (e.g. metaphysical or conceptual possibility).There is a difficulty at this point, of course, which we raised when we firststated this principle of plenitude. To say that there are as many levels aspossible seems contradictory, because however many there are, there couldhave been more: just take the union of all of them. If we simply deny thatthereissuch a union, we are left struggling to explain why not.There is no denying that thisisa real difficulty for the platonist. For theplatonist, unlike the constructivist, conceives of the universe of sets as static.There are just the sets there are: they do not depend on my, or anyone else’s,construction of them, and hence are not subject to any of the ordinary modal-ities of logical possibility or conceivability. And yet it seems to be of theessenceof the conception that the second principle of plenitude urges on us to keepon trying to destabilize this static picture.Nowthestandardplatonistviewinvitesustoseeastrikingasymmetryhere.For there is, it is claimed, no similar instability in the first principle of plenit-ude. This asymmetry emerges very clearly in the second-order formulation,where it shows itself as a precise technical result, Zermelo’s categoricity the-orem. Thistellsusthatonceitisdeterminedwhattheindividualsare,theonlyvariation between models of second-order set theory is their rank, i.e. howmany levels there are. No variation is possible in the constitution of each levelbecause we are forced by the second-order quantifier to include{x∈V:Xx}forallpropertiesX, and the range of this last quantifier is a matter for logic tosettle, not set theory.But even if this is right, and the second principle issomehowconsequentupon the first, it does not follow automatically that its meaning is affected bythe first. The standard conception, at any rate of platonists, has been that inthissense the two principles are independent. In other words, a difference in"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"286Conclusion to Part IVthe richness of low levels in the hierarchy should make no difference to howmany levels in the hierarchy there can be.But notice how the technical results here concerning first-order set theorypoint in quite the opposite direction. The continuum hypothesis is third-order, i.e. it makes a claim about the first three infinite levels of the hierarchy.So at first sight its truth or falsity is answerable only to the first principle,which governs how rich each level is relative to the previous one, not to thesecond principle, which governs the total number of levels. G ̈odel discoveredthattherearesentencesofthesamelogicalshapeasthecontinuumhypothesiswhicharesettled by appealing to new axioms justified by the second principle.Now this does not yetestablishany interaction between the two principles: itcan be explained simply by a feature of the system we havealreadyaccep-ted, namely that the impredicativity of the axiom scheme of separation hasthe consequence that any new axiom of infinity increases the power of thescheme.If the effect that strong axioms of infinity have on the low levels of the hier-archy does not quiteprovethat the second principle affects the first, it doesnonetheless seem suggestive. The uncritical platonist can stamp his foot, ofcourse, and insist that the range of the second-order quantifier is determin-ate: if so, there is probably nothing that can be done to dissuade him. Butit is striking how little anyone can think of to say about how to determinethis range more fully.

But the theories that were current in the 1920s, when theproposal to adopt a theory equivalent toZFUwas first mooted, were signi-ficantly weaker thanZU, and so the regressive support for the strengtheningwas somewhat greater. To explain this point, we shall have to trace how theseaxiomatizations developed.A.1 Zermelo’s axiomsThecentrepieceofZermelo’soriginalaxiomatizationwastheaxiomofchoice,which we have discussed in chapter 14. If we put it to one side, his remainingaxioms were approximately as follows.Axiom of extensionality.Ifa,bare sets,(∀x)(x∈a⇔x∈b)⇒a=b.Axiom of individuals.There is a set of all individuals.Axiom of separation.For any definite propertyXand any seta,{x∈a:Xx}is a set.Axiom of power sets.Ifais a set,P(a)is a set.Axiom of union.Ifais a set,\u0003ais a set.Axiom of pairs.Ifa,bare sets,{a,b}is a set.Axiomofinfinity\u0002\u0002.ThereisasetUsuchthatØ∈Uand(∀a∈U)({a}∈U).The overwhelming majority of axiomatizations to be found in subsequenttextbooks have been recognizably variants or extensions of this one.Critics of these axioms at first focused their attention principally on separ-ation: they objected to Zermelo’s appeal to (what he took to be) the primitivenotion of a ‘definite’ property on the ground of vagueness. The first workable"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"292Traditional axiomatizationsproposal to correct the perceived deficiency was made by Weyl. Only sometime later was it realized that Weyl’s formulation amounted to the same thingas restricting separation to those properties expressible by a formula in thefirst-order language. The axiom of separation was therefore replaced by thefollowing axiom scheme.Axiom scheme of separation.IfΦ(x)is a formula, then the following is anaxiom:Ifais a set,{x∈a:Φ(x)}is a set.I shall, at the risk of some historical inexactitude, call the system with thisadjustment ‘Zermelo’s theory’: it is formal (or at any rate straightforwardlyformalizable). Not only that but it is also weaker thanZU, in the sense thatevery axiom of Zermelo’s theory can be read as a theorem ofZU.A.2 Cardinals and ordinalsThe converse is false, however: there are proofs inZUthat cannot be val-idly replicated in Zermelo’s theory. One instance of this which was especiallyimportant for the historical development arises because Zermelo’s theory isstill, in the terminology I have been using in this book, a theory ofcollectionsrather than of sets: there is no axiom which rules out non-grounded collec-tions. AsaconsequencewecannotinthistheoryusetheScott/Tarskimethodto define cardinals and ordinals. And in fact no other device will do instead: ifin order to obtain a theory of cardinals we add Hume’s principle as an axiom,what we get is (provided that we let the new operator ‘card’ occur in instancesof the axiom of separation) a non-conservative extension of Zermelo’s theory(Levy 1969). In fact, the salience of Zermelo’s theory was in any case tempor-ary. Soon the interest of set theorists focused on thegroundedcollections, andthey were then led to add the following restrictive assumption.Axiom of foundation.a\u0007=Ø⇒(∃x∈a)(xis an individual orx∩a=Ø).Yet even with this axiom our theory still is not strong enough to support theefficient exploitation of its hierarchical structure. The definition of the car-dinal of a set applied foundation to theclassof all sets equinumerous with thegiven set, and this is not licensed by the axiom of foundation in the first-orderform we have stated (Jensen and Schr ̈oder 1969; Boffa 1969).Sowhatshouldwedo? ForZermelohimselfatthetimeof1908bnofurtheraxiom was needed: his purpose was to give a system of axioms that wouldground his new proof (1908a) of the well-ordering principle from the axiomof choice. The key feature of this proof was that, unlike his earlier proof(1904) of the same result, it does not make use of ordinals. So in this case at"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Cardinals and ordinals293least Zermelo had shown that ordinals could be regarded as ideal elementswhose use in his proof was eliminable. For a time, indeed, there was con-siderable interest in the general project of eliminating uses of ordinals fromproofs: Lindel ̈of showed in 1905 that Cantor’s use of ordinals in proving theCantor/Bendixson theorem was eliminable, and in 1922 Kuratowski gave ageneral method for eliminating them from a large class of mathematical con-texts.But mathematicians have never been inclined to give up fruitful techniquessolely for reasons of foundational hygiene. The theory of ordinals is a con-venient tool for the pure mathematician to have, so have it he will. What,then, can be done to give regressive support to this intransigence? One pos-sibility would be to find an axiom that will allow the Scott/Tarski definitionsof cardinals and ordinals to go through.Axiomoftransitivecontainment.Foreachsetthereisatransitivesetcontain-ing it.CalltheresultingtheoryZU\u0002\u00020. Ontheobviousinterpretationitbecomesasub-theory ofZU, since all its axioms are recognizable as things we have alreadyproved inZU. However, it is in fact significantly weaker thanZU, but to seewhy, we need to look more closely at the form of Zermelo’s axiom of infinity.Zermelo chose this form because it is equivalent to the claim that the setω\u0002\u0002={Ø,{Ø},{{Ø}},{{{Ø}}},...}exists, and this is the set he intended to use as his surrogate for the naturalnumbers. If we were still working in the context of the theory of levels de-veloped in chapter 3, the difference would be unimportant: Zermelo’s axiomof infinity would imply the version of the axiom of infinity given in chapter 4.Butthisisbecausetherewetookthenotionofalevelasfundamental(althoughby using Scott’s other trick we were able to avoid taking it as a primitive),whereas in Zermelo’s theory the basic notion is that of aset. The consequenceis that in a theory of the sort we set up in chapter 3, asserting the existence ofone set guarantees the existence of a whole level, so that Zermelo’s axiom ofinfinity would in that context have had the same effect as the axiom of infinitywe actually stated there, namely to guarantee the existence of thewholelevelVω. But in the context of Zermelo’s system his axiom does only what it saysand not much more: it guarantees the existence of some sets of rankω, suchas Zermelo’s set of natural numbersω\u0002\u0002itself, but not of others such as the setω\u0002={Ø,{Ø},{Ø,{Ø}},{Ø,{Ø},{Ø,{Ø,{Ø}}}},...}which von Neumann used ashisset of natural numbers (Mathias 2001;Drabbe1969).

The body of knowledge which the regressive argument appeals toas its basis is presumablymathematicalknowledge (some fragment of currentmathematical practice) rather than set-theoretic knowledge. So the regressiveargument can gain its grip only once we have shown how to embed math-ematics (or at any rate the relevant fragment of it) in set theory. What theinequivalence ofZU\u00020andZU\u0002\u00020does is merely to remind us that the regressivejustification is relative to the embedding: if we had chosen a different embed-ding, we would have been justified in believing a slightly different set theory.Indeed the regressive justifier might even regard the inequivalence with ap-proval, since it hints at a salutary parsimony in our choice of theory.Thiscutsbothways,though: justbecauseofitsparsimonythetheoryisveryinconvenient. Even if most mathematical reasoningcanbe embedded inZU\u00020,it will quite often take some knowledge of set theory to see how to do it. TherestrictionsZU\u00020places on reasoning will seem to most mathematicians (who,after all, are not, and do not want to become, set theorists) to be arbitrary andunmotivated. And if we intend to use the Scott/Tarski definitions of cardinalsand ordinals, we now have no reason to wantω\u0002in our universe rather thanω\u0002\u0002, and we might as well just assert the existence ofsomeinfinite set. Theresulting theory will be adequate for embedding all the mathematics that canbe represented inZU, so there will be no regressive argument for preferringZUto it.In any case the historical development did not follow the course just out-lined. We have already seen in part I that the iterative conception of set tooksome time to emerge, so that when the axiom of foundation was first mooted,it was regarded more as a convenient tool for metamathematical reasoningthan as an evident truth. But even from this metamathematical perspectivethe iterative hierarchy was not well understood by most set theorists. In par-ticular, the definitions of cardinals and ordinals that we have used in this bookwere not known until the 1950s. So the possibility of adding the axiom oftransitive containment and using these definitions was not recognized.Instead attention focused on adding axioms which allowed the von Neu-mann treatment of the ordinals to work. For this we would have to add somesuch axiom as the following.Axiom of ordinals\u0002.Every well-ordered set is isomorphic to a von Neumannordinal.Adding this axiom allows us to develop the theory of ordinals satisfactorily.But now what about the theory of cardinals? If we also assume the axiomof choice, we can use as a surrogate for the cardinal of a set the least vonNeumannordinalequinumerouswithit(seechapter14), butoneofthepointsof interest, especially in the 1920s and 1930s, was to study cardinal arithmeticwithout the axiom of choice, and if that is our aim, we are still adrift.

It is there-foreeasytoseetheimmediateappeal,ongroundsofsimplicityifonnoothers,of an axiom scheme which unifies this job lot of extra axioms into one form.So consider now what happens if, instead of transitive containment and theaxiom of ordinals\u0002, we add the following.Axiom scheme of replacement.Ifτ(x)is any term, this is an axiom:(∀x∈a)(τ(x)is a set)⇒{τ(x):x∈a}is a set.We shall writeZFU\u0002, for the system obtained fromZU\u00020by deleting the axiomof transitive containment and adding this axiom scheme; and we shall writeZF\u0002for its pure variant. (The ‘F’ stands for Fraenkel, who was one of thedevisors of replacement in the early 1920s.) Our choice of notation suggeststhat there is a connection betweenZFU\u0002andZFU, and indeed there is:ZFU\u0002is equivalent toZFUas a theory of sets. In one direction we have alreadyestablished this, of course: all the axioms ofZFU\u0002have already been shownto be theorems ofZFU. To establish the converse, we would have to work inZFU\u0002and prove the axioms ofZFU. There is a certain amount of machinerywe would have to develop again, mimicking the treatment already given inZFU. But once we had done this, it would be possible to prove inductively inZFU\u0002that the Vαare all levels and the axioms of creation and infinity followat once from this.ThedefinitionofwhatwehaveherebeencallingthevonNeumannordinalshadalreadybeenidentifiedbyZermeloinsomeunpublishedworkabout1915(see Hallett 1984, pp.270–80) and again by Mirimanoff (1917), but von Neu-mannwasthefirsttoseehowtheaxiomschemeofreplacementcouldbeusedtolegitimateit. Fraenkel, who hadstated theaxiomscheme ofreplacement in1922 before von Neumann, later recorded his surprise that there turned outto be this link between it and the theory of ordinals (Fraenkel 1967, p.169).What these mathematicians were discovering, and what made replacementso appealing, was in essence that it entailsallthe other axioms we have beenconsidering as additions to Zermelo’s theory with foundation, in particular"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Replacement297the axiom of transitive containment and the axiom of ordinals\u0002. The underly-ing reason for this, at least when viewed from the perspective of the iterativehierarchy, is that replacement acts as a hybrid: it asserts the existence of sets,such as von Neumann ordinals, of very high ranks, and hence has the effectof a higher axiom of infinity; but whenever a set exists it also entails the exist-ence of its birthday.ZFU\u0002is thus the first of the traditional theories we havedescribed in this Appendix that is strong enough to contain the whole of thetheory of levels that we developed in part I.The hybrid nature of replacement may be part of the explanation for thecurious mixture of regressive enthusiasm and intuitive suspicion that it hasengendered. Once we have seen how to treat cardinals and ordinals by theScott/Tarski method, the regressive arguments in favour of replacement areoverwhelmingly arguments for its ability to generate a hierarchy of levelsrather than for its use as an axiom of infinity. Boolos (1971, p.229) observesthat the advantageous consequences of replacement ‘include a satisfactory...theory of infinite numbers, and a highly desirable result that justifies in-ductive definitions on well-founded relations’; but, as we have shown in thisbook, both of these are available inZU, and hence they do not give any re-gressive support to replacement when viewed as a higher axiom of infinity.Indeed it is striking, given how powerful an extension of the theory replace-ment represents, how thin the justifications for its introduction were. Skolem(1922) gives as his reason that ‘Zermelo’s axiom system is not sufficient toprovide a complete foundation for the usual theory of sets’, because the set{ω,P(ω),P(P(ω)),...}cannot be proved to exist in that system; yet this is agood argument only if we have independent reason to think that this set doesexist according to ‘the usual theory’, and Skolem gives no such reason. VonNeumann’s (1925) justification for accepting replacement is only thatin view of the confusion surrounding the notion ‘not too big’ as it is ordinarily used,on the one hand, and the extraordinary power of this axiom on the other, I believethat I was not too crassly arbitrary in introducing it, especially since it enlarges ratherthan restricts the domain of set theory and nevertheless can hardly become a sourceof antinomies. (In van Heijenoort 1967, p.402)Butiftheregressiveargumentfortheaxiomisnotasstrongassomehavesup-posed, it is nevertheless given noticeably more weight here than in justifyingthe other axioms, even by authors otherwise inclined towards offering moreintuitive justifications. Boolos (1971, p.229), for instance, says explicitly that‘the reason for adopting the axioms of replacement is quite simple: they havemany desirable consequences and (apparently) no undesirable ones.’An emphasis on the regressive method of justification at the expense of theintuitive is often a sign of logical nervousness: Russell adopted the regressivemethod (1973b) only because he had been forced to include in his system anaxiom (reducibility) which he saw no direct reason to believe was true. And"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"298Traditional axiomatizationswhen Frege (1893–1903, vol.II, p.253) was told that his Basic Law V wascontradictory, he admitted, in effect, that his reasons for assuming it had beenlargely regressive.In the case of replacement there is, it is true, no widespread concern thatit might be, like Basic Law V, inconsistent, but it is not at all uncommon tofind expressed, if not by mathematicians themselves then by mathematicallytrained philosophers, the view that, insofar as it can be regarded as an axiomof infinity, it does indeed, as von Neumann (1925, p.227) said, ‘go a bit toofar’. Putnam (2000, p.24), for instance, admits, ‘Quite frankly, I see no intu-itive basis at all for...the axiom of replacement. Better put, I do not see thatanotionof set on which that axiom is clearly true has ever beenexplained.’ AndBoolos (2000) expresses at some length his discomfort with the ontologicalcommitments of the theory that results if we assume it.NotesMathias 2001 is a good account of the failure of systems such asZU\u00020andZU\u0002\u00020to deliver a theory that can cope satisfyingly with transfinite recursions.Uzquiano (1999) shows that this is not wholly due to the weakness of first-order separation: the second-order versions of these theories do not deliverthe hierarchy either.Cantor’s published works contain several assertions which are true only ifthe universe is rather large: for example, he claimed in (1883) that there is analeph for every ordinal, although the assumptions which he made explicitlythere do not imply this. It was only in work he chose not to publish that hestated (informally) a property approximating to the replacement principle. Itre-appeared (again stated informally) in Mirimanoff 1917, Lennes 1922, andFraenkel 1922b, and was given a precise first-order formulation by Skolem(1922); the name ‘axiom of replacement’ (Ersetzungsaxiom) under which it isnowadays known is due to Fraenkel."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Appendix BClassesAnaggregateissomethingwhosenatureitistobemadeupfromotherthings.In §2.1 we distinguished two quite different conceptions of how this can hap-pen, which we have called fusions and collections.

Thisis not because we conceive of them as objects and logic is supposed not tobe ontologically committed, but rather because the relation of constitutionwhich is of their essence seems to be metaphysical rather than logical. Butboth these notions — fusions and collections — have been connected to (andattimesconfusedwith)othernotionsthatdoperhapshavetitletoberegardedas logical.Consider fusions first. One reason they have often been thought to be on-tologically innocent, and hence nominalistically acceptable, is that singularreference to a fusion is equivalent to plural reference to its parts. To say of mybooks that they are heavy is just to say of their fusion that it is. So the notionof a fusion is connected to the logical idea of plural quantification.Andinarathersimilarmannerthenotionofacollectionisconnectedtothelogical idea of theextensionof a property. This idea is standardly explained bymeans of tired examples such as the properties of having a heart and havinga kidney. I am no physiologist, but I trust those logic textbooks which assureme that although they are different properties, they apply to just the same ob-jects: apart from pathological cases such as people in the course of transplantsurgery, any being with a heart also has a kidney and vice versa. Logiciansexpress this by saying that the two predicates have differentintensionsbut thesameextension.The correspondence between singular reference to a fusion and plural ref-erence to its parts is not exact, however. We should therefore be cautiousabout too swiftly reducing one to the other. And we already know that therecannot be a wholly general correspondence between extensions of proper-ties and collections because all properties have extensions but, as we saw inchapter 2, not all are collectivizing.The fundamental property that makes extensions extensional is that prop-erties have the same extensions just in case they have the same instances.

For we need to be mindful of thereason for the lasting notoriety of Frege’s principle.

The aim of this appendix is to explore how much of the content of thecontradictory conjunction we should preserve.B.1 Virtual classesSo let us begin again. To be definite, let us start with a prior theoryU: thecase which will interest us most is that in whichUis a theory of sets such as1Tobestrictlyaccurate,whatFregecalledBasicLawVwasasomewhatmoregeneralprinciple,but the difference between the two is irrelevant to our current concerns."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Virtual classes301ZU, but it will clarify the issues if for the moment we assume only that it isa conventionally formalized first-order system in a countable language.

So weshall for the moment treat ‘yε[x:Φ(x)]’ merely as an abbreviation forΦ(y).General statements about classes can thus be represented at best schematic-ally.

Indeed it is even a conservative extension provided thatUalready entails the existence of infinitely many objects (Bell 1994).This oddity is straightforwardly explained by the theory of cardinality weshall develop in part III.

Butif, aswearesupposinghere,Uis a conventional first-order theory, there are only countably manyformulae. So as long as our model is infinite, there is no difficulty about asso-ciating an object in its domain with eachformulaof the language so as to makeall the instances of the scheme true. In other words, if Frege had restrictedhimself to a first-order language, his treatment of extensions of concepts asobjects belonging to the domain over which the quantifiers range would nothave been contradictory.B.2 Classes as new entitiesSuppose now that, emboldened by the harmlessness of speakingas iftherewere classes, we start using names as if referring to them. If we do this, wecan no longer treat ‘ε’ as contextually defined, since we shall want to use italongside class names, where its meaning cannot be unpacked contextually.We must therefore add ‘ε’ as a new logical primitive and add the followingaxiom scheme.Epsilon scheme.IfΦis any formula,xε[y:Φ(y)]⇔Φ(x).Lettersusedtosubstituteforclasstermsarenolongermetalinguisticastheywereinthefirstproposal, butareanadditiontotheobjectlanguageitself.

Russell’s paradox for collections was unsurprising because itmerely gave us an explicit example of a non-collectivizing property when wehad no prior reason to expect that all propertiesshouldbe collectivizing. Here,ontheotherhand,wedoexpectallpropertiestobeclass-forming,sinceclassesare obtained from properties by a general logical process of abstraction; butprecisely because they are obtained in this manner, they are to be conceivedof asnewentities not falling within the range of the quantifiers of our priortheoryU, and Russell’s argument merely demonstrates this explicitly.Russell’s paradox for classes is to be read, therefore, as demonstrating thatif we treat classes as objects, they do not invariably fall within the range ofthe quantifiers of the prior theory. As long as we observe this restriction, thetheory which introduces classes in this manner is still trivially conservativeover the prior theoryUjust as the virtual theory discussed in the last sectionwas: if we have a proposition in the language ofUwhose proof makes useof class names, it is a straightforward, mechanical matter to eliminate themand hence convert it into a proof inUof the same proposition. Moreover,the new proof obtained by this mechanical procedure will not be of signific-antly greater length than the old one. For this reason one might expect theapplication of the extended theory to be wholly uncontroversial. This is notso, however. What makes this step problematic is that it places a constrainton the quantifiers of our prior theory, which now do not range unrestrictedlyover all the objects there are, but only over those that are not classes. Butin that case it appears that wholly unrestricted quantification overeverythingisnot possible within any formalism, since we can always extend our languageas just described, whereupon the paradox will lead us to realize that the quan-tifiers of our prior theory did not in fact range over everything. We need topause, therefore, to consider whetherthisshould trouble us.B.3 Classes and quantificationThe view we are considering — that our quantifiers are not genuinely unres-tricted but range only over the membership of some classV— seems to haveoriginatedwithRussell,whopersistentlyidentifiedtherangesofobjectswhichbelong to classes with those over which quantification makes sense. ‘When Isaythatacollectionhasnototal, Imeanthatstatementsaboutallitsmembersare nonsense.’ (Russell 1908, p.225n.) But the view has also attracted wide-spread support since then. Indeed, according to Dummett, ‘the one thing wemayconfidentlysaythatnomodernlogicianbelievesin’iswhollyunrestrictedquantification.The one lesson of the set-theoretic paradoxes which seems quite certain is that wecannot interpret individual variables in Frege’s way, as ranging simultaneously over"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"304Classesthe totality of all objects which could meaningfully be referred to or quantified over.This is why modern explanations of the semantics of first-order predicate calculusalways require that a domain bespecifiedfor the individual variables: we cannot, asFrege supposed, rely on a once-for-all explanation that individual variables are alwaysto be thought of as ranging over the totality of all objects. (1973, p.567)It seems unlikely that there was ever, as Dummett claims, a time whennologician believed in wholly unrestricted quantification. Moreover, Dummett’sownunderstandingofthelimitationsonunrestrictedquantificationisnotfullycaptured by the above quotation, as we shall see later when we turn to a dis-cussion of his views. Nonetheless, there remains, irrespective of what Dum-mett himself thinks, the question whether it is right to maintain a rigid linkbetween the legitimacy of quantification over some objects and the existenceof a class to which they all belong.In one direction, indeed, the entailment between the two notions seemsclear: itishardtoseewhatobjectiontherecouldbetoquantifyingoverallthemembers of some class, and harder still to find an example of a logician whohas suggested one. For if a class is, as we have said, a logical entity obtainedby abstraction, it is surely incoherent to suppose that it could be so obtainableeven though quantification over its members was impossible.But what the argument in the opposite direction is supposed to be is moreproblematic. One that crops up persistently in the modern literature is basedon the observation that the standard semantics for first-order logic may becouched in class-theoretic terms. A quantified sentence is said to be validif it is true in every interpretation of the language; and an interpretation isunderstoodasbeingastructureconsistingofaclassD(calledthedomainoftheinterpretation), a member of the domain for each constant of the language,a subclass ofDfor each unary predicate symbol, a relation onDfor eachbinary predicate symbol, etc. (cf. §4.10). So, the argument goes, if we caninterpret a quantified sentence meaningfully, we must be understanding thequantifiers occurring in it as ranging over the members of some domainDofinterpretation, i.e. some class.It should be clear, I hope, how unpersuasive this is. The standard se-mantics which the argument invokes is available only from the perspectiveof a metalanguage, and when we adopt this perspective, we are using wordssuch as ‘class’ in whatever sense our grasp of that language gives to them.In the course of our discussion of classes, by contrast, we are speakers of theobject language. That language has a word ‘class’ too, but it is a differentword (because a word in a different language). While we are speaking this ob-ject language, we do not invoke a metalanguage semantics in order to explainwhat we mean: we simply speak the language.Or, to put it another way, if it is legitimate to conceive of our variablesas ranging over absolutely everything, then that is not a conception whichsimultaneouslyallows for a metalinguistic perspective. What the move to the"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Classes and quantification305metalanguageinvolvesisindeedtheconceptionoftheworldasalimitedwhole—as,ifyouwishtospeakthisway,aclass—butthatisnotyettosaythatifwecarryonflat-footedlyspeakingtheobjectlanguagethereisanythinginconsistentabout denying that limitation.But this way of resolving the tension created by the argument from model-theoretic semantics immediately prompts a second, rather subtler accountwhich argues that we cannot quantify over everything because it is in someway indeterminate what ‘everything’ amounts to. It is important, of course,to be clear what sort of indeterminacy is in question here. It is no doubt truethat I have no clear conception of what, according to my representation ofthe world, there is; and, further, that no such clear conception is to be hadbecause my representation just is insufficiently precise to determine it. Butit is not immediately clear whatthissort of indeterminacy has to do with theset-theoretic paradoxes, for it seems to be an essentially representational inde-terminacy, whereas if the set-theoretic paradoxes demonstrate an indeterm-inacy at all, it is (at least according to the platonist) an indeterminacy inwhatthere isand not merely in what we represent there to be. But if it is this last sortof indeterminacy that is in question, we need to say more if we are to explainwhy the platonist should regard it as a threat to the coherence of unrestrictedquantification at all. After all, Russell’s paradox does not seem to hint at anyinherent vagueness as to which objects are classes.Perhaps, though, themostconvincingsortofargumentagainstunrestrictedquantification is one that starts from the natural first thought that universalquantification is analogous to conjunction, and existential quantification todisjunction. Thus if there are only finitely many objectsa1,...,anin thedomain of quantification,(∀x)Φ(x)⇔Φ(a1)andΦ(a2)and...andΦ(an),(∃x)Φ(x)⇔Φ(a1)orΦ(a2)or...orΦ(an).And in the case where the domain of quantification is infinite, perhaps we canimagine there to be corresponding equivalences which only the constraintsof our finite language prevent us from expressing. But it would be a mistaketo treat these equivalences as expressing the wholemeaningof the quantifiers,even in the finite case, because they omit to express the vital information thata1,...,anreally areallthe objects in the domain. Yet to conceive of themas exhausting the domain is, the thought goes, to conceive of the domain ascircumscribed, as being a limited portion of a larger range of objects. Andthis is just what is required for there to be a class with justa1,...,anas itsmembers.This third sort of argument arises naturally from consideration of Wittgen-stein’sTractatus(1922), in which it is closely linked with the second sort ofargument already considered. For ifa1,...,anare all the objects there are,"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"306Classesthen according to theTractatusI would be capable of representing this to bethecaseonlyifIcouldadoptanessentiallydifferent(transcendental)perspect-ive from which to see the world (the old world I represented from my formerperspective) as a limited whole (and even then, one supposes, only imper-fectly); but if I remain resolutely within the bounds of the original perspective,I cannot express (and hence cannot fully comprehend) these limits.B.4 Classes quantifiedIf we treat classes as genuine objects and learn to live, however reluctantly,with the consequent realization that our prior quantifiers did not really rangeovereverything,thatneednotpreventusfromintroducinganewkindofquan-tifier to range over the new objects. Let us proceed cautiously, however, andinvestigate first the case where we ban these new variables from occurring inthe instances of the two schemes governing the behaviour of classes. (We shalldiscuss later whether this restriction is well-motivated.)One interesting feature of this way of extending our theory is that becausewe are now permitted to quantify over class variables, any axiom scheme inUcan be replaced by a single axiom in the new theoryU. The reason thisis of interest is that if the original language has only a finite number of non-logical primitives, the extension will be finitely axiomatizable. (This is notquite trivial.) So the theory of classes we are considering provides us with ageneral method of moving from a first-order theoryUaxiomatized by finitelymany schemes to a finitely axiomatized conservative extensionU.This undoubtedly represents a significant extension of the theory we hadbefore, for although our new theoryUwith class quantifiers is still conser-vative overU, the proof that it is is no longer trivial as it was in the case wediscussedin§B.2. Whattheproofofconservativenessinvolvesnowisanexpli-cit (finitistic) recipe for converting a proof inUof a sentence of the class-freelanguage into a proof of the same sentence inU. But there is some work in-volved in doing this: we have first to rewrite the proof in cut-free form so thatit has an especially simple structure amenable to proof-theoretic analysis. Butit is a routine fact of proof theory that such rewritings, although mechanical,may involve a marked (often exponential) increase in length, and so the newproof will not in general be merely a trivial rewriting as in the earlier case.Quantifying over classes, although conservative, is thus a significant step totake because it has the potential to alter the lengths of proofs substantially.But in a way the very fact that it is a significant step may provide a clue tothe reason for taking it. Our new proof may, as we have noted, be markedlydifferent from the old one: in particular, it may be much shorter. If so, ourintroduction of quantification over classes will have an instrumental justifica-tion: we have here, in fact, an example of a successful application of Hilbert’s"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Impredicative classes307programme. For it was Hilbert (1925) who conceived the general project ofinstrumentallyjustifyingouruseofanextensionofanalreadyacceptedtheoryUby proving finitistically that it is conservative. The case which most inter-ested Hilbert was one in which the reason for acceptingUis itself finitistic,whereas of course here we are envisaging thatUmay be a theory of sets suchasZorZUwhich goes well beyond what the finitist would accept, but theshape of the justification for theextensionis the same.According to Quine’s (1948) dictum that to be is to be the value of a vari-able, by adopting the quantified theory of classes we express a commitment toan ontology of classes. But Hilbert’s programme suggests an alternative view,according to which the objects of the new theory may be regarded as no morethan convenient fictions whose use is justified by the conservativeness proof:it is useful to argueas ifsuch entities exist because doing so sometimes per-mits shorter proofs, but in every such case we know that if required we couldin principle purge the proofs of all mention of the ideal elements so as to beleft with only unobjectionable reference to the real objects to which our priortheory already committed us.B.5 Impredicative classesSo far we have banned class quantifiers from occurring in the formulae in ourtwo class schemes, the abstraction scheme and the epsilon scheme. Supposenow that we relax this restriction. We shall say that the classes which resultfrom this relaxation areweakly impredicative. The new theoryU1is still conser-vative overU. To see this, suppose thatΦis a sentence in the language ofUwhich is not provable inU. Then by the completeness of first-order logicUhas a set-theoretic model in whichΦis false. Now interpret the class vari-ables as ranging over the subsets of the domainDof this model, and interpretany class term [x:Ψ(x)] as referring to the set of those members ofDwhichbelong to the interpretation ofΨin this model. With these definitions thestructure becomes a model ofU1in whichΦis still false, soΦis not provableinU1.Notice that this argument is radically different from the proof of conservat-ivenessofthepredicativeextensionconsideredin§B.4. Thatearlierproofwasfinitistic — it explicitly converted proofs in the enlarged system into class-freeproofs inU— whereas now our demonstration is model-theoretic. This hasimportant consequences.First, the demonstration itself makes use of impredicative set-theoreticmethods in the metatheory. It can thus no longer be thought of as an in-stance of Hilbert’s programme as he originally conceived it, since we cannotuse it to convince an agnostic of the reliability of such methods."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"308ClassesSecond, given a proof ofΦinU1, our demonstration that there is a proof ofΦinUhasbeenwhollynon-constructiveand, asistypicalofnon-constructivedemonstrations, gives us no clue how to obtain a proof inUor (even approx-imately) how long to expect it to be.

TheydonotentitleustoexpectanyrelationshipbetweentheproofinU1andtheproofinU: inadditiontodifferingmarkedlyinlength,they might also use quite different proof ideas.B.6 ImpredicativityIf we rejected the platonistic attempt to link the legitimacy of quantificationwith the existence of a collection to act as the domain of quantification, thatwould not yet be to refute the constructivist’s more modest variant of thisclaim. For the constructivist may claim, as Dummett has famously done, thata domain is required not in order that quantification over the domain shouldbecomprehensiblebut only in order that it should be guaranteed to deliver adeterminatetruth-valueforeachsuchsentence. Sosentencesquantifyingovereverything will be possible provided that we are willing to give up the law ofexcluded middle in application to them.Nowwesawin§2.5thatDummettbaseshisargumentforthisconclusiononthe notion of indefinite extensibility. I suggested then that in a wholly generalsetting it is difficult to see what the argument is. But the current context givesus more resources with which to gain a grip on the idea. The key point isencapsulated in Dummett’s remark thatthecriterionforassertingsomethingofallobjectsfallingunderaconceptisanessentialfeature of that concept, but is not automatically given with the criterion for a givenobject’s falling under it. (1994b, p.338)There is, that is to say, something further to our grasp of the universal gener-alization which goes beyond our grasp of each of its instances.The clue to understanding this remark lies, I think, in our earlier attemptsto find a platonistic argument to connect quantification with collectivization.The constructivist will suggest that those attempts were on the whole unsuc-cessful because they relied on a distinction (which the platonist of course ac-cepts) between what there is and what I represent there to be. Let us see whathappens if we collapse that distinction and identify one with the other.Our best argument ended, let us recall, by observing that if we treat a uni-versally quantified proposition as a (possibly finite) conjunction, we leave outthe information that the objects we refer to in the conjunction really are allthe objects there are. But suppose now thatwhat there isis itself an indefinitelyextensible concept. By hypothesis, then, there is a process which, when ap-plied to all the objects there are, yields another object which is not among all"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"Impredicativity309the objects there are. Contradiction. The only way out is therefore to denythat we are capable of a determinate conception of what there is independentof any particular representation. Denying this leads us to see, in other words,that whenever we employ classical quantification, we inevitably quantify onlyover some limited totality which cannot exhaust everything there is (or indeedeverything falling under any indefinitely extensible concept).What makes this conclusion seem intolerable to the platonist, as we haveseen, is that we seem so clearly capable of quantifying over a range that iswider than the membership of any particular limited domain. Indeed the actof seeing that a domainislimited seems explicable only by appeal to such aquantification. The Dummettian constructivist, however, has a way of resolv-ing this tension by explaining unrestricted quantification schematically. Wemay represent this by saying that the unrestricted generalization(∀x)Φ(x)expresses our willingness to assert any instanceΦ(σ)obtained by instantiat-ing the variablexwith a termσ.Notice, though, that this cannot be intended merely as expressing a formalrule. For if we were to read the scheme as representing only instantiations bythe terms of a fixed formal language, we would have failed to capture fullythe open-endedness of the conception to which the notion of an indefinitelyextensible concept is supposed to lead us. A commitment to the universalgeneralization is intended to commit us toΦ(σ)for anyσthat we may comein thefutureto recognize as a term, even if the formal rules of our language donot yet provide for it.But it is important, the constructivist maintains, to observe that quantifiedsentences express something very different when understood in this mannerfrom when they are understood classically, for now they ‘can be interpretedonlyasexpressingclaims,notasmakingstatements’(Dummett1994a,p.249).These two ways of interpreting assertoric utterances are, according to Dum-mett, fundamentally different. ‘With a statement is associated a condition forits truth: if the condition is satisfied, the assertion is correct; if not, the state-ment is false and its assertion incorrect.’ A claim, on the other hand, ‘is to theeffect that a certain intellectual or linguistic feat can be performed’.The difference between the two types of assertoric utterance is that the condition forthe truth of a statement is independent of the speaker’s or anyone else’s abilities orepistemic condition, except, of course, where the statement was about him, whereasthe condition for a claim to be justified always turns on what the speaker of someonehe can call on to act for him is able to do. (Dummett 1994a, pp.246–7)The contrast Dummett is making here goes back to Ramsey, who referredto the claims expressed by genuinely unrestricted quantification as ‘variablehypotheticals’.What have they in common with conjunctions, and in what do they differ from them?Roughly we can say that when we look at them subjectively they differ altogether, but"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"310Classeswhen we look at them objectively, i.e. at the conditions of their truth and falsity, theyappear to be the same.(x).φxdiffers from a conjunction because(a) It cannot be written out as one.(b) Its constitution as a conjunction is never used; we never use it in class-thinkingexcept in its application to a finite class, i.e. we use only the applicative rule.(c) (This is the same as (b) in another way.) It always goes beyond what we know orwant. ...It expresses an inference we are at any time prepared to make, not abelief of the primary sort.A belief of the primary sort is a map of neighbouring space by which we steer. Itremains such a map however much we complicate it or fill in details. But if we pro-fessedly extend it to infinity, it is no longer a map; we cannot take it in or steer by it.Our journey is over before we need its remoter parts. (Ramsey 1931, pp.237–8)Dummett claims that although the distinction between statements andclaims allows us to resolve our difficulty concerning unrestricted quantifica-tion, it does so only at a price: we have to give up the notion that classicallogic applies to claims. But the difficulty we face now, as Ramsey recognized,is to explain what our grasp of the variable hypothetical comes to if it isnotaproposition.Whenweaskwhatwouldmakeittrue,weinevitablyanswerthatitistrueifandonlyifeveryxhasφ;i.e.whenweregarditasapropositioncapableofthetwocasestruthandfalsity, we are forced to make it a conjunction, and to have a theory of conjunctionswhich we cannot express for lack of symbolic power.(But what we can’t say we can’t say, and we can’t whistle it either.)If then it is not a conjunction, it is not a proposition at all; and then the question arisesin what way can it be right or wrong. (Ramsey 1931, p.238)This is surely the crux of the matter. Dummett seems to portray the aban-donment of the classical law of the excluded middle as both a consequence ofadopting the constructivist position and a solution to the problem that led toit. Even if he is right about the former, it is hard to see why he should be rightabout the latter. Dummett (1994a, p.246) assures us that ‘the evaluation of aclaim as justifiable is as objective a matter as the evaluation of a statement astrue’, but why?B.7 Using classes to enrich the original theoryTaking as our starting point a theoryU, we have been considering a seriesof extensions ofUwhich take ever more seriously the claims to existence ofclassesobtainedbyabstractingfromthepropertiesformulableinthelanguageofU.

As we remarked earlier, a commonmotivation for laying down a theory of this form is that we already believe thesecond-order sentence(∀X)...X...(1)and adopt the first-order scheme as the best approximation to this that is ex-pressible in our first-order language. But if this is our motivation for assentingto the scheme, then when we extend the language we should automaticallyextend this assent to cover all the instances in the extended language.What this amounts to in the current case is that we should allow a secondsort of impredicativity into our theory. Not only do we permit class terms[x:Φ(x)] to be formed in which the formulaΦitself quantifies over classes,but we also assent to all instances of the scheme...Φ...in whichΦis aformula of the extended language and thus may involve quantification overclasses. Let us call thestrongly impredicativetheory thus obtained\u0012U. In onesense this is a very natural step to take.

SoifΦisanyformulaoftheextendedlanguage,we must presumably accept the existence of a property possessed by all andonly the objectsxsuch thatΦ(x).

What is remarkable about this is that theprocess which led us to advance fromUto the strictly stronger theory\u0012Uinvolved no more than taking seriously the ontological commitments involvedin recognizing the existence of classes, i.e. extensional entities abstracted fromproperties."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"Appendix CSets and classesThe versions of set theory to be found in the literature are, despite some fam-ily resemblances, enormously varied. But the picture becomes much clearerwhen one realizes that most of the variations can be classified quite succinctly.Onedimensionofvariationwehavealreadymetconcernswhetherthetheorypermits there to be any individuals; a second concerns how many levels thereare in the hierarchy; and a third concerns how rich our conception is, once alevel is given, of the level that follows it. In this appendix we discuss a fourthsort of variation.There is no set of all sets: that, we know, is a consequence of Russell’sparadox (at any rate if we assume separation). But Russell’s paradox doesnot prevent there being something else — aclassof all sets — which is anextensional entity behaving in some respects as sets do. Theories of sets maythus be categorized according to whether they countenance such entities.C.1 Adding classes to set theoryIn the previous appendix we discussed the notion of a class in isolation fromthat of a set: everything we said was therefore at a very general level, and wemaderatherfewassumptionsaboutthenatureofthepriortheoryUonwhichtalk of classes was being superimposed.

Butshouldwebother? Formostmathematicalpurposes it matters not at all whether we afforce our theory of sets with thelanguage of classes, virtual or otherwise. The one obvious exception to thisis category theory. In principle, the simplest facts about categories can beexpressed in set theory without classes, but the methods for doing this aresyntactically elaborate and non-intuitive. And we do not have to progressfar into the subject to come across statements for which these methods oftranslation fail.The authors of Bourbaki wrestled with this problem for some time beforeeventually abandoning the attempt to add a chapter on category theory totheirTh ́ eorie des Ensembles. Simply adding classes is not the whole answer,however. Even inMKwe would have to resort to coding tricks to repres-ent functors between categories. So the easiest way to represent categories insettheoryisby meansofanintermediateuniverseofsetscapableofbelongingto sets higher in the hierarchy. One reason for the formulation of set theoryin my 1990 was to facilitate this representation. This suggests that the issuesraised by the set-theoretic representation lie in a different plane from the dis-tinction between logical and mathematical concepts of aggregations that weare concerned with here.C.2 The difference between sets and classesThere is evidently a natural way of associating with every setathe classa=[x:xεa], and we then havex∈a⇔xεa."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"314Sets and classesWe know that we cannot simply identify sets and classes in all cases: the classV=[x:x=x],forinstance,doesnotcorrespondtoanyset. Butmanymath-ematicians have been inclined to identify sets with the classestheycorrespondto, leaving the other classes as a special case, calledproper classes.If we do this, an obvious simplification of the theory results. Indeed, if wehad planned to do this all along, there would have been no need for us tohave introduced the first kind of variable, ranging only over sets: we couldmake do with only the second sort, ranging over classes. And there would beno need to distinguish between the two species of membership∈andε. Setswould simply be classes belonging toV, and quantification over sets would berepresented by restricted quantifiers ‘∀x∈V’ and ‘∃x∈V’ ranging over justsuch classes.The question that remains to be addressed is whether we are right to makethe identification of sets with classes which is required if the non-conservativeMorse/Kelley extension is even to be possible. The idea of making somesort of distinction between sets and classes goes back to Cantor, who wroteletters to Dedekind and Hilbert in the late 1890s distinguishing what he called‘consistent’ and ‘inconsistent’ classes. The first published system which adoptsa distinction between sets and classes (von Neumann 1925) treats sets as aparticularkindofclass. ButthereisnothingineitherCantororvonNeumannto suggest that they conceived of the distinction, as we are doing here, as acategoricaldistinctionbetweenmetaphysicalandlogicalobjects.

Moreover, it is not clear thatthe distinction as these writers conceive of it is quite the same as the one wewant here. Writers who make such a distinction often seem to be interestedmainlyintheideaofarbitrariness: onthelogicalconception, aclassisderivedfrom a property, and hence all its elements share the property, whereas onthe combinatorial conception, any elements whatever form a class, whetheror not there is a property characterizing them. But this distinction makeslittle sense if taken on its own independent of any context of representation.For if there are some objects, however disparate, forming an aggregate inthe combinatorial sense, then thereisa property that characterizes just thosethings, namely the property of belonging to that aggregate.The obvious retort is to say that what is meant is a propertyexpressible inlanguage. But the difficulty is to say which language. For any fixed formallanguage we can, by diagonalization, obtain a property not expressible in thatlanguage which, once recognized, we are forced to treat as legitimate. Or,to put it in Dummettian terms once more, the notion of property that we are"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"The metalinguistic perspective315appealingtohereisindefinitelyextensible(cf.Dummett1978). Forthisreasonitseemswrongtoregardthedistinctionbetweensetsandclassesassimplyoneof arbitrariness, but that still does not answer our question about whether it isright to identify a set with the associated class.A short answer is that if we cannot identifyeveryclass with a set, we shouldnot identifyany. Slightly less briefly, if we treat sets as a kind of class, wehave to give up the explanation of the hierarchy of sets based on the notionof dependency, since that was derived from a conception of the metaphysicalnature of sets, whereas classes, being logical, do not — we may suppose —have substantial metaphysical properties independent of the properties of theentities from which they are abstracted. So if we regard the classesaandbas derived from the setsaandb, we may, if we wish, think ofaandbasinheriting fromaandbwhatever dependency relations hold between them.But if we simplyidentifyawithaandbwithb, this collapses, and we are leftwithout a route to the account of dependency which we used in chapter 3 toexplain the paradoxes.We can see the symptoms of this collapse if we reflect on the form of atheory which assimilates sets to classes from the outset. In such a theory weare told that among classes there are some (sets) that belong to other classesandsome(properclasses)thatdonot. Butwhythedifference? Whyisthereinsuch a theory no room for such a class as{V}, for instance? The identificationof sets as a kind of class has deprived us of the resources to respond.C.3 The metalinguistic perspectiveWe mentioned in §4.10 the central idea of model theory that a (generalized)structurecanberegardedasaninterpretationofaformallanguage: thequan-tifiers of the language are interpreted as ranging over the members of the do-main, a unary predicate symbol is interpreted by means of a subset of thedomain, a binary predicate symbol by means of a relation on it, etc.Now model theory is a branch of mathematics; and, like other branches ofmathematics, it can be formalized in set theory. If this is done, the variousclaims it makes are transformed into statements in the theory of sets. Thereis a familiar distinction drawn at the beginning of logic between syntax andsemantics. If we confine ourselves topuremodel theory, the part which is con-cerned solely with semantic concepts, the process of formalization is relativelyunproblematic. Butwe mustbe carefulwhen weembark onthe formalizationof syntax as well, for at that point formal languages themselves become theobjects of study. The reason this is dangerous is that set theory, the frame-work within which our study is being conducted, is itself a formal theory, andso the theorems of logic are (apparently) applicable to it. The danger lies inthe fact that in order to study our language we de-interpret it — treat it as"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"316Sets and classesconsisting of strings of symbols without meaning. What we must not do isto confuse these strings of signs with the symbols they become when we readthem as part of our own language.The paradox of the set of all sets provides a ready example of the difficulty.Set-theoretic semantics provides a means of interpreting the sentences of aformal theory in such a way that all the quantifiers in them are relativizedto someset, the domain of the interpretation. In theintendedinterpretation ofset theory itself, the quantifiers range over all sets, so set-theoretic semanticswould require the domain of the intended interpretation to be the set of allsets. But there is no set of all sets. Contradiction.But this is simply the set-theoretic version of an argument we consideredfor classes in §B.3 and rests on a similarly bad pun. When we use set-theoreticsemantics to talk about our language, there is an inevitable shift of perspect-ive and our words change meaning. Our set-theoretic language becomes anobject language, while the semantics is now conducted in the metalanguage.In the metalanguage we do indeed interpret all the quantifiers in our objectlanguage as ranging over all sets (in the object language sense), but there isnothingcontradictoryabouttheideathatthereshouldbeaset(inthemetalan-guage sense) which has them all as members.Soonewayofunderstandingclassesisasthe‘sets’ofthemetalanguage.

But if we do, we must remember that the ‘set theory’ ofwhich they are models is not the same as the theory within which our talk isformulated but a formal simulacrum of it which we have synthesized.NotesThe account of the distinction between sets and classes in this appendix isgreatly indebted to Parsons (1974). Other authors who have tried to draw aprincipled distinction between sets and classes include Mayberry (2000, §3.5),Maddy (1983) and Simmons (2000).The problems of representing category theory inside set theory, which wegestured towards in §C.1, have been much discussed: see Feferman (1977),McLarty (1992, ch.12, §1), and Borceux (1994, ch.1, §1). The solution ofassuming the existence of an intermediate universe, which I adopted in myearlier book (1990), is discussed by Mac Lane (1969).
