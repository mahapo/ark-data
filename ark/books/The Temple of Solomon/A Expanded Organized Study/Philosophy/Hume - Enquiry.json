This behaviour is flatly contrary to all the rules of honesty and fairness, and a strikingexample of the debating tricks that bigoted zealots think it is all right for them to employ. From now on, the author wants thefollowing pieces to be regarded as the sole source for his philosophical opinions and principles.Section 1: The different kinds of philosophyMoral philosophy, or the science of human nature, canbe treated in two different ways, each of which has itsown special merit and may contribute to the entertainment,instruction, and reformation of mankind[‘moral philosophy’ herecovers every study involving human nature, including history, politics,etc.].•One of the two treatments considers man chiefly asborn for action, and as guided in his conduct by taste andsentiment[= ‘feeling or opinion’], pursuing one object and avoid-ing another according to the value they seem to have andaccording to the light in which they are presented. As virtueis agreed to be the most valuable thing one could pursue,philosophers of this kind paint virtue in the most charmingcolours, getting help from poetry and eloquence and treatingtheir subject in a popular and undemanding manner that isbest fitted to please the reader’s imagination and arouse hisaffections. They select the most striking observations andexamples from common life; they set up proper contrastsbetween opposite characteristics·such as virtue and vice,generosity and meanness·; and, attracting us into the pathsof virtue by visions of glory and happiness, they direct oursteps in these paths by the soundest rules and the mostvivid examples. They make usfeelthe difference betweenvice and virtue; they arouse and regulate our beliefs andfeelings; and they think they have fully reached their goal ifthey manage to bend our hearts to the love of honesty andtrue honour.Philosophers who do moral philosophy in•the secondway focus on man as areasonablerather than as anactivebeing, and try to shape his thinking more than to improvehis behaviour. They regard human nature as a subject oftheoretical enquiry, and they examine it intently, trying tofind the principles that regulate our understanding, stirup our sentiments, and make us approve or blame thisor that particular object, event, or action. They think itsomewhat disgraceful that philosophy hasn’t yet establishedan agreed account of the foundation of morals, reasoning,and artistic criticism; and that it goes on talking abouttruth and falsehood, vice and virtue, beauty and ugliness,1"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume1: Different kinds of philosophywithout being able to fix the source of these distinctions.While they attempt this hard task, no difficulties deter them;moving from particular instances to general principles, theythen push their enquiries still further, to get to principlesthat are even more general, and they don’t stop, satisfied,until they arrive at the basic principles that set the limitsto human curiosity in every branch of knowledge. Thoughtheir speculations seem abstract, and even unintelligible toordinary readers, they aim at getting the approval of thelearned and the wise; and think themselves well enoughcompensated for their lifetime’s work if they can bring outinto the open some hidden truths that may be good for latergenerations to know.[In the writings of Hume and others of histime, a ‘principle’ could be something propositional such as the principlethat every event has a cause, but it could also be a non-propositionalforce,cause, orsource of energy. Make your own decision about whetherin this paragraph (and some others) ‘principle’ has one meaning or theother or both.]The general run of people will certainly always prefer therelaxed and obvious kind of philosophy to the accurate andabstruse kind; and many will recommend the former asbeing not only the more agreeable of the two kinds but alsothe more useful.[To us ‘accurate’ means something like ‘correct asa result of care’. In Hume’s day it often meant merely ‘done with carefulattention to detail’, with no implication of being correct. This version willlet ‘accurate’ stand; but many of Hume’s uses of it would strike you asodd if you didn’t know whathemeant by it.]It enters more intocommon life; moulds the heart and affections; and becauseit involves principles on which peopleact, it reforms theirconduct and brings them nearer to the model of perfectionthat it describes. The abstruse philosophy, on the otherhand, is based on a mental attitude that cannot enter into·every-day·business and action; so it vanishes when thephilosopher comes out of the shadows into daylight, and itsprinciples can’t easily influence our behaviour. The feelingsof our heart, the agitation of our passions, the intensity ofour affections, scatter all its conclusions and reduce theprofound philosopher to a mere peasant.The easy philosophy—let us face the fact—has achievedmore lasting fame than the other, and rightly so. Abstractreasoners have sometimes enjoyed a momentary reputation,because they caught the fancy of their contemporaries orbecause the latter were ignorant of what they were doing; butthey haven’t been able to maintain their high standing withlater generations that weren’t biased in their favour. It iseasy for a profound·abstract·philosopher to make a mistakein his intricate reasonings; and one mistake is bound tolead to another, while the philosopher drives his argumentforward and isn’t deterred from accepting any conclusion byits sounding strange or clashing with popular opinion. Not sowith a philosopher who aims only to represent the commonsense of mankind in more beautiful and more attractivecolours: if by accidenthefalls into error, he goes no further.Rather than pushing on, he renews his appeal to commonsense and to the natural sentiments of the mind, gets backonto the right path, and protects himself from any dangerousillusions. The fame of Cicero flourishes at present; but thatof Aristotle is utterly decayed. La Bruyère is read in manylands and still maintains his reputation: but the glory ofMalebranche is confined to his own nation, and to his owntime. And Addison, perhaps, will be read with pleasure whenLocke has been entirely forgotten.To be amere philosopheris usually not thought well of inthe world, because such a person is thought•to contributenothing either to the advantage or to the pleasure of society,•to live remote from communication with mankind, and•tobe wrapped up in principles and notions that they can’tpossibly understand. On the other hand, themere ignoramus2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume1: Different kinds of philosophyis still more despised; and at a time and place where learningflourishes, nothing is regarded as a surer sign of an ill-bredcast of mind than having no taste at all for learning. The bestkind of character is supposed to lie between those extremes:retaining an equal ability and taste for books, company, andbusiness; preserving in conversation that discernment anddelicacy that arise from literary pursuits, and in businesspreserving the honesty and accuracy that are the naturalresult of a sound philosophy. In order to spread and developsuch an accomplished kind of character, nothing can be moreuseful than writings in the easy style and manner, which stayclose to life, require no deep thought or solitary pondering tobe understood, and send the reader back among mankindfull of noble sentiments and wise precepts, applicable toevery demand of human life. By means of such writings,virtue becomes lovable, the pursuit of knowledge agreeable,company instructive, and solitude entertaining.Man is•a reasonable being, and as such he gets appro-priate food and nourishment from the pursuit of knowledge;but so narrow are the limits of human understanding thatwe can’t hope for any great amount of knowledge or for muchsecurity in respect of what we do know. As well as beingreasonable, man is•a sociable being; but he can’t alwaysenjoy—indeed can’t alwayswant—agreeable and amusingcompany. Man is also•an active being; and from thatdisposition of his, as well as from the various necessities ofhuman life, he must put up with being busy at something;but the mind requires some relaxation, and can’t alwaysdevote itself to careful work. It seems, then, that naturehas pointed out amixedkind of life as most suitable forthe human race, and has secretly warned us not to tilt toofar in any of these directions and make ourselves incapableof other occupations and entertainments. ‘Indulge yourpassion for knowledge,’ says nature, ‘but seek knowledge ofthings that are human and directly relevant to action andsociety. As for abstruse thought and profound researches,I prohibit them, and if you engage in them I will severelypunish you by the brooding melancholy they bring, by theendless uncertainty in which they involve you, and by thecold reception your announced discoveries will meet withwhen you publish them. Be a philosopher, but amidst allyour philosophy be still a man.’If people in general were contented to prefer the easy phi-losophy to the abstract and profound one, without throwingblame or contempt on the latter, it might be appropriate togo along with this general opinion, and to allow every man toenjoy without opposition his own taste and sentiment. Butthe friends of the easy philosophy often carry the matterfurther, even to point of absolutely rejecting all profoundreasonings, or what is commonly called metaphysics;·andthis rejection should not be allowed to pass unchallenged·.So I shall now proceed to consider what can reasonably bepleaded on behalf of the abstract kind of philosophy.Let us first observe that the accurate and abstract kindof philosophy has one considerable advantage that comesfrom its being of service to the other kind. Without help fromabstract philosophy, the easy and human kind can neverbe exact enough in its sentiments, rules, or reasonings. Allliterature is nothing but pictures of human life in variousattitudes and situations, and these inspire us with differ-ent sentiments of praise or blame, admiration or ridicule,according to the qualities of the object they set before us. Anartist must be better qualified to succeed in presenting suchpictures if, in addition to delicate taste and sensitive uptake,he has an accurate knowledge of the internal structure andoperations of the understanding, the workings of the pas-sions, and the various kinds of sentiment that discriminatevice and virtue. However difficult this search into men’s3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume1: Different kinds of philosophyinteriors may appear to be, it is to some extentneededbyanyone wanting to describe successfully the obvious andoutward aspects of life and manners. The anatomist presentsto the eye the most hideous and disagreeable objects; but hisscience is useful to the painter in presenting even a Venus ora Helen. While the painter employs all the richest colours ofhis art, and gives his figures the most graceful and engagingairs, he still has to attend to the inward structure of thehuman body, the position of the muscles, the structure ofthe bones, and the function and shape of every bodily partor organ. Accuracy always helps beauty, and solid reasoningalways helps delicate sentiment. It would be pointless topraise one by depreciating the other.Besides, it is notable that in every art or profession,even those of the most practical sort, a spirit of accuracy(however acquired) makes for greater perfection and rendersthe activity more serviceable to the interests of society. Andeven if philosophers keep themselves far from the world ofbusiness and affairs, the spirit of philosophy, if carefullycultivated by a number of people, must gradually permeatethe whole society and bring philosophical standards of cor-rectness to every art and calling. The politician will acquiregreater foresight and subtlety in apportioning and balancingpower; the lawyer more method and finer principles in hisreasonings; and the army general more regularity in hisdiscipline, and more caution in his plans and operations.The growing stability of modern governments, comparedwith the ancient, has been accompanied by improvementsin the accuracy of modern philosophy, and will probablycontinue to do so.Even if these studies brought no advantage beyond grat-ifying innocent curiosity, that oughtn’t to be despised, forit’s one way of getting safe and harmless pleasures—few ofwhich have been bestowed on human race. The sweetest andmost inoffensive path of life leads through the avenues ofknowledge and learning; and anyone who can either removeany obstacles along the path or open up new views ought tothat extent to be regarded as a benefactor to mankind. Andthough these·accurate and abstract·researches may appeardifficult and fatiguing, some minds are like some bodies inthis: being endowed with vigorous and flourishing health,they need severe exercise, and get pleasure from activitiesthat most people would find burdensome and laborious.Obscurity, indeed, is painful to the mind as well as to theeye; but to bring light from obscurity is bound to be delightfuland rejoicing, however hard the labour.But this obscurity in the profound and abstract kind ofphilosophy is objected to, not only as painful and tiring, butalso as the inevitable source of uncertainty and error. Hereindeed lies the fairest and most plausible objection to a largepart of metaphysics, that it isn’t properly a science[= ‘isn’ta theoretically disciplined pursuit of organised knowledge’], but ariseseither from•the fruitless efforts of human vanity, trying topenetrate into subjects that are utterly inaccessible to theunderstanding, or from•the craft of popular superstitionswhich, being unable to defend themselves by fair arguments,raise these entangling·metaphysical·brambles to cover andprotect their weakness.·Each of these is sometimes true;and the misuse of metaphysics by the friends of popularsuperstition is vexatious·. Chased from the open country,these robbers run into the forest and lie in wait to break inon every unguarded avenue of the mind and overwhelm itwith religious fears and prejudices. They can oppress thestrongest and most determined opponent if he lets up hisguard for a moment. And many of their opponents, throughcowardice and folly, open the gates to the enemies—·the pur-veyors of superstition·—and willingly and reverently submitto them as their legal sovereigns.4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume1: Different kinds of philosophyBut is this a good enough reason for philosophers to holdback from such researches, to retreat and leave superstitionin possession of the field? Isn’t it proper to draw the oppositeconclusion, and see the necessity of carrying the war intothe most secret recesses of the enemy? It is no use hopingthat frequent disappointment will eventually lead men toabandon such airy pursuits·as the superstitious ones·, anddiscover the proper province of human reason. For onething, many people find it too obviously to their advantageto be perpetually recalling such topics; and furthermore themotive of blind despair should never operate in the pursuitof knowledge, for however unsuccessful former attemptsmay have proved there is always room to hope that thehard work, good luck, or improved intelligence of succeedinggenerations will reach discoveries that were unknown informer ages. Each adventurous thinker will still leap atthe elusive prize, and find himself stimulated rather thandiscouraged by the failures of his predecessors; while hehopes that the glory of succeeding in such a hard adventureis reserved for him alone.·So the friends of superstitionand bad philosophy will never justgive up·. The onlyway to free learning from·entanglement in·these abstrusequestions is to enquire seriously into the nature of humanunderstanding, and through an exact analysis of its powersand capacity show that it’s utterly unfitted for such remoteand abstruse subjects. We must submit to this hard work inorder to live at ease ever after; and we must cultivate truemetaphysics carefully, in order to destroy metaphysics of thefalse and adulterated kind. Laziness protects some peoplefrom this deceitful philosophy, but others are carried into itby curiosity; and despair, which at some moments prevails,may give place later to optimistic hopes and expectations.Accurate and valid reasoning is the only universal remedy,fitted for all people of all kinds—·lazy and curious, despairingand hopeful·—and it alone can undercut that abstrusephilosophy and metaphysical jargon that gets mixed up withpopular superstition, presenting the latter in a manner thatcasual reasoners can’t understand, and giving it the air ofreal knowledge and wisdom.So an accurate scrutiny of the powers and faculties ofhuman nature helps us to reject, after careful enquiry, themost uncertain and disagreeable part of learning; and it alsobrings many positive advantages. It is a remarkable factabout the operations of the mind that, although they aremost intimately present to us, whenever we try to reflectonthem they seem to be wrapped in darkness, and the eye·of the mind·can’t easily detect the lines and boundariesthat distinguish them from one another. The objects·of thisscrutiny—i.e. the operations of the mind·—are so rarefiedthat they keep changing; so they have to be graspedin aninstant, which requires great sharpness of mind, derivedfrom nature and improved by habitual use. So it comesabout that in the pursuit of knowledge a considerable partof the task is simply to know the different operations of themind, to separate them from each other, to classify themproperly, and to correct all the seeming disorder in whichthey lie when we reflect on them. This task of orderingand distinguishing has no merit when it’s performed onexternal bodies, the objects of our senses; but when it’sdirected towards the operations of the mind it is valuable inproportion to how hard it is to do. Even if we get no furtherthan this mental geography, this marking out of the distinctparts and powers of the mind, it’s at least a satisfaction togo that far; and the more obvious these results may appear(and they are by no means obvious), the more disgraceful itmust be for those who lay claim to learning and philosophyto be ignorant of them.5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume1: Different kinds of philosophyNor can there remain any suspicion that this branchof knowledge—·the pursuit of accurate and abstractphilosophy·—is uncertain and illusory, unless we adopta scepticism that is entirely subversive ofalltheoreticalenquiry, and even of all action. It can’t be doubted•thatthe mind is endowed with various powers and faculties,•that these are distinct from each other,•that what is reallydistinct to the immediate perception may be distinguished byreflection; and consequently•that in all propositions on thissubject there are true ones and false ones, and sorting themout lies within the reach of human understanding. Thereare many obvious distinctions of this kind, such as thosebetween thewillandunderstanding, theimaginationand thepassions, which every human creature can grasp; and thefiner and more philosophical distinctions are no less real andcertain, though they are harder to grasp. Some successesin these enquiries, especially some recent ones, can give usa better idea of the certainty and solidity of this branch oflearning. Will we think it worth the effort of an astronomerto give us a true system of the planets, and to determine theposition and order of those remote bodies, while we turn ournoses up at those who with so much success determine theparts of the mind—a topic which for us comesveryclose tohome?But may we not hope that philosophy, if carried out withcare and encouraged by the attention of the public, maycarry its researches still further? Might it not·get beyondthe task of distinguishing and sorting out the operationsof the mind, and·discover, at least in some degree, thesecret springs and drivers by which the human mind isactuated in its operations? Astronomers were for a longtime contented with proving, from the phenomena, the truemotions, order, and size of the heavenly bodies; until at lasta scientist,·Isaac Newton·, came along and also determinedthe laws and forces by which the revolutions of the planetsare governed and directed. Similar things have been donewith regard to other parts of nature. And there is no reasonto despair of equal success in our enquiries into the powersand organisation of the mind, if we carry them out as ablyand alertly·as those other scientists did their work·. Itis probable that one operation and principle of the minddepends on another; which may in turn be brought under astill more general and universal one; and it will be difficultfor us to determine exactly how far these researches can becarried—difficult before we have carefully tried, and difficulteven after. This much is certain: attempts of this kind aremade every day even by those who philosophize the mostcarelessly; and the greatest need is to embark on the projectwith thorough care and attention. That is needed so thatif the taskdoeslie within reach of human understanding,it can eventually end in success; and if itdoesn’t, it canbe rejected with some confidence and security. But thislast conclusion is not desirable, and shouldn’t be arrived atrashly, for it detracts from the beauty and value of this sort ofphilosophy. Moralists have always been accustomed, whenthey considered the vast number and variety of actions thatarouse our approval or dislike, to search for some commonprinciple on which this variety of sentiments might depend.And though their passion for a single general principle hassometimes carried them too far, it must be granted that theyare excusable in expecting to find some general principlesunder which all the vices and virtues can rightly be brought.Similar attempts have been made by literary critics, logicians,and even students of politics; and their attempts have metwith some success, though these studies may come evennearer to perfection when they have been given more time,greater accuracy, and more intensive study. To throw upat once all claims to this kind of knowledge can fairly be6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume2: The origin of ideasthought to be more rash, precipitate, and dogmatic thaneven the boldest and most affirmative philosophy that hasever attempted to impose its crude dictates and principleson mankind.If these reasonings concerning human nature seem ab-stract and hard to understand, what of it? This isn’t evidenceof their falsehood. On the contrary, it seems impossiblethat what has hitherto escaped so many wise and profoundphilosophers can be very obvious and easy·to discover·. Andwhatever efforts these researches may cost us, we can thinkourselves sufficiently rewarded not only in profit but also inpleasure, if by that means we can add at all to our stock ofknowledge in subjects of such enormous importance.Still, the abstract nature of these speculations is a draw-back rather than an advantage; but perhaps this difficultycan be overcome by care and skill and the avoidance of allunnecessary detail; so in the following enquiry I shall tryto throw some light on subjects from which•wise peoplehave been deterred by uncertainty, and ignorant•peoplehave been deterred by obscurity. How good it would be tobe able to unite the boundaries of the different kinds ofphilosophy, by reconciling profound enquiry with clearness,and truth with novelty! And still better if by reasoning inthis easy manner I can undermine the foundations of anabstruse philosophy that seems always to have served onlyas a shelter to superstition and a cover to absurdity anderror!Section 2: The origin of ideasEveryone will freely admit that the perceptions of the mindwhen a man•feels the pain of excessive heat or the pleasureof moderate warmth are considerably unlike what he feelswhen he later•remembers this sensation or earlier•looks for-ward to it in his imagination. Memory and imagination maymimic or copy the perceptions of the senses, but they can’tcreate a perception that has as much force and livelinessas the one they are copying. Even when they operate withgreatest vigour, the most we will say is that they representtheir object so vividly that we couldalmostsay we feel or seeit. Except when the mind is out of order because of diseaseor madness, memory and imagination can never be so livelyas to create perceptions that are indistinguishable from theones we have in seeing or feeling. The most lively thought isstill dimmer than the dullest sensation.A similar distinction runs through all the other percep-tions of the mind. A real fit of•anger is very different frommerely thinking of that emotion. If you tell me that someoneis in•love, I understand your meaning and form a correctconception of the state he is in; but I would never mistakethat conception for the turmoil of actually being in love!When we think back on our past sensations and feelings, ourthought is a faithful mirror that copies its objects truly; butit does so in colours that are fainter and more washed-outthan those in which our original perceptions were clothed.To tell one from the other you don’t need careful thought orphilosophical ability.So we can divide the mind’s perceptions into two classes,on the basis of their different degrees of force and liveliness.The less forcible and lively are commonly called ‘thoughts’7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume2: The origin of ideasor ‘ideas’. The others have no name in our language or inmost others, presumably because we don’t need a generallabel for them except when we are doing philosophy. Let us,then, take the liberty of calling them ‘impressions’, using thatword in a slightly unusual sense. By the term ‘impression’,then, I meanall our more lively perceptions when we hear orsee or feel or love or hate or desire or will. These are to bedistinguished from ideas, which arethe fainter perceptionsof which we are conscious when we reflect on[= ‘look inwardsat’]our impressions.It may seem at first sight that human thought is utterlyunbounded: it not only escapes all human power andauthority·as when a poor man thinks of becoming wealthyovernight, or when an ordinary citizen thinks of being a king·,but isn’t even confined within the limits of nature and reality.It is as easy for the imagination to form monsters and to joinincongruous shapes and appearances as it is to conceive themost natural and familiar objects. And while•the body mustcreep laboriously over the surface of one planet,•thoughtcan instantly transport us to the most distant regions of theuniverse—and even further. What never was seen or heardof may still beconceived; nothing is beyond the power ofthought except what implies an absolute contradiction.But although our thought seems to be so free, when welook more carefully we’ll find that it is really confined withinvery narrow limits, and that all this creative power of themind amounts merely to the ability to combine, transpose,enlarge, or shrink the materials that the senses and experi-ence provide us with. When we think of a golden mountain,we only join two consistent ideas—goldandmountain—withwhich we were already familiar. We can conceive a virtuoushorse because our own feelings enable us to conceive virtue,and we can join this with the shape of a horse, which is ananimal we know. In short, all the materials of thinking arederived either from our outward senses or from our inwardfeelings: all that the mind and will do is to mix and combinethese materials. Put in philosophical terminology:all ourideas or more feeble perceptions are copies of our impressionsor more lively ones.Here are two arguments that I hope will suffice to provethis.(1)When we analyse our thoughts or ideas—howevercomplex or elevated they are—we always find them to bemade up of simple ideas that were copied from earlier feelingsor sensations. Even ideas that at first glance seem to bethe furthest removed from that origin are found on closerexamination to be derived from it. The idea of God—meaningan infinitely intelligent, wise, and good Being—comes fromextending beyond all limits the qualities of goodness andwisdom that we find in our own minds. However far we pushthis enquiry, we shall find that every idea that we examine iscopied from a similar impression. Those who maintain thatthis isn’t universally true and that there are exceptions to ithave only one way of refuting it—but it should be easy forthem, if they are right. They need merely to produce an ideathat they thinkisn’tderived from this source. It will thenbe up to me, if I am to maintain my doctrine, to point to theimpression or lively perception that corresponds to the ideathey have produced.(2)If a man can’t have some kind of sensation becausethere is something wrong with his eyes, ears etc., he willnever be found to have corresponding ideas. A blind mancan’t form a notion of colours, or a deaf man a notion ofsounds. If either is cured of his deafness or blindness, sothat the sensations can get through to him, the ideas canthen get through as well; and then he will find it easy toconceive these objects. The same is true for someone whohas never experienced an object that will give a certain kindof sensation: a Laplander or Negro has no notion of the8"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume2: The origin of ideastaste of wine·because he has never had the sensation oftasting wine·. Similarly with inward feelings. It seldom if everhappens that a person hasneverfelt or iswhollyincapableof some human feeling or emotion, but the phenomenon I amdescribing does occur with feelings as well, though in lesserdegree. A gentle person can’t form any idea of determinedrevenge or cruelty; nor can a selfish one easily conceive theheights of friendship and generosity. Everyone agrees thatnon-human beings may have many senses of which we canhave no conception, because the ideas of them have neverbeen introduced to us in the only way in which an ideacan get into the mind, namely through actual feeling andsensation.(There is, however, one counter-example that may provethat it isn’t absolutely impossible for an idea to occur withouta corresponding impression. I think it will be granted that thevarious distinct ideas of colour that enter the mind throughthe eye (or those of sound, which come in through the ear)really are different from each other, though they resembleone another in certain respects. If that holds for differentcolours, it must hold equally for the different shades of asingle colour; so each shade produces a distinct idea, inde-pendent of the rest. (We can create a continuous gradationof shades, running from red at one end to green at the other,with each member of the series shading imperceptibly intoits neighbour. If the immediate neighbours in the sequenceare not different from one another, then red is not differentfrom green, which is absurd.) Now, suppose that a sightedperson has become perfectly familiar with colours of all kinds,except for one particular shade of blue (for instance), whichhe happens never to have met with. Let all the other shadesof blue be placed before him, descending gradually from thedeepest to the lightest: it is obvious that he will notice ablank in the place where the missing shade should go. Thatis, he will be aware that there is a greater quality-distancebetween that pair of neighbouring shades than between anyother neighbour-pair in the series. Can he fill the blank fromhis own imagination, calling up in his mind the idea of thatparticular shade, even though it has never been conveyed tohim by his senses? Most people, I think, will agree that hecan. This seems to show that simple ideas are not always,in every instance, derived from corresponding impressions.Still, the example is so singular[Hume’s word]that it’s hardlyworth noticing, and on its own it isn’t a good enough reasonfor us to alter our general maxim.)So here is a proposition that not only seems to be simpleand intelligible in itself, but could if properly used make everydispute equally intelligible by banishing all that nonsensicaljargon that has so long dominated metaphysical reasonings.·Those reasonings are beset by three troubles·.(1)All ideas,especially abstract ones, are naturally faint and obscure,so that the mind has only a weak hold on them.(2)Ideasare apt to be mixed up with other ideas that resemble them.(3)We tend to assume that a given word is associated witha determinate idea just because we have used it so often,even if in using it we haven’t had any distinct meaning forit. In contrast with this,(1)all our impressions—i.e. all ouroutward or inward sensations—are strong and vivid.(2)Theboundaries between them are more exactly placed, and(3)itis harder to make mistakes about them. So when we cometo suspect that a philosophical term is being used withoutany meaning or idea (as happens all too often), we need onlyto ask: From what impression is that supposed idea derived?If none can be pointed out, that will confirm our suspicion·that the term is meaningless, i.e. has no associated idea·.By bringing ideas into this clear light we may reasonablyhope to settle any disputes that arise about whether theyexist and what they are like.9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume3: Association of ideasSTAR T OF A BIG FOOTNOTEPhilosophers who have denied that there are any innateideas probably meant only that all ideas were copies ofour impressions; though I have to admit that the terms inwhich they expressed this were not chosen with enough care,or defined with enough precision, to prevent all mistakesabout their doctrine. For what is meant by ‘innate’? If‘innate’ is equivalent to natural’, then all the perceptionsand ideas of the mind must be granted to be innate ornatural, in whatever sense we take the latter word, whetherin opposition to what is uncommon, what is artificial, orwhat is miraculous. If innate means ‘contemporary with ourbirth’, the dispute seems to be frivolous—there is no pointin enquiringwhenthinking begins, whether before, at, orafter our birth. Again, the word ‘idea’ seems commonly tobe taken in a very loose sense by Locke and others, whouse it to stand for any of our perceptions, sensationsandpassions,as well as thoughts. I would like to know what itcan mean to assert that self-love, or resentment of injuries,or the passion between the sexes, is not innate!But admitting the words ‘impressions’ and ‘ideas’ in thesense explained above, and understanding by ‘innate’ whatisoriginalornot copied from any previous perception, thenwe can assert that all our impressions are innate and noneof our ideas ‘impressions’ and ‘ideas’ in the sense explainedabove, and understanding by ‘innate’ what isoriginalornotcopied from any previous perception, then we can assert thatall our impressions are innate and none of our ideas areinnate.Frankly, I think that Locke was tricked into this questionby the schoolmen[= mediaeval Aristotelians], who have usedundefined terms to drag out their disputes to a tediouslength without ever touching the point at issue. A similarambiguity and circumlocution seem to run through all thatgreat philosopher”s reasonings on this as well as on mostother subjects.END OF THE BIG FOOTNOTESection 3: The association of ideasThe mind’s thoughts or ideas are obviously inter-connectedin some systematic way: there is some order and regularityin how, in memory and imagination, one idea leads on toanother. This is so clearly true of our more serious thinkingor talking what when a particular thought breaks in onthe regular sequence of ideas it is immediately noticed andrejected·as irrelevant·. Even in our wildest daydreams andnight dreams we shall find, if we think about it, that theimagination doesn’t entirely run wild, and that even in imag-ination the different ideas follow one another in a somewhatregular fashion. If the loosest and freest conversation werewritten down, you would be able to see something holdingit together through all its twists and turns. Or, if not, theperson who broke the thread might tell you that he had beengradually led away from the subject of conversation by someorderly train of thought that had been quietly going on in10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume4: Doubts about the understandinghis mind. We also find that the compound ideas that arethe meanings of words in one language are usually also themeanings of words in others, even when there can be noquestion of the languages’ having influenced one another.This is conclusive evidence that the simple ideas of which thecompound ones are made up were linked by some universalfactor that had an equal influence on all mankind.The fact that different ideas are connected is too obviousto be overlooked; yet I haven’t found any philosopher tryingto list or classify all the sources of association. This seems tobe worth doing. To me there appear to be only three factorsconnecting ideas with one another, namely,•resemblance,•contiguity[= ‘nextness’]in time or place, and•cause or effect.I don’t think there will be much doubt that our ideas areconnected by these factors.•A picture naturally leads ourthoughts to the thing that is depicted in it;•the mentionof one room naturally introduces remarks or questionsabout other rooms in the same building; and•if we thinkof a wound, we can hardly help thinking about the painthat follows it. But it will be hard to prove to anyone’ssatisfaction—the reader’s or my own—that this these threeare theonlysources of association among our ideas. Allwe can do is to consider a large number of instances whereideas are connected, find in each case what connects them,and eventually develop a really general account of thisphenomenon.1The more cases we look at, and the morecare we employ on them, the more assured we can be thatour final list of principles of association is complete.Section 4: Sceptical doubts about the operations of the understandingAll the objects of human reason or enquiry fall naturally intotwo kinds, namelyrelations of ideasandmatters of fact. Thefirst kind include geometry, algebra, and arithmetic, andindeed every statement that is either intuitively or demon-stratively certain.That the square of the hypotenuse is equalto the squares of the other two sidesexpresses a relation be-tween those figures.That three times five equals half of thirtyexpresses a relation between those numbers. Propositions ofthis kind can be discovered purely by thinking, with no needto attend to anything that actually exists anywhere in theuniverse. The truths that Euclid demonstrated would stillbe certain and self-evident even if there never were a circleor triangle in nature.Matters of fact, which are the second objects of humanreason, are not established in the same way; and we cannothave such strong grounds for thinking them true. Thecontrary of every matter of fact is stillpossible, because itdoesn’t imply a contradiction and is conceived by the mind aseasily and clearly as if it conformed perfectly to reality.Thatthe sun will not rise tomorrowis just as intelligible as—and1For instance, Contrast or Contrariety is also a connection among Ideas. But we might considered it as a mixture of Causation and Resemblance. Wheretwo objects are contrary, one destroys the other; that is, causes its annihilation, and the idea of an object’s annihilation implies the idea of its formerexistence.11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume4: Doubts about the understandingno more contradictory than—the propositionthat the sunwill rise tomorrow. It would therefore be a waste of time totry todemonstrate[= ‘prove absolutely rigorously’]its falsehood. Ifit were demonstratively false, it would imply a contradictionand so could never be clearly conceived by the mind.So it may be worth our time and trouble to try to answerthis: What sorts of grounds do we have for being sure ofmatters of fact—propositions about what exists and whatis the case—that aren’t attested by our present senses orthe records of our memory? It’s a notable fact that neitherancient philosophers nor modern ones have attended muchto this important question; so in investigating it I shallbe marching through difficult terrain with no guides orsignposts; and that may help to excuse any errors I commitor doubts that I raise. Those errors and doubts may evenbe useful: they may make people curious and eager tolearn, and may destroy that ungrounded and unexaminedconfidence·that people have in their opinions—a confidence·that is the curse of all reasoning and free enquiry. If we findthings wrong with commonly accepted philosophical views,that needn’t discourage us, but rather can spur us on to tryfor something fuller and more satisfactory than has yet beenpublished.All reasonings about matters of fact seem to be based onthe relation ofcause and effect, which is the only relationthat can take us beyond the evidence of our memory andsenses. If you ask someone why he believes some matter offact which isn’t now present to him—for instance that hisfriend is now in France—he will give you a reason; and thisreason will be some other fact, such as that he has receiveda letter from his friend or that his friend had planned to goto France. Someone who finds a watch or other machine ona desert island will conclude that there have been men onthat island. All our reasonings concerning fact are like this.When we reason in this way, we suppose that the presentfact isconnectedwith the one that we infer from it. If therewere nothing to bind the two facts together, the inferenceof one from the other would be utterly shaky. Hearing thesounds of someone talking rationally in the dark assures usof the presence of some person. Why? Because such soundsare the effects of the human constitution, and are closelyconnected with it. All our other reasonings of this sort, whenexamined in detail, turn out to be based on the relation ofcause and effect. The causal chain from the evidence tothe ‘matter of fact’ conclusion may be short or long. And itmay be that the causal connection between them isn’t directbut collateral—as when one sees light and infers heat, notbecause either causes the other but because the two arecollateral effects of a single cause, namely fire.So if we want to understand the basis of our confidenceabout matters of fact, we must find out how we come to knowabout cause and effect.I venture to assert, as true without exception, thatknowledge about causes is never acquired througha priorireasoning, and always comes from our experience of findingthat particular objects are constantly associated with oneother.[When Hume is discussing cause and effect, his word ‘object’often coverseventsas well asthings.]Present an object to a manwhose skill and intelligence are as great as you like; if theobject is of a kind that is entirely new to him, no amountof studying of its perceptible qualities will enable him todiscover any of its causes or effects. Adam, even if hisreasoning abilities were perfect from the start, couldn’t haveinferred from the fluidity and transparency of water that itcould drown him, or from the light and warmth of fire that itcould burn him. The qualities of an object that appear to thesenses never reveal the causes that produced the object orthe effects that it will have; nor can our reason, unaided by12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume4: Doubts about the understandingexperience, ever draw any conclusion about real existenceand matters of fact.The proposition thatcauses and effects are discoverablenot by reason but by experiencewill be freely granted(1)with regard to objects that we remember having once beenaltogether unknown to us; for in those cases we rememberthe time when we were quite unable to tell what wouldarise from those objects. Present two smooth pieces ofmarble to a man who has no knowledge of physics—hewill not be able to work out that they will stick togetherin such a way that it takes great force to separate them bypulling them directly away from one another, while it willbe easy to slide them apart.(2)Events that aren’t muchlike the common course of nature are also readily agreed tobe known only by experience; and nobody thinks that theexplosion of gunpowder, or the attraction of a magnet, couldever be discovered by argumentsa priori—·i.e. by simplythinkingabout gunpowder and magnets, without bringingin anything known from experience·.(3)Similarly, whenan effect is thought to depend on an intricate machineryor secret structure of parts, we don’t hesitate to attributeall our knowledge of it to experience. No-one would assertthat he can give the ultimate reason why milk or bread isnourishing for a man but not for a lion or a tiger.But this same proposition—·that causes and effects can-not be discovered by reason·—may seem less obvious whenit is applied to events of kinds(1)that we have been familiarwith all our lives,(2)that are very like the whole course ofnature, and(3)that are supposed to depend on the simple·perceptible·qualities of objects and not on any secret struc-ture of parts. We are apt to imagine that we could discovertheseeffects purely through reason, without experience. Wefancy that if we had been suddenly brought into this world,we could have known straight off that when one billiard ballstrikes another it will make it move—knowing this for certain,without having to try it out on billiard balls. Custom hassuch a great influence! At its strongest it not only hidesour natural ignorance but even concealsitself: just becausecustom is so strongly at work, we aren’t aware of its being atwork at all.If you’re not yet convinced that absolutely all the lawsof nature and operations of bodies can be known only byexperience, consider the following. If we are asked to saywhat the effects will be of some object, without consultingpast experience of it, how can the mind go about doingthis? It must invent or imagine some event as being theobject’s effect; and clearly this invention must be entirelyarbitrary. The mind can’t possibly find the effectinthesupposed cause, however carefully we examine it, for theeffect is totally different from the cause and therefore cannever be discoveredinit. Motion in the second billiard ball isa distinct event from motion in the first, and nothing in thefirst ball’s motion even hints at motion in the second. A stoneraised into the air and left without any support immediatelyfalls; but if we consider this situationa prioriwe shall findnothing that generates the idea of a downward rather thanan upward or some other motion in the stone.Just as the first imagining or inventing of a particulareffect is arbitrary if it isn’t based on experience, the sameholds for the supposed tie or connection between causeand effect—the tie that binds them together and makes itimpossible for that cause to have any effect but that one.Suppose for example that I see one billiard ball moving in astraight line towards another: even if the contact betweenthem shouldhappento suggest to me the idea of motionin the second ball, aren’t there a hundred different eventsthat I can conceive might follow from that cause? May notboth balls remain still? May not the first bounce straight13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume4: Doubts about the understandingback the way it came, or bounce off in some other direction?All these suppositions are consistent and conceivable. Whythen should we prefer just one, which is no more consistentor conceivable than the rest? Oura priorireasonings willnever reveal any basis for this preference.In short, every effect is a distinct event from its cause. Soit can’t be discoveredinthe cause, and the first inventionor conception of ita priorimust be wholly arbitrary. Also,even after it has been suggested, the linking of it with thecause must still appear as arbitrary, because plenty of otherpossible effects must seem just as consistent and naturalfrom reason’s point of view. So there isn’t the slightest hopeof reaching any conclusions about causes and effects withoutthe help of experience.That’s why no reasonable scientist has ever claimed toknow the ultimate cause of any natural process, or to showclearly and in detail what goes into the causing of any singleeffect in the universe. It is agreed that the most humanreason can achieve is to make the principles that governnatural phenomena simpler, bringing many particular effectstogether under a few general causes by reasoning fromanalogy, experience and observation. But if we try to discoverthe causes of these general causes, we shall be wasting ourlabour. These ultimate sources and principles are totallyhidden from human enquiry. Probably the deepest causesand principles that we shall ever discover in nature are thesefour:•elasticity,•gravity,•cohesion of parts·which makesthe difference between a pebble and a pile of dust·, and•communication of motion by impact·as when one billiardball hits another·. We shall be lucky if by careful workwe can explain particular phenomena in terms of thesefour, or something close to them. The perfect philosophyof the natural kind[= ‘the perfect physics’]only staves off ourignorance a little longer; just as, perhaps, the most perfectphilosophy of the moral or metaphysical kind[= ‘the mostperfectphilosophy’, in the 21st century sense of the word]serves onlyto show us more of how ignorant we are. So both kinds ofphilosophy eventually lead us to a view of human blindnessand weakness—a view that confronts us at every turn despiteour attempts to get away from it.Although geometry is rightly famous for the accuracyof its reasoning, when it is brought to the aid of physicsit can’t lead us to knowledge of ultimate causes, therebycuring the ignorance I have been discussing. Every part ofapplied mathematics works on the assumption that natureoperates according to certain established laws; and abstractreasonings are used either to help experience to discoverthese laws or to work out how the laws apply in particularcases where exactness of measurement is relevant. Here isan example. It is a law of motion, discovered by experience,thatthe force of any moving body is proportional to its massand to its velocity; so we can get a small force to overcomethe greatest obstacle if we can devise a machine that willincrease the velocity of the force so that it overwhelms itsantagonist. Geometry helps us to apply this law by showingus how to work out the sizes and shapes of all the partsof the machine that we make for this purpose; but the lawitself is something we know purely from experience, and noamount of abstract reasoning could lead us one step towardsthe knowledge of it. When we reasona priori, consideringsome object or cause merely as it appears to the mind andindependently of any observation of its behaviour, it couldnever prompt us to think of anyotheritem, such as its effect.Much less could it show us the unbreakable connectionbetween them. It would take a verycleverperson to discoverby reasoning that heat makes crystals and cold makes icewithout having had experience of the effects of heat and cold!14"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume4: Doubts about the understandingPart 2But we haven’t yet found an acceptable answer to thequestion that I initially asked. Each solution raises newquestions that are as hard to answer as the first one was,and that lead us on to further enquiries. To the questionWhat is the nature of all our reasonings concerning matter offact?the proper answer seems to be that they are based onthe relation of cause and effect. When it is further asked,What is the foundation of all our reasonings about cause andeffect?we can answer in one word,experience. But if wepersist with questions, and ask,What are inferences fromexperience based on?this raises a new question that maybe harder still. Philosophers—for all their air of superiorwisdom—are given a hard time by people who persist withquestions, pushing them from every corner into which theyretreat, finally bringing them to some dangerous dilemma[= ‘a choice between two alternatives that both seem wrong’]. The bestway for us to avoid such an embarrassment is not to claimtoo much in the first place, and even to find the difficulty forourselves before it is brought against us as an objection. Inthis way we can make a kind of merit even of our ignorance!In this section I shall settle for something easy, offeringonly a•negative answer to the question I have raised·aboutwhat inferences from experience are based on·. It is this:even after we have experience of the operations of cause andeffect,the conclusions we draw from that experience are•notbased on reasoning or on any process of the understanding.I shall try to explain and defend this answer.It must be granted that nature has kept us at a distancefrom all its secrets, and has allowed us to know only a fewsuperficial qualities of objects, concealing from us the powersand energies on which the influence of the objects entirelydepends. Our senses tell us about the colour, weight andconsistency of bread; but neither the senses nor reason canever tell us about the qualities that enable bread to nourish ahuman body. Sight or touch gives us an idea of themotionofbodies; but as for the amazingforcethat keeps a body movingfor ever unless it collides with other bodies—we cannot havethe remotest conception of that. Despite this ignorance ofnatural powers2and forces, however, we always assumethat the same sensible qualities[= ‘qualities that can be seen orfelt or heard etc.’]will have the same secret powers, and weexpect them to have the same effects that we have foundthem to have in our past experience. If we are given somestuff with the colour and consistency of bread that we haveeaten in the past, we don’t hesitate to repeat the experiment·of eating it·, confidently expecting it to nourish and supportus.·That’s what we do every morning at the breakfast table:confidentlyexperimentingwith bread-like stuff by eating it!·I would like to know what the basis is for this process ofthought. Everyone agrees that a thing’s sensible qualitiesaren’t connected with its secret powers in any way that weknow about, so that the mind isn’t led to a conclusion abouttheir constant and regular conjunction through anythingit knows of their nature. All that past experience can tellus, directly and for sure, concerns the behaviour of theparticular objects we observed, at the particular time whenwe observed them.·My experience directly and certainlyinforms me thatthatfire consumed coalthen; but it’s silentabout the behaviour of the same fire a few minutes later, andabout other fires at any time·. Why should this experience beextended to future times and to other objects, which for allwe know may onlyseemsimilar?—that’s what I want to know.The bread that I formerly ate nourished me; i.e. a body with2The word ‘power’ is here used in a loose and popular sense. Using it more accurately would add strength to this argument. See Section 7.15"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume4: Doubts about the understandingsuch and such sensible qualities did at that time have suchand such secret powers. But does it follow that other breadmust also nourish me at other times, and that the sameperceptible qualities must always be accompanied by thesame secret powers? It doesn’t seem to follow necessarily.Anyway, it must be admitted that in such a case as thisthe mind draws a conclusion; it takes a certain step, goesthrough a process of thought or inference, which needs tobe explained. These two propositions are far from being thesame:•I have found that such and such an object has alwayshad such and such an effect.•I foresee that other objects which appear similar willhave similar effects.The second proposition is always inferred from the first; andif you like I’ll grant that it is rightly inferred. But if you insistthat the inference is made by a chain of reasoning, I challengeyou to produce the reasoning. The connection between thesepropositions is not intuitive[i.e. the second doesn’t self-evidentlyandimmediatelyfollow from the first]. If the inference is to beconducted through reason alone, it must be with help fromsome intermediate step. But when I try to think what thatintermediate step might be, I am defeated. Those who assertthat it really exists and is the origin of all our conclusionsabout matters of fact owe us an account of what it is.·They haven’t given any account of this, which I take tobe evidence that none can be given·. If many penetrating andable philosophers try and fail to discover a connecting propo-sition or intermediate step through which the understandingcan perform this inference from past effects to future ones,my negative line of thought about this will eventually befound entirely convincing. But as the question is still new,the reader may not trust his own abilities enough to concludethat because he can’t find a certain argument it doesn’t exist.In that case I need to tackle a harder task than I have sofar undertaken—namely, going through all the branches ofhuman knowledge one by one, trying to show that none cangive us such an argument.All reasonings fall into two kinds:(1)demonstrative rea-soning, or that concerning relations of ideas, and(2)factualreasoning, or that concerning matters of fact and existence.That no demonstrative arguments are involved in(2)seemsevident; since there is no outright contradiction in supposingthat the course of nature will change so that an object thatseems like ones we have experienced will have different orcontrary effects from theirs. Can’t I clearly and distinctlyconceive that snowy stuff falling from the clouds might tastesalty or feel hot? Is there anything unintelligible aboutsupposing that all the trees will flourish in December andlose their leaves in June? Now, if something is intelligible andcan be distinctly conceived, it implies no contradiction andcan never be proved false by any demonstrative argument orabstracta priorireasoning.So if there are arguments to justify us in trusting past ex-perience and making it the standard of our future judgment,these arguments can only beprobable; i.e. they must be ofthe kind(2)that concern matters of fact and real existence,to put it in terms of the classification I have given. Butprobable reasoning, if I have described it accurately, can’tprovide us with the argument we are looking for. Accordingto my account, all arguments about existence are basedon the relation of cause and effect; our knowledge of thatrelation is derived entirely from experience; and in drawingconclusions from experience we assume that the future willbe like the past. So if we try to provethisassumption byprobable arguments, i.e. arguments regarding existence, weshall obviously be going in a circle, taking for granted thevery point that is in question.16"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume4: Doubts about the understandingIn reality, all arguments from experience are based on thesimilarities that we find among natural objects—which leadus to expect that the effects of the objects will also be similar.Although only a fool or a madman would ever challengethe authority of experience or reject it as a guide to humanlife, still perhaps a philosopher may be allowed to ask whatit is about human nature that gives this mighty authorityto experience and leads us to profit from the similaritiesthat nature has established among different objects. Ourinferences from experience all boil down to this:From causesthat appear similar we expect similar effects. If this werebased on reason, we could draw the conclusion as well after•a single instance as after•a long course of experience. Butthat isn’t in fact how things stand. Nothing so similar aseggs; yet no-one expects them all to taste the same! Whenwe become sure of what will result from a particular event,it is only because we have experienced many events of thatkind, all with the same effects. Now, where is that processof reasoning that infers from one instance a conclusion thatwas not inferred from a hundred previous instances just likethis single one? I ask this•for the sake of information asmuch as•with the intention of raising difficulties. I can’tfind—I can’timagine—any such reasoning. But I am willingto learn, if anyone can teach me.It may be said that from a number of uniform experiencesweinfer a connectionbetween the sensible qualities and thesecret powers; but this seems to raise the same difficultyin different words. We still have to ask what process ofargumentthisinference is based on. Where is the interme-diate step, the interposing ideas, which join propositionsthat are so different from one another? It is agreed that thecolour, consistency and other sensible qualities of breaddon’t appear to be inherently connected with the secretpowers of nourishment and life-support. If they were, wecould infer these secret powers from a first encounter withthose qualities, without the aid of long previous experience;and this contradicts what all philosophers believe and con-tradicts plain matters of fact. Start by thinking of us inour natural state of ignorance, in which we know nothingabout the powers and influence of anything. How doesexperience cure this ignorance? All it does is to show usthat certain·similar·objects had similar effects; it teachesus that those particular objects had such and such powersand forces at those particular times. When a new object withsimilar perceptible qualities is produced, we expect similarpowers and forces and look for a similar effect. We expect forinstance that stuff with the colour and consistency of breadwill nourish us. But this surely is a movement of the mindthat needs to be explained. When a man says‘I have found in all•past instances such and suchsensible qualities conjoined with such and such secretpowers’,and then goes on to say‘Similar sensible qualities•will always be combinedwith similar secret powers’,he isn’t guilty of merely repeating himself; these propositionsare in no way the same. ‘The second proposition is inferredfrom the first’, you may say; but you must admit that theinference isn’t intuitive[= ‘can’t be seen at a glance to be valid’],and it isn’t demonstrative either[= ‘can’t be carried through by aseries of steps each of which can be seen at a glance to be valid’]. Whatkind of inference is it, then? To call it ‘experiential’ is toassume the point that is in question. For all inferences fromexperience are based on the assumption that the future willresemble the past, and that similar powers will be combinedwith similar sensible qualities. As soon as the suspicion isplanted that the course of nature may change, so that thepast stops being a guide to the future, all experience becomes17"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume5: Sceptical solutionuseless and can’t support any inference or conclusion. Sono arguments from experience cansupportthis resemblanceof the past to the future, because all such arguments arebased onthe assumption of that resemblance. Howeverregular the course of things has been, that fact on its owndoesn’t prove that the future will also be regular. It’s no useyour claiming to have learned the nature of bodies from yourpast experience. Their secret nature, and consequently alltheir effects and influence, may change without any changein their sensible qualities. This happens•sometimes withregard to•some objects: Why couldn’t it happen•alwayswith regard to•all? What logic, what process of argument,secures you against this? You may say that I don’tbehaveas though I had doubts about this; but that would reflecta misunderstanding of why I am raising these questions.When I’m considering how to act, I am quite satisfied thatthe future will be like the past; but as a philosopher withanenquiring—I won’t saysceptical—turn of mind, I want toknow what this confidence is based on. Nothing I have read,no research I have done, has yet been able to remove mydifficulty. Can I do better than to put the difficulty beforethe public, even though I may not have much hope of beinggiven a solution? In this way we shall at least be aware ofour ignorance, even if we don’t increase our knowledge.It would be inexcusably arrogant to conclude that becauseI haven’t discovered a certain argument it doesn’t really exist.Even if learned men down the centuries have searched forsomething without finding it, perhaps it would still be rashto conclude with confidence that the subject must surpasshuman understanding. Even though we examine all thesources of our knowledge and conclude that they are unfitfor a given subject, we may still suspect that the list ofsources is not complete or our examination of them notaccurate. With regard to our present subject, however, thereare reasons to think that my conclusion is certainly rightand that I am not arrogant in thinking so.It is certain that the most ignorant and stupid peasants,even infants, indeed even brute beasts, improve by experi-ence and learn the qualities of natural objects by observingtheir effects. When a child has felt pain from touching theflame of a candle, he will be careful not to put his hand nearany candle, and will expect a similar effect from any causethat is similar in its appearance. If you assert that the child’sunderstanding comes to this conclusion through a process ofargument, it is fair for me to demand that you produce thatargument, and you have no excuse for refusing to do so. Youcan’t say that the argument has eluded you because it is sodifficult and complex, because you have just said that a mereinfant finds it easy! So if you hesitate for a moment, or if afterreflection you produce any intricate or profound argument,you have in effect given up your side in this dispute: youhave as good as admitted thatit isn’t through reasoning thatwe are led to suppose the future to resemble the past and toexpect similar effects from apparently similar causes. This isthe proposition that I intended to establish in the presentsection. If I’m right about it, I don’t claim it as any greatdiscovery. If I am wrong, then thereisan argument·frompast to future·which was perfectly familiar to me long beforeI was out of my cradle, yet now I can’t discover it. What abackward scholar I must be!18"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume5: Sceptical solutionSection 5: Sceptical solution of these doubtsThe passion for philosophy, like that for religion, involves acertain danger. Although it aims to correct our behaviourand wipe out our vices, it may—through not being handledproperly—end up merely encouraging us to carry on indirections that we’re already naturally inclined to follow. Wemay set out to achieve philosophical wisdom and firmness,and to become satisfied with the pleasures of the mind·as distinct from those of the body·, yet reason ourselvesout of all virtue as well as all social enjoyment, ending upwith a philosophy which (like that of Epictetus and otherStoics) is only a more refined system of selfishness. While wemeditate on the vanity of human life, and focus our thoughtson the empty and transitory nature of riches and honours,perhaps we are really just finding excuses for our idleness,trying to get reason’s support for our lazy unwillingnessto be busy in the world. However, one kind of philosophyseems to run little risk of this drawback, because it doesn’tjoin forces with any disorderly passion of the human mind,and can’t get mixed up with any of our natural tendenciesor inclinations; and that is the sceptical philosophy. Thesceptics always talk of doubt and suspending judgment, ofthe danger of deciding too quickly, of keeping intellectualenquiries within narrow limits, and of giving up all theorizingthat isn’t in touch with common life and practice. So theirphilosophy is as opposed as it could be to the mind’s idleness,its rash arrogance, its grandiose claims, and its superstitiouscredulity. This philosophy has a humbling effect on everypassion except the love of truth; andthatcould never becarried too far. Given that this philosophy is almost alwaysharmless and innocent, it’s surprising that it should sooften be criticized and stigmatized as libertine, profane,and irreligious. Perhaps the very feature that makes it soinnocent also brings hatred and resentment against it. Itdoesn’t encourage any bad feelings or habits, so it has fewsupporters; but it does oppose many vices and follies, whichis why it has so many enemies!When it tries to limit our enquiries to common life, thisphilosophy runs no risk of going too far and undermining thereasonings that we useincommon life, pushing its doubtsso far as to destroy all action and belief. Nature will alwaysmaintain its rights, and prevail in the end over any abstractreasoning whatsoever.·That is, we shall continue to thinkand act in the ways that our human nature dictates—theways that arenaturalto us—with no risk of our beingdeflected from these by philosophical considerations·. Forexample, I showed in the preceding section that whenever wereason from experience we take a step that isn’t supportedby any argument or intellectual considerations; but theseexperiential reasonings are the basis for almost all theknowledge we have, and there’s no chance of their beingdislodged by the discovery that they can’t be justified byarguments. If we aren’t led by argument to make inferencesfrom past experience, we must be led by something else thatis just as powerful—some other force that will have powerin our lives as long as human nature remains the same. Itwould be worthwhile to explore what that other force is.Suppose that a highly intelligent and thoughtful personwere suddenly brought into this world; he would immediatelyobserve one event following another, but that is all he coulddiscover. He wouldn’t be able by any reasoning to reachthe idea of cause and effect, because (firstly) the particularpowers by which all natural operations are performed are19"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume5: Sceptical solutionnever perceived through the senses, and (secondly) there isnoreasonto conclude that one event causes another merelybecause it precedes it. Their occurring together may bearbitrary and casual, with no causal connection betweenthem. In short, until such a person had more experiencehe could never reason about any matter of fact, or be sureof anything beyond what was immediately present to hismemory and senses.Now suppose that our person gains more experience, andlives long enough in the world to observe similar objects orevents occurring together constantly;nowwhat conclusiondoes he draw from this experience? He immediately infersthe existence of one object from the appearance of the other!Yet all his experience hasn’t given him any idea or knowledgeof the secret power by which one object produces another;nor can any process of reasoning have led him to draw thisinference. But he finds that hecan’t helpdrawing it: and hewon’t be swayed from this even if he becomes convinced thatthere is no intellectual support for the inference. Somethingelse is at work, compelling him to go through with it.It iscustomorhabit. When we are inclined to behaveor think in some way, not because it can be justified byreasoning or some process of the understanding but justbecause we have behaved or thought like that so often inthe past, we always say that this inclination is the effect of‘custom’. In using that word we don’t claim to give thebasic reason for the inclination. All we are doing is topoint out a fundamental feature of human nature whicheveryone agrees is there, and which is well known by itseffects. Perhaps that is as far as we can go. Perhaps, thatis, we can’t discover the cause of this cause, and mustrest content with it as the deepest we can go in explainingour conclusions from experience. Our ability to go that farshould satisfy us; if our faculties won’t take us any further,we oughtn’t tocomplainabout this. We do at least havehere a very intelligible proposition and perhaps a true one:After the constant conjunction of two objects—heat and flame,for instance, or weight and solidity—sheer habit makes usexpect the one when we experience the other.Indeed, thishypothesis seems to be the only one that could explain whywe draw from a thousand instances an inference which wecan’t draw from a single one that is exactly like each ofthe thousand.•Reason isn’t like that. The conclusions itdraws from considering one circle are the same as it wouldform after surveying all the circles in the universe. But noman, having seen only one body move after being pushed byanother, could infer that every other body will move after asimilar collision. All inferences from experience, therefore,are effects of custom and not of•reasoning.·STAR T OF A VAST FOOTNOTE·Writers often distinguish reason from experience, takingthese kinds of argumentation to be entirely different fromeach other. Reason’s arguments are thought to result purelyfrom our intellectual faculties, which establish principles ofscience and philosophy by consideringa priorithe natureof things, examining the effects that must follow from theiroperation. Arguments from experience are supposed to bederived entirely from sense and observation, through whichwe•learn what has actually resulted from the operationof particular objects and can•infer from this what theirresults will be in the future. For example, the limitations andrestraints of civil government and a legal constitution may bedefended either from reason which—reflecting on the greatfrailty and corruption of human nature—teaches that noman can safely be trusted with unlimited authority; or fromexperience and history, which inform us of the enormousabuses that have resulted in every age from an excess ofsuch authority.20"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume5: Sceptical solutionThe same distinction between reason and experience ismaintained in all our discussions about the conduct of life.While the experienced statesman, general, physician, ormerchant is trusted and followed, the unpracticed novice,however talented he may be, is neglected and despised.Reason can enable one to make plausible estimates of whatwill be likely to ensue from x-type conduct in y-type circum-stances, people say, but they regard reason as not goodenough unless it gets help from experience. Only experience(they hold) can give stability and certainty to the results thatare reached·by reason·from study and reflection.However, although this distinction is universally accepted,both in practical life and in intellectual inquiry, I do nothesitate to say that it is basically mistaken, or at leastsuperficial.If we examine (1) arguments like those I have mentioned,which are supposed to involve nothing but reasoning andreflection, they turn out to be relying on some generalprinciple based solely on observation and experience. Theonly difference between them and (2) the maxims that arecommonly thought to come from pure experience is that (1)can”t be established without some process of thought—somereflection on what we have observed, in order to sort outits details and trace its consequences—whereas in (2) theexperienced event is exactly like the one we predict on thenew occasion. The fear that if our monarchs were freedfrom the restraints of laws they would become tyrants mightbe arrived at (2) through our knowledge of the history ofTiberius or Nero; or (1) through our experience of fraud orcruelty in private life, which with a little thought we cantake as evidence of the general corruption of human natureand of the danger of putting too much trust in mankind. Ineachcase the ultimate basis for the fear that we arrive at isexperience.Any man, however young and inexperienced, will havebeen led by his experience to many general truths abouthuman affairs and the conduct of life; but he will be apt togo wrong in putting them into practice, until time and furtherexperience have broadened the scope of these truths andtaught him how to apply them. Talented though he may be,he will be likely to overlook some apparently minor aspectsof a situation which are in fact crucial to the conclusionshe ought to draw and to how he ought to act. He must ofcourse have hadsomeexperience. When we call someone an‘unexperienced reasoner’, we mean only that he hasn’t hadmuchexperience.·END OF THE VAST FOOTNOTE·Custom, then, is the great guide of human life. It aloneis what makes our experience useful to us, and makes usexpect future sequences of events to be like ones that haveappeared in the past. Without the influence of custom, wewould be entirely ignorant of every matter of fact beyondwhat is immediately present to the memory and senses. Wewould never know what means we should adopt in order toreach our ends; we couldn’t employ our natural powers toproduce any desired effect. There would be an end of allaction and of most theorizing.I should point out, however, that although our inferencesfrom experience carry us beyond our memory and senses,and assure us of matters of fact that happened in distantplaces and at remote times, any such inference must startwith a fact thatispresent to the senses or memory. A manwho found in a desert country the remains of magnificentbuildings would conclude that the country had long beforehad civilized inhabitants; but without the initial experiencehe could never infer this. We learn the events of bygoneages from history; but to do this we must read the booksthat give the information, and carry out inferences from one21"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume5: Sceptical solutionreport to another, until finally we arrive at the eye-witnessesand spectators of these distant events. In short, if we didn’tstart with some fact that is present to the memory or senses,our reasonings would be merely hypothetical; and howeverstrong the particular links might be, the whole chain ofinferences would have nothing to support it, and we couldn’tuse it to arrive at knowledge of any real existence. If I askwhy you believe any particular matter of fact that you tellme of, you must tell me some reason; and this reason willbe some other fact connected with it. But you can’t go onlike this for ever: eventually you must end up with some factthat is present to your memory or senses—or else admit thatyour belief has no foundation at all.What are we to conclude from all this? Something that isfar removed from the common theories of philosophy, yet isvery simple:All beliefs about matters of fact or real existence arederived merely fromsomething that is present to thememory or senses, anda customary association ofthat with some other thing.Or in other words: having found in many cases that twokinds of objects—flame and heat, snow and cold—have al-ways gone together, and being presented with a new instanceof flame or snow, the mind’s habits lead it to expect heat orcold and to believe that heat or cold exists now and will beexperienced if one comes closer. This belief is the inevitableresult of placing the mind in such circumstances. That ourminds should react in that way in those circumstances isas unavoidable as that we should feel love when we receivebenefits, or hatred when we are deliberately harmed. Theseoperations of the soul are a kind ofnatural instinct, whichno reasoning or process of the thought and understandingcan either produce or prevent.At this point we could reasonably allow ourselves to stopour philosophical researches. In most questions, we cannever make a single step further; and in all questions, wemust eventually stop, after our most restless and probingenquiries. But still our curiosity will be pardonable, perhapscommendable, if it carries us on to still further researches,and makes us examine more accurately the nature of thisbelief, and of the customary conjunction from which itis derived. This may bring us to some explanations andanalogies that will give satisfaction—at least to those wholove the abstract sciences and can enjoy speculations which,however accurate, may still retain a degree of doubt anduncertainty. As to readers whose tastes are different fromthat: Part 2 of this section is not addressed to them, andcan be neglected without harm to their understanding of therest.Part 2Nothing is more free than the imagination of man; andthough it is confined to the original stock of ideas providedby the internal and external senses, it has unlimited powerto mix, combine, separate and divide these ideas, in all thevarieties of fiction and vision[= ‘in every way that can be describedor depicted’.]It can invent a sequence of events, with all theappearance of reality, ascribe to them a particular time andplace, conceive them as really happening, and depict themto itself with as much detail as it could any historical eventwhich it believes with the greatest certainty to have reallyhappened. What, then, is the difference between such afiction and belief? It isnotthis:There is one special idea that is joined to every propo-sition that we assent to and not to any that we regardas fictional.22"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume5: Sceptical solutionThe reason why that is a wrong account is that the mindhas authority over all its ideas, so that if this ‘one specialidea’ existed the mind could voluntarily join it to any fiction,and consequently—according to this account—it would beable to believe anything it chose to believe; and we find bydaily experience that it cannot. We can in putting thoughtstogether join the head of a man to the body of a horse; but wecan’t choose tobelievethat such an animal has ever reallyexisted.It follows that the difference between fiction and belief liesin somesentiment or feelingthat goes with belief and not withfiction—a feeling that doesn’t depend on the will and can’tbe commanded at pleasure. It must be caused by nature,like all other sentiments; and must arise from the particularsituation that the mind is in at that particular moment.Whenever any object is presented to the memory or to thesenses, it immediately leads the imagination—by the force ofcustom—to conceive the object that is usually conjoined to it;and this conception comes with a feeling or sentiment that isdifferent from·anything accompanying·the loose daydreamsof the imagination. That is all there is to belief. For as thereis no matter of fact that we believe so firmly that we can’tconceive the contrary, there would be no difference betweenthe conception assented to and that which is rejected if thereweren’t some·feeling or·sentiment that distinguishes theone from the other. If I see a billiard-ball moving towardsanother on a smooth table, I can easily conceive it to stop oncontact. This conception implies no contradiction; but still itfeelsvery different from the conception by which I representto myself the collision followed by the passing on of motionfrom one ball to the other.If we tried to define this feeling, we might find that hardif not impossible to do, like the difficulty of defining thefeeling of cold or the passion of anger to someone who neverhad any experience of these sentiments. ‘Belief’ is the trueand proper name of this feeling; and everyone knows themeaning of that term because everyone·has beliefs all thetime, and therefore·is at every moment conscious of thefeeling represented by it. Still, it may be worthwhile to try todescribe this sentiment, in the hope of explaining it betterwith help from some analogies. In that spirit, I offer this:Belief is nothing but a more vivid, lively, forcible,firm, steady conception of an object than any thatthe unaided imagination can ever attain.This variety of terms—·five of them!·—may seem unphilo-sophical, but it is intended only to express that act ofthe mind which renders realities—or what we take to berealities—more present to us than·what we take to be·fictions, causing them to weigh more in the thought andgiving them a greater influence on the passions and onthe imagination. Provided we agree about thething, it isneedless to dispute about theterms. The imagination hasthe command over all its ideas, and can join and mix andvary them in every possible way. It can conceive fictitiousobjects with all the circumstances of place and time. It canset such fictions—in a way—before our eyes, in their truecolours, just as they might have existed. But this faculty ofimagination can never by itself produce a belief; and thatmakes it evident that belief doesn’t consists in any specialnature or order of ideas·because the imagination has nolimits with respect to those·, but rather in themanneroftheir conception and in theirfeelingto the mind. I admit thatit’s impossible to explain perfectly this feeling or manner ofconception. We can use words that express something nearit·as I have been doing·; but its true and proper name, as weobserved before, is ‘belief’—a term that everyone sufficientlyunderstands in common life. And in philosophy we can gono further than to assert thatbelief is something felt by the23"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume5: Sceptical solutionmind that distinguishes the ideas of the judgment from thefictions of the imagination. Itgives them more weight and influence,makes them appear of greater importance,strengthens them in the mind, andmakes them the governing principle of our actions.For example: right now I hear the voice of someone whomI know, the sound seeming to come from the next room.This impression of my·auditory·senses immediately carriesmy thought to the person in question and to all the objectssurrounding him. I depict them to myself as existing rightnow, with the same qualities and relations that I formerlyknew them to have. These ideas take a firmer hold on mymind than would ideas of·something I know to be fictitious,such as·an enchanted castle. They are very different to thefeeling, and have a much greater influence of every kind,either to give pleasure or pain, joy or sorrow.Let us, then, take in this doctrine in its full scope, andagree that•the sentiment of belief is nothing but a conceptionthat is more intense and steady than conceptions thatare mere fictions of the imagination, and•this mannerof conception arises from a customary conjunction ofthe object with something present to the memory orsenses.It will not be hard, I think, to find other operations of themind analogous to belief (on this account of it), and to bringthese phenomena under still more general principles.[Seenote on ‘principle’ on page 2.]I have already remarked that nature has establishedconnections among particular ideas, and that no soonerhas one idea occurred to our thoughts than it introducesits correlative—·i.e. the idea that nature has connectedwith it·—and carries our attention towards it by a gentleand imperceptible movement. These·natural·principlesof connection or association come down to three·basicones·, namely,•resemblance,•contiguity[= ‘nextness’], and•causation. These three are the only bonds that unite ourthoughts together, and generate that regularsequenceofthought or talk that takes place among all mankind to agreater or lesser degree. Now a question arises on whichthe solution of the present difficulty will depend. Does ithappen with each of these relations that, when an objectis presented to the senses or memory the mind is not onlycarried to theconceptionof the correlative, but comes to have·abeliefin it, that is·, a steadier and stronger conception ofit than it would it would otherwise have been able to attain?This seems to be what happens when beliefs arise from therelation ofcause and effect. If it also holds for the other tworelations or principles of association, this will be establishedas a general law that holds in all the operations of the mind.As the first relevant experiment, let us notice that whenwe see the picture of an absent friend, our idea of him isevidently enlivened by the picture’sresemblanceto him, andthat every feeling that our idea of him produces, whetherof joy or sorrow, acquires new force and vigour. This effectis produced by the joint operation of•a relation·of resem-blance·and•a present impression. If the picture doesn’tresemble him, or at least wasn’t intended to beofhim, itdoesn’t convey our thought to him at all. And when thepicture and the person are both absent from us, though themind may pass from the thought of the one to that of theother it feels its idea of the person to be weakened ratherthan strengthened by that transition. We take pleasure inviewing the picture of a friend, when it is set before us; butwhen it is not in our presence we would prefer consideringhim directly to considering him through a likeness of himthat is both distant and dim.24"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume5: Sceptical solutionThe ceremonies of the Roman Catholic religion can beconsidered as instances of this phenomenon. When thedevotees of that superstition are reproached for the ridicu-lous ceremonies it has them perform, they usually plead intheir defence that they feel the good effect of those externalmotions and postures and actions, in enlivening their de-votion and intensifying their fervour, which would decay ifit were directed entirely to distant and immaterial objects·such as God·. ‘We portray the objects of our faith’, theysay, ‘in perceptible pictures and images; and the immediatepresence of these pictures makes the objects more presentto us than they could be merely through an intellectualview and contemplation.’ Perceptible objects always havea greater influence on the imagination that anything elsedoes, and they readily convey this influence to the ideasto which they are related and which they resemble. Allthat I shall infer from these practices and this reasoningis that the effect of resemblance in enlivening ideas is verycommon; and because in every case a resemblance and apresent impression must both be at work, we are suppliedwith plenty of empirical examples that support the truth ofthe foregoing principle.We may add force to these examples by others of adifferent kind, bringing in the effects of contiguity as wellas of resemblance. It is certain that distance diminishesthe force of every idea, and that as we get nearer to someobject—even though our senses don’t show it to us—itsinfluence on the mind comes to be like the influence of animmediate·sensory·impression. Thinking about an objectreadily transports the mind to things that are contiguousto it; but it’s only the actual presence of an object thattransports the mind with a greater liveliness. When I ama few miles from home, whatever relates to it touches memore nearly than when I am two hundred leagues away,though even at that distance reflecting on anything in theneighbourhood of my friends or family naturally producesan idea of them. But in cases like this, both the objectsof the mind—·what it is carried from and what it is carriedto·—areideas·and not the livelier kind of perception thatwe call ‘impressions’·. Although there is an easy transitionbetween them, that transition alone can’t give either of thema liveliness greater than ideas have; and the reason for thatis that in these cases no immediate impression is at work.3No-one can doubt thatcausationhas the same influenceas the other two relations,resemblanceandcontiguity.Su-perstitious people are fond of the relics of saints and holymen for the same reason that they like to have pictures orimages—·namely·to enliven their devotion and give them amore intimate and strong conception of those exemplary livesthat they desire to imitate. Now it’s evident that one of thebest relics that a devotee could procure would be somethingmade bya saint; and if his clothes and furniture are everconsidered in this light, it is because they were once at hisdisposal and were moved and affected by him. This lets usconsider them as imperfect effects·of the saint; ‘imperfect’because he didn’t cause them to exist, but merely causedthem to go through various vicissitudes while they were in hispossession·. They are connected with him by a shorter chain3Cicero wrote: ‘Is it just a fact about our nature or is it because of some sort of error that we are more moved by seeing places where we have heard thatnotable people spent time than we are by hearing of their deeds or reading their writings? Indeed I am moved right now; for I remember Plato, who (weare told) was the first to hold discussions in this place. And these little gardens don’t just conjure up his memory; they seem to place the man himselfbefore me. [Then some remarks about the place’s association with other people, whom the speaker names.] Such is the power of suggestion that placeshave. It is not without reason that memory-training is based on this.’ Cicero,De Finibus, book 5, section 2.25"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume5: Sceptical solutionof consequences than any of the things—·human testimony,gravestones, written records, etc·.—by which we learn thereality of his existence.Suppose we encounter the son of a friend of ours whohas been long dead or absent; it’s evident that this object(·the son·) would instantly revive its correlative idea (·namely,the idea of our friend·), and recall to our thoughts all ourpast intimacies and familiarities with the friend, in morelively colours than they would otherwise have appeared tous. This is another phenomenon that seems to prove theabove-mentioned principle.Notice that in each of these phenomena the personbe-lievesthat the correlative object does or did exist. Withoutthat the relation could have no effect. The influence of thepicture requires that webelieveour friend to have onceexisted. Being close to home can never stir up our ideas ofhome unless webelievethat home really exists. Now I assertthat•thisbelief, where it reaches beyond the memory orsenses, is of a similar sort and arises from similar causes as•the transition of thought and liveliness of conception that Ihave just been explaining. When I throw a piece of dry woodinto a fire, my mind is immediately carried to a thought ofit as making the flame grow, not as extinguishing it. Thistransition of thought from the cause to the effect doesn’tcome from reason. Its sole origin is custom and experience.And as it first begins from an object that is present to thesenses·when I see the dry wood go into the fire·, it makesthe idea or conception of flame more strong and lively than·it would be in·any loose, floating reverie of the imagination.That idea·of the increased flame·arises immediately. Thethought moves instantly towards it, and conveys to it all theforce of conception that comes from the impression presentto the senses. It might happen by accident that when aglass of wine is presented to me my next ideas are thoseofwoundandpain; but they will not occur as strongly asthey would if I had been presented with a sword levelled atmy chest! But what is there in this whole matter to causesuch a strong conception apart froma present object and acustomary transition to the idea of another object, which wehave been accustomed to conjoin with the former? This is allthat our mind does in all our inferences concerning mattersof fact and existence; and it is satisfactory to have foundsome analogies through which it can be explained. In everycase, the transition from apresent objectgives strength andsolidity to the related idea·to which the transition is made·.Here, then, is a kind of pre-established harmony[Hume’sphrase, copied from Leibniz]between the course of nature andthe sequence of our ideas; and though the powers and forcesby which nature is governed are wholly unknown to us, wefind that our thoughts and conceptions have occurred inan order matching the order of events in the other worksof nature. This correspondence has been brought about bycustom, which is so necessary to the survival of our speciesand to the regulation of our conduct in every circumstanceand occurrence of human life. If it hadn’t been the case thatthe presence of an object instantly arouses the idea of objectsthat are commonly conjoined with it, all our knowledge wouldhave been limited to the narrow sphere of our memory andsenses; and we would never have been able to suit our meansto our ends, or to employ our natural powers in getting goodresults and avoiding bad ones. Those who delight in thediscovery and contemplation of final causes[= ‘purposivenessin nature’]have here a great deal to admire and wonder at.Here is a point that further confirms the theory I haveoffered. This operation of the mind in which we infer likeeffects from like causes, and vice versa, is so essential to oursurvival that it probablycouldn’thave been entrusted to thefallacious deductions of ourreason. For reason is slow in26"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"First EnquiryDavid Hume5: Sceptical solutionits operations; very little of it appears in early infancy; andat best—even in adults—it is extremely liable to error andmistake. It fits better with the ordinary wisdom of naturethat such a necessary an act of the mind should be securedby some instinct or automatic tendency, which can be•infallible in its operations,•present when life and thought first appear, and•independent of all the laborious deductions of theunderstanding.As nature has taught us the use of our limbs without givingus knowledge of the muscles and nerves by which they aremoved, so she has implanted in us an instinct that carriesour thought forward along a course corresponding to thecourse she has established among external objects—thoughwe are ignorant of those powers and forces on which thisregular course and succession of objects totally depends.27"}]
